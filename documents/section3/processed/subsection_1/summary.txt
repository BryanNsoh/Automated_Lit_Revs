Zwart   Scientific Data  11, Article number: 77 (2024) Cite this article 2339 Accesses 50 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Lake trophic state is a key ecosystem property that integrates a lake’s physical, chemical, and biological processes. Despite the importance of trophic state as a gauge of lake water quality, standardized and machine-readable observations are uncommon. Remote sensing presents an opportunity to detect and analyze lake trophic state with reproducible, robust methods across time and space. We used Landsat surface reflectance data to create the first compendium of annual lake trophic state for 55,662 lakes of at least 10 ha in area throughout the contiguous United States from 1984 through 2020. The dataset was constructed with FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) in mind, where data are publicly available, relational keys from parent datasets are retained, and all data wrangling and modeling routines are scripted for future reuse. Together, this resource offers critical data to address basic and applied research questions about lake water quality at a suite of spatial and temporal scales.

Millions of people worldwide face intermittent clean water availability due to climatic and anthropogenic stressors1. Current literature suggests that changes in surface water quantity and quality are highly heterogeneous, and trends globally suggest that factors such as ice cover, air temperature, humidity, and lake surface area are likely interacting regionally to affect freshwater ecosystems in synergistic ways2,3,4,5,6,7. To gain a better understanding of the potential threats to freshwater ecosystems, new technologies must be engaged. Satellite-based Earth observations (hereafter “remote sensing”) are particularly useful as they can provide information at spatial and temporal scales that are currently impossible to replicate via ground-based observations. Although remote sensing’s usefulness to track changes in water quantity has enabled analyses of water availability from local-to-global scales8,9,10,11, investigations of water quality have historically been more limited in scale and scope. However, remote sensing now offers powerful approaches to assessing patterns and trends in water quality2,12,13,14,15, and data harmonization efforts allow for greater interoperability between in situ collections and remote sensing imagery16,17. Among studies of remotely sensed metrics of water quality, the majority have centered around specific constituents, such as secchi disk depth, chlorophyll, or suspended sediment, without necessarily offering holistic metrics of ecosystem productivity. Lake trophic state (LTS) is an example of a metric intended to provide holistic assessments of a lake’s aggregate physical (e.g., light attenuation), chemical (e.g., nutrient concentrations), and biological processes (e.g., productivity). Broadly speaking, LTS is a property closely associated with a lake’s characteristic autochthonous and allochthonous productivity as well as water color18. Eutrophic lakes are green, oligotrophic lakes are blue, and dystrophic lakes are brown (Fig. 1). From color-trophic state connections, fundamental limnological principles center around linking trophic states to characteristic properties (Fig. 1). For example, oligotrophic lakes are usually characterized by having lower phosphorus concentrations, low offshore but comparably higher nearshore productivity, and low colored dissolved organic matter (Fig. 1). In contrast, eutrophic lakes have higher phosphorus concentrations and higher phytoplankton biomass (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Nutrient-Color Paradigm (NCP) scheme for classifying oligotrophic, eutrophic, dystrophic, and mixotrophic lakes. Schematic is adapted from Williamson et al.22 and Webster et al.23, and characteristic lake descriptions broadly stem from results presented in Leech et al.24 and Oleksy et al.92 Within each NCP-quadrant, there are a suite of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that distinguish each type of lake: colored Dissolved Organic Matter (cDOM), primary production, cyanobacterial abundance, and higher order production. Lower cDOM concentrations (blue water drops) are characteristic in oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes. When cDOM is low, light can transmit through the water column more deeply, allowing for primary producers to undergo photosynthesis and zooplankton to consume primary producers (oligotrophic). When nutrients, such as phosphorus, are at higher concentrations and cDOM is low (eutrophic), primary production, cyanobacterial abundance, and higher order production can all increase, resulting in increased biomass. When cDOM concentrations are high (brown water drop) and nutrient concentrations are low (dystrophic), the increased light attenuation can result in decreased primary production, which can reciprocally cause decreased higher order production. Lastly, when nutrient and cDOM concentrations are both high (mixotrophic), primary production, cyanobacterial abundance, and higher order production can exceed values observed when solely cDOM or nutrient concentrations alone are higher. Phytoplankton and filled-in zooplankton cartoons were downloaded from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Integration and Application Network (https://ian.umces.edu/media-library/). Phytoplankton were designed by Tracey Saxby of the Integration and Application Network, Dieter Tracey of the Water and Rivers Commission, Kim Kraeer and Lucy Van Essen-Fishman of the Integration and Application Network. Transparent crustacean zooplankton and rotifer cartoons were drawn by Stephanie E. Hampton. Full size image In a management context, the language of LTS has historically been used to describe conditions relative to nutrient enrichment. For example, following the 1971 announcement of US Federal efforts to limit the use of phosphorus in detergents, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and state water resource management agencies launched a National Eutrophication Survey19. The survey assessed trophic state, defined as nutrient enrichment, of lakes influenced by wastewater treatment plants. In this case, LTS language was used to focus on and communicate about eutrophication, whereas dystrophication aspects of the framework were not as prominent. These language patterns likely carry over to contemporary uses. Because discussions may have focused on eutrophication in the past, modern tools and frameworks could be enhanced by remotely sensed water quality data that capture aspects of both eutrophication and dystrophication. For example, as climate changes, drinking water utility managers will increasingly face compounding hazards that could negatively impact lakes and reservoirs that supply hundreds of millions of people with drinking water20. Data and tools that provide remotely sensed information on LTS could improve the ability to observe multidecadal changes in water quality and save resources by better targeting field monitoring. Although LTS is often employed as a classification system for characterizing autotrophic production21, the Nutrient-Color Paradigm (NCP) is an empirically tested framework for discriminating LTS based off two variables: (1) phosphorus concentrations, a proxy for nutrient availability and primary productivity; and (2) colored dissolved organic matter or turbidity measured in platinum-cobalt units, both proxies for water transparency22,23,24. By combining characteristic metrics of a lake’s primary productivity and optical properties, the NCP presents a powerful system for discriminating LTS, where both autochthonous and allochthonous processes are considered. Leveraging the relationship between LTS, nutrient concentrations, and water clarity, it is possible to transform remotely sensed lake surface reflectance observations into meaningful limnological and ecosystem properties. Here, we present the first national-scale compendium of LTS that has been built from remotely sensed lake color (i.e., red, green, blue, and near-infrared surface reflectances). The dataset, referred to as LTS-US, is derived from (1) coordinated, continental-scale in situ measurements, where LTS has been documented for select lakes and years, and (2) characteristic Landsat surface reflectance values for each lake’s Chebyshev center (the point in a polygon furthest from the edge). Using in situ LTS, we can build predictive models to associate LTS with characteristic reflectance values, and then apply predictive models to lakes with unknown trophic states. Together, the dataset contains predictions for 55,662 lakes of at least 10 ha in area with annual estimates of LTS from 1984 through 2020. By coupling satellite-based remote sensing with fundamental limnological principles, the LTS-US dataset provides the means to apply the NCP at the national scale to identify macroscale patterns and trends in LTS. Further, this approach moves beyond remote sensing of individual parameters to provide insights into lakes’ physical, chemical, biological, and ecosystem properties. Methods The LTS-US dataset is constructed using a four-part pipeline, as shown in Fig. 2: (1) aggregate training data, (2) create classification models, (3) apply predictions to lakes outside of the training data, and (4) assess model performance and prediction validity. Individual steps within the pipeline are described below. Fig. 2 Flowchart for data harmonization, modeling, and prediction steps of the LTS-US dataset pipeline. Steps shaped as a file-folder correspond to an intermediary data product, and rectangles correspond to an intermediary model. Data aggregation combines data from the U.S. EPA’s National Lakes Assessment, HydroLAKES, and LimnoSat-US to create a single, harmonized dataset of in situ lake trophic states with paired remotely sensed surface reflectances. Model training steps create multinomial logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and extreme gradient boosted regression tree models. Each fitted model is then applied to the entire LimnoSat-US data, where national-scale predictions are made for each modeling method. Probabilistic predictions are then averaged to create ensemble predictions of lake trophic state. Quality control steps (described in “Technical Validation”) use both the ensemble and individual model predictions to assess model performance. Each of these four components correspond to a piece of the overall data production pipeline: data aggregation functions are described in “1_aggregate”; model training functions are described in “2_train”; national-scale prediction functions are described in “3_predict”; quality control procedures are described in “4_qc”. Flowchart was designed with the “DiagrammeR” package93. Full size image Step 1: Identify Parent Datasets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Lakes Assessment In situ measurements of total phosphorus and true color were compiled from the U.S. EPA’s National Lakes Assessment (NLA)25,26,27,28,29, a synoptic sampling campaign of lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, hereafter collectively referred to as “lakes”, conducted in the contiguous U.S. every five years. Lakes used in this analysis were sampled in the summer (June-September) of 2007 (n = 1,028), 2012 (n = 1,038), or 2017 (n = 1,005). Lakes were selected from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD, https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset) using a randomized design stratified on aggregated Omernik level III ecoregion30 and lake surface area. The minimum surface area for inclusion in the 2007 assessment was 4 ha but owing to increasing resolution in the NHD was reduced to 1 ha for the 2012 and 2017 assessments. Natural lakes and reservoirs were treated equally in the site selection process. To inform internal quality assurance within a campaign, 10% of the lakes were sampled twice within a field season. Approximately 25% of lakes were targeted for resampling in multiple years to examine temporal change. State, Tribal, Federal, and contractor field crews evaluated lakes on site to ensure that selected lakes met criteria for inclusion in the field campaign (e.g., lake ≥1 m deep). A wide set of measurements were collected at each sampled lake, but we only provide details on the variables used in this analysis. Additional details, protocols, and data are available online (https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/nla). Total phosphorus and true color were collected and processed in the 2007, 2012, and 2017 field campaigns25,26,28. In natural lakes, field crews sampled in a deep area of the lake regardless of whether the sample location was in the geometric center of the system. In reservoirs, field crews were asked to find a midpoint in the reservoir that was reasonably lentic, deep, and away from a dam. In lakes and reservoirs deeper than 50 m, field crews sampled from a location with a maximum depth of 50 m. Water was collected from 0–2 m using a vertical integrated water sampler. In lakes where the photic zone (2x Secchi depth) was <2 m, sampling was limited to the photic zone to prevent sampling of hypolimnetic water. All water samples were placed on ice and shipped overnight to the Willamette Research Station in Corvallis, Oregon for analysis. True color was estimated by visual comparison of filtered water samples to a calibrated glass color disk31. Total phosphorus concentrations were measured with manual alkaline persulfate digestion, followed by automated colorimetric analysis (ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate under acidic conditions, with absorbance at 880 nm) using a flow injection analyzer following standard method 4500-P-E32. Detailed descriptions of all water quality analyses are available in the NLA Laboratory Operations Manuals25,27,29. HydroLAKES HydroLAKES (v1.0)33 is a compendium of more than 1.4 million lake and reservoir shapefiles globally, with surface area of at least 10 ha. For an individual waterbody, HydroLAKES contains its spatial extent and location (using georeferenced polygons), a unique identifier (ranging from 1 to 1,427,688), and its morphological (area, mean depth, elevation, shoreline length etc.), hydrological (e.g., residence time, discharge, and watershed area), and geographical (e.g., name, country, continent) properties. HydroLAKES is a compilation of existing lake databases, with sources from government agencies (e.g., Natural Resources Canada, U.S. Geological Survey, European Environment Agency) and from remote sensing studies (for example, Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Water Body Data, Global Lakes and Wetlands Database, and Global Reservoir and Dam Database). Most of the lake polygons are sourced from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Water Body Data for regions between 60°S and 60°N34, supplemented by other datasets for higher latitudes and for underrepresented regions. More detailed information on the creation and validation of the HydroLAKES dataset can be found in Messager et al.33. LimnoSat The LimnoSat-US35 dataset comprises over 22 million remotely sensed observations of lake surface reflectance from 1984 to 2020. Observations cover 55,662 lakes greater than 10 ha33 aggregated from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 Collection 1 imagery. Each observation was calculated by taking the median surface reflectance within 120 meters of each lake’s Chebyshev center, defined as the point farthest from shore and usually located at the lake’s deepest point36. While many valid choices of buffer distance exist, LimnoSat-US employed a 120 m buffer to capture reflectances from a maximum of 64 Landsat pixels, which should prevent the values of a few pixels from influencing the mean. Further, extracting reflectance values from the Chebyshev center minimizes signals due to bottom reflectance and adjacent land pixels. For each Landsat observation, non-high confidence water pixels were masked using the Dynamic Surface Water Extent algorithm37. Observations were removed if the scene cloud cover was greater than 75%, any snow, ice, cloud, cloud shadow38, or hillshadow was detected over the lake’s Chebyshev center, or if there were fewer than eight high confidence water pixels within the 120 meter buffer of the lake’s Chebyshev center. For certain lakes, these filters lead to extended periods (i.e., months to years) with limited observations (see Fig. 2 in Topp et al.2). Data in LimnoSat-US are presented in a tabular format, where each row reflects a Landsat overpass for a given waterbody, and columns include median Collection 1 surface reflectance values by band extracted from pixels within 120 m of the Chebyshev center, scene-wide cloud cover, date of imagery acquisition, and number of water pixels within 120 m of the Chebyshev center. Step 2: Define lake trophic state Many lakes across the United States are experiencing simultaneous changes in their water clarity, with some lakes getting greener due to eutrophication, and others getting browner from increasing terrestrially-derived organic matter, and some are simultaneously ‘greening’ and ‘browning’24. Given the need to discriminate between lakes that may be browning and/or greening, the Nutrient Color Paradigm (NCP) is a useful tool to assign LTS based on a lake’s characteristic color. The NCP was initially proposed in the early 20th century, emphasizing that both autochthonous and allochthonous processes are important to understanding LTS39,40,41. Specifically, water color often affects algal biomass and light transparency independent of nutrient availability. Rodhe42 first assembled the four quadrants of the NCP, placing autochthony on the horizontal axis and allochthony on the vertical axis. This second dimension distinguishes “oligotrophic” (low nutrient, low color) and “eutrophic” (high nutrient, low color) lakes from “dystrophic” (low nutrient, high color) and “mixotrophic” (high nutrient, high color) lakes. Although metrics such as Trophic State Index21 gained popularity for providing instantaneous assessments of a lake’s autotrophic production, Williamson et al.22 encouraged a focus on NCP for lake classification given the importance of both nutrients and colored dissolved organic matter to lake structure and function. The NCP’s implementation is empirically supported by studies like Webster et al.23, where an analysis of ~1,600 temperate lakes in North America demonstrated that within lakes grouped by total phosphorus concentration (i.e., oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic), those with ‘browner’ color (indicative of dissolved organic matter) had higher volumetric chlorophyll-a concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths. A similar pattern was observed by Nürnberg and Shaw43, which analyzed 600 lakes spanning a latitude of 39°S to 82°N. Here, we used the thresholds published in Webster et al.23 to classify lakes in the NLA dataset. Lakes were described as oligotrophic or ‘blue’ if total phosphorus concentration was less than 30 μg/L and true color was less than 20 platinum cobalt units (PCU), eutrophic or ‘green’ if total phosphorus was greater than 30 μg/L and true color was less than 20 PCU, dystrophic or ‘brown’ if total phosphorus was less than 30 μg/L and true color was greater than 20 PCU, and mixotrophic or ‘murky’ if total phosphorus was greater than 30 μg/L and true color was greater than 20 PCU (Fig. 1). Thresholds for total phosphorus are based on long established and widely accepted ranges affecting primary productivity18. True color thresholds are derived from Nürnberg and Shaw43. Eutrophic and mixotrophic classifications were combined into a single grouping due to similar spectral characteristics (see Step 3). Notably, the NCP assumes that phosphorus is the limiting factor for primary production. While there are instances where nitrogen can be the limiting nutrient44,45, ecosystems with low concentrations of total phosphorus also tend to have low total nitrogen concentrations46. Step 3: Create a training dataset First, to create a dataset of lakes with in situ LTS measurements, we aggregated all total phosphorus and true color measurements from the U.S. EPA NLA 2007, 2012, and 2017 data (Figs. S1–3, Table S1). Although the NLA includes lakes smaller than 10 ha, we only used lakes of at least 10 ha in area for consistency with the HydroLAKES database. We then assessed the extent to which seasonal shifts in total phosphorus concentrations and true color values may alter interpretation of trophic state for a given lake using the subset of lakes that were sampled intra-annually. For lakes that were sampled multiple times within a U.S. EPA NLA campaign, we calculated the percentage of lakes that transitioned between trophic states within a single year and found that lakes broadly remained in the same NCP trophic state throughout a given summer (85.1% of lakes). Of the lakes that changed trophic state during a sampling season (14.9%), the majority transitioned from oligotrophic (61.5% of changing lakes; 8.7% of all lakes) or dystrophic (15.4% of changing lakes; 2.2% of all lakes) to eutrophic/mixotrophic. Few lakes transitioned from oligotrophic to dystrophic (15.4% of changing lakes; 2.2% of all lakes), and even fewer transitioned to oligotrophic from either dystrophic (3.9% of changing lakes; 0.5% of all lakes) or eutrophic/mixotrophic (3.9% of changing lakes; 0.5% of all lakes). No lakes transitioned from eutrophic/mixotrophic to dystrophic across all three NLA campaigns. Broadly, lakes transitioned between trophic states when lakes were located near a threshold for trophic state delineation (15–45 μg/L total phosphorus or 11–29 PCU). These results mirror those in Leech et al.24 and suggest that despite some lakes changing trophic states within a summer, the majority of lakes do not transition and those that do transition usually fall along an edge of a NCP-determined trophic state. Thus, for lakes sampled twice in one sampling campaign, we averaged total phosphorus and true color estimates. Second, to match the in situ trophic states with remotely sensed imagery, we merged the complete 2007, 2012, and 2017 NLA dataset with the LimnoSat-US dataset35, where each NLA lake-year had corresponding Landsat spectral data. Because the NLA is designed to describe lakes’ summertime conditions, we filtered LimnoSat-US observances for those only occurring in June, July, and August, which we a priori defined as the summertime season for the contiguous U.S.; then, to create a characteristic reflectance for a given lake-year, we computed each lake-year’s median summertime reflectance for red, blue, green, and near-infrared bands. Because LimnoSat-US compiles reflectance values from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, there are differences in the number of images per lake and year. In particular, images from 1984 through 1998 were solely collected from Landsat 5, when lakes averaged 3.04 images per summer (minimum average images: 2.43 images; maximum average images: 3.64 images). From 1999 through 2012, summertime imagery was gathered from Landsat 5 and 7, when lakes averaged 5.64 images per summer (minimum average images: 3.37 images; maximum average images: 6.42 images). From 2013 through 2019, summertime imagery was collected from Landsat 7 and 8, when lakes averaged 5.42 images per summer (minimum average images: 4.87 images; maximum average images: 5.87 images). Third, to better characterize spectral bands’ relative reflectance, we normalized each lake’s median summertime reflectance for the red, green, blue, and near-infrared band by the sum of the summertime reflectance values of all four bands. This normalization allowed us to differentiate lakes by trophic state based on their most prominent reflectances. For example, we anticipated that oligotrophic lakes would be dominated by high blue and green reflectances relative to the red and near-infrared bands. In contrast, dystrophic lakes would be dominated by the near-infrared band relative to green and red bands, because dystrophic lakes tend to have exceptionally low primary productivity and elevated dissolved organic matter. When assessing mixotrophic and eutrophic lakes, spectral characteristics were nearly identical, and to be conservative, we combined mixotrophic and eutrophic lakes into one category ‘eutrophic/mixotrophic’. These relative reflectances for all three lake trophic states were ultimately intended to discriminate among lakes that were optically similar in the visible spectrum (i.e., oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes). Notably, the decision to use median summertime relative reflectances differed from previous work2 that focused on the dominant wavelength, which is an aggregation of wavelengths detected in the visible spectrum and has been used to discriminate autotrophic production (i.e., blue vs green lakes), but not dystrophic states. Thus, our methods are better suited towards discriminating between oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, because the dominant wavelength approach would consider both of these lake types to be “blue”. Step 4: Create classification models To find an optimal performing classifier for lakes with unknown LTS, we employed three classification methods to predict trophic state: multinomial logistic regression47, extreme gradient boosting regression48, and a neural network using multilayer perceptrons49. Logistic regression is a parametric classification method, whereas gradient boosted regression and multilayer perceptrons are machine learning methods. The methods differ in how they make classifications. Using trophic state as a categorical response variable, logistic regression applies a linear regression of log-odds ratios to model the probability of a given trophic state for each lake. In contrast, gradient boosted regression applies decision trees to iteratively improve its predictions. Multilayer perceptrons apply a type of feedforward artificial neural network in which a backpropagation algorithm is used to subsequently update the individual weights of each neuron unit by comparing modeled predictions to the training data. For each modeling method, we used z-scored, relative red, green, blue, and near-infrared reflectances as predictors. Model performance and potential for overfitting were assessed using a 90:10 train:test data split with spatial-holdout cross-validation. Initial hyperparameters for the gradient boosted regression and multilayer perceptron models were tuned by holding out 20% of each trophic class from the training observations to use for validation and conducting a coarse grid-search across the hyperparameter space. For each combination of hyperparameters, models were trained until validation performance did not increase for 20 consecutive epochs using categorical cross entropy as the objective function. During the multilayer perceptron hyperparameter tuning, we iterated through model fits using all combinations of 5, 10, and 20 hidden layers as well as a learning rate of 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0005. Multilayer perceptron hyperparameter tuning metrics were optimal for models with 20 hidden units and a learning rate of 0.001. During the gradient boosted regression hyperparameter tuning, we iterated through model fits using all combinations of 2, 3, and 4 maximum tree depths, subsample as well as column samples of 0.5 and 0.8, step sizes of 0.01 and 0.1, as well as a minimum child weight of 1 and 3. Gradient boosted regression hyperparameter tuning metrics were optimal for models with a max depth of 4, subsample of 0.5, column sample of 0.5, step size of 0.01, and minimum child weight of 1. For both multilayer perceptron and gradient boosted regression models, best performing hyperparameter tuning metrics were assessed by having lowest validation loss values. These hyperparameters were then used in a spatial cross-validation routine50, where a given lake was held out as test data if it was included in the training data. During the spatial cross-validation routine, training data were divided into five folds, such that lakes within each test partition were not present in remaining training partitions (i.e., test metrics represent performance on unseen lakes). Training data within each fold were then partitioned into a 90:10 split with 10% of each trophic class set aside for an inner-loop fold validation. Models within each fold were trained using an early stopping criterion of 20 epochs to avoid overfitting on the training data. This inner-fold validation was additionally used to hypertune the best number of epochs for the final models. Finally, overall error metrics were calculated based on the mean prediction accuracy of the test partitions withheld from the inner-loop training of each fold. All reported metrics are based on the test partitions from the spatial cross-validation routine while final models were trained on the full dataset using the hyperparameters identified from the grid-search and inner-loop validation routines. We applied the final models to make predictions for all 55,662 lakes in the LimnoSat-US dataset. Step 5: Assess and compare model performance To evaluate the final fitted models, we used test data predictions from the spatial-holdout routine to calculate each model’s overall and balanced accuracy, receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves, as well as the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve. Overall accuracy was calculated as the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the total number of LTS predictions. Balanced accuracy was calculated as the sum of a true positive and true negative results for a single lake trophic state. Whereas overall accuracy can be biased towards more prevalent trophic states (i.e., eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes), balanced accuracy is useful to assess a model’s capacity to predict more rare trophic states (i.e., dystrophic lakes). As an additional metric of model performance, we calculated the AUC of each model’s ROC curve. The ROC curve visually graphs the relationship between the rate of a correct classification with the rate of a false classification. An AUC of 0.5 indicates a false prediction rate increases 1:1 with the rate of a correct prediction. AUCs greater than 0.5 imply a model performing better than random, even when a false positive rate is artificially inflated. Thus, comparing overall and balanced accuracy as well as ROC curves and AUCs allowed us to assess how models performed broadly as well as how robustly models predicted trophic state correctly. Beyond model performance, we also evaluated whether model coefficients and variable importance for trophic state discrimination reflected NCP groupings. For increased interpretability across all three models, we employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) analysis51,52,53 to better understand individual feature importance and influence in model predictions. SHAP analysis yields insight into the marginal contribution of a given feature (e.g., near-infrared spectra) on model output - in this case trophic state - and helps decode ‘black box’ results. Understanding the relative contribution of individual features in trophic state prediction not only helps explain feature roles in model accuracy and misclassification but also quantitatively connects features, such as remotely sensed data, to the biophysical parameters in which LTS prediction is grounded. SHAP feature contribution was calculated for blue, green, red, and near-infrared Landsat spectra. SHAP feature contribution was scored for oligotrophic, dystrophic, and eutrophic/mixotrophic classifications and across each of the three models. This scoring illuminates the relationship among feature values and SHAP contribution for a given trophic state classification and for a given model. Specifically, for classification problems, a positive SHAP value indicates that a given input contributed to a positive classification and a negative value indicates the input contributed to a low probability for a given classification. Data Records The LTS-US dataset54 is available at the Environmental Data Initiative (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/212a3172ac36e8dc6e1862f9c2522fa4) and is structured in a tabular format, where each row is a lake-year combination. The main dataset is contained in “ensemble_predictions.csv” and is structured in a way that provides both categorical LTS predictions as well as probabilities for each LTS prediction. The probabilities reported in “ensemble_predictions.csv” are averaged probabilities generated from each of the three modeling methodologies. An additional tabular dataset (“individual_predictions.csv”) contains probabilities generated for each of the three modeling methodologies and can be merged with “ensemble_predictions.csv” by the “Hylak_id” and “year” columns. We provide raw and average predicted LTS probabilities as well as variance among models for a given LTS prediction to allow future users to filter predictions of a certain threshold for their particular analysis. Although many thresholds may exist, reporting probability thresholds used in subsequent analyses will help maintain reproducibility and synthesis across studies. Below, we detail column names and metadata for each of the core datasets contained within the LTS-US data product. “ensemble_predictions.csv” Hylak_id HydroLAKES unique identifier of lake.

Technical Validation Model performance diagnostics To assess how each model correctly classified training data, we compared the model accuracies, balanced accuracies, and AUC of ROC curves. Overall and balanced model accuracies were similar, where all models had accuracies ranging from 72.4 to 72.9% and balanced accuracies ranging from 69.9 to 71.5%. AUCs of ROCs were likewise similar across all three model techniques, ranging from 0.88 to 0.90 (Figure S4). These combined metrics suggest that all three modeling approaches performed similarly, when assessing model performance with global metrics. Although models performed similarly at high levels, they varied more in their robustness to classify dystrophic lakes (Fig. 3). Machine learning-based methods, such as multilayer perceptron (60%) and gradient boosted regression (58%), had higher balanced accuracies, whereas distribution-based methods, such as logistic regression (55%), had lower balanced accuracies. These differences were largely driven by deviations in true positive rates (47.5–50.6%), whereas true negative rates were higher (91.8–92.7%). This difference in true negative and true positive rates is likely due to spectral similarities between oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, where both are characterized by low primary production in comparison to eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes. Although these differences only span 5%, they may be important, given that dystrophic lakes tend to be uncommon relative to oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes23. Such differences imply variation in each model’s robustness to predict rarer trophic states, but our overall metrics of model performance highlight exceptional congruence across all three modeling techniques. Fig. 3 Confusion matrices from each modeling approach. Confusion matrices were generated using the test partitions for each spatial-holdout cross-validation. Circle size is scaled by the number of lakes falling within each category. Trophic states for model predictions and reference data correspond to the acronyms “dys” for “dystrophic”, “eu/mixo” for “eutrophic/mixotrophic”, and “oligo” for “oligotrophic”. Model acronyms are located as the title for each confusion matrix, where “MLP” signifies “Multilayer Perceptron”, “XGB” signifies “Gradient Boosted Regression”, and “Logit” signifies “Multinomial Logistic Regression”. Full size image Spatial patterns in lake classification To evaluate spatio-temporal patterns in trophic state classification, we created spatial confusion matrices, where predictions and reference sites were plotted across the entire United States. We a priori hypothesized that when misclassifications result from lake-specific deviations, misclassifications should be distributed throughout the United States without any clear spatial patterns. In the event that spatial clustering of misclassified lakes occurred, these patterns should be more pronounced where high densities of a given lake trophic state are located. In cases when lake clustering appears in an unexpected area, these patterns should be more attributed to place-based irregularities in spectral data. Confusion between oligotrophic and eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes were spatially distributed throughout the entire continental United States, with no evidence of spatial clustering (Figures S5–S7). In contrast, dystrophic misclassifications were broadly isolated to the Upper Midwest and Upper Northeast regions. Consistent with our hypotheses, these regions are associated with increased densities of dystrophic lakes, suggesting that optical similarities between oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes in these regions may lead to increased misclassification. Notably, dystrophic lakes tended to be misclassified as oligotrophic, whereas oligotrophic lakes tended to not be misclassified as dystrophic, meaning that our predictions should be conservative with assigning an individual lake as dystrophic. Assessing patterns in lake classification Given that lake trophic state classifications may be a product of a lake’s limnological, morphological, and geographic properties, we performed a series of analyses of variance (ANOVA) to test for significant differences (i.e., p-value < 0.05) in lake classification accuracy. For each ANOVA, a lake property was the response variable, and predictors were lake trophic state, model correctness (i.e., correct or incorrect classification), and model type. All response variables were log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Because each analysis had an unbalanced sample size, we calculated Type II Sum-of-Squares55. Residuals for each model were assessed for normality and homogeneity of variance. The main goal of each ANOVA was to assess whether variation in a lake parameter could be associated with variation in model methodologies, model correctness, or trophic states themselves. Consequently, our ANOVAs do not include interaction terms, as most interactions would not be helpful for understanding patterns in how our classification models performed. NCP patterns in lake classification To assess how a lake’s misclassification may be related to its position in the NCP, we assessed where correctly and incorrectly classified lakes were located in the NCP. Lakes that were incorrectly classified tended to be located near total phosphorus (30 ± 15 μg/L) and color (20 ± 9 PCU) thresholds, with a large portion at the nexus of the total phosphorus and color thresholds (Fig. 4). Across all modeling techniques, correctly classified lakes spanned a wider range across both axes, especially total phosphorus. Median total phosphorus concentration for misclassified lakes was 24 μg/L (range: 1–4,772 μg/L), whereas median total phosphorus concentration for correctly classified lakes was 36 μg/L (range: 0.24–4,144 μg/L). Similarly, median PCU for correctly (14 PCU; range: 0–724 PCU) and incorrectly (16 PCU; range: 0–350 PCU) classified lakes were along the edge of the color threshold of 20 PCU. When assessing total phosphorus and color independently, ANOVA suggested that total phosphorus concentrations were significantly different for correctly and incorrectly classified lakes, whereas differences in color were not significantly different across correctly and incorrectly classified lakes (Table 1; Fig. 5). Fig. 4 True and false classifications from testing data displayed on the NCP axes. Hexbins are colored by the number of lakes they contain. Labels reflect the percentage of lakes correctly or incorrectly predicted within a given modeling technique. Incorrect LTS predictions tend to be located at the nexus of trophic state groupings. Correct predictions tend to more accurately reflect the breadth of ranges that can be observed within each of the LTS groupings. Full size image Table 1 ANOVA table for total phosphorus and true color measurements in response to model type, model correctness, and trophic state. Full size table Fig. 5 Density plots for total phosphorus (a) and true color (b) values as well as absolute differences from NCP thresholds for total phosphorus (c) and true color (d) among correctly (i.e., True; orange) and incorrectly (i.e., False; purple) classified trophic states. Because misclassifications appeared to increase in frequency near threshold values for trophic state classification, we also assessed classification accuracies across absolute differences for each variable and threshold value. Across all models, we noticed that misclassifications tended to be highest near NCP thresholds for total phosphorus and color. Total phosphorus concentrations of 15–45 μg/L tended to be associated with false classifications. True color concentrations of 11–29 PCU tended to be associated with a false classification. Full size image Beyond total phosphorus and color patterns influencing lake classification, our analyses of lakes that transitioned trophic states within a summer suggest that lakes along a NCP boundary (i.e., near total phosphorus or color threshold) are more prone to misclassification. Among lakes that transitioned within a summer, the most frequent change in lake trophic state was among lakes switching from oligotrophic to eutrophic (61.5% of NLA lakes that changed in a summer; 8.7% of all NLA lakes). Considering that both total phosphorus concentrations as well as summertime lake phenologies are associated with algal production and can cause a lake to transition categories within a summer, our results of NCP patterns are not surprising. Rather, confusion along the total phosphorus axis of the NCP, an axis that corresponds with autotrophic productivity, is concordant with the idea that a lake can experience moments of eutrophy - e.g., a pulse of nutrients or algal growth - while otherwise being oligotrophic for the majority of the summer. Therefore, classifications made for lakes at the boundary of trophic states can be challenging, and our validation analyses describe total phosphorus and color conditions where misclassifications may be more common. Morphological and locational patterns in lake classification At the spatial resolution of Landsat’s sensors, there is a risk of “mixed pixels”, where a pixel includes water with fractions of adjacent bare land or vegetation. Given the difference in optical contrast between water and other features, even minor differences can lead to large errors in estimating surface reflectance. A major source of uncertainty in lake optical water quality estimation is the separation of water and atmospheric effects56. The latter increases in severity near land, and this adjacency effect can extend several kilometers, depending on the state of the atmosphere. Before assessing how edge and lakebed effects may influence model classifications, we first ensured that spectral differences between each trophic state in our dataset were greater than differences within a trophic state when accounting for lake area, depth, and shape. To evaluate how edge and lakebed effects may be present within our training and test data, we used lake area, average depth, and shoreline development (a metric of how closely a lake’s shape resembles a circle) data from HydroLAKES33 as well as maximum depth from the GLOBathy dataset57. While evaluating lake area, we noticed that smaller lakes tended to have higher near-infrared relative reflectance values, and relative near-infrared reflectance generally decreased with increasing lake area (Figures S8–S10). Because LimnoSat-US aggregates reflectance data at the lake’s Chebyshev center, the point in the lake farthest away from shore, smaller lakes would likely have Chebyshev centers that are closer to the shoreline. As terrestrial near-infrared reflectances tend to be higher than aquatic near-infrared reflectances, smaller lakes with Chebyshev centers closer to the shoreline may be associated with increased near-infrared signatures. Similarly, relative blue reflectance increased with increasing lake surface area, which would likewise be expected, as larger lakes likely have a Chebyshev center that is farther from shore, and therefore, less influenced by shoreline effects. With respect to lakebed effects, the shallowest lakes tended to have slightly elevated relative green reflectance, which would be consistent with increased primary production. Across all trophic states, lakes with average depths of 1–10 m were also associated with increased relative near-infrared reflectance, suggesting that these lakes may have the highest near-infrared reflectance due to reflectance signatures of lakebed substrate or increased benthic algal production. To evaluate how models might misclassify lakes in response to morphological, geographic, and biological characteristics, we examined how lake depth, elevation, surface area, shoreline development, and mean chlorophyll concentration may correspond to correct and incorrect classifications. Average and maximum lake depth can be used to evaluate a lake’s potential for lakebed effects, where reflectance from benthic algae, emergent vegetation, or sediment may confound signals for the actual surface of the lake. Assessing classification differences across elevation ranges can be important for understanding atmospheric effects on reflectance data, where higher elevations may have fewer aerosols, and therefore contain fewer misclassifications. Examining misclassifications across lake sizes can reveal potential for adjacency effects, where surrounding geologies or vegetation may obscure surface reflectances observed over the lake. Shoreline development can likewise reveal adjacency effects, where lakes with more complex shapes but with large areas may be prone to misclassification. Lastly, chlorophyll a concentrations can inform that our models are capturing patterns expected through how we operationally defined LTS, where higher chlorophyll concentrations should be observed in eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes relative to dystrophic and oligotrophic lakes. ANOVA results suggested that average depth, chlorophyll a, maximum depth, shoreline development, and elevation differed significantly across correct and incorrect misclassifications (Table 2), although differences based on average and maximum depth as well as chlorophyll a were more visually apparent than those observed for elevation and shoreline development (Fig. 6). In contrast, lake area did not differ significantly across correct and incorrect classifications (Table 2). Table 2 ANOVA table for lake morphological and locational properties in response to model type, model correctness, and trophic state. Full size table Fig. 6 Density distributions for each lake’s average depth, mean summertime chlorophyll a concentration, elevation, area, maximum depth, and shoreline development values across true (orange) and false (purple) classifications. Values are log-transformed to show characteristic density distributions over a wide range in value magnitudes. In general, patterns across true and false classifications were consistent across all three types of models. Depth was a primary characteristic for misclassified oligotrophic and eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes, where shallower oligotrophic and deeper eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes tended to be misclassified. Full size image Together, these analyses suggest that lakebed reflectance may lead to lake trophic state misclassification, whereas edge effects are likely less consequential for inaccurate lake trophic state classifications. In particular, shallower oligotrophic lakes (i.e., average depth <5 m and maximum depth <15 m; Fig. 6) and deeper eutrophic lakes (i.e., average depth >5 m and maximum depth >15 m; Fig. 6) tended to be misclassified. We speculate that these differences may stem from shallower, oligotrophic lakes having pronounced benthic algal growth58 or emergent macrophytes that can produce a strong green signal. Conversely, deeper eutrophic lakes may have less concentrated algal growth in the water column, thereby creating a stronger blue reflectance relative to green reflectance and increasing chances for misclassification (see Optical patterns in lake classification). These differences may also be related to chlorophyll a concentration, where oligotrophic lakes with higher concentrations tended to be classified as eutrophic/mixotrophic, and eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes with lower concentrations tended to be misclassified as oligotrophic (Fig. 6). Overall, these results correspond with our NCP validation analyses, where total phosphorus concentrations were associated with greater misclassifications of oligotrophic lakes as eutrophic. Given the potential for lakes to be misclassified because of issues with lakebed reflectance, considering whether depth could alter results and building analytical workflows to assess sensitivity to interference from lakebed reflectance (see SHAP Analysis for more detail) could improve model lake classifications. Optical patterns in lake classification To evaluate how models might misclassify lakes based on reflectance values, we assessed how z-scored relative red, green, blue, and near-infrared reflectance values differed between correctly and incorrectly predicted lake trophic state. Because we used relative reflectances that are inherently interdependent, and thus violate ANOVA assumptions, we elected to forgo significance tests for whether band ranges differed across modeling methods. For dystrophic lakes, incorrectly classified lakes, compared to correctly classified lakes, tended to have lower z-scored near-infrared and blue band values as well as higher green and red values (Fig. 7). For eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes, misclassified lakes tended to have lower values for red and green bands as well as higher values for blue bands (Fig. 7). For oligotrophic lakes, incorrectly classified lakes tended to have higher red and lower blue band values (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Density distributions for each Landsat band’s z-scored, relative reflectance value across true (orange) and false (purple) classifications. In general, patterns across true and false classifications were consistent across all three types of models. Oligotrophic lakes tended to be misclassified when red bands were high and blue bands were low. Conversely, eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes tended to be misclassified when blue bands were high, and red bands were low. Dystrophic lakes tended to be misclassified when near infra-red bands were low and when green bands were high. Full size image These inconsistencies in LTS classification correspond with variation that can be present in natural systems. Dystrophic lakes are generally characterized as having low primary productivity and high dissolved organic matter, which should result in low green band values as well as higher near-infrared values, yet misclassified dystrophic lakes tended to have low near-infrared as well as high red and green bands. Eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes are generally characterized as having high productivity, which should result in high green values, yet misclassified eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes tended to have low green and red as well as high blue bands. Oligotrophic lakes should be characterized as having high blue bands, yet misclassified lakes tended to have low blue and high red bands, which may be a product of bottom reflectance. Together, these misclassifications likely represent lakes that are not characteristic of LTS classifications. For example, a more productive oligotrophic lake could produce a stronger red and green signature and, therefore, be classified as eutrophic. Likewise, less productive eutrophic lakes may be optically more similar to oligotrophic lakes and, therefore, be characterized by lower red and green bands. SHAP Analysis To evaluate the influence of remote sensing reflectance inputs on final predictions, we assessed the distribution of SHAP values calculated for each predictor and for each trophic state. In general, SHAP values can be useful for decoding how machine learning and parametric methods may assign relative importance to a given predictor, thereby increasing interpretability of a model. In an instance where models are classifying lakes based on a priori hypothesized relationships, SHAP values across predictors should correspond to the a priori hypothesized relationships. For example, oligotrophic lakes are generally characterized as having high blue reflectance relative to red and green, and in a case where models reflect this understanding, SHAP values should attribute an oligotrophic classification to high values in the relative blue reflectance. Consistently high attributions for blue reflectances should subsequently result in high overall feature importance when discriminating oligotrophic lakes. When evaluating feature importance across trophic states, measured as the mean absolute SHAP value of a given feature, all models agreed on the most influential features for classification (Figure S11). Furthermore, the distribution of SHAP values reflected limnological understanding of each trophic state’s inherent properties. For dystrophic lakes, SHAP values indicate that models relied on low green and high near-infrared and red band values, corroborating the idea that dystrophic lakes should have lower primary production and increased cDOM22,59 (Figure S11). Predictions for eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes were attributed to high red and low blue band values, corresponding with the idea that eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes should have higher algal production24 (Figure S11). Conversely, SHAP values for oligotrophic lakes attributed predictions to low red and high blue band values, agreeing with the idea that oligotrophic lakes should have lower algal production24 (Figure S11). Beyond each individual trophic state’s most important predictors, our SHAP analysis mirrored the logic of NCP analyses, where lakes with lower true color values (i.e., oligotrophic and eutrophic) were discriminated more effectively by bands associated with autotrophic capacity, whereas lakes with higher true color values (i.e., dystrophic) were discriminated more effectively by bands suggesting decreased autotrophic production and increased colored dissolved organic matter. SHAP values can also provide insight on what drives models to misclassify certain lakes. Specifically, when examining smaller, shallower oligotrophic lakes that could potentially be influenced by bottom reflectance or adjacency effects, we observed that some misclassifications were attributable to models relying on low relative blue reflectance and high relative near-infrared reflectance (Figures S12–S23). These patterns indicate that in certain lakes, the models were unable to distinguish the spectral signatures that are potentially attributable to sediment or benthic algae as well as shoreline vegetation and soil. The spectral similarity between shallow oligotrophic and deep eutrophic lakes is relevant to active research trajectories in limnology, particularly those examining the relatively high contributions of benthic algal communities to whole lake productivity in oligotrophic lakes58,60,61,62,63,64. Given the potential for lakebed effects to alter classifications, research questions could consider the influence of depth-related misclassifications. Comparing predicted and NLA spatial patterns To independently validate the LTS-US dataset’s robustness in capturing macroscale and multi-year changes in lake trophic state, we replicated analyses similar to Leech et al.24 and compared statistics from the NLA with those from the LTS-US dataset. We first merged the lake trophic state classifications from the 2007, 2012, and 2017 NLA campaigns as well as the LTS-US dataset with the U.S. EPA Level I Ecoregions30. We then calculated the proportion of each trophic state occurring within each ecoregion in a given year. To compare the NLA and the LTS-US dataset, we calculated the absolute difference between predicted and estimated proportions for each trophic state within each year and ecoregion. Predicted and measured proportions were broadly consistent across all three years. Visually, all three years and trophic states followed consistent trends across all ecoregions (Fig. 8). For example, our models generally captured increasing dystrophic and decreasing oligotrophic lakes in northern forested regions, a pattern consistent with Leech et al.24. Absolute differences between estimated and predicted proportions across ecoregions were likewise congruent across all three years. Eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes tended to have the smallest differences (mean = −5.3%, sd = 19%), indicating that our models may overestimate relative abundance of eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes (Figure S24). In contrast, dystrophic (mean = 7.0%, sd = 6.7%) and oligotrophic (mean = 7.6%, sd = 22.4%) relative abundance tended to be underestimated (Figure S24). Larger standard deviation values were caused by some ecoregions having few lakes overall, thereby increasing proportions of a given trophic state within an ecoregion. When filtering for ecoregions that contained at least 10 lakes, we noticed similar patterns of eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes being slightly overestimated (mean = −7.9%, sd = 11.3%), as well as dystrophic (mean = 9.1%, sd = 6.7%) and oligotrophic (mean = 4.6%, sd = 13.8%) lakes being underestimated; yet the standard deviation in absolute differences decreased. Fig. 8 National-scale maps of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Level I Ecoregions colored by proportion of lakes occurring in that ecoregion. For each trophic state, we compare estimated trophic state relative abundance from the NLA with predicted proportions from the ensemble LTS-US dataset. Full size image Together, these analyses demonstrate that though the LTS-US dataset does contain biases towards eutrophic/mixotrophic classification, its overall congruence with the NLA highlights its robustness. These biases may stem from our models attempting to classify lake ecosystem properties based on optically visible (i.e., color) and optically invisible (i.e., phosphorus) properties, where the exceptionally oligotrophic, dystrophic, and eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes are more consistently discriminated. In contrast, the NLA may likewise contain biases due to site selection, whereas our methods select for all lakes of at least 10 ha in area. Regardless of the biases in the LTS-US and NLA datasets, the congruence between the two is even more notable considering that our modeling approaches and the NLA use independent methods for classifying lake trophic state. The NLA uses in situ total phosphorus and true color measurements, whereas our methods use lake red, green, blue, and near-infrared reflectance. Furthermore, despite not including temporal or spatial predictors, our models reproduce NLA spatial and temporal trends in lake trophic state at larger spatial and temporal scales. Given both the potential biases and robustness of the LTS-US data product, cross-referencing the LTS-US dataset with known trends in an area of interest, especially in areas where lakes may be less abundant, could enhance regional and local analyses. In instances where the LTS-US dataset may be more biased, reproducing the LTS-US dataset using both our existing code and particular predictors of interest for a region, such as average depth, lake area, or watershed area could offer particular insights into why a given region may be more prone to misclassifications. Creating tailored versions of the core LTS-US dataset can promote further understanding of features that may be important for assessing lake trophic state with remotely sensed surface reflectance data. Manual quality control To ensure integrity of lake classifications across all steps of our pipeline, we randomly subsampled 250 lakes from the final dataset and manually cross-referenced their predicted trophic state with independent sources. The random subsample only included lakes that had associated names in the HydroLAKES dataset and was stratified by lake surface area, where surface areas were binned by orders of magnitude (i.e., <1 km2, (1, 10] km2, (10, 100] km2, (100, 1,000] km2, (1,000, 10,000] km2, >10,000 km2). We filtered specifically for lakes with names because we assumed that named lakes within the HydroLAKES database would likely have more publicly available information about their water quality and would likely be easier to find within managerial reports and scientific publications. To minimize bias, persons engaged in manual checking only received lake latitude and longitude, name, and the U.S. state where the lake was located. All persons engaged in manual checking were not involved in model and prediction development and were, therefore, blind to individual lake predictions. When possible, persons identified trophic states for multiple years, although many sources only referenced a lake’s trophic state in an individual year or broadly across multiple years. In either case, LTS was reported for the lake and years that independent sources reported. Of the 250 target lakes, we were able to find verified trophic state data on 93 lakes (38%). For the 93 lakes that had independent lake trophic state data, our models corroborated independent, in situ observations 74% of the time, which is consistent with our models’ overall accuracy against testing data from the U.S. EPA NLA. We did not observe any apparent spatial patterns with model misclassification, which complements our spatial confusion validation (Figure S25). Together, these results demonstrate that our manual checking procedure returned similar results as our evaluation procedures against our testing data, giving confidence that our modeling pipeline and evaluation procedures are both robust and able to capture natural processes occurring in lakes. Effects of processor heterogeneity When recreating lake trophic state predictions de novo, care should be taken to ensure that effects from heterogeneous processors are minimized. When creating the LTS-US dataset from the original LimnoSat-US dataset35, we specified seeds for each modeling framework, which enabled us to reproduce results between model runs. Final dataset production occurred on one machine using an Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-10885M processor with eight cores, however, slight differences may arise due to differences in a user’s hardware float precision. If users recreate or update LimnoSat-US prior to recreation of the LTS-US predictions, care should be taken as Google Earth Engine65 uses a heterogeneous processor framework, where individual processors cannot currently be specified. Meyer et al.9 quantified the effect of Google Earth Engine’s processor heterogeneity on various lake surface area and basin-level climatological estimations, and effects of processor heterogeneity were likely inconsequential (e.g., differences of 10−12), although these differences may result in slightly different trophic state predictions. The extent to which these values would influence results or conclusions of other studies will depend on the level of precision required and scope of research question. Usage Notes The LTS-US dataset was constructed to be an accessible and interoperable product for a range of basic and applied research questions related to water quality and ecological integrity at national scales. Here, we detail several options for application of the LTS-US dataset and associated pipeline. First, the LTS-US dataset can be joined with water quantity and quality datasets to assess how changes in LTS, and therefore ecosystem integrity, may be influenced by watershed processes, climate, and human population. At the local scale, the LTS-US dataset can be merged with in situ sampling data or modeled data from individual lakes to assess how hydrodynamic, climatic, physicochemical, and biological processes may be associated with interannual variation in LTS. As demonstrated here, local in situ observations are important for providing validation of the LTS data, and potentially, refinement of methods for deriving LTS predictions. Similarly, the LTS-US dataset can be merged with data from research coordination networks, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (www.neonscience.org) or the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network66, to enable upscaling highly localized processes to regional and national scales. Beyond watershed-specific processes, the LTS-US dataset can likewise be useful for synthetic questions focused on macroscale water quality trends. For example, in cases where users may wish to synthesize changes in lake ecosystem metabolism with trends in lake water quantity, climate, and human population, the LTS-US dataset can be merged with the GLCP (Global Lake area, Climate, and Population)9 or LakeATLAS67, thereby enabling users to assess how changes in seasonal and permanent lake surface area may correlate with changes in lake trophic state. The LTS-US dataset offers a valuable resource for addressing a broad spectrum of basic and applied research questions from local and regional to continental scales. Second, the LTS-US dataset provides a tool for using remote sensing products with the NCP, a framework increasingly used by limnologists, to understand lake water quality at macroscales. Although previous studies have remotely sensed lake trophic state index68, our data product is the first to incorporate NCP with remote sensing reflectance data. Where TSI focuses exclusively on eutrophication patterns (also known as greening) associated with nutrient-driven primary production, the LTS-US dataset enables investigations of the spatial extent and temporal trends of lake dystrophication (also known as lake browning). This difference between TSI and NCP is important for assessing long term and spatially extensive changes in lake browning, as well as “murkification” (i.e. simultaneous browning and greening), which has been associated with complex, often non-linear changes in temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and food web structure24,59. Further, national-scale sampling campaigns, such as the U.S. EPA NLA, have helped reveal that the proportion of dystrophic lakes has been increasing nationally since 200724. The U.S. EPA NLA is one of the most extensive, structured, and coordinated lake sampling efforts at the national scale, and the LTS-US dataset can complement these in situ data by providing finer temporal information at comparable spatial scales. When data from successive NLA sampling campaigns become available, the LTS-US dataset can be updated and further benefit from additional training data. Together, the use of remote sensing imagery with extensive sampling campaigns, like the NLA, can be useful for identifying broadscale changes in water quality. Third, although our reflectance data are spatially aggregated to represent each lake’s characteristic summertime reflectances, our data pipeline and modeling frameworks are amenable to numerous data aggregations, thereby enabling investigation of lakes’ intra- and inter-annual phenologies. For example, many oligotrophic lakes experience summertime greening, due to increased algal growth throughout the summer. Although algal succession tends to follow similar temporal and community compositional patterns69,70, users may be interested in understanding how greening events may shift temporally in response to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances. Similarly, end users may be interested in understanding intra-lake heterogeneities, where embayments or nearshore areas may differ in trophic state from the offshore. In both cases, users could adapt our data, modeling, and validation pipeline, where temporal and spatial resolution are more finely resolved. Operationally, end users could modify the aggregation scripts (“1_aggregate.R” and “aggregate_utils.R”)54 and LimnoSat codes35 to accommodate input data that aggregate at monthly or fortnightly timesteps as well as on a per-pixel basis or with varying radii lengths from the Chebyshev center. Because our data pipeline allows for automated re-running of all harmonization, modeling, and quality control routines, users are able to build off the existing infrastructure to tailor the LTS-US dataset to their particular research questions without high computational overhead or the need to build new workflows de novo. Beyond any specific research question, the LTS-US dataset is a streamlined resource for many end users looking to incorporate remote sensing and its derived products into their analyses. Because of the dataset’s interoperability and flexible structure, the LTS-US dataset serves as a powerful resource for evaluating and contextualizing aquatic ecosystem change at local-to-national spatial as well as annual-to-decadal temporal scales. Code availability All data harmonization, modeling, and validation procedures for the LTS-US dataset54 were scripted in the R Statistical Environment71, using the tidyverse72, lubridate73, data.table74, sf75, keras76, tensorflow77, caret78, CAST79, yaml80, reticulate81, xgboost82, nnet47, viridis83, trend84, multiROC85, ggpubr86, fastshap87, maps88, ggtext89, and ggforce90 packages. To enhance reproducibility, all scripts are designed to work within a single pipeline that uses the targets package91. The targets pipeline is divided into four main components: “1_aggregate”, “2_train”, “3_predict”, and “4_qc”. Each component corresponds to one of the steps presented above and can be customized by users to fit their specific needs. The associated pipeline setup and user guide can be found on the Environmental Data Initiative54, where the “README_targets.pdf” file details directory architecture and how to execute the pipeline. When downloading the “scripts.zip” folder to access the targets pipeline, future users should be aware that empty files within the directory are necessary for running the pipeline, as those folders will become populated each time the pipeline is run. To ensure reproducibility across operating platforms, all scripts for the pipeline can be executed within a container. Running the pipeline within the container allows users to execute the entire pipeline without the need to make small, yet important, edits to the code, or to configure their own operating environment to conform to the pipeline’s requirements. For example, recent versions of the sf package default to using the s2 spherical geometry engine instead of the Graphic Environment Operating System (GEOS), which assumes planar coordinates. End users on a system with one version of the sf library might need to adjust the code to use the correct geometry engine, whereas users with another version might be able to run the pipeline without any adjustments. The container crystallizes a known-working set of libraries, both at the system level (e.g., GEOS, GDAL, PROJ) and at the R level (e.g., sf), so that anybody can run the code without reconfiguring their own environment. This also provides future proofing by ensuring that the inevitable changes to other libraries over time do not lead to errors. To help end users, who are less familiar with running containerized code, a tutorial for installing and executing the pipeline within the container is located in the Environmental Data Initiative repository as a compressed entity (see “README_container.pdf”)54. The EDI repository also contains both a rendered (“lake_trophic_status_docker_image.tar.gz”; ~3.5 GB) and unrendered (“lts_container.zip”; ~4.0 KB) docker image. While the document “README_container.pdf” details information for running both the rendered and unrendered images, future users can choose either format depending on their familiarity with rendering Docker images and their capacity to download larger Docker images.

These networks consist of low-resource sensors that produce streaming data requiring online processing. However, since data outliers can occur, it’s important to identify and classify them as errors or events using outlier detection and classification techniques. In this paper, we propose a new and enhanced approach for online outlier detection and classification in WSNs. Our approach is titled SA-O2DCA for Seasonal Adapted Online Outlier Detection and Classification Approach. SA-O2DCA, combines the benefits of the K-means algorithm for clustering, the Iforest algorithm for outlier detection and the Newton interpolation to classify the outliers. We evaluate our approach against other works in literature using multivariate datasets. The simulation results, which encompass the assessment of our proposed approach using a combination of synthetic and real-life multivariate datasets, reveal that SA-O2DCA is stable with fewer training models number and outperforms other works on various metrics, including Detection Rate, False Alarm Rate, and Accuracy Rate. Furthermore, our enhanced approach is suitable for working with seasonal real-life applications as it can dynamically change the Training Model at the end of each season period.

These systems have resource-limited sensors that collect environmental data, such as temperature and humidity. However, due to harsh deployment environments and the inherent limitations of sensors, WSNs and IoT systems are vulnerable to various forms of abnormal behaviour. Such anomalies can severely impact the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, ultimately affecting the applications dependent on them. In WSNs, an outlier refers to a data point that deviates significantly from the expected pattern of collected data [1]. These outliers can originate from various sources, including errors and noise, events, and malicious attacks, as described in [2]. Outlier detection approaches can be categorized based on different criteria, such as whether they target outliers or events, whether they operate online or offline, and whether they are supervised or unsupervised, distributed or centralized [2]. In our research, we focus specifically on online outlier detection. Therefore, to mitigate such issues, outlier detection techniques have been developed for IoT and WSN applications to monitor abnormal behavior and identify and classify outliers in real-time. This is essential in applications where timely decision-making is crucial, such as the following use cases: Healthcare monitoring: In healthcare applications, WSNs are used to monitor patients’ vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. Detecting outliers in real-time can help identify critical events or errors in the collected data, enabling healthcare professionals to take immediate action. Industrial monitoring: WSNs are deployed in industrial settings to monitor various parameters like temperature, pressure, and vibration. Outlier detection can help identify anomalies that may indicate equipment malfunction or potential risks, allowing for proactive maintenance and preventing costly downtime. Smart cities: WSNs play a crucial role in smart city applications, monitoring environmental factors, traffic conditions, and energy consumption. Real-time outlier detection can help identify abnormal patterns or events, such as pollution spikes or traffic congestion, enabling efficient management and resource allocation. Our work is primarily motivated by considering the real-time Decision-making in such applications. Offline detection techniques are insufficient as they cannot process streaming data in real-time. Therefore, there is a need for an approach that can detect and classify outliers online, ensuring data quality and enabling timely decision-making. Secondly, while various solutions have been proposed for online outlier detection, they cannot often consider the correlations between sensor data vectors and provide a real-time classification of errors and events. Including correlation information can help identify the origin of outliers, distinguishing between erroneous data that can be discarded and actual events in the physical world that require decision-making. The proposed SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach aims to address this limitation by considering the spatial-temporal relationships among sensor data vectors. Thirdly, WSNs collect data from multiple sensors, resulting in multivariate data. Many existing approaches struggle to handle such data effectively. The SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach addresses the specific requirements of the previous use cases by providing online outlier detection and classification capabilities, considering correlations between different multivariate data attributes, and enabling dynamic adaptation to seasonal variations in the data. Some existing works address these challenges but still operate offline or need more enhancements. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced approach of our previous work O\\(^2\\)DCA [3], for online clustering, outlier detection, and classification in WSNs. Our new approach, named SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, consists of two main systems: the CDC (Clustering, Detection, Classification) system, which comprises two key phases—training and online—and the monitoring system. For the training phase of the CDC system, we build an initial \\(TM_{0}\\) or a set of seasonal training models STM = \\(\\{TM1, TM2,... TMs\\}\\) in an offline manner. The goal of \\(TM_{0}\\) is to cluster an initial set of data vectors and detect and classify the outliers using different input parameters (cluster radius w and the number of nearest neighbours K) to reach the highest Detection Rate (DR) and the False Alarm Rate (FAR) performance metrics. This \\(TM_{0}\\) will be used later in the online phase to cluster the new coming streaming real-life data vectors. Our approach can also able to use a set of seasonal training models and change between them dynamically at the end of each season period. Within the CDC system, we consider the correlation of sensor data in both time and space. We aim to identify the origin of the outliers, distinguishing between erroneous data that can be discarded and actual events in the physical world that require a decision. The CDC system will alert the monitoring system for every detected error or event. The monitoring system will check the received alerts, process them and send different feedback information. To evaluate SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, we conduct a simulation test, where our approach uses the current \\(TM_{0}\\) until the DR performance changes and is less than a predefined threshold \\(\\alpha\\). In such case, we build a new TM and continue working online. We also conduct another simulation test, where our approach uses the first TM in the set STM and can change the TM dynamically at the end of each season. Our approach can also change the current TM and build a new one if the level of DR is less than a predefined threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) or the FAR is greater than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Our evaluation focused on the DR and FAR performance metrics, specifically in the context of multivariate data. Our simulation results, using a combination of synthetic and real-life multivariate datasets, show that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms not only our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach but also other approaches from the literature. Additionally, our enhanced approach maintains stable performance across a range of \\(\\alpha\\) values even with fewer required \\(TM_{s}\\). The main contribution of this paper can be synthesized as: we introduce SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, a novel and advanced approach for online outlier detection and classification in WSNs. Our approach utilizes an initial TM that is dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of newly arriving streaming data vectors. We also developed our new approach to work with seasonal real-life applications where it can change the TM dynamically at the end of each season period. Our evaluation involves a comparative analysis of the performance of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA against O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] and two other approaches [4] proposed in the literature. We assess the performance of these approaches using several performance metrics, including DR, FAR, and ACC. Our methodology considers the spatial-temporal relationships among sensors multivariate data vectors to distinguish between erroneous and event-based outliers. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, is the first to incorporate adaptive TM changing and dynamic adaptation to seasonal data in online outlier detection and classification solutions for WSNs. The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the related works concerning online outlier detection in WSNs. Algorithms used in our proposed approach and its architecture are presented in Sect. 3. We provide the results of our evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets in Sect. 4, where we examine various performance metrics. Finally, we conclude the paper in Sect. 5. 2 Related Work Online outlier detection refers to identifying and flagging outliers in real-time or near real-time as data streams are generated. Such a process is essential for several WSN applications, where it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify and classify anomalous behaviours to respond to them effectively. On the other hand, offline outlier detection is the process of identifying outliers in a dataset after it has been collected. This type of outlier detection is commonly employed when dealing with massive amounts of data, as it allows for more thorough analysis and can provide more accurate results. However, it is unsuitable for applications requiring immediate outlier detection and classification. The literature offers several approaches for online outlier detection in WSNs. This section discusses relevant works in this domain, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In [5], a novel approach for outlier identification in WSNs was introduced. The proposed method leverages the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and consists of two main modules. The first module focuses on parameter computation, specifically determining the minimum radius threshold (\\(\\epsilon\\)) for accepting a cluster. The second module handles class identification within a spatial-temporal dataset, enabling the detection of outliers. In [6], an approach for identifying outliers and events in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) was proposed. This approach utilized the OPTICS clustering algorithm that eliminates the need for manual configuration or a predefined number of clusters. The experimental results demonstrated that their approach achieved high outlier detection and event identification accuracy while maintaining a low rate of false classification between errors and events. In [7], the authors developed a new classification model that combines deep belief networks with the Online Quarter-Sphere One-Class Support Vector Machines (QSOC-SVMs). This model is designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of outlier detection in high-dimensional and large-scale datasets, such as those typically gathered by WSNs. Their model uses a sorting method to learn the quarter sphere radius during the training phase and then uses this information to classify data values as outliers or non-outliers during the unsupervised testing phase. In [8], the authors introduced an unsupervised algorithm for real-time anomaly detection in continuous data sequences. They utilized the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm, which is an online sequence memory algorithm that can continuously learn and model the spatial-temporal characteristics of its inputs. However, HTM does not directly model anomalies or provide an anomaly score. To address this issue, the authors computed a measure of prediction error based on the HTM network output and used a probabilistic model to calculate the likelihood of the system being in an anomalous state. A threshold was then applied to this likelihood value to determine whether an anomaly was present. In [9], authors proposed an online density-based approach for outlier detection on big data. Their approach is based on computing the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and it has two main steps. First, the Grid-Based Partitioning (GBP) algorithm divides the data into grids and assigns them to the distributed nodes in the network. This allows outlier detection to be performed in parallel, which is essential for dealing with large and high-dimensional datasets. Second, the Distributed LOF Computing (DLC) algorithm is used to detect density outliers in each grid partitions. This algorithm is designed to be efficient and scalable, and it can effectively handle high-dimensional data without requiring a large amount of network resources. In [10], authors proposed a new timely fog computing outlier detection method for IoT systems. Their method is designed to overcome the high latency of centralised approaches and the high energy consumption of distributed ones. Their proposed method sends all data values directly to the fog nodes for outlier detection. This eliminates the need for multi-hop transmission and allows efficient and low-latency outlier detection. The authors proposed two algorithms for outlier detection: the Ellipsoidal Neighbourhood Outlier Factor (ENOF), which is based on the LOF algorithm, and the Hyper-ellipsoidal clustering algorithm (HyCARCE). The ENOF algorithm is designed for high efficiency and low computation cost, while the HyCARCE algorithm solves the problem of prior knowledge of cluster parameters by automatically choosing them. Together, these algorithms provide a flexible and effective approach for outlier detection in IoT systems. In [11], the authors proposed a one-time framework for detecting outliers with a request. Their framework consists of two primary phases: the offline phase and the online phase. In the offline phase, they employ the K-Medoids algorithm to cluster the data points within the dataset. They also use a density-based outlier factor to identify the normal and outlier clusters. In the online phase, they use the clustering information and the detected outliers to detect the newly arrived outliers on the fly based on specific requests. This allows the framework to quickly and accurately detect outliers in the dataset. In [12], the authors proposed an Optimised Adaptive and Sliding Windowing (OASW) framework for anomaly detection in IoT data streams. Their framework is designed to adapt to the changing patterns of online IoT data streams, using the fast and high-performance LightGBM machine learning model and the drift adaptation concept. The OASW framework is a combination of sliding and adaptive window-based methods and performance-based methods. It is designed to efficiently and effectively detect anomalies in IoT data streams, and it consists of two stages: the first stage involves offline learning to obtain an initial trained model, while the second stage focuses on online training to identify IoT attacks in real-time data streams. In [13], the authors proposed a fully distributed General Anomaly Detection (GAD) scheme for real-time anomaly detection. This scheme uses the principles of graph theory and takes advantage of the spatial-temporal correlations of processes to achieve fast and accurate anomaly detection. However, the GAD scheme cannot detect anomalous events that consist of a series of related unusual behaviours that reflect changes in those behaviours. This type of anomaly, which may be particularly interesting in some applications, cannot be detected by the GAD scheme. In [14], the authors proposed a Performance Weighted Probability Averaging Ensemble (PWPAE) framework for detecting anomalies in data streams generated by IoT devices. Their framework is designed to be drift adaptive, meaning that it can adapt to changes in the data distribution over time, which is a common challenge in the field of data stream mining. It combines two drift detection methods, ADaptive WINdowing (ADWIN) and Drift Detection Method (DDM), with two drift adaptation methods token from literature to construct base classifiers, which are then combined into a single ensemble model using a weighting scheme based on their real-time performance. They prove that their framework achieves high accuracy in detecting IoT attacks. In [15], the authors have employed a modified Hampel Identifier (HI) algorithm for real-time detection of temporal outliers and have merged it with a Gaussian process (GP) model and a graph-based outlier detection technique to enhance the algorithm’s ability to detect spatial outliers. The GP model enables the algorithm to consider the spatial relationships among data points, while the graph-based outlier detection technique identifies outliers that may not be apparent when considering individual data points independently. The proposed approach effectively detects temporal and spatial outliers in real-time, with a high accuracy identification rate and low resource requirements. In [16], the authors have suggested implementing real-time anomaly detection in telemetry data using streaming machine learning techniques. They have utilized the DenStream method, an unsupervised clustering technique, to process data as it is being generated in real-time instead of relying on offline processing of vast amounts of data. They have also conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of DenStream with other online and offline algorithms such as DBScan, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), ExactSTORM, Continuous Outlier Detection (COD), and Robust Random Cut Forest (RRCF). The experimental results have shown that DenStream performs as well as RRCF, which is the best-performing algorithm, in terms of detection outcomes, and is significantly faster than the other approaches, particularly RRCF. In [3], the authors proposed a centralized approach, named O\\(^2\\)DCA, for online outlier detection and classification in WSN. O\\(^2\\)DCA considers the spatial-temporal relationships between sensor data vectors and their neighbouring sensor nodes to distinguish between errors caused by sensor malfunctions and errors caused by events. The approach combines the distributed Fixed Width Clustering (FWC) and Inter Cluster Distance (ICD) algorithms for clustering and outlier detection, respectively. Additionally, the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method is used for classification. Simulation results showed that the proposed approach outperforms the offline approach and is suitable for real-life applications where the DR performance metric remains stable and better. In [17], the authors introduce a novel approach to enhance the security of wireless sensor WSNs by proposing a new Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a deep learning model. Emphasizing optimal cluster head (CH) selection among sensor nodes, the method considers energy levels, delay, and distance. The innovative Self-Improved Sea Lion Optimization (SI-SLnO) model is introduced for optimal CH selection. The paper advocates a multidimensional two-tier hierarchical trust model, evaluating content trust, honesty trust, and interactive trust for both CH and nodes. Intrusion detection is performed using a deep learning-based approach with an optimized neural network trained by the SI-SLnO algorithm. The paper concludes by evaluating the proposed approach against existing techniques, showcasing its potential for improving WSN security. In [18], the authors address in their survey the challenges posed by mobile nodes in the context of the IoT. With IoT nodes generating substantial data that requires seamless indexing for storage and processing, the mobility of nodes introduces complexities. Existing indexing techniques for mobile environments are deemed inadequate due to data transmission from diverse locations over varying time periods and the randomness of sensor movement. The survey aims to elucidate the relationship between activities of mobile sensors in IoT, focusing on data transfer, collection, and the effectiveness of indexing techniques. By exploring meta-heuristic, spatial-temporal indexing, and prediction model approaches, the review investigates the challenges affecting indexing effectiveness in mobile IoT nodes. The analysis delves into features, limitations, and requirements, providing insights into the behavior of mobile environments. The survey concludes by highlighting overlooked or unknown open issues in the domain. In [19], the authors propose a distributed algorithm for detecting dynamic environmental phenomena using mobile WSNs. The algorithm assumes there is no centralized server to collect and aggregate sensor data. Instead, the sensors self-organize into groups, with a few sensors elected as group heads (GHs). Each group of sensors detects phenomena locally, and the GHs communicate the detected information among themselves to detect global phenomena. The paper also introduces two GH election algorithms and an optimization technique to reduce energy costs. The proposed algorithms and methods are validated through experiments using the NS2 network simulator. The paper contributes a distributed algorithm, GH election algorithms, and an optimization technique to reduce energy costs in detecting environmental phenomena in mobile WSNs. In summary, we can say that several online outlier detection approaches are used in literature in WSNs and IoT. However, most of these works suffer from one or many of the following limitations: According to [5,6,7, 9, 10], and [11], the first limitation of their works is the lack of emphasis on exploring the correlation between sensors’ data vectors for outlier and event identification in the environment. Except for the O\\(^2\\)DCA work [3], which we reference for comparison. Although [8, 12, 13] have examined the correlation, they did not use its properties to differentiate between errors and events. The two baseline approaches proposed in the literature [5] and [6] are also referenced for comparison with our new approach. The selected approaches have been recognized as commonly used techniques in the literature, where they are online and manipulate the three different phases. Additionally, they have only detected one sensor outlier and only some events were detected without exploring correlations. The dataset used in that study was univariate and did not accurately represent the features of real-life WSNs applications. Another limitation highlighted in previous research, such as [9] and [10], is that their works can only provide an outlier score and may not detect all outliers promptly or distinguish between errors and events. Furthermore, the approach proposed in [11] only detects outliers upon request. A third limitation observed in previous studies, such as [11] and [12], is the lack of sufficient feedback information to facilitate adaptive changes in the TM of the online system. Except for the O\\(^2\\)DCA work [3], which we reference for comparison. In the case of [13], the authors have examined the spatial-temporal correlations and differentiated between novelties and anomalies using a univariate dataset without providing feedback information to the online system. One potential drawback in our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work [3] is the inability to dynamically adapt the TM to the streaming data and the use of the FWC clustering algorithm which forms fixed-size clusters using a fixed-width parameter w. However, the algorithm’s performance is sensitive to the selection of this parameter. If the chosen value of w is too small, the algorithm may generate an excessive number of small clusters, while if it is too large, it may produce too few large clusters. Thus, selecting an appropriate value of w is crucial for the FWC algorithm to operate effectively. However, determining the appropriate value of w can be challenging in practical scenarios, particularly for datasets with high dimensionality or clusters with varying densities or shapes. The K-means used in our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach is a centralised algorithm, different from the distributed FWC used in our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work. The shortcomings of previous studies have motivated us to develop a new online approach that utilizes a multivariate dataset for clustering, outlier detection, and classification of errors and events over time. This approach exploits the correlation properties of sensor data vectors and employs adaptive processing through various TM. We have used both real-life and seasonal real-life WSN streaming data to evaluate our approach. 3 SA-O2DCA Architecture The SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA consists of two main systems like O\\(^2\\)DCA: the CDC (Clustering, Detection, Classification) system with two main phases (training and online) and the monitoring system. Figure 1 gives a detailed flow chart of our CDC and monitoring systems. In what follows, we describe the two phases of the CDC and monitoring systems. Fig. 1 A detailed flow chart of our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach Full size image 3.1 The CDC System The first phase of the CDC system involves building a set of offline seasonal training models STM. These models aim to cluster an initial set of seasonal data vectors and detect and classify the outliers using different input parameters, like the number of nearest neighbours K and the optimal clusters number N, that give the highest DR and the lowest FAR performance metrics. For that, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to group data vectors of each sensor in a centralised manner into clusters, where each data vector will be in a cluster with a radius w. After that, the base station executes the Iforest outlier detection method to identify the existing outliers. Finally, the classification of detected outliers into errors and relevant events is performed using the Newton interpolation and KNN methods. As a result, we have a set of training model STM where each TM in this set corresponds to a set of clusters C, so for the STM: STM = \\(\\{TM1, TM2,... TMs\\}\\) set we have another set TC: TC = \\(\\{C1, C2,... Cs\\}\\), a determined value of K and the optimal clusters’ number N which is calculated automatically for each TM in STM, that we can use in the online phase. The second phase of the CDC system is the online phase, where we use the first TM in the set STM to cluster the new streaming data vectors. The DR and the FAR performance metrics used to evaluate our approach are defined in (5 and 6) respectively. In this phase, the base station executes our new online outlier detection and classification Algorithm 1 using the first TM in the set STM. We start to work in an online manner, where we calculate the Euclidean distance (1) between the current newly arrived real-life streaming data vector and each cluster existing in the first C in the set TC. After that, we add this data vector to the nearest cluster based on the calculated Euclidean distance. We consider this data vector an outlier if we cannot add it to any existing cluster. $$\\begin{aligned} d(x,y)= \\sqrt{(y_{1}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-x_{2})^2} \\end{aligned}$$ (1) Our online system continues to receive the coming streaming data vectors and detects the existing outliers. We also differentiate between events and errors. During the online phase, we can send two different alerts to the monitoring system: Alert for an outlier data vector founded and classified as an error. Alert for an outlier data vector founded and classified as an event. Our approach uses the K-means clustering algorithm [20], a centralized and non-parametric approach to partition data into clusters based on their similarity. This algorithm is widely used in data analysis and has applications in various fields, such as outlier detection, image processing, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. Moreover, we employ the Iforest method [21] to identify the outliers, which is a technique for anomaly detection based on binary trees. Additionally, for classification, we use the Newton interpolation method [22] combined with the K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) method to study the correlation between sensors data vectors and classify detected outliers into errors and events using multivariate real-life and synthetic datasets. These algorithms have not been used in our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach [3], and we showed their effectiveness in this study. Our novel approach aims to address the limitations of existing methods in literature by considering correlations between sensor data vectors, providing real-time classification of errors and events, handling multivariate data, and dynamically adapting the Training Model (TM) based on the characteristics of the streaming online data. The choice of K-means, Iforest and Newton algorithms was motivated by their performance in dealing with multivariate online streaming data. The paper highlights the originality and unique contributions of the proposed solution in combining these algorithms to achieve effective online outlier detection and classification approach in WSNs. 3.1.1 K-Means Clustering Algorithm K-means clustering is a technique to partition a set of n data vectors into k clusters. Each cluster is represented by its centroid, which is the mean of all the data vectors in that cluster. Each data vector has m attributes. The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data vector and its closest centroid. Let X = {\\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),..., \\(x_{n}\\)} be a set of n data vectors, where each data vector \\(x_{i}\\) has m attributes. The K-means algorithm can be described mathematically as follows: 1. Initialize k cluster centroids randomly from X: C = {\\(c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\),..., \\(c_{k}\\)} \\(\\subset\\) X. 2. Assign each data vector \\(x_{i}\\) to the closest centroid \\(c_{j}\\), where: j = argmin\\(||\\) \\(x_{i}\\)-\\(c_{j}\\) \\(||\\) \\(^2\\). ArgMin is a mathematical function that returns the argument (i.e., the input value) that minimizes a given function. 3. Recalculate the centroid of each cluster as the mean of all the data vectors assigned to it: $$\\begin{aligned} c_{j} = (1/|S_{j}|) * \\sum x_{i} \\in S_{j} \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where \\(S_{j}\\) is the set of data vectors assigned to cluster j. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer change or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. 3.1.2 Iforest Outlier Detection Method Iforest is a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm used for anomaly detection. It operates by randomly partitioning the data space and isolating anomalies that are more easily separable than normal data vectors. The Iforest algorithm works by constructing a collection of isolation trees, each of which is a binary tree that recursively partitions the data into two subsets based on randomly selected features and split vectors. Anomalies are expected to be isolated in small, highly partitioned data space regions, leading to shorter average path lengths from the root to the leaf nodes of the isolation trees. The anomaly score of a data vector is calculated as the inverse of the average path length, which measures the degree of isolation of the vector. The Iforest algorithm has several advantages over other anomaly detection methods, including its ability to handle high-dimensional data, its efficiency in detecting anomalies, and its robustness to outliers and noise. The Iforest algorithm has been applied to various applications, such as network intrusion detection, fraud detection, and anomaly detection in time-series data. The algorithm can be described mathematically as follows: Given a dataset X = {\\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),..., \\(x_{n}\\)} with n data vectors where each \\(x_{i}\\) is a vector of m attributes, the Isolation Forest algorithm constructs a collection of T binary trees, each of which is built recursively by randomly selecting a feature j from the d features and a split vector p between the minimum and maximum vector of feature j in a sub sample of n data vectors. The data vectors are partitioned into two subsets based on whether their feature j is less than or greater than p, and the process is repeated until each leaf node contains only one data vector or the depth of the tree exceeds a predefined isolation depth c. The anomaly score \\(s_{i}\\) of a data vector \\(x_{i}\\) is calculated as the inverse of the average path length from the root to the leaf nodes of the T trees that \\(x_{i}\\) traverses, normalized by a factor of c: $$\\begin{aligned} s_{i} = 2^{\\frac{-E(h_{i})}{c}} \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where: E(\\(h_{i}\\)) is the average path length from the root to the leaf nodes of the T trees that \\(x_{i}\\) traverses, and cis the isolation depth parameter. Anomalies are expected to have shorter average path lengths and higher anomaly scores than normal data vectors. The threshold vector for anomaly detection can be set based on the desired DR or FAR. 3.1.3 Newton Outlier Classification Method Newton’s interpolation method is a polynomial technique used to approximate a function using a set of data vectors. The polynomial is constructed by using divided differences of the function vectors at the data vectors. In our previous work [22], we use the Newton interpolation method to examine the correlation between neighbouring data vectors in both space and time. This helps us classify detected outliers as either errors or events. The Newton forward difference method is used to estimate the value of a data vector (y)=DV of a node \\(node_i\\) at a specific location (x) using a set of neighbouring independent indexes (\\(x_{i}\\)) and a set of \\(K+1\\) dependent data Vectors (\\(y_{i}\\) = \\(DV_i\\)). We start the process by calculating the KNN to find the K nearest neighbours for all nodes. The differences between these dependent data vectors (\\(y_{1}\\) – \\(y_{0}\\), \\(y_{2}\\) – \\(y_{1}\\),...,\\(y_{K}\\) – \\(y_{K-1}\\)) are referred to as the first forward differences: (\\(\\Delta\\) \\(y_0\\), \\(\\Delta\\) \\(y_1\\),...,\\(\\Delta\\) \\(y_{K-1}\\)). Then, we calculate the interpolated data vector \\(N_i\\): $$\\begin{aligned} N_i = y_0 + u \\Delta y_0 + \\frac{u(u-1)}{2!} \\Delta ^{2} y_0+...+ \\frac{u(u-1)(u-2)(u-K+1)}{K!}\\Delta ^{K} y_0 \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where: u = \\(x_i\\) - \\(x_0\\) and \\(x_i\\), \\(x_0\\) are the indexes of the \\(node_i\\) and its first neighbour. The neighbours’ indexes of \\(node_i\\) is the list [\\(x_0, x_1,..., x_{K-1}\\)]. The neighbours’ data vectors of \\(node_i\\) is the list [\\(DV_0, DV_1,..., DV_{K-1}\\)]. After that, we calculate the difference between the interpolated data vector calculated in Eq. 4\\(N_i\\) and the actual data vector \\(DV_i\\). If the difference is greater than \\(\\epsilon\\), we have an error data vector. Elsewhere we have an event data vector. 3.2 The Monitoring System The monitoring system will check the received alerts from the online system and compare them with the corresponding control data. These control data are stored in the monitoring system and contain information about the validity of the received alerts if they are true or false. The control data lets the adaptive processing unit generate three different feedback information that will be sent back to the CDC system: TPA: True Positive Alert for an outlier data vector received and classified rightly as an error or event. TNA: True Negative Alert for an outlier data vector received but classified badly as an error or event. FPA: False Positive Alert for an outlier data vector received but it is a normal data vector. The monitoring system can send this feedback information to the online system. The CDC system stays working online while receiving feedback information for a TPA. However, the online system will check the DR and FAR performance metrics and verify if it is less than a specific threshold \\(\\alpha\\) when the specified time intervals pass or if it receives TNA or FPA feedback information. If the DR is less than \\(\\alpha _1\\) or the FAR higher than \\(\\alpha _2\\), it builds a new (TM) using the recently stored data vectors (e.g. last 1000 records), where they are more suitable for the current situation and so on. Otherwise, the CDC system stays working in an online manner. If the DR stays higher than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) or the FAR less than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), the CDC system stays working in an online manner until reaching the end of the first season then it changes dynamically to next TM in the set STM. This process is described in the Algorithm 1. The code of our approach is available at [23]. Algorithm 1 SA-O2DCA algorithm Full size image 4 Evaluation and Simulation Results This section presents the results of our MATLAB simulations, which are designed to evaluate our approach’s performance with multivariate datasets. We provide a detailed description of the evaluation scenario and analyze the obtained results. Our simulation assumes a hierarchical network structure, where all sensor nodes are accurately synchronized, and the observed data vectors conform to the same unknown distribution. Furthermore, the nodes are assumed to be deployed in a homogeneous environment. The primary objective of detecting outliers in WSNs is to create efficient techniques that minimize communication overhead and account for resource limitations of sensor nodes, such as memory and battery life. Several performance metrics are employed to assess the efficacy of outlier detection and classification techniques, such as the DR, which is the percentage of abnormal data values accurately identified as outliers as defined in (5), and the FAR, which is the percentage of normal data values incorrectly identified as outliers as defined in (6). Another approach to evaluate outlier detection methods using the ACC, which is the proportion of true detections as defined in (7). We utilize the confusion matrix shown in Table 1 to establish these performance metrics. We specify four distinct scenarios for evaluating the outlier detection phase, which are: True Positive (TP): An outlier is inserted, and the algorithm correctly identifies it. False Positive (FP): Nothing is inserted, but the algorithm identifies an outlier. True Negative (TN): Nothing is inserted, and the algorithm does not identify an outlier. False Negative (FN): An outlier is inserted, but the algorithm does not identify it. Table 1 The online detection phase confusion matrix Full size table $$\\begin{aligned} DR= & {} TP / (TP + FP) \\end{aligned}$$ (5) $$\\begin{aligned} FAR= & {} FP / (FP + TN) \\end{aligned}$$ (6) $$\\begin{aligned} ACC= & {} (TP+TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN) \\end{aligned}$$ (7) It should be acknowledged that there are alternative methods of evaluating outlier detection techniques, such as assessing complexity and computational cost. However, our current study does not take these types of evaluations into account. 4.1 Evaluation Methodology We create the set STM, and we combine two datasets. The first dataset, known as the Real-life DataSet (RDS), is sourced from the Berkeley dataset. It consists of 2.3 million readings from 54 sensors deployed in the Intel Berkeley Research lab between February 28th and April 5th, 2004 [24]. Each data vector, collected every 30 s, contains attributes such as temperature, humidity, light, and voltage. For our experiments, we extract 2000 data vectors with temperature and humidity attributes to construct each TM in the set. The second dataset is a Synthetic DataSet (SDS) created to achieve high detection rate (DR) and low false alarm rate (FAR) performance metrics for the RDS. To generate the SDS, we use a uniformly random generator to introduce a set of errors and events. The SDS comprises 90 outliers, with 60 errors and 30 events. The process of constructing each TM in STM involves four key steps. Firstly, we apply the K-means algorithm to cluster the RDS and obtain a set of clusters C. The number of clusters is determined automatically in advance. Next, we employ the Iforest method to detect outliers in the RDS. In the second step, we use the SDS, which consists of three parts: temperature with added outliers, humidity with added outliers, and control data, to label the data vectors with values (0 for normal, 1 for events, and 2 for errors). We then check if each data vector from SDS belongs to any cluster in C. If it does, we consider it as normal and add it to the corresponding cluster. Otherwise, we identify it as an outlier and output it accordingly. In the third step, we classify each outlier data vector as either an error or an event using Newton and KNN methods. Finally, in the fourth step, we calculate the DR and FAR performance metrics based on the control data of SDS for different numbers of nearest neighbours, denoted as K. As a result, we choose the input parameters (K, C) that give the highest DR and the lowest FAR. These training models STM will be used in the online phase. In addition, we evaluate our CDC system with different values of \\(\\alpha\\), which are accepted to stay in the online phase. If the DR and FAR stay over the specified threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), or the CDC system did not receive any (TNA, FPA) from the monitoring system, so the CDC system stay online and wait until reaching the end of the first season to change the TM dynamically and work with TM2 and so on. Otherwise, we need to build a new TM from the recent coming data. 4.2 Discussion Results The performance of the offline approach is evaluated by computing the DR and FAR performance metrics. These metrics are calculated based on a confusion matrix, which is shown in Table 2. Four different cases are defined for evaluating the offline classification phase: TP: This refers to the situation where the algorithm correctly predicts an event when it is actually present. FP: This refers to the situation where the algorithm predicts the occurrence of an event when, in reality, no event is present. TN: This occurs when the algorithm correctly recognizes the absence of an event and predicts accordingly. FN: This occurs when the algorithm fails to predict an event that is present. Table 2 The online classification phase confusion matrix Full size table In the first experiment, we evaluated SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA in terms of DR, FAR and ACC under varying Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, measured in decibels (dB), as defined in [4]. The SNR values considered in their study encompassed a range of (-30 dB, -20 dB, -10 dB, 0 dB, 10 dB, 20 dB, 30 dB). Each SNR level introduced different magnitudes of outliers into the data. Our objective was to examine the performance of the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach under different levels of outlier presence in the data. To assess the performance, we compared our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach with the O\\(^2\\)DCA approach [3], as well as two other online approaches, namely OPTICS-OD and DBSCAN-OD, introduced in [4] during the detection phase. We employed a confusion matrix, as depicted in Table 1. The results, as shown in Fig. 2, indicated that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved the highest DR across all SNR values, surpassing our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach and the other two approaches. We also observed that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved the lowest FAR, except in comparison to DBSCAN-OD, where DBSCAN-OD exhibited the lowest FAR. Additionally, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved the highest ACC, except in comparison to DBSCAN-OD, where DBSCAN-OD obtained the highest ACC. It is worth noting that the FAR and ACC values we obtained were considered reasonable. Conversely, the FAR and ACC values of OPTICS-OD and DBSCAN-OD appeared unreliable, as it is not plausible to have low DR, very low FAR, and extremely high ACC. Therefore, we can assert that our proposed SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach demonstrated superior performance compared to the other solutions examined. Fig. 2 Performance metrics at the outlier detection phase for the average of all SNR values Full size image In the second experiment, we build \\(TM_{0}\\) using 2000 data vectors with (m = 2) attributes, temperature and humidity. We also use an SDS that contains 90 outliers (60 errors and 30 events). In this experiment, we evaluate the offline approach and calculate the DR and FAR performance metrics. To calculate these metrics, we take the confusion matrix as presented in Table 2. We use the \\(TM_{0}\\) and an SDS of 300 outliers (200 errors and 100 events) as explained in section 4.1. We use the \\(TM_{0}\\) to cluster, detect and classify the complete set of data which contains 10000 data vectors in an offline manner. We get for the offline approach a DR equal to 82% and a FAR equal to 10%. This value allows us to evaluate our online system with different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). In the third experiment, we evaluated SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA regarding DR and FAR performance metrics using the confusion matrix presented in Table 2. We use the \\(TM_{0}\\) to cluster the streaming dataset containing 10000 data vectors. We detect and classify the outlier in the streaming set in an online manner. Table 3 shows the obtained results when evaluating the DR and FAR metrics of O\\(^2\\)DCA and SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches during the online classification phase. We notice that we have nine \\(TM_{s}\\) for our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach and five \\(TM_{s}\\) for our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach, each representing an average of several time intervals. The online system changes the model if the DR is less than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) or FAR is higher than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). These values are equal to the values of DR and FAR resulting from evaluating the offline approach. We notice that for O\\(^2\\)DCA, we have an average DR higher than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and an average FAR less than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for all \\(TM_{s}\\) except for \\(TM_{0}\\), \\(TM_{4}\\) and \\(TM_{5}\\). In these cases, we change them directly at the end of the time interval where we have DR less than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and FAR higher than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Whereas for SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, we have an average DR higher than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and an average FAR less than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for all \\(TM_{s}\\). In addition, with SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA we reach the stable model quickly with less \\(TM_{s}\\) compared to O\\(^2\\)DCA. Table 3 Average DR performance metric for O\\(^2\\)DCA and SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA for different \\(TM_{s}\\) − \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) = 82% and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) = 10% Full size table In the fourth experiment, we take the DR and the FAR values for the offline approach, which is calculated in the second experiment. In Table 4, we show that the DR and FAR metrics of our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach during the online classification phase, for the average of all \\(TM_{s}\\), is better than the DR and FAR of our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach [3] and the offline approach. Table 4 The average DR and FAR performance metrics of all \\(TM_{s}\\) of O\\(^2\\)DCA, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and the offline approach Full size table In the fifth experiment, we evaluated the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches in terms of the DR and FAR performance metrics using different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) (80%, 82%, 85%, 95%) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) (12%, 10%, 8%, 6%). We can see from Fig. 3 that our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach has higher DR than O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] for all the different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\). Fig. 3 The DR for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches for the average of all \\(TM_{s}\\) with different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) Full size image We can also see from Fig. 4 that our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach has lower FAR than O\\(^2\\)DCA for all the different values of \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Fig. 4 The FAR for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches for the average of all the \\(TM_{s}\\) and different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\), \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) Full size image In the sixth experiment, we evaluated the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches regarding the DR and FAR performance metrics using a seasonal dataset of 8000 data vectors that contains four seasons. In this experiment, we build four offline training models \\(\\{TM1, TM2, TM3, TM4\\}\\). In this scenario, we check if the DR stays over the specified threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and FAR stay down the specified threshold \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), or if the CDC system did not receive any (TNA, FPA) from the monitoring system, so the CDC system stays online and wait until reaching the end of the first season to change the training model dynamically and work with \\(TM_{2}\\) and so on. Otherwise, we need to build a new training model from the recent coming data. From Figs. 5, 6, 7, we can see the percentage of the DR, FAR and ACC for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA. We notice that the two approaches have good performance metrics when dealing with the seasonal data with four \\(TM_{s}\\). From Fig. 5, we notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA have higher DR than the specified thresholds \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) for the four seasonal \\(TM_{s}\\). We also notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has higher DR than O\\(^2\\)DCA for all \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 5 DR of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach measured for the seasonal multivariate dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) = 82% Full size image From Fig. 6, we notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA have lower FAR than the specified thresholds \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for the four seasonal \\(TM_{s}\\). We also notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has lower FAR than O\\(^2\\)DCA for all \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 6 FAR of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach measured for the seasonal multivariate dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) = 10% Full size image From Fig. 7, we notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has higher ACC than O\\(^2\\)DCA for the four seasonal \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 7 ACC of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach measured for the seasonal multivariate dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) Full size image To summarize the results, our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms both the offline approach, O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] and two other approaches [4] from the literature in the clustering, detection, and classification phases when worked in an online fashion. In addition, the DR and FAR performance metrics are still stable over specified thresholds, although we use different training models. So, we show the efficiency of our new approach and its ability to work online with both real-life and seasonal real-life multivariate WSN data. 5 Conclusion This paper introduces SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, a novel and effective online approach designed to address outlier challenges in WSNs while achieving high performance. The proposed approach has two central systems, the CDC and the monitoring systems. The CDC system consists of two main phases. In the training phase, we build an initial TM or a set of initial \\(TM_{s}\\) based on the K-means clustering algorithm, Iforest method for outlier detection and Newton interpolation method combined with KNN for outlier classification. In the online phase, we perform online clustering, outlier detection, and classification for the new real-life arrived streaming data vectors using the previous algorithms. The second system is the monitoring system that can check the received alerts from the online system and send different feedback information. Our system can stay online with higher DR, lower FAR and higher classification ACC performance than O\\(^2\\)DCA. It can also change the current training model by building a new one like O\\(^2\\)DCA. Additionally, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA is suitable for real-life seasonal applications where it can change between a set of \\(TM_{s}\\) dynamically at the end of each season. The simulation results obtained from synthetic and real-life multivariate datasets and a seasonal multivariate dataset demonstrated that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms O\\(^2\\)DCA and other existing approaches in terms of DR, FAR and ACC performance metrics. Notably, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieves superior performance while utilizing a smaller number of \\(TM_{s}\\) compared to our previous work, O\\(^2\\)DCA. Also, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA can stay stable with fewer \\(TM_{s}\\) number than the number required by our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work. In our future research, we aim to thoroughly assess our novel online approach by testing it with various clustering algorithms and datasets with high levels of correlation. Additionally, we plan to explore the potential of utilizing deep learning algorithms to facilitate dynamic switching between different \\(TM_{s}\\), enabling the reuse of pre-existing models rather than building new ones. Such a study could enhance our approach’s adaptability and efficiency. References Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V.: Anomaly detection: A survey.

Traditional Device-Cloud protocol in smart agriculture wastes network resources when big data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices are directly transmitted to the cloud server without processing, delaying network connection and increasing costs. Edge computing has emerged to bridge these gaps by shifting partial data storage and computation capability from the cloud server to edge devices. However, selecting which tasks can be applied in edge computing depends on user-specific demands, suggesting the necessity to design a suitable Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS) architecture for single-crop requirements. This study aims to design and implement a cost-saving multilayered SAIS architecture customized for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation toward leveraging edge computing. A three-layer SAIS adopting the Device-Edge-Cloud protocol, which enables the integration of key environmental parameter data collected from the IoT sensor and RGB images collected from the camera, was tested in this research. Implementation of this designed SAIS architecture with typical examples of mushroom cultivation indicated that low-cost data pre-processing procedures including small-data storage, temporal resampling-based data reduction, and lightweight artificial intelligence (AI)-based data quality control (for anomalous environmental conditions detection) together with real-time AI model deployment (for mushroom detection) are compatible with edge computing. Integrating the Edge Layer as the center of the traditional protocol can significantly save network resources and operational costs by reducing unnecessary data sent from the device to the cloud, while keeping sufficient information.

Introduction Nowadays, edible mushrooms are well known as not only a healthy food but also a valuable pharmacy, since they can provide rich nutrients such as protein, minerals, and vitamins as well as increase the human immune system to prevent many diseases, even cancer [1,2]. Therefore, the demand for mushroom products is increasing in the world’s food market, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic [3,4]. Although wild mushrooms can be harvested in the natural environment, their high sensitivity to seasonal variations of weather/climate factors leads to unsustainable production [5,6]. Industrialized mushroom cultivation in the greenhouse offers an alternative strategy to natural cultivation to improve both the quantity and quality of mushroom production because the key environmental parameters affecting mushroom growth can be monitored and controlled. However, the traditional cultivation method based on manual monitoring, controlling, and harvesting involves time-consuming and labor-intensive work which can then increase operational costs, demanding timely, automated, cost-effective, and eco-friendly solutions for the mushroom industry [7,8]. Along with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) when innovative technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data (BD), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been commonly employed in industrial automation, a parallel revolution in agriculture (Agriculture 4.0) boosts automation in farming activities by applying those new technologies to the agriculture sector, so-called smart agriculture/farming (or precision agriculture, digital agriculture, and Agricultural IoT). Although it can contribute to the reduction in labor costs, deploying smart agriculture systems in practice is facing other cost-related problems such as setup costs and running costs [9]. On the one hand, from the users’ point of view, especially in some developing countries where most people working in agriculture are smallholder farmers, they have limited access to modern smart farming infrastructure due to the expensive product prices (setup costs). On the other hand, from the perspective of service developers/providers, smart farming system construction and applications, which are commonly implemented in centralized cloud servers can consume massive resources for BD storage, management, analytics, and security, resulting in higher overall cloud service costs (running costs). Cutting those unnecessary costs is therefore pivotal for many business organizations, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to optimize their smart farming systems toward serving smallholder clients with cost-saving infrastructures. Besides the cloud service costs, traditional smart agriculture systems are often limited by the slow network connection (low bandwidth) between Agricultural IoT devices and cloud servers when all the huge numbers of data collected from the devices are directly sent to the cloud, which then delays the system decisions and hampers real-time applications in smart agriculture (high latency) [10,11,12]. This is a challenge for mushroom cultivation when its key parameters require strict monitoring within short time intervals [13]. Edge computing (including cloudlets, fog, and mobile edge computing) has recently emerged as a promising solution to bridge this connection gap, thanks to the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies as well as hardware capacity. Specifically, an edge computing node can be regarded as a decentralized local server (edge server) that allows for storing a small number of data and bringing data computation closer to the edge devices [14,15,16]. By coupling the edge computing paradigm with a classical Device-Cloud protocol, the original BD is effectively managed in an offline process at the edge server before transmission instead of storing and processing all the collected raw data at the cloud server [17]. This can free up the bandwidth for faster connection and for the cloud server load spent on complicated analytics and applications [16,18]. Despite the wide deployment of edge computing in smart homes and smart cities, it is not very commonplace in smart farming, and thus there is still room for leveraging and improving this paradigm to meet the demands of smart agriculture as well as the greenhouse mushroom industry. Shifting partial work from cloud to edge offers SMEs an effective and cost-saving solution to overcome the issues of excessive bandwidth-cloud utilization and high latency [10]. However, determining which features should be conducted in the edge server highly depends on the specific functional requirements and capacity of each smart farming system [19]. This suggests the necessity to design a proper digital Farm Management Information System (FMIS) architecture assisting smart agriculture applications for the specific farmer’s requirements (e.g., for each different crop) [20,21,22], hereafter the Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS). From the perspective of an SME, Sejong Rain Company in collaboration with Chungnam National University aims to design and implement a low-cost SAIS architecture customized for smart greenhouse mushroom management in association with a paradigm shift to edge computing for business objectives, in this article. This system was tested in a pilot site located in Songsan Green City, Republic of Korea. The advanced Agricultural IoT sensors developed by Korean companies, a standard network flow that is possible for scalability, and edge computing tasks suitable for greenhouse mushroom cultivation, together with examples of how to implement them, were introduced through the proposed SAIS architecture. Finally, a potential SAIS architecture for business purposes in future studies was also suggested, especially for the developing country markets that consider smart agriculture development as the core industry. 2. Background and Related Work 2.1. Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS) The traditional FMIS, which relied on simple farm recordkeeping tasks, has been developed since the 1970s to provide useful information for decision-makers to effectively manage farming activities [23]. However, in the era of Agriculture 4.0 nowadays, the adoption of a traditional FMIS is limited when massive data are provided from the IoT sensors and complex tasks are required for modern farm management [24,25]. To cope with the rapid increase of agricultural data pools and data-driven farming applications, the SAIS, whose cornerstone is the large digital FMIS specialized for precision agriculture, can improve the automation and efficiency in managing enormous amounts of farming information including data collection, data processing, and data-driven decision making [20,25]. Although the core of the SAIS is the multi-layered architecture comprising four basic components of Smart Product, Network Connection, Data, and Smart Service [22], recent studies paid more attention to adapting this core SAIS to the domain-specific uses by breaking it into higher-level architectures, ranging from the classical three- or four-layer up to the advanced seven- or eight-layer architectures. Among the classical architectures, the three-layer one, which corresponds to the two-layer without the Network Layer, refers to the Device-Cloud protocol where the raw data obtained by sensors will be directly transmitted to the cloud for storage, processing, and applications. The four-layer architecture (three-layer without the Network Layer) can allow edge computing to involve those cloud tasks. Integrating a separate layer of edge computing into SAIS architectures is also gaining attraction and possibly becoming a trending paradigm in future studies [17]. Additionally, advanced architectures improved on the classical ones for business objectives by proposing enterprise architecture by adding new layers such as the Business, User, or Security Layers [26]. For more details, the readers are referred to the literature reviews of different multi-layered SAISs in previous studies, summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Literature reviews of multi-layered Smart Agriculture Information Systems. 2.2. Smart Greenhouse Mushroom Cultivation Aside from the benefits for human health and commerce, edible mushrooms are currently becoming the preferred crop for indoor cultivation, even in urban farming, because they are easily relocated, do not require large space and direct sunlight, and need only a short duration until harvesting [35]. However, the major limitation came from the high sensitivity of mushrooms to the surrounding environment, since extreme weather conditions can immediately damage mushroom health. Therefore, the most important task of indoor mushroom cultivation relies on the timely and continuous control of the key environmental parameters’ ideal conditions at every mushroom growing stage [36]. Previous studies listed a wide range of those key parameters [13], but the two most important ones that are worth regarding are air temperature and humidity, while several studies further considered light intensity or carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The ideal ranges for these parameters vary depending on different mushroom species [7,37], and they can be easily, timely, and automatically observed and controlled in the greenhouse using IoT sensors, which have been widely reported in the literature as the common approach for indoor mushroom management. Alongside the development of computer vision and precision agriculture technologies, high-resolution cameras associated with AI-based image processing have been successfully applied in the mushroom industry to enhance management accuracy and efficiency [38]. Current advances improved by combining the advantages of IoT sensors and camera computer vision, which opens a new door for future smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation in particular and smart agriculture in general. Literature reviews of smart greenhouse mushroom management using IoT sensors, cameras, and integrated IoT sensor-camera systems are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Literature reviews of smart greenhouse mushroom management. 3. System Architecture Design Based on the potential of the SAIS with edge computing and the increased need for mushroom products, this study aims to design and implement a multi-layered SAIS architecture with leveraging edge computing for cost-effective smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation. In particular, an integrated IoT environmental sensor-camera system and the oyster mushroom were selected to test in this study. To highlight the capability of coupling the edge computing model to the classical Device-Cloud protocol, a general three-layer SAIS architecture (without the Network Layer), which adopted the Edge Layer as a bridge for the Device and Cloud (Device-Edge-Cloud protocol), was employed. Moreover, we also suggested the integration of a bidirectional (two-way) communication mechanism in this system to separate the network flow into two major domains for different functional tasks, including the Forward and Backward Domains. In each layer, two modules were included to respond to separated functional tasks in the Forward and Backward Domains, respectively. The proposed SAIS architecture applied to greenhouse mushroom management in this paper is depicted in Figure 1. Specifically, according to Figure 1, the Forward Domain enables data transmission from the Device Layer (Data Collecting module) through the Edge Layer for quality control and aggregation (Data Preprocessing module), and then to the Cloud Layer (Data Storage module). In contrast, the Backward Domain allows an inverse direction that AI-based solutions developed at the Cloud Layer using stored data (Data Analytics/AI Development module) to be deployed at the Edge Layer for real-time applications (Real-time AI Deployment module), then to control the ideal conditions of the environmental parameters if necessary via controlling actuators/sensors at the Device Layer (Device Controlling module). The Forward Domain is responsible for the data management and storage tasks while the Backward Domain is responsible for the solutions development and decision-making based on the obtained data. In this study, we describe the proposed architecture following its network flow and focus especially on the Forward Domain, since it is the mainstream in the SAIS. It is important to note that although the Network/Communication Layer which encompasses the protocols for network connection is also important and was already employed in this paper, we did not focus on modifying this layer, so it was not mentioned here as a major layer. A detailed description of the proposed SAIS architecture and its implementation for smart greenhouse mushroom management at the testbed site is provided below. Figure 1. A proposed design of the Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS) architecture for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation. The blue dashed border and arrows indicate the Forward Domain and its procedure, and the red dashed border and arrows indicate the Backward Domain and its procedure. 3.1. Forward Domain–Device Layer The Device Layer is the first layer in this proposed SAIS architecture, which enables a workspace for Agricultural IoT end devices. In this layer, the Data Collecting module is particularly responsible for the Forward Domain. Its detailed architecture is presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. The architecture of the Forward Domain in the Device Layer. Data Collecting: This module aims to collect farming and environmental data observed from the IoT sensors system. Since the integrated IoT environmental sensor-camera system was employed, this module was separated into two sub-modules for better management, consisting of (1) the one-dimensional (1D) Data sub-module which stands for point environmental data collected from the IoT sensors, and (2) the two-dimensional (2D) Data sub-module, which stands for image data collected from the cameras. 1-Dimensional Data (1): This sub-module offers a workspace for the point IoT sensors to collect the environmental data time series. Because temperature, humidity, and CO2 are generally the key environmental parameters for mushroom growth in the literature, they were considered in this system. A three-in-one IoT environmental sensor, which measures automatically and simultaneously the three key parameters of temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and CO2 levels (CO2) in real-time using only one sensor, was adopted in this study. This low-cost combination sensor is a domestic Korean product that was researched and developed by the Sejong Rain Company, Republic of Korea, and is currently being tested before commercialization. Even though this combination sensor can observe real-time data, the maximum 10 min time resolution has been set to be updated in this sub-module. For more information or inquiries on this combination IoT sensor, please refer to the company homepage (http://sejongrain.com/, accessed on 10 January 2024). Its photos and specifications are shown in Figure 3a,b, and Table 3, respectively. Two-Dimensional Data (2): Besides the IoT environmental sensor, this system uses a surveillance camera system to collect crop image/video (time series of RGB images) data, which enhances automation in intuitive recognition of mushroom characteristics (e.g., shapes, colors, species, phenological stages, or related diseases) and was implemented in this sub-module. Specifically, an industrial high-definition (HD 720p) digital camera (model SMT-720PUSBBOX) manufactured by Smtkey Electronic Technology Company, Shenzhen Guangdong, China, was employed to provide streaming images/video of the oyster mushroom. However, to match the temporal resolution of the environmental sensor, the camera system was set to capture image time series at 10 min intervals in single red (R), green (G), and blue (B) bands. A photo of the camera used is shown in Figure 3c and its specifications are presented in Table 4. Figure 3. Photos of the combination IoT environmental sensor: (a) displaying temperature and humidity and (b) displaying CO2 level; and (c) photo of the surveillance camera used in this study. The Korean word in the IoT combination sensor label is the name of the company who develops this device, the Sejong Rain Company, Republic of Korea. Table 3. Specifications of the combination IoT environmental sensor used. Table 4. Specifications of the surveillance camera used. 3.2. Forward Domain–Edge Layer The Edge Layer or edge server is a middle layer in this proposed three-layer SAIS, where edge computing is executed, and is the major part of this study. It is important to note that edge computing is not a replacement for traditional cloud computing, but that it is a complement for cloud computing. Edge computing is normally conducted in low-memory and low-power microprocessors and assigned for small workloads with lightweight computation, which fits in with real-time AI applications. In contrast, cloud computing is compatible with smart solutions requiring BD and heavy computation capacity. Therefore, a powerful, low-energy-consumption, and cost-effective Raspberry Pi single-board computer was used in this study for edge computing in both Forward and Backward Domains. In particular, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, which also provides a high-speed processor suitable for HD video processing and dual connections via both WiFi (wireless) and Ethernet port (wired), was employed in the system. For a more detailed description of its specifications, users are referred to the company’s website (https://www.raspberrypi.com/, accessed on 10 January 2024). The related tasks are shown in the Data Preprocessing module for the Forward Domain, and its architecture is depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4. The architecture of the Forward Domain in the Edge Layer. Data Preprocessing: It is important to note that not all the raw data should be stored in the cloud. Selecting essential data for the cloud can save resources by decreasing cloud and bandwidth workloads. Hence, the main mission of this module is to reduce the number of raw data observed from the Device Layer while keeping data quality before sending them to the Cloud Layer, based on the following sub-modules for preprocessing: Small-Data Storage (1): Since a previous study indicated the effective greenhouse mushroom monitoring on an hourly basis [13], we also set a one-hour (1 h) interval as the standard temporal resolution to be sent to the cloud and for mushroom cultivation in this study. To this end, several raw data should be stored in the Edge Layer for further temporal data resampling and quality control development. Temporal Resampling (2): The temporal resampling applied in this sub-module aims to convert the 10 min raw data into hourly data and relies on a simple Average Filtering method, whereas the six raw data samples within every 1h interval stored in the Small-Data Storage sub-module will be transferred to this sub-module for averaging into one data sample. This method can be applied to both 1D and 2D data in this SAIS and may help it reduce the number of data together with overcoming the temporal gaps (missing data) that occurred at the original 10 min interval. Data Quality Control (3): Despite the benefit of temporal resampling in dealing with the gaps in raw data time series, the resampled data still probably suffer from temporal gaps (when six raw data samples are missing values) or sudden extreme conditions. This requires an AI-based data quality control filter that can not only automatically and continuously detect such outliers in the data stream, but also has a low computational cost when it is applied to the Edge Layer. Even though several lightweight AI models are compatible with edge/fog computing, the well-known k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm was used for showcasing in this research. The k-NN is simply a non-parametric supervised learning method, which considers k samples of training data to solve the classification and regression problems, but it can be regarded as an unsupervised learning algorithm when it is applied to anomaly detection [50]. The k-NN integrated with a 24 h moving window was applied in this study to identify whether real-time data are anomalous or not, based on the lagged 23h data samples stored in the Small-Data Storage sub-module. Whenever the ksample is detected and masked, it can be continuously used to identify the (k + 1) sample, and the (k − 23) sample is then automatically removed from the Small-Data Storage sub-module. This AI-based data quality control filter can be applied to both 1D and 2D data. For 1D data, besides transmitting them to the Cloud Layer for long-term storage, the processed data were also sent to a responsive module of the Backward Domain in the Edge Layer to support the system’s real-time decision-making. However, in the case of 2D data, to reduce the high computational cost when processing image data, the RGB images obtained from the camera were first converted to grayscale images and then transformed to 1D format by simply averaging the digital number (DN) values within an image scene (scene-averaging) before they can be applied, with the data quality control filter. Anomalous DN data samples closer to 0 can be identified as temporal gaps (black images), while those with high values (e.g., higher than 80—a typical average grayscale digital number value) can be classified as light images, which still provide useful information. The quality-controlled image data on an hourly basis were sent only to the Cloud Layer. 3.3. Forward Domain–Cloud Layer The Cloud Layer is the final layer in this proposed SAIS, which is widely used in various architectures and allows high computational application development based on the quality-controlled BD. Hence, the Forward Domain offers long-term high-quality data to be stored firstly in the Cloud Layer under the Data Storage module management. Data Storage: Because the accuracy of AI models significantly depends on the quality and quantity of the training data, this module aims to provide a space to store long-term (e.g., one life cycle of mushrooms) high-quality data observed from the integrated environmental sensor-camera system to develop AI-based solutions which require a high computation cost. These necessary datasets stored in this module can be then transmitted to the responsive module of the Backward Domain in the Cloud Layer for training AI models with respect to specific user requirements. 3.4. Backward Domain–Cloud Layer As highlighted in the description above, the mission of the Backward Domain is to develop AI-based smart solutions and make decisions based on the collected and stored data in the Forward Domain. Therefore, in the Cloud Layer, the Backward Domain tasks are conducted in the AI Development module. Figure 5 presents the architecture of the Backward Domain in the Cloud Layer. Figure 5. The architecture of the Backward Domain in the Cloud Layer. AI Development: This module is designed to account for AI-based smart solution development for specific demands, which requires BD for high computational cost training and complex analytics. The implementation of this module in the Backward Domain of the Cloud Layer follows the two sub-modules: AI Model Training (1): This sub-module includes the feature selection task for training AI models based on user-specific demands, whereas relevant important features were extracted from the BD in the Data Storage module. Furthermore, several well-known AI model candidates will be selected for training. Parameter Storage (2): The optimal AI model among the candidates was chosen and its optimal parameters were then stored in this sub-module for further deployment. Various AI-based smart greenhouse mushroom-cultivation solutions can be considered for development. However, to showcase only one example of the high-computational-cost AI model application with BD (mostly with image/video data) in the Cloud Layer, a well-known, fast, effective, and advanced computer vision algorithm version among the series of the “You Only Look Once” (YOLO) framework [51], the YOLOv5 model, was used in this study for real-time mushroom detection with a surveillance camera. Specifically, the YOLOv5 model, whose cornerstone is a simple deep convolutional neural network, was introduced in 2020 to improve on its predecessors in object detection. The YOLOv5 model divides images into a grid cell and finally predicts the objects with multiple bounding boxes per grid cell. Its architecture consists of three main components: the BackBone for feature extraction, the Neck for feature fusion, and the Head for feature conversion to bounding-box parameters. The BD images stored in the Big-Data Storage module can be labeled for training the YOLOv5 model. To reduce the training costs (including the training time and number of training-data samples), this study adopted the Transfer Learning method to fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv5 model for mushroom detection to be compatible with the current training mushroom images in the Big-Data Storage module. The optimal model parameters were stored in the Parameter Storage sub-module and then transferred to the Edge Layer for real-time deployment. 3.5. Backward Domain–Edge Layer The Backward Domain in the Edge Layer provides the workspace for real-time smart agriculture solution deployment, which was assigned to the Real-time AI Deployment module, with its architecture provided in Figure 6. Figure 6. The architecture of the Backward Domain in the Edge Layer. Real-time AI Deployment: This module consists of four sub-modules for integrating analytics from both environmental sensors and cameras to improve real-time solution/decision making, as follows: Short-term Analytics (1): This sub-module receives the analytical results from the Forward Domain in the Edge Layer (Data Preprocessing module), mainly based on temporary small-data storage of the 1D data from the IoT environmental sensor. Long-term Analytics (2): The optimal AI model obtained from the Backward Domain based on BD analytics in the Cloud Layer (AI Development module) was deployed in this sub-module, mainly for the 2D image data. Integrated Analytics (3): This sub-module combines the analytical results from the Short-term and Long-term Analytics sub-modules to enhance decision-making. Solutions/Decision Making (4): Relevant solutions/decisions will be made in this sub-module, based on the results from the Integrated Analytics sub-module. 3.6. Backward Domain–Device Layer The Backward Domain in the Device Layer covers the Device Controlling module. Device Controlling: This module aims to automatically control sensors/actuators to make farm management decisions as soon as possible, based on the analytical solutions provided by the Real-time AI Deployment module in the Edge Layer. For example, the image-based mushroom detection solution allows users to recognize whether the mushrooms are currently in the growing period or have been harvested. In the case of extreme conditions observed by the environmental sensor during the mushroom growing period, this module enables the modulating of key environmental parameters by controlling IoT sensors/actuators such as the heater/cooling fan (for temperature), humidifier/dehumidifier (for humidity), or air ventilation (for CO2 level) via connection to a microcontroller. 4. Implementation Results 4.1. Implementation of Forward Domain–Device Layer Installation of the integrated IoT environmental sensor-surveillance camera system for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation is the first implementation step and was carried out in a mushroom house located in Songsan Green City, Republic of Korea. This system aims to collect the key environmental parameters affecting mushroom growth and intuitive mushroom information, which is the responsibility of the Data Collecting module belonging to the Forward Domain in the Device Layer. Figure 7 describes the installation of the combination IoT environmental sensor for simultaneously measuring the real-time 1D data of three key environmental parameters including air temperature (T), atmospheric relative humidity (RH), and CO2 level (CO2), together with the construction of a data logger containing the Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Data collected from the IoT environmental sensor were then transmitted to the data logger for further processing, mainly via a wireless connection (Figure 7a). However, we also set up ethernet cables here to ensure that data transmission can be automatically switched to a wired connection when the wireless connection collapses, maintaining their stable transmission (Figure 7b). It is important to note that although the environmental sensor was set up in the greenhouse environment, we constructed the data logger outside the mushroom house for future combination with outdoor smart agriculture sensors/actuators such as smart precipitation gauges, unmanned aerial vehicles, tractors, and so on (Figure 7c). Figure 7. Installation of the combination IoT environmental sensor for the greenhouse mushroom information system with connection to data logger via the following: (a) wireless connection and (b) wired connection. (c) Construction of data logger outdoors with potential combination with outdoor sensors. The Korean words in the label of the data logger represent for the system name “Agriculture Environment Data Collection System” and the company name “Sejong Rain”. The time series of the raw 1D data (at 10 min of temporal resolution) for the three key parameters from the installed IoT environmental sensor for nearly one month (one life cycle of the mushroom) is depicted in Figure 8. In general, no major operational errors occurred when continuous data were collected without missing values and the observed data range fell within the sensor’s allowable measuring range for each parameter, according to Table 3. This suggests that the combination IoT environmental sensor used in this study, which was developed by the Korean company, is ready and has potential for smart mushroom monitoring and further applications in smart agriculture. Figure 8. Time series of 1D raw data in 10 min intervals collected from the combination IoT environmental sensor for (a) temperature (T), (b) humidity (RH), and (c) CO2 level (CO2). Besides the IoT environmental sensor, the simultaneous installation of the surveillance camera to capture real-time intuitive 2D data for crop information was also implemented in the pilot area, as illustrated in Figure 9. The camera was fixed to collect a time series of RGB images covering a partial mushroom farm for preliminary testing. We also connected the camera system to the data logger for data transmission. Figure 9. Installation of the surveillance camera for the greenhouse-mushroom information system. Time series of the raw 2D data at 10 min time intervals were obtained from the installed surveillance camera. We showcase several RGB image samples of mushrooms at different growth stages in Figure 10. It can be drawn from Figure 10 that intuitive mushroom information can be well captured by the installed surveillance camera, even with the changes between growth stages. However, there are several temporal gaps (image samples with no-value/black images) that occurred during the operation which need to be noticed and addressed. All the raw data collected in the Device Layer were then sent to the Edge Layer for pre-processing. Figure 10. Samples of 2D raw data in 10 min intervals collected from the surveillance camera during different mushroom growth stages. The red rectangle highlights the gap (no-value data) in the data stream. 4.2. Implementation of Forward Domain–Edge Layer The raw 1D and 2D data collected at the Device Layer were then delivered to the Forward Domain in the Edge Layer for further preprocessing before being transmitted to the Cloud Layer. The Edge Layer is the major layer in this designed SAIS, whose main goal is a stepping stone toward saving cloud and bandwidth resources as well as selecting essential data for the cloud server. Therefore, the Forward Domain in this layer (represented by the Data Preprocessing module) is responsible for reducing unnecessary data collected from the Device Layer and conducting quality control for high-quality data sent to the Cloud Layer. To this end, several raw data samples (small data) should be stored in this layer for a short period and the Small-Data Storage sub-module is responsible for providing storage space in this task. The first preprocessing task in this module is data reduction. Since the mushroom monitoring on an hourly basis is sufficient and was selected as the standard temporal resolution to be updated in the cloud, an average filtering technique was utilized as the temporal resampling method to convert 10 min data into 1h data. Figure 11 illustrates examples of how to conduct this temporal resampling method in both 1D and 2D data time series. In particular, every six raw data samples/images within a current 1h duration were initially stored. Since no significant differences were observed among these raw data, an hourly representative point value/image can be generated by simply taking an average of those six data samples/images. After an hourly representative data sample/image is given, it will be sent back to the Small-Data Storage sub-module for temporal storage and the current raw data will be automatically removed from this sub-module for updating the coming raw data. It is important to note that, besides the data reduction benefit, this method also supports dealing with temporal gap problems, ensuring continuous measurement of the data stream. For example, a black image (temporal gap) that occurred in the raw 2D data was successfully removed and replaced by a representative image (average image of the six raw data in 10 min intervals within every 1h interval) while keeping sufficient information, as illustrated in Figure 11b. Figure 11. Examples of the temporal resampling based on the average filtering method to resample raw data in 10 min intervals into standard data in 1h intervals applied to the following: (a) 1D data from the environmental sensor and (b) 2D data from the camera. The red dashed rectangle represents the 1h data window. The second preprocessing task in the Forward Domain of the Edge Layer is for data quality control, which is covered by the Data Quality Controlling sub-module. For the 1D data, since the important task of smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation is mainly based on modulating the ideal conditions of key environmental parameters, this sub-module aims to determine the sudden extreme conditions occurring in the environmental data, supporting the system with timely responses to address the problems as well as managing high-quality data sent to the cloud server. However, because edge computing is compatible with light computing applications that can work well in short-term small-data numbers stored in this layer, effective and lightweight AI algorithms are preferable for this task. As a result, a widely used lightweight AI model, the k-NN algorithm, was selected as the anomaly-detection method in this study. More specifically, the k-NN was conducted in a 24h moving window (k = 23) for the continuous hourly data samples stored in the Small-Data Storage. The real-time outlier detection of the current data sample (the k sample) can be performed based on its recent 23 lagged hourly data samples. Whenever the k sample is detected and masked, it can be continuously used to identify the (k + 1) sample, and the (k − 23) sample is automatically deleted from the Small-Data Storage sub-module. Figure 12 presents the results of applying the k-NN algorithm-based anomaly detection to the 1D hourly data of three key environmental parameters for mushroom cultivation. These successful implementation results of the k-NN model-based anomaly detection in the 1D environmental data, as illustrated in Figure 12, highlight the suitability and potential application of lightweight AI models for edge computing. Figure 12. Results of the AI-based anomaly-detection application to the 1D hourly (hr) environmental data for (a) temperature (T), (b) humidity (RH), and (c) CO2 level (CO2). As regards the 2D data, one problem is that although the temporal resampling method can deal with temporal gaps in the raw data, they still possibly occur in the resampled data (when the six original images within one hour are all black images). Hence, the anomaly-detection method should be applied to the hourly 2D data to detect these gaps. However, to deal with the high computational cost when processing numerous crop images, a preprocessing procedure series was applied to the 2D data to transform them into 1D data before conducting the AI-based anomaly detection. In particular, an RGB image was first converted to a grayscale image and subsequently transformed into a digital number value by averaging grayscale digital numbers from all pixels within an image scene (scene averaging). Figure 13 provides a general example of how to carry out AI-based anomaly detection in the 2D data and their results for mushroom images in this study. As can be seen from Figure 13, two types of outliers have been identified by using the k-NN anomaly-detection method. Anomalous data with digital numbers closer to 0 are assigned to the temporal gaps (black images), which do not provide any useful information, whereas the outliers with the highest values (e.g., greater than 80—a typical average grayscale digital number value) are identified and masked as “light image”, which still provide similar crop information to the normal images but at a higher brightness. Finally, after the resampled data are quality-controlled, they will be sent to the cloud server for storage and to the Short-term Analytics sub-module in the Backward Domain of the Edge Layer for supporting real-time decision making. Figure 13. An example of the AI-based anomaly-detection application to the 2D image data. The color maps on the left side display the heatmap of an original image in digital numbers for red, green, blue, and grayscale channels. 4.3. Implementation of Forward- and Backward-Domain–Cloud Layer In the Cloud Layer, high-quality BD transmitted from the Edge Layer after passing the data quality control procedure will be initially stored in the Big-Data Storage Module of the Forward Domain. These high-quality BD stored in the Cloud Layer were then sent to the AI Development Module for training high-computational-cost AI models based on specific user requirements. This study employed a widely used deep learning-based object-detection algorithm, the YOLOv5 model, to address the mushroom recognition problem, mainly for the 2D image data. Moreover, to reduce the computational cost during the training process, the transfer learning technique was integrated to fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv5 model for adapting the mushroom images stored in the Cloud Layer. Detailed information on training and evaluation of the YOLOv5 model for mushroom detection in this study is shown in Table 5. The obtained optimal hyperparameters were subsequently stored in the Parameter Storage module and were used for real-time deployment of this solution in the Edge Layer. Table 5. Information on the training and evaluation of the YOLOv5 model for mushroom detection. 4.4. Implementation of Backward Domain–Edge Layer The Backward Domain in the Edge Layer, which was carried out by the Real-time AI Development module, aims to provide integrated analytics for decision-making by combining the results of short-term and long-term analytics. In particular, on the one hand, the Short-term Analytics module in this layer obtained the key environmental-parameter anomaly-detection results from the Forward Domain in the Edge Layer, which was described in the section above (Implementation of Forward Domain–Edge Layer) and is shown in Figure 12. On the other hand, when it comes to long-term analytics, this module adapted the developed YOLOv5-based mushroom-recognition model for detection, based on the stored optimal model hyperparameters from the Backward Domain in the Cloud Layer. Representative examples of the YOLOv5 model deployment for mushroom detection in this study are depicted in Figure 14, whereas single-object (mushroom) areas are detected in continuous images with the red bounding box and confidence level by further applying instance segmentation. According to the figure, in general, most of the mushroom areas during the fruiting period can be well identified by the system, with a clear discrimination of the non-mushroom areas observed. This indicated the successful deployment of a high-computational-cost AI model in the Edge Layer, demonstrating its suitability to adopt a developed AI model in the Cloud Layer for edge computing. However, there are still several mushroom areas in an image that the system cannot detect, suggesting the need for retraining the model to improve its performance by the updated high-quality BD sent to the Cloud. The results from the long-term analytics can be integrated with those from the short-term analytics to support the system’s decision-making. For example, if outliers are detected in the streaming environmental data (results from the short-term analytics) during the mushroom’s fruiting period (results from the long-term analytics), the system can automatically send an alert notification to the users or control the sensors/actuators for maintaining the normal status of environmental conditions. Figure 14. An example of implementation of the Real-time AI Deployment module (deployment of YOLOv5 and transfer learning in mushroom detection). 5. Discussion and Future Direction The major difference between this proposed research and related work mentioned in Table 1 and Table 2 is the combined use of the edge-computing paradigm in a smart greenhouse mushroom-cultivation information system. In particular, the Edge Layer was not included in the SAIS architecture for mushroom cultivation in Table 1 [28], while none of the previous mushroom management studies in Table 2 employed the edge computing model in their system. Thus, the successful practical application of this study can shed new light on leveraging edge-computing paradigm shifts as well as improving smart mushroom cultivation systems. In addition, a minor discrepancy that is worth mentioning is the introduction of a new low-cost combination IoT environmental sensor made by a Korean company. This product combines three single sensors for different environmental parameters into one sensor (three-in-one sensor) and also employs low-cost Raspberry Pi single-board computers working in the resource-saving edge computing paradigm, so it can contribute to the diverse selections for clients in low-cost smart agriculture devices and information system markets. Notwithstanding the benefits of edge computing in complementing classical cloud computing and in improving smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation, this preliminary study may suffer from several challenges in the future. First, the implementation costs when scaling this framework up to a larger scale for other crops, together with integrating outdoor smart agriculture systems, are questionable, since additional costs from new IoT devices and their installation might be included in the system. This may limit the commercialization of this framework for business objectives. Second, the improvement in mushroom production efficiency when the edge computing paradigm is included is not fully analyzed, suggesting the implementation of more detailed analyses for this problem in further studies. Addressing potential challenges is also related to the future outlook of this research. Besides the application customized for mushroom cultivation, the successful practical implementation of this study suggests a potential to scale up this framework for business objectives and other user-specific requirements (e.g., other crops) in future studies. To this end, in the future direction, this fundamental SAIS architecture is expected to be coupled with the two new layers, including the User and Administration Layers. The potential architecture for future the SAIS is illustrated in Figure 15, and a detailed description for each added layer is provided below. Figure 15. The potential architecture of the future SAIS for business objectives. The blue dashed border and arrows indicate the Forward Domain and its procedure, and the red dashed border and arrows indicate the Backward Domain and its procedure. User Layer: This layer is particularly designed for the users of the SAIS such as farmers or clients. From the user’s perspective, the acquisition of quality-controlled datasets and the intuitive visualization of these datasets with timely notifications if any anomalous events occur from the Cloud Layer, and the capability to control the devices manually in an emergency in the Device Layer, are preferable. Thus, several respective modules such as Data Extraction, Visualization/Notification, or Manual Device Controlling Modules can be considered in this layer. Since the users mainly work in the Device and Cloud Layers, the users can only access these two layers, and they do not need to access the Edge Layer to adjust any edge computing tasks. Administration Layer: This layer is particularly designed for the providers or developers (e.g., companies) of the SAIS for business goals. Unlike the users, the administrators aim to manage all the data flow from the Device Layer to the Cloud Layer, so they can access and collect data from all the layers in this system, which can be conducted by the Data Extraction/Management module. Moreover, the administrators can meet the specific user requirements by developing suitable solutions, and ensure the safety of the system by maintaining the security. Therefore, the two respective modules including Application Development and Network Security are considered in this layer. Not only are the above additional layers being included, but the Device Layer is also planning to be extended with new sensors, in the future system. Microcontrollers and several controlling sensors/actuators (e.g., heaters, fans, humidifiers, or air ventilation…) are expected to be utilized, which can complement the current indoor system. Furthermore, a parallel SAIS for outdoor smart agriculture with relevant IoT devices (e.g., smart rain gauges, automated weather sensors, irrigation valves, or unmanned aerial vehicles…) can be considered and developed for an integrated indoor–outdoor smart agriculture system. 6. Conclusions Traditional Device-Cloud protocol in smart agriculture often suffers from the challenges of delayed system responses caused by low bandwidth and high latency, together with high cloud-service costs for data computation and storage when enormous numbers of data acquired from IoT devices are directly transmitted to the cloud server without processing. Novel edge computing offers an effective solution to deal with challenges in this traditional protocol by shifting partial data storage and computation capability from the cloud server to edge devices. Nevertheless, selecting which tasks can be implemented in edge computing depends on user-specific demands, suggesting the need to design a specific and proper Smart Agriculture Information System (SAIS) architecture that is compatible with single-crop requirements. Based on the nutritious and commercial benefits of edible mushrooms as well as the necessity of cost reduction from a business viewpoint, the major goal of this study is to design and implement a standard multilayered SAIS architecture for smart greenhouse mushroom cultivation toward leveraging edge computing, which can be scalable for business goals. In this designed SAIS, the three-layer architecture, which couples edge computing in the central layer to connect the Device and Cloud Layers (Device-Edge-Cloud protocol) and enables automation in mushroom management using an integration of the IoT environmental sensor (for mushroom key environmental-parameter monitoring) and surveillance camera (for intuitive mushroom monitoring) was employed and tested in a testbed site in the Republic of Korea. Via this designed SAIS, we aim to introduce the advanced combination environmental IoT sensors developed by Korean companies, a standard network flow that is possible for scalability and suitable edge computing tasks, with typical examples. Moreover, a potential SAIS architecture with additional layers for a future direction for business purposes was also suggested. The successfully implemented SAIS architecture indicated that our combination IoT environmental sensor integrated with a surveillance camera could monitor the real-time key environmental parameters affecting mushroom growth and intuitive mushroom information. Typical examples of mushroom cultivation based on the collected data revealed that several low-cost data pre-processing procedures including small-data storage, temporal resampling-based data reduction, and lightweight artificial intelligence (AI)-based data quality control for anomaly detection within environmental conditions, together with real-time AI model (YOLOv5) deployment for mushroom recognition from crop images, are compatible with edge computing. In contrast, high-quality BD storage and high-computational-cost AI model development can be implemented in the cloud. Moreover, integrating the Edge Layer as the center of the traditional protocol can significantly save network resources and operational costs by reducing unnecessary data sent from the device to the cloud while keeping sufficient information. Finally, the future improvement suggests including additional layers to meet user-specific demands for business objectives and the extension of the current system with new controlling sensors and a parallel outdoor system, toward an integrated indoor–outdoor smart agriculture system.

Abstract India's agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem output. Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making effective use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with IoT enabled are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques face difficulties in forecasting weather and predicting disease accurately. In this work, a system is developed to automate weather forecasting and field monitoring using sensors. Wireless transmission is used to transfer sensor data to a web server database. In the first step, the collected data is pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data is then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. In the second step, crop images acquired from sensors for disease prediction are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement of image. Pre-processed images are then fed into ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by the systems. On the other hand, regarding the information about horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers. The proposed method is tested with several metrics which attain better performance like 94% accuracy for weather forecasting and 98% accuracy for field monitoring. Thus the proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support farmers to achieve a high quantity of crop production in lesser time.

Introduction India has agriculture as its primary occupation. IBEF (Indian Brand Enquiry Foundation) estimates that 58 % of Indians who live in rural areas depend on agriculture. Not only in underdeveloped countries but also in many industrialised countries, farming and agriculture make up a significant component of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (Karthick et al., 2018). As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. It will help handle global catastrophes like climate change and epidemics like draught in addition to fostering the flourishing sustainable development of people, flora, and fauna (Lavanya et al., 2020). Farmers still use traditional methods such as manual field monitoring, which involves often watering crops and applying pesticides to manage pests, whether or not they are aware of the appropriate dosage. These old methods include disadvantages such as water logging in fields, excessive use of pesticides and fungicides, lack of knowledge about the kind of crops that need to be cultivated for a certain type of soil fertility, and lower yields than anticipated from the agricultural area (AshifuddinMondal & Rehena, 2018). Many farmers continue to cultivate using traditional techniques, which leads to low crop yields (Sushanth & Sujatha, 2018). Better technology will increase yield, hence reducing the likelihood of famine and malnutrition. The technology should be inexpensive enough that it can have an influence on billions of people worldwide (Ogunti, 2019; Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). Monitoring of the soil, plants, moisture, and temperature, as well as the management of the infrastructure and control systems, are all necessary for agricultural production. IoT is essential in the sector of agriculture (Thakur et al., 2020). Since they are utilised to offer information about agricultural areas, all Internet of Things sensors is quite effective. A smart agriculture stick advertises the novel smart agriculture programme based on IoT that enables farmers to have access to real-time data to track how the environment is operating, enabling them to engage in smart farming, increase their final yield, and ensure that their product meets quality standards (Phasinam et al., 2022). A wireless sensor network is used by this advanced agricultural monitoring system to gather data from a number of sensors placed at various junctions. A great amount of data can be analysed using such technology in precision farming after being collected by WSN (Khanna & Kaur, 2019). It enables farmers to boost yields while using fewer resources. In industrialised countries, smart framing is being carried out on a wide scale combining IoT, AI, and agriculture data analysis (Goel et al., 2021). The Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture system demonstrated that distant sensors are used to monitor inside settings and that micro-scale controllers are utilised to control and operate indoor and remote sensing systems, including those that take pictures and videos and even use cameras (Panda & Bhatnagar, 2020). Farmers may monitor and manage the microclimate in the greenhouse, as well as illnesses and pests that impact the plants, with the aid of precision farming (Arora et al., 2021). The status of the plants can be impacted by a variety of external elements and microclimatic interior occurrences (Gunjan et al., 2022). Plant development and the spread of some diseases are both impacted by temperature and relative humidity (Daya Sagar et al., 2023). In terms of the effectiveness of greenhouses, it is one of the most detrimental agricultural production illnesses (Cambra et al., 2018). When ambient and micro-indoor conditions are favourable, controlling the irrigation of water quality is easier. When growing crops in greenhouses, it is essential to apply the appropriate fertiliser treatments or drip system cleanser at the appropriate time and location (Siddiquee et al., 2022). Understanding the stage of the production cycle at which specific nutrient solutions should be used is essential (Sai Surya Teja et al., 2023). The purpose of this paper is to make automated and continuous field monitoring for smart agriculture using IoT and deep learning technologies (Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). The main contribution of the proposed work is given below: • Automated and efficient field monitoring model is designed through combining IoT and deep learning technology to support farmers in achieving higher crop production. • Sensors are assembled in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. • Normalization and missing value imputation are used as data pre-processing techniques and GRU is used to forecast weather and soil conditions based on the acquired data. • Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram equalization are used as image pre-processing techniques and CNN is used to detect the presence of disease using pre-processed crop image. • Alert SMS are sent to farmers regarding the horrible weather condition and diseases to render control action.

Result and discussion part of the proposed methodology is given in Section 4. At last, Section 5 contains the conclusion part. 2. Literature review Several techniques for automatic forecasting of weather and field monitoring had been developed. The following section examines some of the current approaches utilized for weather forecasting and crop disease prediction in smart agriculture. (a) Weather and irrigation monitoring system An IoT-based smart irrigation management system combining machine learning and open source technology has been proposed by Goap et al. (2018). The proposed system's intelligence is based on a smart algorithm that considers sensory data as well as elements of the short-term weather forecast, such as precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV. But the system cost of this suggested approach is high. Velmurugan (2020) have suggested a smart system that uses open-source technologies to forecast how much irrigation is needed for a given field. The entire system has been created and is currently being tested on a small-scale pilot project. Web-based information visualisation and decision support systems are used to wirelessly gather sensor node data via the cloud, and they deliver real-time information insights based on the analysis of sensor and weather forecast data. Singh et al. (2019) have suggested In an IoT-driven smart irrigation framework, machine learning techniques are used to maximise the irrigation water use by forecasting the future soil moisture of a field. The performance of various ML techniques is tested for predicting future soil moisture, and the GBRT outcomes are quite encouraging. Rani et al. (2020) have suggested a machine learning and neural networks-based flood monitoring system using IoT. This research outlines an efficient and adaptable technique for flood and system-altering system identification. The most cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning (ML), have a large positive impact on technology and are particularly effective at detecting both normal and pathological behaviour in any system. The most common, extensively used, and effective method for forecasting rainfall is neural networks. Real-time agricultural field monitoring utilising IoT-based sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles has been developed by Quach et al. (2021). A sensor network for gathering information on the ground is also incorporated, in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle system for remote sensing. Numerous sensor nodes are used in the sensor network to measure various environmental and plant factors, including temperature, humidity, and nitrogen content. The sensor network transmits data using LoRa, a low-power wide-area network modulation method that enables a single receiver to receive signals from sensor nodes up to 450 m away. (b) Crop disease prediction In order to predict apple disease in Kashmir Valley apple orchards, Akhter and Sofi (2022) suggested using data analytics and machine learning in an IoT system. This study reaches a pinnacle in demonstrating the power and promise of computing tools like the internet of things, wireless sensor networks, data analytics, and machine learning in agriculture. A local poll was also conducted to find out from the farmers how the most recent technological advancements affect precision farming. Khamparia et al. (2020) developed a hybrid deep learning model merging autoencoder with Convolutional neural network for crop leaf disease prediction. Obtained dataset contained 900 image samples of three different crops and five types of disease. From total samples 600 images were considered for training process and remaining 300 was considered for testing process. Different convolution filter size of and was used in this developed approach achieving 97.5 % accuracy. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) developed deep learning model along with transfer learning for prediction of disease in rice leaf. In traditional farming, farmers spend lot of resources as well as time consuming due to visualizing through naked eye and it results in unhealthy farming. Object segmentation and classification was achieved using InceptionResNetV2 for recognizing disease in rice leaf image. Kaur et al. (2022) developed hybrid CNN model for detection of leaf disease through utilizing feature extraction and feature reduction approach. Using this developed approach four different types of diseases such as black measles, stable, black rot and leaf blight present in grapevines was recognized. Plant village dataset was collected and processed using EfficientNet B7 deep model using transfer learning. After extracting features it was further reduced by applying logistic regression. According to the literature, numerous systems are designed for automatic field monitoring with IoT. Based on the above mentioned articles several significant challenges arise in automatic weather forecasting and field monitoring approaches. High system cost (Goap et al., 2018), alerting system not available (Rani et al., 2020), and only considering a single parameter (Akhter and Sofi, 2022) are some of the issues in the existing algorithms. Thus effective field monitoring is not achieved using the existing research. So, the current research focuses on utilizing IoT and deep learning approach for automated and continuous field monitoring. 3. Proposed methodology In India, one of the most important economic sectors is agriculture. India's increased agricultural activity can be attributed to the country's abundant irrigation-supporting water supplies and highly productive soil. However, a number of circumstances stop the production of the projected yield from occurring. To overcome these aforementioned issues and to support farmers with better quality and quantity crops an improved automated and computer based technology is designed in this current research. Fig. 1 illustrates the architecture of the proposed IoT based system. Download : Download high-res image (592KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Architecture of the Proposed IoT Based System for Improved Precision Agriculture. The agricultural area is equipped with several IoT-based sensor nodes to gather real-time data. The nodes that have been assembled gather data on the state of the soil, moisture content of the soil, presence of humidity, presence of pests, diseases, and insects, as well as photographs of plants and other things. The information is then either sent to a cloud server based on IoT or stored locally in a nearby fog node. The collected data is pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data which is required for classification. Pre-processed data is then given as input for Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. Then, in the second step, the images of the crop are acquired to predict the presence of disease and pests. The acquired crop images are pre-processed using an Adaptive Gaussian filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization (DHE) for contrast enhancement of the image. Pre-processed image is then fed to ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers. The proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support the farmers to achieve quantity and quality crop production in lesser time. 3.1. IoT based network for data acquisition The first step in putting together a weather forecasting and field monitoring system is setting up a wireless sensor network field where each node is linked by a Wi-Fi module as well as lays data over a server computer, form where an automated Python script can keep polling the information and then transmits alert/start messages for the required procedure. Below Fig. 2 shows the diagrammatic representation of distributed WSN. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Distributed WSN. Data collection using numerous sensors placed around the field or garden is the first stage in creating an automatic weather forecasting and field monitoring system. The gateway node, or Raspberry Pi 3 B+, will handle all communication with the other sensor nodes. Advanced soil moisture sensors, GSM and Bluetooth modules, temperature and humidity sensors, MQ2 gas sensors, pH sensors, water level indicators, alarm and clock modules, batteries, and relay modules are all included in each Arduino mega unit. Ultrasonic sensor for rodents and significant intruder detection. Each node will send information to the raspberry pi3, which functions as both the base station and the gateway node. The data storage on the raspberry pi will be handled by a python script, from which it might be displayed to the user via an application layer. The intranet can also accomplish what it was designed to do for data transmission from the raspberry pi to the server, enabling its use of it in places with limited to no internet access. The basic principles of receiver, transmitter, ground, and positive are the basis for connecting various sensors to the microcontroller. The majority of connections need to be made in this way, because the Arduino Mega board includes a lot of digital pins, RXD, analogue pins and TXD in addition to a lot of Vcc and Gnd pins. After building the network topology and collecting the data, the first phase of the proposed applications is finished. Data processing begins with the initial phase of data collection using various sensors. 3.1.1. Node’s structural details Each node is made up of a micro-controller, which in this case is advised to be an Arduino mega because it most closely matches the scope of the solution. Each node has a soil moisture sensor, a Wi-Fi module, a temperature sensor, a DHT11 sensor, a light intensity sensor, also a battery module linked to it. Fig. 3 below contains each node's block diagram. Download : Download high-res image (161KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Configuration of each sensor node. In order to transmit further signals to the actuators and inform the end user in the event that manual intrusion is required, all of the data collected by the sensors must be processed and analysed. 3.2. Data analysis The data kept on a cloud server is also taken into account for analytical purposes, whereby an AI system is used to predict the weather, the characteristics of the soil, irrigation, and illness. To automate the forecast of various agricultural aspects and take corrective action to increase crop output, AI systems are being considered. However in the data analysis process initially the information regarding temperature, humidity, moisture and soil condition are considered. 3.2.1. Weather monitoring (a) Data pre-processing The sensors' entire collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. The given input datasets such as temperature, humidity moisture and soil properties contains some missing values. Normalization and mean based missing value imputation are used in the proposed method to convert the raw data into meaningful data which is required for classification. (b) Normalization Normally, attributes from the raw data are high variables and not present in a specified range. To accomplish a better outcome, the attributes from the data are kept in a uniform range of [A, B]. So here, min–max normalization method is used to normalize the attribute ranges. A mathematical formulation of min–max normalization is given in Eq. (1). (1) where represents the original value, denotes the maximum value of and indicates the minimum value of . (c) Mean based Missing value Imputation Imputation using mean values, also known as rough imputation, is a quick and simple imputation method that employs the mean value of all the data on the variable to be improved. Imputation of numerical variables is done using the mean. This rough imputation not only ignores the amount of variance but also the connection between variables, resulting in inaccurate estimations. The rough imputation approach should only be used when just a few missing data are present, and it is not designed for broad usage and is given in Eq. (2). (2) where represents the sample mean, and the total of each value in the sample is represented by , while the number of values in the population is represented by . 3.2.2. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises data into labelled informational classes or categories. In this designed model, GRU is used to forecast the weather. (a) Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) A GRU can be viewed as a simplification and improvement of LSTM and is comparable in performance to LSTM. Introduce LSTM before giving a comprehensive description of a GRU. The hidden state is the most crucial portion of an RNN because it is in charge of remembering or forgetting certain information (Li et al., 2020). From top to bottom, GRU has a total of three layers. The 10 node input layer is in charge of feeding information into the hidden layer. The output unit, which contains two nodes and one layer, is in charge of classifying and producing the data processed from the hidden layer using the SoftMax classifier. 32 nodes and one layer make up the hidden layer. The hidden layer's output processed data is handled using one-hot encoding, a real output that is gained following the decoding procedure. GRU consists of two gates a reset gate and an update gate . The two gates cooperate to regulate the flow of data into and out of the memory cell. Although they both use the input and the preceding concealed state to calculate them, their functions are distinct. A GRU makes some reductions in complexity compared to LSTM. Fig. 4 is a diagram of the GRU's organisational structure. Eq. (3) provides the link relationship seen in Fig. 4. (3) Download : Download high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of the GRU. In Eq. (3), candidate’s output is represented by , output vector is indicated using and represents the input vector. The reset gate of the GRU is designated by the letter , and the output gate by the letter (Xu et al., 2018). This GRU network is used in proposed approach to forecasting the weather in the agriculture area. 3.2.3. Disease prediction (a) Image pre-processing The sensors' entire collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. From the information collected from the nodes, the Python programmes running on the Raspberry Pi will check for certain criteria. The input crop image dataset is pre-processed in order to convert the raw image into a meaningful image. Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram equalization technique to remove noise and to improve the quality of the image for achieving accurate prediction. (b) Adaptive Gaussian filter When using a conventional Canny edge detector operator, the Gaussian filter is employed to smooth out the image and minimise the parasitic effect that sampling quantization has on the image. Due to the fact that both the edge and the noise are high frequency signals, the filter operator smoothes the image's edges while suppressing the noise, which affects how accurately the edges are identified. An updated Gaussian filtering algorithm is put forth to address this issue; it decides whether to apply a Gaussian filter based on the disparity between the pixel's grey value and the grey mean in the surrounding area. If the noise interferes with the image, it can be written as in Eq. (4): (4) where is the noise signal. When there is noise, the difference between the noise-affected pixel's grey value also its neighbouring pixels is described as in Eq. (5). (5) Due to the approximate zero interference free D, the mean value difference between the point grey value of the noise-affected image pixel and its neighbouring pixels, called , is roughly equal to , which is the degree of noise hopping. (c) Dynamic histogram equalization The cropped image's total number of pixels is used as the basis for the spanning function used by the equalisation method to perform equalisation (Dhal et al., 2018). Histogram equalisation and mapping the image pixels to a dynamic range are the two stages of the process. (d) Mapping image pixels to dynamic range The dynamic range for the output sub-histograms can be obtained from as Eqs. (5), (6). (6) (7) The exceptions are present at the two extremities, where (e) Equalizing each sub-histogram Similar to how a global histogram is equalised, each image's histogram is equalised using the same process. The remapped values for the ith sub-histogram are derived as in Eq. (8). (8) where is the new intensity level corresponding to the intensity level on the original image, is the histogram value at the intensity level on the fuzzy histogram and is the total population count in the partition of the fuzzy histogram. 3.2.4. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises data into clearly defined categories or classes. In this designed model, ResNet50 a kind of CNN model is used to predict plant diseases. (a) Residual Neural Network (ResNet50) The goal of CNN's back propagation method is to automatically discover the spatial hierarchies of feature classes. Convolution, pooling, and fully connected (FC) units are common building components utilized in the creation of CNNs. The process of repeatedly running the input image through the selected filter is the foundation of the convolutional layer's operation. The filter can be 3 × 3, 5 × 5 or 7 × 7 pixels in size. As a result, the image with the filter applied to it becomes the input of the following layer (m2 × m3). Activation maps are created as a result of this convolution process. Local unique elements can be seen on activation maps. A filter (m1) exists for each convolutional layer (Toğaçar et al., 2020). The output of layer l is made up of feature maps with dimension The ith subset of features, displayed as , is calculated utilizing Eq. (9). The matrix bias is indicated by and denotes size of the filter. (9) The pooling units preserves image characteristics while reducing image size also expenses while maintaining image information. This structure reduces the number of parameters, the filter's spatial dimension, and the step. It takes information in the following sizes as input: , and again outcomes Eqs. (10), (11), (12) demonstrates, in brief how the pooling layer functions. (10) (11) (12) The characteristics from the preceding stage are flattened before being assigned to the FC layers, which update the weights also provide the final values for each label. An actual multi-layered sensor for mapping is a convolutional network with fully interlinked units. In Eq. (13), the FC layer's processing stages are displayed. (13) In the proposed method CNN model such as ResNet 50 is used for the training of plant disease image dataset. Fig. 5 illustrates a building block for residual learning. A remarkable architecture made up of residual layers is called ResNet. Furthermore, ResNet is distinct in that it substitutes a collection of global average pooling layers for the more customary set of fully linked layers at the network’s conclusion. ResNet50 is a type of residual network with 50 layers. Each group of identical layers in the ResNet50 design is unique. ResNet calculates data from one layer to the next that must occur in order to arrive at the final forecast. ResNet helps to mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients by offering an alternative shortcut route for gradient to flow through. The model can skip a CNN weight layer if the current layer is not necessary thanks to the ResNet identity mapping algorithm (Theckedath & Sedamkar, 2020). This assists in preventing the over-fitting issue with the training set. This ResNet50 classifier used in the proposed method classifies the plant diseases in agricultural land. Predicted data using deep learning approach is further used for the purpose of monitoring the agriculture field. Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Building Block for ResNet50. 3.3. Field monitoring The temperature, humidity, irrigation, fertilisers and illness in the agricultural field will all be checked when the smart agricultural monitoring system is turned on. The water pump will automatically start if the temperature is really high. Then if the soil moisture is going down then the water pump will start automatically. Nutrient levels of the soils are then checked. If nutrient deficiencies occurred then an automatic fertilization machine is turned on to spray the fertilizer on the agricultural land. If the plants are affected by a particular disease means the automatic pesticide sprayer will start automatically. The smart agriculture monitoring system uses a GSM module to communicate with mobile devices and establish SMS alerts on the mobile device about the levels. 4. Result and discussion Agriculture and farming contribute significantly to the GDP of many affluent countries as well as emerging countries. As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. A critical matter that requires the highest appropriateness to be addressed is the necessity for agricultural maintenance and the rising water issues. To build an automated and continuous field monitoring, the proposed research focus on IoT and deep learning approach. The proposed GRU and ResNet50 are tested on MATLAB 2021a with intel core i5 and 8 GB RAM. Simulation parameters for GRU and ResNet50 are given in Table 1, Table 2. Table 1.

In order to gather real-time data, several IoT-based sensor nodes are set up in the agricultural field. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the environmental conditions, soil condition, moisture condition, presence of humidity fertility of the soil, and presence of the pest, diseases, and insects also capture images of plants and so. The collected information’s either stored locally in the nearby fog node or transmitted to the cloud server based on IoT. The agricultural node with sensor nodes and sensor node deployment used for this proposed approach is illustrated in Fig. 6, Fig. 7.

The information stored in cloud server is further considered for analysis purposes in which the prediction of weather, soil properties, irrigation and disease is achieved by means of AI system. The reason for considering AI systems is to achieve automated prediction of varying agricultural factors and take remedial action for higher crop yield. 4.1. Dataset description Different sensors are placed in the agricultural field for monitoring purpose to support smart in order to perform healthy farming. The collected sensor data is processed using AI system to predict weather, crop disease, soil nutrition and irrigation support. Four different datasets collected from publicly available is taken for analysis. Description regarding different dataset is given below. Dataset 1: This data contains details regarding district wise crop area, season, temperature different types of crops, production in hectares and yield. The statistics is collected from 1997 to 2021 and it is obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare of India. Data is acquired from 35 states and union territory. Dataset 2: For the purpose of monitoring and controlling an irrigation system in real-time, data is gathered using a wireless sensor network. This method prevents water waste while providing the farm and garden with uniform and necessary water levels. This method aims to provide an automated irrigation mechanism that activates and deactivates the pumping motor in response to the amount of moisture in the ground. In this system, the soil moisture sensor, dht11 sensor, and NodeMCU are all used to interface with the Arduino board. Using these sensors, the data is collected. Dataset 3: Data related to soil nutrients is collected from department of agriculture and farmers welfare. Different types of nutrients are essential to be present in the soil for plant growth. Various soil nutrients includes pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Iron (Fe), Organic Carbon (OC), Nitrogen (N), Manganese (Mn), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (zn). Dataset 4: This dataset contains both unhealthy as well as healthy leaves image. Total number of image samples present in the dataset is 3600 images of RGB. It contains healthy apple leave and diseased apple leaves such as scab, black rot and cedar. 4.2. Weather monitoring The collected data such as temperature (Dataset 1), soil moisture (Dataset 2) and nutrients (Dataset 3) are pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data which is required for classification. GRU is utilized as a classifier for predicting weather condition. This proposed GRU classifier is compared with existing classifiers like Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The performance metrics used for comparison between proposed and existing classifiers are accuracy, precision, recall, error, specificity, F1_Score, NPV, FNR and FPR. AUC plot and ROC plot of the proposed approach is depicted in Fig. 8. To validate or show the effectiveness of a multi-class categorization problem, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are used. The degree or amount of separability is represented by AUC. In the proposed method, AUC plot is close to 1, so it has a high level of separability. The ROC curve is a probability curve that demonstrates how effective the model can discriminate across classes. Table 3 illustrates the comparison study between proposed and existing model.

Field monitoring The agricultural area’s temperature is first checked using a temperature sensor. When abnormal conditions occur like a high temperature greater than or equal to 35 degree centigrade then the controller sends message to the owner using 19:19:19 to spray on the leaves of small crops for 15 min to protect the crop from sun's effect. Because of the sun's heat and high temperature crop growth decrease so to avoid it use that fertilizer. The temperature always monitored and displayed on LCD which is detected by temperature sensor. When detected high moisture in the soil it causes root rot in crops, then this system detects moisture conditions and sends that information to owner to protect crop from root rot using copper oxychloride 3gmsspltr use at root zone of plants. When a farmer wants to switch on motor manually by sending message from his mobile to system with a message as “#M ON*” and to switch off motor when he wants then send message as “#M OFF*”. Again he wants a change in auto mode he sends a message from his mobile to system as “#AUTO*”. When the system detects that disease affected on crops and sends that information to the owner to protect crop from diseases by spraying fertilizer named as a pyrethroid. The agrobot carries the sprinkler motor which sprays the pesticide. It is in ON state till it moves at the end of agricultural land. 5. Conclusion Automated weather forecasting and field monitoring using AI based deep learning approach is focused in this current research. Traditional farming results in unhealthy crops because of poor weather and soil condition, crops affected through diseases and pest. To overcome these issue automated weather forecasting and field monitoring is essential to support farmers to produce healthy crops with higher yield quantity. In this current research initially, sensors are assembled in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient and capture images of plants and so. In first phase, the previous collected data for weather forecasting was pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data was then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the temperature and soil moisture content for upcoming years. In the second phase, the crop images acquired from sensors to predict the presence of disease are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization to improve the image's brightness. The pre-processed image was then fed to ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. In the third phase, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions observed by these predicted data, remedial action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to farmers. Graphical representation proves that the proposed approach results are significantly better than those of existing approaches. Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity obtained for weather forecasting is 94 %, 94 %, 93 % and 93 %. Following that Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity reached for crop disease prediction is 98 %,98 %, 98 % and 98 %. Thus, the deep learning techniques used in proposed approach are the best choice for automated weather forecasting and field monitoring to support precision agriculture. In future, by utilizing AI and surveillance, the field area may be kept free of intruders. 6.

  Explanation: **1. Yes.** The research team controlled for water availability by exposing juvenile cork oak seedlings to four different watering regimens: 100, 50, 25, and 10 % of soil water holding capacity. Statistically significant differences in a variety of physiological traits were found across water availability treatments, indicating that seedlings adjusted their physiological performance accordingly. Moreover, seedlings from different locations (populations) showed different sensitivities to water limitation, suggesting that they are locally adapted to distinct water availabilities in their native environments.

**2. Yes.** The research team addressed this question by investigating the relationship between water use efficiency, expressed as carbon isotope discrimination levels, and drought tolerance, measured as aboveground biomass production, across the different populations and watering treatments. Their results suggest that the southernmost populations had higher water use efficiency and greater biomass production than northern populations, particularly when subjected to extreme water limitation. This suggests that the southernmost populations are more drought-tolerant and better adapted to drier conditions.

**3. Yes, in part.** The research team assessed three main parameters related to drought tolerance: (1) foliar morphological traits (leaf size and shape), (2) physiological responses (e.g., photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance), and (3) biochemical responses (e.g., levels of compatible solutes and malondialdehyde). Statistically significant variation was found among the three reproductive strategies for most of the leaf morphological traits, with northern populations generally having more drought-tolerant leaf traits than southern populations. For the physiological and biochemical traits, the research team only found significant differences among populations for a subset of the traits investigated. These results suggest that local adaptation to drought may have evolved differently for different traits in cork oak, with foliar morphological traits showing a more consistent pattern of local adaptation than physiological and biochemical traits.

Abstract Rationale Increased aridity has led to drought-induced mortality or loss of health for many tree species. Of particular interest is to explore the response of the Mediterranean tree species cork oak (Quercus suber) to this declining phenomenon due to its severity and its large implications for the local economy and the provision of highly relevant ecosystem services. Approach To assess geographical variations in the response to water stress, we analyzed under controlled conditions the effects of four watering levels and the resistance to a terminal drought on seedlings collected from nine populations covering the complete latitudinal distribution of the species. We explored the response of a number of physiological traits and markers of oxidative stress potentially related with drought-resistance. Findings We found a highly plastic phenotypic response of most variables to water availability and a large influence of seedlings provenance in the drought-resistance strategies. Although the oxidative stress enzymes ruled out differential water stress throughout the distribution range, we found that seedlings from the southern limit are less vulnerable to drought than other populations. Southern seedlings adapted to xeric conditions displayed a larger sensitivity of stomata to changes in soil humidity and a higher water use efficiency. These physiological local adaptations coupled with larger acorn size in the southern populations, resulted in larger aboveground biomass and higher drought resistance at the southern distribution edge. Conclusions Our data suggest that this evergreen tree species relies on its physiological plasticity to develop adaptative features that allows it to overcome water shortage and that southern populations hold genetic diversity that could improve the specie´s adaptation in the forecasted drought context with relevant implications for conservation programs. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Cork oakDrought resistanceFunctional responsesPhysiological traitsClimate changePhenotypic plasticity Introduction A broad knowledge of the ecological and geographical range of organisms is becoming increasingly important to promote effective planning and decision making for conservation and natural resource management. Such a task is especially pertinent in the ongoing climate change context due to the numerous and relevant harmful consequences of this phenomenon on Earth (Alberto et al., 2013; Keenan et al., 2011). Climate change is not only modifying the environments in which all living beings develop, but it is also projected to affect their global distribution patterns (Rubenstein et al., 2023). Changes in the species distribution range have the potential to reshape ecological communities, impact ecosystem services and functioning, disturb human health and well-being, and even have feedback effects on climate (Jing et al., 2022; Weiskopf et al., 2020). Therefore, disentangling how species are shifting as a function of climate change is key for meaningfully managing species and ecosystems. Whether abrupt changes in their geographical range will actually occur, however, depends on the extent to which these species are able to tolerate environmental modifications. In most terrestrial biomes, trees are deemed to be keystone species as they support the survival of numerous multiple taxons and provide a broad spectrum of ecosystem services, with crucial feedbacks on biotic and abiotic factors(Díaz et al., 2007). Thus, the way in which trees respond to changes in climate has the potential to largely affect the delicate balance ruling ecosystem functioning (Cramer et al., 2001). A major current challenge for the research community is to depict the framework of such selective pressure over time as accurately as possible in sessile species like trees, which have a limited migration capacity. Plant species have developed two main mechanisms to cope with environmental changes (Pérez-Ramos et al., 2013). On the one hand, local adaptations occur when a population evolves through a natural selection process responding to specific ecological conditions (Ducousso et al., 1996), being climate the most pressing factor causing population differentiation (Méndez-Cea et al., 2023; Saxe et al., 2001). On the other hand, plants can also deal with these new conditions through phenotypic plasticity, which is the range of phenotypes that a single genotype can express as a function of its environment (Chevin et al., 2013; Nicotra and Davidson, 2010; Reed and Frankham, 2001). Identifying responses to ecosystem variations will require a deep understanding of the environmental changes induced in the phenotype for a given plant species or population. Although phenotypic plasticity was used to be regarded as noise, we currently know that it is genetically controlled, heritable and of potential relevance to species' evolution (Bradshaw, 2006; Lande, 2009). Gaining an improved understanding of how plant species can take advantage of these two mechanisms will be crucial for predicting changes in species distributions, community composition and tree productivity under future climate change scenarios. Natural differences in functional traits throughout the species distribution range can be selectively fixed by local environmental conditions. Thus, site-specific characteristics can drive the selection of given functional trait values that benefit tree performance in such an environment, giving rise to local adaptations. The Mediterranean biome has been widely acknowledged as a prominent hotspot of biodiversity (Myers et al., 2000), but also of vulnerability (Ochoa-Hueso et al., 2017). The Mediterranean basin is one of the European regions projected to be most impacted by climate change, with precipitation expected to decrease while temperature will rise causing an overall shortage in water availability as a result of increased evapotranspiration (Masson-Delmotte, 2021). Further, a higher frequency and severity of extreme droughts has been forecasted, especially during the summer season (Masson-Delmotte, 2021). These changes will imply strong consequences for Mediterranean forests and ecosystems (Martínez-Vilalta et al., 2012; Matías et al., 2019b; Vitale et al., 2012), as drought-related mortality has been found to be an emerging widespread event with critical implications for forest conservation (Hartmann et al., 2018). If these changes are as abrupt as projected, plant populations climatic boundaries may move faster than forest tree species can migrate (Higgins and Harte, 2006). Thus, the survival of forest tree species will depend in the short term on evolutionary change (Etterson and Shaw, 2001) through their phenotypic plasticity and their intra-specific genetic variation for adaptive traits (Marchin et al., 2008). For these reasons, great attention is being paid to disentangle the range dynamics of tree species, their forecasted patterns and adaptive functional traits in the Mediterranean region (Matías et al., 2019b; Morillas et al., 2023). Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is an iconic evergreen tree species typical of forest landscapes in the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula and at the north of Morocco. These forests not only hold a rich biodiversity and drive extensive and relevant ecological processes (e. g. carbon storage, water retention, nutrient cycling, soil conservation…), but they also have an important role in the local economy for many Mediterranean countries by the production of a renewable resource as cork (Ibáñez et al., 2014; Marras et al., 2014; Petroselli et al., 2013). Considering its significant implications for biodiversity, provision of ecosystem services and socio-economic interests, together with the alarming declining trends that this species is currently suffering (Catalão et al., 2022; Dorado et al., 2023; Matías et al., 2019a), it is of paramount importance to understand the potential scenarios that cork oak will face in the near future to address conservation and restoration programs (Beaumont et al., 2007; Keenan et al., 2011). Despite cork oak is well adapted to water stress conditions through drought-adapted morphological traits (Morillas et al., 2023) and the activation of several physiological mechanisms to limit water evaporation (Lobo-do-Vale et al., 2023; Mediavilla et al., 2019), soil moisture seems to be the main constraining factor determining its geographical distribution. Previous research in common gardens proved that different cork oak populations across the distribution range display large variation in growth, morphological traits and survival (Gandour et al., 2007; Matías et al., 2019b; Morillas et al., 2023; Ramírez-Valiente et al., 2014, 2010). Adaptation to contrasting water availabilities has been proposed as the major mechanism responsible for the differences found in functional traits among populations (Matías et al., 2019b; Morillas et al., 2023). In Mediterranean environments, soil water availability is the most constraining factor determining plant species growth, reproduction, and survival (Gulías et al., 2002). Thus, tree fitness in these areas is largely affected by physiological traits controlling water loss such as the efficiency in the use of water (WUE) and the capacity of water transport through stomata (GSW), but also physiological traits involved in carbon uptake such as the maximum capacity to fix carbon (Amax). Besides, a combination of intracellular chemical reactions are also part of the plant's response to water stress (Porth et al., 2005). Given their important role, some of these traits have been suggested to have an adaptive value for cork oak under water stress (Matías et al., 2019b) and can be expected to be under selection in a water shortage context. However, the physiological and chemical responses of cork oaks to the forecasted increased drought are far from being fully understood. The aim of this research was to explore the role of a number of physiological traits and markers of oxidative stress potentially involved in cork oak's drought resistance and their prevalence in natural populations located along the cork oak´s latitudinal distribution. Namely, we quantified the functional responses of cork oak seedlings to the effect of increasingly severe levels of experimental drought and their resistance ability to a terminal drought. For this purpose, a controlled-conditions experiment was performed using acorns collected from nine populations of cork oak encompassing the complete latitudinal distribution of the species. The emerging seedlings were subjected to four different levels of water availability and following this phase, a terminal drought period was imposed. This approach allowed us to pinpoint the most vulnerable populations to water stress with implications for planning management strategies under a climate change context. We hypothesized that (i) Differences in water availability during the growing season will modulate the carbon uptake capacity and water use efficiency of cork oak seedlings, resulting in differential markers of oxidative stress. We also predicted that (ii) populations located in drier areas will display higher efficiency in the use of water during the growing period. Lastly, we projected that (iii) cork oak populations located near the southern limit of the species’ distribution range will have developed physiological local adaptations to water shortage, making them less vulnerable to our experimental terminal drought compared to populations located in the central or northern parts of the distribution. Materials and methods Focal species and study sites Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is an emblematic evergreen tree species widely distributed in the Mediterranean biome, chosen as focal species for this study. To explore the role of local adaptations to drought conditions through the cork oak´s distribution range, we selected nine populations along its latitudinal distribution gradient separated approximately 1° in latitude (Fig. 1, Table A.1). In November-December 2020 and following the natural ripening period of the species across its distribution range, we randomly selected five trees per population, with a minimum separation among them of 50 m, to account for the spatial variability of the sampling area. Fifty mature acorns per tree were collected, their viability was tested by the flotation method following Gribko (1995) and viable acorns were stored in wet vermiculite at 5 °C until sowing.

The location of the source populations is indicated by black dots: ARN, ALF, VAL, MER, CAL, HIN, ALC, Cha and TAZ, sorted out from north to south, being ARN and TAZ the northern and southern most populations, respectively. Distribution data obtained from Caudullo et al. (2017). Experimental design The experiment was performed at the greenhouse facilities of the University of Seville (CITIUS II), located at the city of Seville (Spain; 37°21′31″N 5°59′13″W) from January to September 2021. Temperature was stable throughout the experiment (25 °C in the day and 15 °C at night) and light conditions mimicked the forest understory (PAR 516.7 μmol m − 2 s − 1 ± 50.13) with natural daily duration. The experiment covered the first spring and summer of life of tree seedlings, the most critical stage in the ontogeny of Mediterranean woody species (Mendoza et al., 2009). In January 2021, 360 tubular pots (15 cm in diameter and 20 cm height) were filled with a peat and river sand mixture (proportion 3:1 per volume) to allow a non-limiting nutrient availability and adequate drainage conditions. One individual acorn was sown per pot at 2 cm depth, 8 pots per mother tree, making a total of 40 pots per latitudinal population. To allow natural mycorrhization, all pots were watered with 300 ml of a soil microbial inoculum obtained from the maceration of 10 kg of soil collected under the canopy of natural Q. suber adult trees on 100 l of water for 48 h (Matías and Jump, 2014). This soil was collected from Doñana National Park (SW Spain), a central population to the latitudinal gradient of distribution, and was analyzed to assure the absence of the soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi (Sánchez et al., 2002). All pots were weekly irrigated at 100 % of soil water holding capacity (WHC, estimated as the amount of water (g) that the substrate held following water saturation) until 80 % of the seedlings emerged, which occurred after 13 weeks (April 2021). After this initial experimental phase under optimal conditions, we simulated four different watering scenarios, each of them with 10 replicates: 1) 100 % of WHC, corresponding with a rainy growing season where soils remain wet most of the time, simulated through an irrigation until field capacity twice per week; 2) 50 % of WHC, simulating average moisture availability conditions in a cork oak forest during the spring season (Pérez-Ramos and Marañón, 2012); 3) 25 % of WHC, simulating a reduction of approximately 30 % over the previous scenario and according with the projections of the A1B scenario for the Mediterranean area at the end of the current century (Giorgi and Lionello, 2008); 4) 10 % of WHC, corresponding with an infrequently dry spring, an extreme event that is expected to become more usual in the coming years (Mildrexler et al., 2018). These watering treatments were applied to experimental pots by adding a constant amount of water to all seedlings within the same watering level from 12 April to 1 July 2021, simulating the natural growing season. Following this differential treatment, watering was completely stopped simulating an extreme drought period and seedlings were subjected to a progressive drought until death (terminal drought hereafter) to determine seedling resistance to extreme drought conditions across provenances and watering levels. To determine the effectiveness of the watering treatments, soil moisture was measured twice a week using a ML3 Theta Probe soil moisture sensor (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) on the top 10 cm. To avoid the potential effect of small differences in environmental conditions, the position of every pot was randomly rotated monthly. Seedling survival was weekly monitored until all of them were dead. Analyses of physiological traits, markers of oxidative stress and aboveground biomass in response to drought Maximum leaf-level photosynthesis capacity (Amax), stomatal conductance (GSW) and ambient to leaf CO2 difference (Ca) were measured on three to four individuals per provenance and watering treatment combination every fortnight before the onset of the extreme drought period (1st of July) and weekly along this period until the number of surviving seedlings prevented continuing with these measures. Gas exchange measurements were performed in randomly selected, fully expanded leaves by using a LI-6800 infrared gas-exchange analyzer system (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). These measurements took place between 10:00 h and 14:00 h using a multiphase flash fluorometer chamber fitted at 400 ppm reference CO2 concentration, 1500 μmol m − 2 s − 1 light-saturating photosynthetic photon flux density, block temperature at 25 °C to match ambient air temperature, and relative humidity on full scrub. Plant stress at the end of the terminal drought was estimated through the analysis of the oxidative stress metabolite malondialdehyde (MDA), which is a useful marker of general lipid peroxidation. Also, the accumulation of the compatible organic solute proline was quantified. For doing this, we selected a random subset of three seedlings per provenance and watering treatment combination. The crude extracts for both metabolic determinations were obtained grinding 0.1 g of fresh leaves tissue with 2 ml of Ethanol 80 % (v/v). The homogenate was soaked at room temperature for 1 hour and finally centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min; the supernatant was used as a crude extract. The level of lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring MDA concentration with the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method (Hodges et al., 1999). Proline was quantified as described by Pérez-López et al. (2023). Aliquots of 50 μL of ethanolic extract were added to 100 μL of reaction mix [ninhydrin 1% (w/v) in acetic acid 60% (v/v), ethanol 20% (v/v)] and heated at 95 °C for 20 min. After cooling, the absorbance of the reaction was measured at 520 nm. Proline concentration was determined from a standard curve. As proline levels were reported on fresh weight, the reduced plant relative water content responding to the experimental drought may have underestimated its concentration in the high watering treatments. For the analysis of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content in leaves and the relative abundance of 13C (δ13C), 5 leaves of eight saplings per provenance and watering treatment combination were ground to powder following sapling death as result of the extreme drought period. Total carbon and nitrogen as well as the bulk isotopic composition were determined in these samples by dry combustion in a Flash 2000 elemental micro-analyzer coupled via ConFlo IV interface to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Carbon isotopic ratio is reported as part per thousand deviations (expressed as δ values) referred to appropriate IAEA standards: (A1) where R is the 13C/12C ratio. The standard deviations of δ13C were lower than ± 0.05 ‰. The total C and N values were used for the computation of the leaf C:N ratio for each experimental treatment and provenance. These variables inform about water stress (proline, MDA), the efficiency in the use of water (δ13C), plant nutrition status (C:N), the maximum capacity to fix carbon (Amax), the capacity of water transport through stomata (GSW) and the ratio between intercellular CO2 (Ci) and ambient CO2 (Ca) concentration (Ci/Ca). The relevance of the latest variable lies in photosynthesis studies that proved that plants do not directly sense ambient CO2 in the air (Ca) but rather use intercellular CO2 (Ci) (Landsberg and Sands, 2011), which makes this index important for photosynthetic research. Following the terminal drought, dead seedlings were harvested and separated into stem, leaf and root fractions. We weighed the total aboveground biomass (g) corresponding to the sum of the shoot and leaf tissues. Data and statistical analysis Variations among provenances and water treatments during the experiment in soil moisture, photosynthetic rate (Amax), stomatal conductance (GSW) and the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 (Ci/Ca) were tested using repeated-measures analyses of variance (rm-ANOVA) with provenance and watering treatment as between-subject factors and time as a within-subject factor. Data were checked for conformity with rm-ANOVA assumptions using Shapiro–Wilk normality test and Mauchly's test of sphericity. Normality tests of the residuals by time point indicated that they followed approximately a normal distribution. When sphericity could not be ensured, a Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied. Pairwise comparisons were conducted by comparing main effects through post hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction. To investigate interactions among provenances, watering levels and time, data were divided into subsets according to different provenances and then were subjected to rm-ANOVA. We analysed the effect of geographical provenance and water availability during the growing period on seedling physiology by using linear models including provenance, watering treatments and their interaction as fixed factors to explore variations in proline, MDA, carbon isotopic discrimination levels, leaf C:N and aboveground biomass. The Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) was applied to choose the best model, i.e. lower AICc (Burnham and Anderson, 2004). The difference in AICc between the best model and the null model is provided by ΔAICc. R2 indicates the proportion of variability in the outcome explained by the predictors (fixed effects). When data did not follow normality and/or homoscedasticity criteria, transformations were performed. When significant interactions between provenance and water treatments were detected, the post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons for each provenance were conducted to allow for more specific comparison. In the cases in which these interactions were not significant, the post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons were carried out for each variable with the whole dataset. All analyses were performed in R statistical software version 4.2.1 (R Development Core Team, 2022). All values are given as mean ± SE. Results Soil moisture Watering levels applied during the experiment resulted in different values of soil moisture across treatments, progressively decreasing from 100 to 10 WHC levels during the whole treatment application (100 WHC: 26.2 ± 0.13 %; 50 WHC: 16.6 ± 0.09 %; 25 WHC: 9.9 ± 0.07 %; 10 WHC: 7.0 ± 0.08 %; Table 1). By contrast, we found no differences in soil moisture among pots containing seedlings from the different provenances (Table 1). Table 1.

Both sapling photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were lowest for the southern provenances and gradually increased in northern provenances, whereas the opposite trend was found for Ci/Ca concentration (Figs. 2a, 3 and A.1a). Rising soil water content from 10 to 100 % WHC resulted in progressively increased photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance (Figs. 2b and A.1b) and decreased Ci/Ca concentration (Fig. 3). Regardless of the seedling provenance or water availability treatment, both photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance dropped over time when subjecting seedlings to extreme drought (Figs. 2 and A.1). The contrary evolution was observed for Ci/Ca concentration, increasing over time in response to water limitation (Fig. 3). Although interactions between time and provenance and time and water treatment were detected frequently for these physiological variables, no significant interactions between provenance and water treatment were found for any of them (Table 1). The triple interaction between time, provenance and watering treatment was only detected for Ci/Ca concentration (Table 1), and the analysis of the independent subsets showed that water availability yielded differential Ci/Ca concentration values for all provenances excepting for two of them (Fig. 3c and 3h, see Tukey post hoc test at the figure caption).

Physiological responses and changes in markers of oxidative stress to water availability across the distribution range Watering treatments applied during the experiment significantly affected all the analyzed functional traits considered in this study, except for leaf C:N ratio (Table 2, Table A.1, Table A.2 and Table A.3). Seed provenance was also found to be a key factor for most of these variables when responding to differential water availability, as it was included in the best model for all explored variables excepting for MDA (Table 2, A.3). We found a significant interaction between provenance and watering treatment for proline levels (Table 2). Thus, the independent analysis of each population revealed that watering availability determined proline concentration across provenances with the exception of population “ALC”, which was unaffected by water conditions (Tables 2, A.1). Accordingly, the treatment 10 % WHC dramatically increased proline concentration for all populations excepting “ARN” and “ALC”. Low watering availability consistently yielded increased proline, MDA and carbon isotopic discrimination levels (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Seedlings from northern provenance displayed more negative values of δ13C compared to those with southern provenance (Fig. 5a). It is worth noting that we did not find differences between the treatments 50 and 100 % WHC for any of the explored variables (Fig. 4 and 5). Plants with southern provenance developed higher aboveground biomass related to those with northern provenance, whereas high water availability consistently resulted in increased aboveground biomass for all provenances (Fig. 6).

Discussion Functional responses to water availability We investigated the physiological responses and changes in markers of oxidative stress of cork oak to both different water availability levels and to a terminal drought to explore the specie´s drought tolerance and its prevalence in natural populations. In increasingly arid Mediterranean forests, water is deemed the most constraining environmental factor for primary production (Austin et al., 2004). It was therefore expected that different levels of water availability during the cork oak seedling´s early development would modulate its physiological performance determining the carbon uptake capacity and water use efficiency of the seedling and eventually resulting in differential markers of oxidative stress. Results of our study fully supported our first hypothesis. We found a significant effect of water availability for all explored physiological variables (Table 1). Cork oak seedlings displayed increasing levels of stomatal inhibition (Figure A. 1. b) and hence a reduction in carbon assimilation (Fig. 2b) when subjected to more restrictive water shortage (i.e., 25 % and 10 % of water holding capacity). The inclusion of the factor “water treatment” in the best linear model for markers of oxidative stress and δ13C (Table 2) supports the large seedling plasticity to face with differential water availability. The highest values of proline and MDA, which levels depend on specific plant responses to water stress, were reported under the most restrictive water limitation treatment (Fig. 4a and b). Overproduction of these molecules has been previously identified as a biochemical process in plants responding to water stress. Proline is an amino acid that acts as an osmoprotectant to keep stable levels of water in the cytoplasm (Ahmed et al., 2009) and to prevent protein denaturation and cell membrane damage by promoting stability in the structure of enzymes and protecting their activity (Hessini et al., 2009). Previous work in cork oak observed a negative correlation between relative water content and proline accumulation in leaves, suggesting that proline amount is directly related to drought stress tolerance (Kwak et al., 2011). On the contrary, other authors provided evidence that proline is a good stress indicator but not always a good tolerance marker (Hnilickova et al., 2021). Intracellular proline also serves as a carbon and nitrogen reserve and, after water deficit, the proline catabolism may be essential for the recovery and restoration of cell homeostasis (Ashraf and Foolad, 2007; Kwak et al., 2011). The production of reactive oxygen species directly damages cell membrane phospholipids and increases lipid peroxidation (Zarafshar et al., 2014). Overall, the content of MDA is a measure of the degree of lipid peroxidation and is a useful marker of oxidative stress (Lima et al., 2002). Our results are supported by previous studies which have reported a similar increase in proline and MDA content in plants displaying specific responses to water stress (Liu et al., 2011), and in particular in other oak species (Cotrozzi et al., 2016; Jafarnia et al., 2018). Drought stress leads to an increase of ROS, which activates the antioxidant system to limit ROS accumulation. This system includes enzymatic and non-enzymatic components. Proline can act as an effective antioxidant molecule, protecting plants from ROS under water stress and reducing the MDA content and its deleterious effects (Szabados & Savouré, 2010; Hnilickova et al., 2021). It is important to note that the populations with the lowest levels of proline (ARN and ALC) showed high MDA content. This result suggests that proline plays a key role in reducing the deleterious consequences of ROS derivatives caused by water stress in both genotypes. The same pattern was found in the carbon isotopic discrimination analyses. The less negative δ13C values reported for seedlings subjected to the lowest water availability (Fig. 5a) indicate a higher capacity to fix carbon per unit of water loss (i.e., a higher water use efficiency; Farquhar et al., 1989). This result implies that cork oak seedlings are able to modulate their water use efficiency according to climatic conditions, buffering the effects of the projected aridity to some extent and keep fixing carbon for a longer period, and highlights the natural drought tolerance of this species. As leaf nitrogen content positively determines the biochemical efficiency of carbon assimilation, the C:N ratio may have been related to the assimilation rate achieved for a given stomatal conductance. However, the C:N ratio showed no trend with water availability in our study (Fig. 5b). In line with this result, previous research did not find a correlation between N mass and rainfall for other plant species (Wright et al., 2005) or for cork oaks (Gouveia and Freitas, 2009). Even though the watering treatment applied to the seedlings produced a homogeneous response through all the explored variables, it is interesting to note that differences between saturated soil at 100% and 50% of water holding capacity were not found for any physiological traits or markers of oxidative stress (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and A.1). This finding supports the notion that cork oaks are highly plastic plant species deeply adapted to water-limited environments. According to our results, a dramatic reduction in water availability (25% of soil water holding capacity) is required to significantly affect the physiology or chemical functioning of this drought-tolerant plant species. As expected, aboveground growth of cork oak seedlings from all provenances significantly declined when exposed to severe water limitations compared with non-stressed seedlings (Fig. 6). The reduction in plant growth is a frequent response to water shortage as a result of restrained photosynthesis (Ghanbary et al., 2017). Differences among provenances in drought-resistance strategies Cork oak seedlings exhibited a contrasting response to water availability across provenances, which suggested differential mechanisms to cope with water shortage throughout the cork oak´s latitudinal distribution. It is worth noting that, although “provenance” was included in the best model for proline (Table 2), we found no geographical trend (i.e., no differences between northern and southern populations). Accordingly, the factor “provenance” was not accounted for in the best model for MDA (Table 2). Therefore, our results point out that cork oak populations coming from the whole species’ distribution range suffered the same level of water stress when subjecting for a common watering level, regardless of their provenance. Despite this fact, seedlings from different provenance presented differential local adaptations to water shortage. Seedlings from northern provenance, historically less constrained by water, displayed lower stomatal limitations (Figure A. 1 a) and higher levels of photosynthetic rates (Fig. 2a) allowing them to fix carbon for a longer period. However, seedlings from the southern edge, adapted to frequent and severe drought, presented higher water use efficiency (Fig. 5a) which was ultimately translated into larger biomass (Fig. 6). These results support our hypothesis proposing the presence of differential physiological local adaptations to water shortage throughout the species’ distribution range. Physiological traits values were not consistent throughout the cork oak´s distribution range, showing increased performance in northern populations compared to southern ones in terms of gas exchange parameters (including photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, Figs. 2a and A. 1 a). However, a common pattern emerged among provenances for these variables, as evidenced for a significant decline in all populations when responding to the terminal drought (Figs. 2a and A.1 a), whereas Ci/Ca concentration consistently increased regardless the provenance (Fig. 3). The gradual decrease of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate with increasing water deficit is a characteristic response of plants in general and oak species in particular (Cotrozzi et al., 2016; Ghanbary et al., 2017), and one of the main physiological strategies to cope with drought. Imposed drought effects were most severe for the southernmost populations (ALC, CHA and TAZ), with reductions of the stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity of oak seedlings reaching negative values (Figs. 2a and A. 1 a). Interestingly, this diminished physiological performance of southern populations was noted from the emergence phase, even before the application of the watering treatments. Thus, southern seedlings showed a conservative strategy for stomata control in response to changes in soil water availability in order to reduce transpiration under water stress. Stomatal conductance is a main driver of hydraulic changes that determine the plant response to environmental stress and is tightly correlated with carbon fixation (Flexas et al., 2014). A close relationship between photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance as observed in this study, was reported by other studies in Quercus species (Damesin and Rambal, 1995; Peñuelas et al., 1998) and in cork oak (Faria et al., 1998). The reduced photosynthetic rate responding to water stress could be due to the decrease in stomatal conductance, but also to mesophilic changes such as changes in the intercellular CO2 concentration (Cotrozzi et al., 2016), finally leading to a reduction in photochemical efficiency of photosystem II. The response of photosynthesis to water shortage in Quercus species growing under natural conditions has been extensively reported (Damesin and Rambal, 1995; Faria et al., 1998; Salleo and Gullo, 1990). Negative photosynthetic values during the terminal drought period in the southernmost populations imply that leaf respiration predominates over photosynthesis (Gallé et al., 2007) and there is a net carbon loss, which would eventually lead to carbon starvation and plant death (McDowell et al., 2008). Conversely, we found that seedlings from northern provenance maintained positive carbon assimilation when subjected to the same terminal drought, being able to keep the carbon gain for a longer period regardless of the water shortage (Figs. 2 and A. 1). This result directly relates to the pattern found in our previous report, which described how cork oak seedlings from the northern distribution range had a higher survival rate compared to those from the south (Morillas et al., 2023). Given the paramount importance of water availability for plant performance, we expected that cork oak southern populations influenced by drier climate would display higher efficiency in the use of water compared to northern populations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found a clear trend towards less negative δ13C values in the southern populations (Fig. 5) supported by the inclusion of the “provenance” factor in the best linear model for this variable (Table 2). This result supports a marked geographical increase in the water use efficiency with decreasing latitude across the species’ distribution range. We further found that lower water availability yielded less negative δ13C values (Fig. 5). The fact that this pattern was consistent across populations implies that seedlings from the whole distribution range can modulate their water use efficiency according to environmental conditions. Cork oak has been previously acknowledged as a highly plastic drought-resistant species, which can display a conservative water use (Besson et al., 2014; Grant et al., 2010). The significant increase of δ13C values in cork oak leaves towards the most xeric end of our gradient (Fig. 5) suggests that this species can largely adjust the gaseous exchange at the leaf level according to local water availability. Thus, southern populations of cork oaks may maintain carbon assimilation by minimizing water loss through fine-tuned stomatal control (Otieno et al., 2007) and by extracting water from deep soil reserves (David et al., 2007; Kurz-Besson et al., 2006), resulting in higher water use efficiency. These findings concur with our previous report in which we found that the same cork oak southern populations analyzed in this study showed a clear trend toward maximizing traits related with belowground growth (i.e., root surface area, root average diameter and root volume) to increase deep water uptake (Morillas et al., 2023). Our findings are in line with previous research relating increased water use efficiency values to local aridity for the studied species (Gouveia and Freitas, 2009) and other tree species (Damesin et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999; Pérez-Ramos et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2003), and imply that not all cork oak populations are equally vulnerable to water stress. In this study, we found that cork oak seedlings originating from the southern distribution range displayed larger aboveground biomass than those from the northern distribution area (Fig. 6). These results are in agreement with our previous report in which we identified the larger acorn size found in the southern populations as a determining trait influencing cork oak seedling growth in this same study area (Morillas et al., 2023). The relevance of seed size for seedling growth has been previously acknowledged by large empirical evidence (Baraloto et al., 2005; Pérez-Ramos et al., 2010; Ramírez-Valiente et al., 2009). Another factor potentially contributing to the differential aboveground biomass developed across provenances is the contrasting water use efficiency displayed by cork oak populations distributed throughout the species distribution range. The positive relationship between water use efficiency and aboveground biomass reported in this study would allow seedlings from southern provenance to fix a larger amount of carbon per unit of water transpired, which would eventually result in larger biomass compared to seedlings from northern provenance. Although most of studies exploring the relationship between water use efficiency and aboveground growth or biomass in water-limited environments report a positive relationship (e.g., Dudley, 1996b, 1996a; Ludwig et al., 2004), some studies yielded neutral (Ludwig et al., 2004) or even negative relationships (Donovan et al., 2007). Conclusions The results of this research support the presence of a marked geographical gradient of physiological adaptations to water stress across the complete latitudinal distribution of cork oak. Despite that the analysis of the stress indicator metabolites (proline and MDA) ruled out the differential water stress level among northern and southern provenances, seedlings from the southern limit seem to be less vulnerable to experimental drought compared to populations located in the central or northern parts of the distribution. Southern seedlings exhibited local adaptations to water shortage such as a higher sensitivity of stomata to changes in soil humidity, adjusting a better stomatal control of transpiration in response to drought, which allows for a fine-tuned physiological performance. Accordingly, seedlings from the more xeric provenance at the southern edge displayed the highest water use efficiency, increasing thus their resistance to drought. These physiological adaptations of southern-range seedlings to local conditions, along with other morphological traits related to drought resistance (i.e., larger acorn size or root investment, Morillas et al., 2023), resulted in larger aboveground biomass and higher drought resistance at the southern distribution limit (Matías et al., 2019b). Beyond these geographical differences, we also found evidence for phenotypic plasticity in terms of physiological traits in the response of cork oak seedlings to different levels of water availability. Thus, the plasticity of the different cork oak ecotypes, and in particular physiological traits, may be used to buffer the response of tree populations under a global change scenario, where extreme drought events are expected to increase in severity and frequency. Our results suggest that despite the potential impact of increasing aridity on the northern most populations, the southern populations may hold genetic diversity that would influence the potential of the species to adapt to novel conditions. The intraspecific genetic diversity harbored by southern populations may provide an important adaptive advantage in response to the forecasted increased drought in the Mediterranean Basin. Thus, this ecotype plays an important role in terms of biodiversity conservation and features a high potential for restoration programs in more xeric environments. Notably, these areas are worthy of deeper scientific research and public awareness for preserving cork oak populations from extinction.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

This technological integration opened up new possibilities in many disciplines including healthcare and well-being. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs and providing improved and reliable services, several healthcare frameworks based on Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) have been developed. However, due to the critical and heterogeneous nature of healthcare data, maintaining high quality of service (QoS)-in terms of faster responsiveness and data-specific complex analytics-has always been the main challenge in designing such systems.

Introduction With the sudden growth of electronic devices and improved connectivity of the Internet, nowadays more devices are connected to the Internet than people [1]. This has been facilitated by a concept, called “Internet of Things” or IoT, which was coined back in 1999 by Kevin Ashton and was meant to connect Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices in the supply chain of a consumer goods manufacturer [2]. However, currently the term is used in almost every field to describe a network of communicable devices [3], [4]. In recent years, IoT enabled devices have emerged exponentially and the estimated number of connected devices are to exceed 28 billion by 2021 [see Fig. 1(a)]. As a technology, the IoT has been adopted at a varied pace among different industries and sectors with their respective applications. The healthcare sector, which is slow in adopting new technologies, however, shows an incredible estimated growth and is expected to have over 50 million connected devices worldwide by 2021 [see Fig. 1(b)] [5]. Also, different application domains in healthcare have shown varied opportunities in applying IoT and, as per the current trend, the smart healthcare products application domain [e.g., smart pills, smart dispensing devices and syringes, smart monitoring devices, smart RFID cabinets, electronic health record (eHR), etc.] is the hottest [see Fig. 1(c)] [6]. Fig. 1. Global connectivity through IoT devices. (a) Global estimation of connected IoT devices by the year 2021. (b) Global estimation of IoHT devices by the year 2021. (c) Heatmap of current IoHT application opportunities. Show All Considering the increase of life expectancy, the Population Reference Bureau projected that by 2050 the World’s population will grow by 31% reaching 9.8 billion [7]. With this unprecedented growth rate, the older population (aged 65 and over) is expected to raise 16% more than the total population between 2025 and 2050 [8]. This will eventually result in increased vulnerability of the aging population toward chronic diseases which is expected to account for 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden diseases by 2020 [9]. On the other hand, as predicted by the World Health Organization, there will be a distressing shortage of 12.9 million healthcare workforce worldwide by 2035 [10]. Hence, energy-efficient, low cost, and scalable healthcare solutions are needed to meet the shortage of healthcare workforce to support disease prevention, treatment, care, and cure. Leveraging the fast advancements in information and communication technology, electronic healthcare ( e -healthcare) emerged itself as a revolutionary new paradigm [11]. Following the technological improvements, e -healthcare is rapidly swapping the means of conventional healthcare [12], and fostering development of novel healthcare applications [13]. In this ever changing scenario of healthcare, IoT plays a key role [14] in redefining e -healthcare as the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT), where both people and devices interact, communicate, collect, and exchange data through integration of physical objects, hardware, softwares, and computing devices [15]. Connecting the digital world to the physical world [16], IoHT—with the help of pervasive and ubiquitous computing, and e -healthcare systems—allows healthcare devices (e.g., Fitbits, sensors, Bluetooth, mobile devices, etc.) to collect health related information (e.g., blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, weight, glucose level, respiratory and heart rate, etc.) [17], [18] over an extended period of time and save as eHR. However, the various players of the e -healthcare ecosystem generate a large amount of heterogeneous, multidimensional and multimodal data databasing which is a big challenge [19], [20]. In North America, during 2010 to 2015, the volume of healthcare data raised from 3 million Terabyte (TB) to 14 million TB [see Fig. 2(a)] [21] with general unstructured data and eHR had an incredible increment from 0.95 millon TB in 2010 to 3.26 million TB in 2015 [see Fig. 2(b)] and from 0.22 millon TB in 2010 to 2.36 million TB in 2015 [see Fig. 2(c)], respectively. In order to process this huge volume of healthcare data, systems with enormous storage and processing power are needed which can analyze the big data, thus, cloud computing was used [22], [23]. Therefore, to shape next generation of e -healthcare systems, IoHT, big data, and cloud computing needed to converge to create the IoHT ecosystem [24]. Cloud computing plays a prominent role in the IoHT ecosystem by providing ubiquitous and on-demand access to shared pool of reconfigurable resources. Nonetheless, the current number of growing IoHT devices cause increasing latency due to network overloading, thus, reducing the suitability of the system for real-time applications. To overcome this situation, the concept of fog computing was introduced, by Cisco Systems Inc., in 2012, which complemented the cloud by providing a substantial amount of storage, communication control, configuration, measurement and management at the edge devices [25], [26]. The concept of fog computing is to deploy cloud-like services closer to user end for local storage and preliminary data processing to reduce congestion and latency. The added flexibility of computation, geographical distribution and user mobility support make fog computing appealing for healthcare related applications which require secure data transfer with low latency [27]. However, fog computing architecture may susceptible to single point of failure as it mostly depends on gateway device [28]. To further increase the response time by reducing the data traffic on fog nodes in local networks, mist computing can be used to create an integrated network [29] which bridges the IoHT devices to the virtual computing world, thus, reducing the response latency and enhancing the performance and lifetime of IoHT devices. Fig. 2. Estimated data volume generated by different healthcare applications at North America between 2010 and 2015. (a) Aggregated volume of healthcare data, (b) volume of general unstructured data only, and (c) volume of electronic health records data only. Show All Different data types and applications of the IoHT ecosystem require different processing and response times. To this aim, this paper proposes a novel heterogeneous cloud-based IoHT communication framework supported by fog and mist computing. This heterogeneous IoHT framework consists of five layers—perception, mist, fog, cloud, and application. The novelty of this architecture lies in its capability to handle separately data routing paths for different data types coming from real-time as well as conventional data sources, optimally balance the network load on demand, and optimally allocate network resources as needed. The obtained results show that the proposed IoHT framework provides better quality of service (QoS) with low power consumption and reduced latency, thus, improving the existing e -healthcare systems. SECTION II. State-of-the-Art of IoHT Frameworks Majority of the contributions concerning IoHT frameworks have been in integrating IoT technology to healthcare systems. Islam et al. [14] surveyed diverse aspects of IoT-based healthcare technologies with descriptions of various existing network architectures, platforms, industrial trends, and applications which facilitate healthcare solutions in the context of IoT. Additionally, the trends of IoT-based healthcare research activities were examined to showcase how IoT can address various healthcare issues like—pediatric and elderly care, private healthcare, chronic disease supervision and fitness management, and pointed out different research problems along with current security requirements and challenges. Through a brief discussion on an intelligent collaborative security model, the authors provided means for anomaly detection. The survey concluded with some e -health and IoT policies and regulations across the world to healthcare stakeholders better understand IoT-based healthcare technologies for sustainable development [14]. IoT enabled personalized healthcare systems (PHS) were systematically reviewed by Qi et al. [30], where the authors focused on identifying the breadth and diversity of existing IoT enabled PHS, the underlying key technologies along with their applications and case studies on healthcare, and listed future research trends and challenges. Farahani et al. [31] surveyed the existing literature on IoT related e -healthcare systems from a viewpoint of transitioning from the conventional clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric treatment. The authors discussed existing challenges of IoT-based e -healthcare systems and proposed a multilayer e -healthcare ecosystem with their respective applications, such as, assisted living, mobile health, warning systems, e-medicine, and population monitoring. Kraemer et al. [32] were among the first to survey the benefits and challenges of fog computing within pervasive healthcare applications. The authors provided a summary of deployment scenarios, requirement of future healthcare and variety of fog processing tasks. Mutlag et al. [33] performed a systematic literature review of the existing technologies focusing on fog computing’s usage in the field of healthcare IoT systems. The study further identified the flaws of the current fog-based frameworks and provided some recommendations toward more secure and reliable IoT systems. Ahmad et al. [34] proposed HealthFog, a fog computing-based framework, capable of successfully removing additional E2E communication costs in comparison to their counterparts. Their framework also ensured enhanced privacy and security using cryptographic primitives. To enhance reliability of IoT architecture for healthcare, Rahmani et al. [35] combined fog computing with smart e-Health gateways and demonstrated that the proposed system is capable of coping with many challenges of pervasive healthcare systems. They also implemented it as an IoT-based early warning score health monitoring system. In addition to the studies mentioned above, other reported works on IoT-based healthcare include: emergency medical service [36], smart rehabilitation system [37], do-it-yourself solution focusing on patient oriented infrastructure development [38], smart hospital system [39], anomaly detection [40], body sensor network-based healthcare system [41], cardiac arrhythmia management system [42], and self-aware early warning system [43]. Laplante and Laplante discussed about their view on negetive effects of IoT in healthcare and showcased an example of the dissociation between patient and caregiver resulting in loss of care [44]. With the growing amount of data, their processing and storage requirements also escalated. To tackle this need, the IoT-based healthcare systems were integrated into more extensive cloud computing architectures. This integration of “IoT” and “Cloud computing” has contributed toward the development of many innovative solutions [45]–[47] spanning in different fields including e -healthcare. With the aim of seamless integration of various remote health monitoring techniques (e.g., sensing analytics, visualization, etc.), Hassanalieragh et al. [48] discussed on the existing challenges related to such integration and their views on integrating those techniques in the clinical practice. Biswas et al. introduced e -health cloud, a three-layered cloud-based framework—capable of mining eHR data—where the network layer was designed using Rich Internet Application1-based client, the server layer with SimpleDB,2 and a logic layer [49]. Pathinarupothi et al. [50] presented a multilayered architecture consisting of IoT devices coupled with body sensors which was implemented to remotely monitor cardiac patients. The cloud HealthIIoT (Health-care Industrial IoT) framework proposed by Hossain and Muhammad [51] transmitted healthcare data securely to the cloud to be accessed by healhcare professionals, and was validated through an IoT driven ECG-based health monitoring application. Suciu et al. proposed an e -health architecture based on exalead cloudview3 which securely integrates big data analytics with cloud-based Remote Telemetry Units4 [52]. Ma et al. [53] proposed a four-layered big health application, system supported by IoHT and big data, for remote disease diagnosis, smart clothing-based healthcare, LTE assisted telemedicine, and robotic interactions. Similar frameworks include: monitoring systems for chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases through IoT sensors [54], mobile healthcare systems for patient monitoring using big data analytics applied on sensor data [55], [56], heterogeneous healthcare big data analytics system for decision making in risk management and patient care [57]. The cloud can also be deployed to process and manage the IoT data online [58], [59]. Dehury and Sahoo [60] implemented a cloud-based service management framework for analyzing real-time IoT data. Various cloud-IoT (cIoT) frameworks have been suggested for pervasive healthcare [61]–[63]. A case study of voice pathology monitoring was proposed using an cIoT model [64]. Bagula et al. [65] introduced cIoT model to prioritize situation aware patients. Hasan et al. [66] introduced a cIoT model, called Aura, which allowed mobile clients to create ad-hoc clouds using IoT devices in their adjacent environments and provided the clients full control of the range of analyses to be performed regardless of their physical locations. Many studies have been reported which utilized the cIoT model to remotely monitor patients [67]–[69] using: ECG android application [70] along with other helathcare data [51], FIWARE5 platform [71], and wearable sensors (IoT) and body area network [72]. Additionally, other cIoT frameworks include: personnel altering system regarding lifestyle diseases from physical activity data [73], [74], collecting real-time patient data from wireless body area network [75], accumulating physiological and healthcare data smart clothing with IoT sensors [76], [77], selecting personalized treatment plan [78], providing personalized medical diagnosis [79], supporting the physically challenged with assistive devices [80]. The transmission and processing latency is the major bottleneck for real-time handling of data in the cloud. Dastjerdi and Buyya [81] proposed fog computing along with edge and cloud computing to handle the big data generated by IoT sensors. Shi et al. [82] outlined the various characteristics of fog computing to manage real-time IoT healthcare data. A low-cost fog-IoT healthcare system was presented which collected the ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature using energy-efficient sensor nodes and analyzed those data for automatic decision making which can be given to appropriate caregivers in real-time [83]. SECTION III. Proposed IoHT Framework Large scale IoT implementation results in large number of connected devices. By default, most of these connected devices are with limited processing power and resources. But, the voluminous and heterogeneous data generated by these devices require efficient and data type specific processing. Centralized cloud-based IoT scheme brings out an effective solution in this regard. However, solo cloud dependent processing is constrained by latency and power consumption issues which can be solved—up to certain extent—by introducing a fog layer. The fog assisted IoT framework with smart gateways (as proposed in [35]) is an approach to enhance reliability, energy-efficiency and performance of IoT frameworks. Nonetheless, there are still QoS issues with sensitive data transmission and there is no need to process various types of data (e.g., delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive) in each layer of a framework. An effective solution to this problem is to allow the framework to be able to handle different types of “on demand” data processing in different layers. This has been achieved in the proposed framework consisting of five layers (perception, mist, fog, cloud, and application). The introduction of an additional layer (i.e., the mist layer) to the existing fog-based architecture reduces data volume to be transmitted by the IoT devices through rule-based preprocessing of data. This reduction in data volume in turn reduces power consumption of the IoT devices, and latency (processing as well as transmission) and computational complexity of the framework. Therefore, the proposed IoHT framework is capable of selecting appropriate data transmission policies based on the disparate data sources to minimize latency; ensuring optimal resource utilization through delegating and delivering processes to layers with relatively less loads; guaranteeing minimal transmission delay through appropriate load balancing; and assuring most favorable data-sensitive resource allocation for prioritized data transmission. The following sections describes the various components of the framework. A. Ecosystem An interoperable ecosystem consisting of diverse devices, applications, and back-end systems is essential for successful architectural design of an IoHT framework which will ensure undisrupted information flow for accurate and timely decision making [84], [85]. A conceptual overview of the proposed IoHT ecosystem is shown in Fig. 3. As the ecosystem diagram indicates, various IoHT stakeholders who reside at the outer circle (e.g., healthcare organizations and professionals, patients, applications, and information systems) connect to their relevant counterparts to the inner circles aiming seamless information exchange. Outer circle is the most interactive and responsive one with very little analytical capabilities. Gradually moving toward the inner circles, the analytical capabilities along with latency and data storage increase. So, to ensure delay tolerant data transmission of real-time data as well as big data, the proposed architecture adopts appropriate layer-specific data transmission polices. Fig. 3. Overview of an IoHT ecosystem with its various stakeholders which implements the proposed framework. Show All B. Network Architecture Fig. 4 shows the proposed IoHT framework’s architecture. The five layers are: 1) perception layer; 2) mist layer; 3) fog layer; 4) cloud layer; and 5) application layer. Each of these layers has been designed with predefined functionalities relevant to the IoHT framework’s data transmission and processing pipeline. Fig. 5 shows a block diagram with the functionality of individual layers. Fig. 4. Architecture of the proposed IoHT framework indicating different layers and possible connectivities among them. The arrow directions indicate the flow of data. Show All Fig. 5. Layer-wise functionality of the proposed IoHT framework. Show All 1) Perception Layer: The perception layer is the lowest layer of the proposed IoHT framework. This layer is responsible for recognizing physical objects, and gathering contextual and healthcare data from devices generating (near) real-time as well as nonreal-time data. The data are mainly measured from individuals and their surroundings through small sensors, embedded systems, RFID tags, and readers, small to medium to large diagnostic and healthcare devices, medical and clinical imaging devices, and any data acquisition and transmission enabled devices. These hardware devices are, in general, connected to the data communication network. Besides the real-time healthcare data, there are healthcare big data [e.g., structured eHR, electronic medical record (eMR), (non-)clinical/medical imaging data, unstructured clinical notes, etc.] which demand separate handling due to their requirement of advanced data analytics [86], [87]. In the proposed framework, both kinds of healthcare data are transmitted to specific overlaying layer (either mist or fog or cloud) based on the data type and their processing requirements. 2) Mist Layer: To facilitate time-critical data processing, the mist computing layer has been introduced in the model. Mist computing resides directly within the network fabric and operates on the extreme edge of it with the help of sensor and actuator controllers. This layer is responsible for performing basic rule-based preprocessing of the sensor data (e.g., data aggregation, fusion, and filtering). At the edge of the IoT network, a fair share of the “Things” are with limited resources (e.g., power, communication bandwidth, and memory). Mist computing contributes to optimal resource utilization of the Things. For example, since communication consumes ∼5× the power of computing, ensuring required transmission instead of on demand transmission will facilitate in optimizing the power consumption [88]. 3) Fog Layer: One of the main driving forces behind development of the IoT technology is the necessity to process data “on the fly” to detect anomalies, provide alerts at real-time, and activate necessary actions automatically. This clearly demands a system with high responsiveness and minimal latency. To this goal, using centralized cloud-based models are inappropriate due to their high latency. In such situations, decentralizing and delegating the processing loads on different layers based on the application’s demand is needed. The fog layer forms a decentralized architectural pattern for bringing computing resources and application services closer to the edge, thus, reducing the response latency. As for the functional components, the fog layer supports—local data storage, data filtering, data compression, data fusion, and intermediate data analytics to reduce disposable load on the cloud, improve system performance and QoS, and save backbone bandwidth. 4) Cloud Layer: The cloud layer is capable of connecting to perception layer, fog layer, and application layer. Aggregated healthcare data from fog layer are sent to the cloud layer for long-term storage, and big data and advanced analytics. Also data from nonsensor sources, such as eMR, eHR, e-prescription platform, etc. get seamlessly integrated at this layer. In order to extract meaningful insights from the heterogeneous healthcare data, the cloud layer performs various advanced data analytics including, machine learning, data mining, rule-based processing, and automated reasoning-based algorithms. However, delegating appropriate computing loads to fog layer and using cloud layer for computationally expensive operations will improve system performance. 5) Application Layer: The application layer is the topmost layer of the proposed IoHT framework. It provides user interfaces between the IoHT stakeholders/consumers and the framework itself to directly reflect the generated economic and social benefits. Through these user interfaces various healthcare applications are delivered to the respective stakeholders. This layer also provides access—subject to access rights and privileges—to relevant resources from the cloud or fog layer directly to the healthcare application developers and consumers. C. Data Transmission Policy To facilitate seamless communication of heterogeneous data, a data-centric transmission scheme has been utilized in the proposed five-layered architecture of the IoHT framework. The perception layer generates three possible types of delay-sensitive data, i.e., real-time, near-real-time, and offline/batch mode data. In order to achieve better QoS, reduced latency, and optimized power consumption, separate transmission paths for real-time data and big data have been used. Fig. 6 represents the transmission and processing flow of data in the proposed model. Based on data traffic and resource availability, the computational loads (e.g., rule-based preprocessing, pretrained machine learning, advanced machine learning, big data analytics, etc.) are delegated to an appropriate layer (either mist or fog or cloud) in the layered architecture. This resulted in different scenarios with specific transmission paths as detailed in the following sections and shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 6. Flowchart of data transmission and processing taking place at different layers of the IoHT framework. Show All Fig. 7. Possible data transmission and processing paths in the IoHT framework’s layer stack. Show All 1) Real-Time Data Transmission: a) Scenario 1: Many healthcare applications require data to be processed at real-time. In the proposed IoHT model, real-time data analytics are hosted at the closest possible location, where the data is generated. As indicated in Fig. 7 by the red-dashed lines with arrows, the generated time-sensitive sensor data are at first forwarded to the mist layer for preprocessing, followed by the fog layer for necessary intermediate analytics, and finally rendering decision to the application layer. For example, if a patient experiences high blood pressure fluctuations along with symptomatic discomforts, it is necessary to process the generated data and forward a decision to the caregiver as soon as possible to prevent a possible stroke. In this case, the preprocessed data from mist layer are further processed in fog layer and forwarded to the application layer for necessary actions by the stakeholders. b) Scenario 2: The intermediate data analytics performed at the fog layer is not sufficient for some healthcare applications. Rendering a decision for these types of applications may require big data analytics and advanced machine learning or long-term data storage for longitudinal studies. In those cases, data are offloaded to the cloud layer for the required processing, analysis, and storage. This transmission path is shown in Fig. 7 using the green dotted-dashed line with arrows. The data and the analysis results are usually stored in the cloud for further reference. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) service can be an example of this scenario. Medication for a particular disease needs diagnosis as well as patients previous history as ADR is inherently generic. So, in this case, data sensed from patient’s terminal are forwarded to mist layer for recognizing the drug. Later on, fog forwards the identified drug to the cloud, where after careful analysis of relevant eMR and allergy profiles the drug compatibility is decided and the decision is sent to the application layer to be accessed by the healthcare professionals. 2) Conventional Data Transmission: a) Scenario 3: Massive data generated from advanced medical instruments, test results, eMR requires data mining, predictive analysis, and other advanced analytics. Only cloud computing is capable of performing these computationally demanding processing. So, in this scenario, data from conventional sources are directly offloaded to the cloud for processing. This transmission path is indicated by the arrowed blue dotted lines in Fig. 7. An example of such a scenario is that, MRI produces thousands of high resolution images per examination which require more computation power and storage, and can be efficiently served only by the cloud. In this scenario, data are directly forwarded to the cloud without any processing or holding in the mist or fog layers. SECTION IV. Optimal Resource Allocation and Load Balancing The IoHT nodes in the perception layer collect the (near) real-time as well as nonreal-time healthcare data to monitor patients. These collected data are forwarded to the IoT hub(s) (also called access point or AP). Based on the traffic class and processing requirements, these data can be processed in the mist, fog, and cloud layers as discussed in Sections III-B and III-C. In the process of effective handling of these data, the end-to-end (E2E) delay, throughput, packet loss, energy efficiency are crucial for maintaining the QoS of the proposed IoHT framework. To handle these heterogeneous data efficiently while maintaining the high QoS, the network resources are to be dynamically allocated. To this goal, the proposed IoHT framework relies on software defined networking (SDN), which is a programmable network structure that can be deployed on the top of IoHT framework as a centralized/distributed control layer for resources (e.g., bandwidth and buffer size) allocation, scheduling, routing, and flow control through SDN controller (SDNC) [89]. As SDN fulfills the requirements of various applications and workloads through network virtualization by decoupling control plane from data plane [90], it has been considered with the IoHT framework to manage the resource demand of exponentially growing IoT devices. A. Traffic Classification The perception layer of the IoHT framework (as discussed in Section III-B1) generates heterogeneous data or network traffic. In order to achieve better QoS, these network traffic are classified as the delay-sensitive ( DS ), loss-sensitive ( LS ), and both delay- as well as loss-sensitive (termed as “Mixed”) ( M ) traffic. This classification is mainly based on transmission data rate ( C ) and queuing delay ( tQ ), and is used to prioritize the network traffic. Table I shows various traffic classes, their service types, transmission priority ( P ), and exemplary applications. TABLE I Traffic Classification of IoHT Healthcare Data B. Resource Allocation In order to achieve better QoS, the objective is to reduce the time delay ( tD ) and packet drop rate ( Pkt drop ) during the transmission process. All the IoHT nodes in the mist layer achieve the minimum threshold requirement for both of these parameters through an optimal resource allocation. Fig. 8(a) illustrates an example scenario of the resource allocation problem. Fig. 8. Exemplary scenario of the IoHT framework with mist, fog, and cloud layers. The network is configured using SDN. The AP allocates resources based on the latency and packet drop rate demand of each IoHT nodes. Show All Consider the output link capacity of an AP is C , there are N IoT devices in a mist (see Fig. 8), each IoHT device has packet size of Pkt size . In order to ensure the QoS requirement of i th IoT device, the user requirement is <t D i , Pkt drop i > and the corresponding resource demand is < B d i , L d i > , where B d i and L d i are the bandwidth demand and buffer length demand of the i th IoHT user node (see Table II). As the allocated resource to i th IoHT device is proportional to the requirement of that user, the maximum resource ( Γ i ) awarded to the i th IoHT node by the SDN-based resource allocator is Γ i = = max[ B i C , L i L ] max[ B d i C B i B d i , L d i L L i L d i ]=max[ D c i U c i , D l i U l i ] (1) View Source where D c i = B d i /C and D l i = L d i /L are the ratios of bandwidth demand of the i th node and the maximum capacity, and buffer length demand of the i th node and the total buffer length of AP, respectively. The U c i = B i / B d i and U l i = L i / L d i are the requirement to demand ratio of bandwidth and buffer length, respectively, for the i th node. TABLE II QoS Requirement and Corresponding Resource Demand to Achieve the QoS Requirement of the i th IoHT Node Using the M/D/1 queue model [91], the E2E delay tD includes the transmission delay tTx , processing delay tP , and queuing delay tQ which are calculated by tD= = tT x i +tP+tQ ∑ cl ∑ fog ∑ sen [ N pkt Pkt size C +( λ 2μ(μ−λ) + 1 μ )+cλ] (2) View Source where λ and μ are the arrival and service rate, N pkt is the number of packets, c is the constant duration required to complete a job by a processor, sen refers to sensor and cl refers to the cloud. The packet drop occurs when the average queuing length E[ Q i ] is higher than demanded buffer length L d i / Pkt size . Based on [91], the packet drop rate is expressed by Pkt drop i = E[ Q i ]− L d i / Pkt size E[ Q i ] . (3) View Source Finally, the resource allocation optimization problem is formulated as max s.t  [( U c 1 , U l 1 ),( U c 2 , U l 2 ),…,( U c N , U l N )]  ∑ n=1 N B n ≤C ∑ n=1 N L n ≤L. (4) View Source C. Load Distribution In the Fog/access layer, the E2E latency can be reduced by link distribution and link fusion techniques. As illustrated in Fig. 8, a link scheduler selects multiple links, distributes the traffic to reduce the E2E delay and finally aggregates the traffic at the other end of the access layer. If the link scheduler selects M links based on the demand of the IoHT users, the link adaptation optimization problem can be formulated as max s.t.  f(T,1/ Pkt drop )  ∑ m=1 M γ m B d ≤C  ∑ m=1 M γ m L d ≤L (5) View Source where T is throughput, B d and L d are the bandwidth demand and buffer length demand of an AP. γ m is the fraction of bandwidth/buffer length allocated by the load balancer and is expressed by γ m = = Fraction of allocation in the mlink ( B m ∑ m B m )β+( L m ∑ m L m )(1−β) (6) View Source where β= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 0, 1, 0.5, if Traffic type is LS if Traffic type is DS if Traffic type is M. View Source The proposed load balancing scheme is shown in Algorithm 1. The central SDN, as a logical controller, selects M multiple links according to traffic demand to coordinate load distribution. At the beginning of the process, network controller specifies traffic classes based on demand. For each outgoing link i the value of γ i is calculated from (6). For delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive traffics, loads are distributed based on demanded bandwidth and demanded buffer length, respectively. For mixed type data traffic, load distribution is done based on comparatively greater requirement of demand. Algorithm 1 Algorithm for Load Balancing Require: Output link capacity of AP as C , Queuing buffer length as L , Bandwidth length demand of AP as B d , Buffer length demand of AP as L d Ensure: Distributed Load 1: procedure BalanceLoads( C , L , B d , L d ) 2: Initialize β , ν , η , Ω , ω ; 3: SDNC selects M links based on traffic demand; 4: if TrafficPriorityClass == 1 then 5: β⟵1 ; 6: else if TrafficPriorityClass == 2 then 7: β⟵0 ; 8: else 9: β⟵0.5 ; 10: end if 11: for all Selected Links as i do 12: Calculate γ i using equation (6); 13: Ω i = γ i B d ; and ω i = γ i L d ; 14: if β==1 then 15: Distribute load to link i using Ω i value; 16: else if β==0 then 17: Distribute load to link i using ω i value; 18: else 19: B= B d ∑ i B i ;L= L d ∑ i L i ; and η = max f( B,L ); 20: if η==B then 21: Distribute load to link i using Ω i value; 22: else 23: Distribute load to link i using ω i value; 24: end if 25: end if 26: end for 27: end procedure D. Computational Complexity Considering the decentralized data processing capability offered by the proposed framework enables it to perform processing at multiple levels reducing the amount of computations needed at subsequent levels. This is mainly because aggregating raw data from various IoT devices results in matrices with very large dimensions, leading to a resource demanding system with intolerable computation complexity. Therefore, the computational complexity of the proposed framework is lesser in comparison to other existing frameworks. Additionally, the proposed load balancing algorithm’s complexity has an upper bound of O(n) , where n is the number of active selected links of the network. SECTION V. Results An example model is considered in this section to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed multilayer mist-fog-cloud architecture for the IoHT framework. Considering, there are 100 IoHT nodes collecting delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive healthcare data from a hospital/home. The links between IoHT nodes (through microcontroller or microcomputer) and APs are IEEE 802.11. There are 5 fog nodes, 1 cloud server, and the link data rate is 54 Mb/s. The raw data generated by these IoHT nodes can be processed using the resources available at the mist layer. When the process is high (i.e., high processing delay), the mist can offload the processing to the fog nodes (also called fog processors). The process availability are generated randomly. Also, the link bandwidth and the queue length in the router are assumed to be distributed randomly. The fog nodes can be selected based on the demand and the processing delay. Finally, the information extracted from the mist/fog layer are sent to the server in the cloud layer. The link speed between the fog and the cloud is 10 Gb/s. The processing speed ratio of the mist to fog and fog to cloud are 1: 1000 and 1: 100, respectively. The parameters used to simulate the heterogeneous mist-fog-cloud for the delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive IoHT healthcare data are listed in Table III. TABLE III Simulation Parameters for the Heterogeneous Mist-Fog-Cloud-Based IoHT Framework Simulation Fig. 9 shows the E2E delay (or latency) for the simulation settings given in Table III. The results indicate that the E2E delay decreases when mist-fog nodes are involved in the computation along with the cloud. However, involvement of more fog neighbors and mist resources can reduce the E2E delay as this process reduces the queuing and transmission delays. The computational latency decreases when the number of neighboring fog nodes increase. Fig. 9. E2E delay of cloud, fog-cloud, and mist-fog-cloud for the simulation setting listed in Table III. The latency is minimal when all the mist-fog-cloud layers are involved in the process of data transmission and processing. Show All Fig. 10 shows the effect of buffer size on the packet delivery rate. The buffer size reduces the packet drop. When the buffer size increases the packet delivery rates in mist and mist-fog layers reduce. However, it should also be noted that the increase of buffer size also increases the queuing delay and total latency. Thus, the appropriate size of the buffer must be selected to ensure high delivery rate and low latency. Fig. 10. Increase in buffer size reduces packet drop. When buffer size increases, packet delivery ratios improve for all the layers. Show All Fig. 11 illustrates the outcome of involving fog neighbors on the task distribution of fog and cloud layers. The simulation results suggest that when the flow controller includes more fog neighbors in the task distribution process, the load on the cloud decreases as the processing performance on the fog nodes increase. The load on the cloud is about 60% with one fog node, and the load drops exponentially to 37% when the number of fog neighbors are four. Fig. 11. Effect of number of fog neighbors on the task distribution of fog/fog-cloud layers. In both cases inclusion of more fog nodes decreases the work load on the layers. Show All While evaluating the efficacy of the proposed framework, we compared its transmission time with one of the state-of-the-art fog computing-based framework [35]. As shown in Fig. 12, the proposed heterogeneous framework (denoted by mist-fog-cloud) requires comparable or less time to transmit same amount of processed samples in comparison to fog-based framework (denoted by Fog-Cloud) proposed in [35]. The mist plays its role in reducing the transmission time while handling real-time data (i.e., smaller sample size). In transmitting 60 KB samples in different network conditions defined in [35] (e.g., light load, medium load, and heavy load), the proposed mist-fog-cloud framework would require 1.5, 2.16, and 3.39 ms in comparison to Fog-Cloud-based framework which would require 1.67, 2.4, and 3.395 ms. Fig. 12. Mist facilitates reduction in transmission time. At different network conditions the Mist-based proposed framework showed an improvement in the transmission time. Show All The above specified lower transmission time is also facilitated by the fact that there are multiple levels of data filtering in our proposed model. This reduces the amount of real-time data to be transmitted along the network, thus, reducing computational complexity of the proposed framework [92]–[94]. Additionally, sophisticated data analytic schemes can also be employed to further reduce the computational complexity [95]. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper proposes a heterogeneous cloud-based IoHT communication framework with mist and fog computing. The framework consists of perception, mist, fog, cloud, and application layers which can handle separately data routing paths for real-time as well as conventional data sources. To ensure high QoS of such heterogeneous communication frameworks, reducing E2E latency and packet drop rate are two main challenges. Through optimizing resource allocation and flow control, the proposed framework delivers improved overall QoS. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can achieve low E2E latency and packet drop rate. The obtained results clearly indicate the suitability of the proposed IoHT framework in the healthcare domain. Nonetheless, this paper can be extended by incorporating advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning) in identifying the heterogeneous traffic, and employing bio-inspired models to ensure effective resource usage, schedule optimal flow to improve performance and increase data distribution to reduce overall computational complexity of next generation IoHT-based healthcare systems.

Abstract The quality of grapes and the drying process has a momentous impact on the quality of the final products (raisins). South Azerbaijan is the most important region for grape growing and raisin producing. However, the majority of the vineyards in the region are traditional, and the drying process is carried out in conventional structures that are not convenient. To increase the quality and productivity, it is necessary to modernize agricultural practices with reasonable cost suitable and affordable to traditional farming and farmers. To do this, the harsh environments and severe climate conditions of the vineyards and the drying buildings should be observed periodically to collect data. Wireless Sensor Networks are a key technology that can provide precise information, can update information, and can be a valuable resource to farmers to determine appropriate management practices. Using this technology, farmers can make real-time decisions such as scheduling irrigation periods, preventing diseases, choosing the right time for harvesting and so on. In this project, a Wireless Sensor Network system was designed and developed for remote real-time monitoring and collection of micrometeorological parameter data in three distant vineyards. The system was also used for monitoring the SO2 gas fumigation process and atmospheric parameters inside the drying structure. The system consists of a gateway and a series of peripheral wireless motes placed in the vineyards and inside the drying structure, which are equipped with agrometeorological sensors for environmental monitoring and for storing and transmitting data to the gateway. The gateway collects agrometeorological data and utilizes a wireless technology for data transmission and for communication between the motes and the central server (webpage). In addition, an on-line (real-time) warning system was embedded in the gateway to send alarm signals via SMS (Short Message Service). The devices were tested for software configuration functionality, hardware operation and data acquisition, energy consumption, and connectivity. Field experiment results demonstrated that the system represents a complete monitoring system, which provides efficient performance for developing information systems in precision viticulture.

The Azerbaijan provinces (South Azerbaijan) are the most important regions for grape growing in Iran, wherein more than 90% of the grape vineyards in these regions are traditional ones. Because of the cold weather and the environment of the region, the traditional vineyards are mainly in the form of large furrows. These specific furrows are called “Qana” in local Azerbaijani Turkish language and are a form of triangular prisms with a long base (approximately 25 × 22) two meters in height with a one-meter interval between every Qana (Fig. 1). Obviously, this particular kind of vineyard is not as productive as trellis ones, but they are more appropriate to the harsh environmental and climatic conditions of the region (extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers with −20 to 40 °C records). Additionally, the conversion of a traditional vineyard to a trellis one is costly and the majority of farmers cannot afford it, and so updates would require a nationally invested project. Instead, farmers could focus on utilizing suitable modern technologies to grow, tend, and monitor their vineyards to enhance efficiency and productivity.

Additionally, Iran is one of the largest raisin exporters in the world, ranking third (after Turkey and the USA) in the world and accounting for 27% of the world’s raisin exports. Compared to the other agricultural activities in the region, raisin producing has become of paramount importance for its economic values and for the size of the population involved in this kind of husbandry and commerce. Traditionally, raisins are produced naturally by sun-drying and hanging the grape bunches outdoor inside a structure (Karimi, 2015), as shown in Fig. 2. Drying the grapes in shade (inside the building) can preserve their natural flavor and color. First, the grapes are pretreated by immersion in 2% K2CO3 solution for ruining the natural wax coating and subsequently for increasing the drying speed (Dobbs et al., 2014, Karimi et al., 2011). The grapes are also fumigated with SO2 gas to control postharvest gray mold rot (Botrytis) and other decay-causing fungi, to preserve the golden color of the raisins, to prevent the enzymatic browning, and to facilitate the drying process (Franck et al., 2005, Karimi et al., 2015, Das et al., 2009, Karimi et al., 2017). According to the Codex standards of golden bleached raisins, the maximum limit applicable for sulfur dioxide is 1500 ppm (62,400 µmol m−3). Since excessive sulfur dioxide fumigation is extremely dangerous to human health, the process should be closely monitored and controlled. Furthermore, as the grapes are dried in the shade, the drying process is sensitive and the drying grapes (raisins) can be spoiled and molded by excessive humidity. Hence, the humidity and temperature of the building should be monitored. Download : Download high-res image (667KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Drying structure. Additionally, pest and nuisance birds, insects, and animals can damage and depredate grape berries in vineyards, which can demolish the quality of grapes and raisins. By monitoring damage patterns and depredating species, it is possible to reduce damage or lower the cost of control by concentrating control methods in areas and seasons when damage is most severe. Precision Agriculture (PA) is one of the most modern and strategic farming systems that integrates information technology with management to increase long-term, site-specific, and whole-farm production efficiency and productivity. Precision Viticulture (PV) as a specific area of PA in vineyards being used to improve productivity and quality. Grape quality and yield depend on agricultural practices, climate and soil characteristics, pests, and environmental diseases. Accordingly, using these variables, PV can provide a management strategy to enhance grape and raisin quality. Generally, PV can simultaneously improve the yield and quality of grapes and their by-products. PV practices are performed based on acquiring, transmitting, and processing agglomerative data coming from a large-scale, heterogeneous sensor network. In recent years, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have been used efficiently to provide remote and real-time monitoring of high-quality production and processing systems. Therefore, WSNs can offer a more reliable and safe measuring process for grape and raisin production. By monitoring environmental conditions through ubiquitous devices called sensor nodes (or motes), a WSN connects the physical and computational world. These networks include a number of motes and one or more base stations. Usually, a base station with high processing and storing capacities is connected to many autonomous, cooperating, battery-powered, small-sized motes through wireless links and a gateway with the capability of gathering data from the motes. The motes integrate different sensors, from simple ones such as temperature, light, and humidity, to sophisticated ones including Global Positioning Systems, images, acoustic data, micro-radars, and so forth. In this manner, it is possible to monitor a wide range of environments to obtain precise online and real-time knowledge from the field. 2. Reasons and objectives of the project 2.1. Vineyard The quality of grapes is closely related to the quality of wine, raisin, grape syrup, vinegar, and other by-products. Therefore, a scientific understanding of viticulture and long-term monitoring of cultivation environment are required for smart viticulture management and, simultaneously, for increasing the quality of the by-products. In an attempt to monitor the cultivation environment, it is necessary to collect data at multiple locations in the vineyard for convenient cultivation management since field conditions such as soil moisture may vary even within the same vineyard (Togami et al., 2011). Furthermore, by monitoring the vineyard, it is possible to estimate, assess and understand the changes that occur in grape growing stages in order to determine irrigation, fertilizer, pesticide, and insecticide requirements, growth and ripening phases, and optimum points of harvesting as accurately as possible—in other words, to adequately predict various stages in grape production. For achieving these goals, it is necessary to collect as much information as possible on the water, soil, plants, and environment. PA is an important means for determining vineyard requirements and predicting growth stages of grapes by utilizing numerous technologies and infrastructures including data instrumentation and gathering systems, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), microelectronics, wireless technologies and so forth (López Riquelmea et al., 2009). There are many factors that affect the quality of grapes. Environmental variables such as temperature, solar irradiation, wind and moisture are the most important factors affecting grapevine phenology. Among them, temperature is the most important factor in vineyards. Other parameters should also be considered such as atmospheric humidity, soil humidity, and soil pH (Winkler, 1963). In general, environmental parameters can be detailed as follows. Temperature: One of the meteorological factors that can cause various damages to the vineyard including physiological damage or disorder, effects on the degree of maturity of the grape berries, frost/freeze damage resulting from low temperatures, fungi and diseases resulting from warm weather such as black rot, etc. The optimum temperature for fungal development during the growing season is 10–25 °C. The loss resulting from disease ranges from 5 to 80% depending on the amount of disease in the vineyard, weather, and cultivar susceptibility (Šrobárová and Kakalikova, 2007). Humidity: An atmospheric parameter (present due to rain, dew, fog or irrigation) that is a major factor in fungal growth. Fungi caused by wet and dry weather include powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot. Additionally, excessive humidity can beget a dense canopy that will not only shade the fruits but also create a microclimate within the vineyard encouraging the spread of diseases. Furthermore, by measuring the environmental (and soil), humidity it is feasible to adjust the irrigation schedules. Soil Moisture: Water content or soil moisture is a result of a balance between water uptake (rainfall, precipitation, groundwater and irrigation) and water loss (seepage, evapotranspiration and drainage). Water stress can occur due to a lower moisture content in the soil. Furthermore, the lack of moisture during all seasons is responsible for slow development, low production, high sugar content, and a lack of acidity in wines. On the other hand, excessive moisture adversely affects the growth, productivity, and quality of grapes, and increases susceptibility to winter injury and disease. Soil pH: Improving the availability of mineral nutrients is one of the objectives in managing vineyard nutrient demand. Soil pH is a measure of soil acidity or alkalinity, which has a dramatic effect on the availability of several essential nutrients for grape growth. Soil pH levels that are too high or too low lead to a deficiency in many nutrients, a decline in microbial activity, a decrease in crop yield, and a deterioration of soil health. Low soil pH (pH 5.0 or lower) affects nutrient availability and root and shoot growth. Decreasing the soil pH from 5 to 3.5 results in increasing aluminum solubility so that the free and exchangeable aluminum ions affect nutrient availability and root growth. Additionally, a low pH prevents nitrogen cycling. High free aluminum precipitates phosphorus out of the soil solution and subsequently makes it unavailable to the plant. Exchangeable aluminum displaces calcium and magnesium, consequently decreasing their availability. Root growth is affected by aluminum toxicity, wherein it inhibits cell division in the root apical meristem. On the other hand, high pH soils present a different set of nutritional circumstances for grapevine roots. When soil pH increases from 5 to 8, aluminum insolubility removes it from the playing field. Accordingly, some of the phosphorus problems are obviated and the availability of calcium and magnesium is increased, but iron simultaneously precipitates out of the soil solution, limiting its availability. It is necessary to occasionally conduct soil tests to determine whether the soil pH has changed over time. Particularly, soils gradually acidify over time due to the removal of cations such as calcium, potassium, or magnesium either by leaching or uptake by plants, acid rain, or the reaction of certain nitrogen fertilizers in the soil (e.g., urea and ammonium nitrate). There are many other factors that can result in changing soil pH such as irrigation method, water quality, temperature, land use and management, the addition of nitrogen and sulfur fertilizers, etc. In warm, humid environments, soil pH decreases over time in a process called soil acidification due to leaching from high amounts of rainfall. In dry climates, however, soil weathering and leaching are less intense and pH can be neutral or alkaline. Hence, in order to prevent certain nutrient deficiencies, the soil pH should be approximately 5.5–6.5. Accordingly, the vines will not be debilitated and vulnerable to pest and disease attacks. Additionally, every year, the vines and grapes experience sequential growth cycles and phases so that every phase and stage has its own characteristics including the following: (1) Dormancy to Sprouting: In late January to early March the vines are awakened and pass the dormancy phase. During this change, the vines are pruned and begin to leak a colorless liquid, sometimes reddish; this is called the vine weeping phase. This phase usually lasts approximately three to four weeks. (2) Sprouting to Blooming: In April, when temperatures reach 10 °C, the sprouting phase begins. Buds swell and break, and initial small leaves appear. During this phase and during the subsequent blooming (flowering) phase, the vine is vulnerable to frost damage. During sprouting and flowering stages, water demand is low, so there are rarely water shortages. However, adequate moisture (water content) is required to promote bud break, root growth, shoot growth, and nutrient uptake. Water availability during the blooming stage is critical for continuous nutrient uptake, increasing fruitfulness, and potentially increasing berry size. (3) Blooming to Veraison: In late May, the blooming (flowering) phase occurs. The flowering consists of the flowers opening, resulting in fertilization. Lack of heat, excessive moisture, or lack of vigor of the plant can cause the flower to be incorrectly fecundated, and the grape bunches can have few berries (flowering shift). Adequate water during flowering can prevent a reduction in the potential harvest as a result of the reduced number of bunches. In July, the physiological maturity of the vine commences. The berries are still far from being mature grapes, but they have already started the ripening process. As August arrives, a phase called veraison (“Qora-Şirin” in the local spoken language) begins. In veraison, the berries’ greenish color changes to yellowish for white grapes and pinkish for red grape varieties. During the veraison phase, the acidity of the grapes decreases and the sugar amount is increased; sour berries become sugary, and their skin gradually softens. During the following growing seasons, the clusters are formed (after blooming), wherein adequate water is demanded. From fruit set to veraison, water is required for cell division, which determines berry size. Throughout this stage, the shoots, roots, and canopy are still growing, and the water demand is at its maximum level. Evapotranspiration values are also highest during this period and the volumes of replacing water can be high. This is the most crucial period to apply water. (4) Veraison to Harvest: During this stage, the maturation phase occurs. After veraison, a limited amount of water is preferable. Water is still required by the berries for cell expansion, but excessive moisture may promote shoot growth, hindering the vine’s acclimation process. Therefore, in order to achieve a balance between quality and productivity during the maturation phase, the amount of water has to be sufficient, but not too much. More importantly, during early September (before the harvest), the amount of sunlight and humidity between leaves and the soil surface (where the vines are lying down on the face of the Qana triangular prism) have the most striking effect on maturation and grape bunch plagues. Excessive sunlight can frazzle, scorch, and sear the grape berries. On the other hand, the humidity of this spatial zone beneath the leaves can result in plague and fungal diseases of the grape bunches, especially botrytis bunch rot (gray mold) and other fungal diseases such as black rot, sour rot, and downy mildew. Hence, in order to avoid such problems, the number of leaves has to be controlled by manually thinning the leaves or leaving them to remain. Near to harvest time from mid-September till mid-October, evapotranspiration values are much lower than earlier in the season, and root and shoot growth have essentially ceased. Hence, depending on the terrain characteristics (dry or wet), the grapes are ready to be harvested. It is extremely crucial to prioritize the harvesting operation according to the meteorological and geographical conditions of the vineyard. Importantly, uniform maturity is a factor that affects the quality of the raisin, and other by-products. The presence of hot or cold spots can result in variations in the degree of the fruit maturity. Moreover, the changes in the plant humidity throughout the entire growing season has a direct impact on the yield and grape quality. In case of water shortages and hot weather, the type of terrain is the most important factor that affects the vine moisture and grape maturity. The daily temperature profile is one of the most important environmental factors for grape quality, especially during the cold months and the month during the ripening phase. Real-time atmospheric temperature monitoring combined with historical data prediction could prevent frost effects. In the case of frost/freeze protection, monitoring air temperatures should be done throughout the vineyard, which is costly in terms of capital, labor, and operating costs. Additionally, the monitoring and analysis of humidity patterns for any phenological stage can also provide an effective way to avoid some crop pathogens, such as powdery mildew. Specifically, irrigation management is essential for high-quality grape production, and therefore it is necessary to measure soil moisture. Importantly, monitoring soil pH from blooming to veraison can notably provide conducive information about applying fertilizer to the vineyard. The WSN and PV technologies enable farmers to track the vineyard’s condition and progression. It is possible to compose an information database and use the data to support specific decisions and actions. Real-time data from a sensor network deployed in the field can be used by experts to make decisions such as the irrigation policy, to locate the spots of vineyards exposed to excessive sunlight, or to take the desired actions at the time when fungus or grape plagues are detected. Furthermore, WSN technology has other notable benefits such as being non-intrusive (with little to no human intervention) and being available for inexpensive prices. Additionally, because of some geographical factors such as the orientation and slope of the landscape, it is possible for vineyards located at different distances to have considerably different temperatures, humidity, etc. Thus, monitoring spatial variability of the conditions affecting the grapes can be feasible by deploying the appropriate sensor network. Lastly, WSN technology can be applied in vineyards to detect nuisance insects. In recent years, the region’s vineyards are suffering mainly from two kinds of insects, the cicada and the cricket. These insects damage grapevines primarily through their ovipositional activities such that vine growth is being affected adversely and severely. Cicadas especially have broken out, and the trees have been overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees have wilted and larger trees have lost small branches in some vineyards. These insects spend 17 years underground before crawling from the soil in late May and early June and immediately shedding their last immature skin to begin life as an adult. They immediately begin to sing, which they do incessantly from dawn to dusk. Their pathogenic existence and damage are concurrent with their strident singing sound (acoustic signals). By applying a WSN with its sensor nodes configured to sample audio signals and recording the sounds, it is possible to detect insects from their surrounding environment. 2.2. Drying building 2.2.1. Drying process Generally, the processing and environmental data acquisition inside the drying buildings can be performed manually, visually, and occasionally, or it can be carried out using wired systems that are normally expensive and not flexible. Additionally, in regard to security and accessibility, these solutions are not secure or appropriate since it is necessary to hire workers to take measurements inside the fumigated and dangerously polluted environment and far inaccessible sections of the building. Uniform environmental conditions inside the building are required in order to maintain a high drying quality and, consequently, to produce raisins with higher quality. Thus, farmers must stay informed of the environmental factors and conditions inside the building such as humidity and temperature during the several weeks of the drying process. Therefore, the grape drying process inside the building can be monitored more easily and comfortably by deploying WSN technology and tools. 2.2.2. Fumigation process As was mentioned, the fumigation process is extremely sensitive and hazardous. If the fumigated amount of SO2 (dioxide sulfur) is low, the process will be useless and futile. On the other hand, excessive fumigation can ruin and vitiate the berries. Meanwhile, visually or manually monitoring the process is extremely dangerous to the workers’ health. Here, remote monitoring is the best solution. Consequently, by implementing WSNs the visual monitoring issue can be obviated without further ado. 3. Relevant research review In recent decades, there have been many different investigations using and implementing WSNs in various crop production applications. In regard to precision horticulture, López Riquelmea et al. (2009) presented the topology of a deployed network using four types of nodes (Soil Mote, Environmental Mote, Water Mote and Gateway Mote) to measure various soil properties such as temperature, volumetric moisture content, and salinity. The system was successful for the ecological monitoring of cabbage crop for the entire growing season with the required precision. Hwang et al. (2010) proposed an agricultural environment monitoring server system for monitoring information of an outdoor agricultural production environment utilizing wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. The proposed server system collected environmental and soil information outdoors through WSN-based environmental and soil sensors. Garcia-Sanchez et al. (2011), deployed WSNs in order to integrate video-surveillance and data-monitoring over distributed crops. They developed wireless node prototypes providing agriculture data monitoring, motion detection, camera sensors and long-distance data transmission. In another study, Jiang et al. (2013) reported an application of a web-based remote agro-ecological monitoring system for observing spatial distribution and dynamics of Bactrocera dorsalis (phytophagous insects) in fruit orchards. To achieve real-time system management and data inquiry, a remote control interface and a web-based decision support program was implemented to allow system administrators and users to remotely access the monitoring report of their farms via the internet from virtually anywhere. Srbinovska et al. (2015) carried out a research project on environmental parameter monitoring using wireless sensor networks, which was deployed in a pepper vegetable greenhouse. Their presented WSN system consisted of sensor nodes and a base station, which was used for measurement and data collection of parameters such as temperature, humidity, and illumination. Moreover, other studies have been conducted applying WSN technologies in agricultural services such as soil water content sensing (Pan et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2014), crop disease risk evaluation (Das et al., 2009, Rossi et al., 2010), fertilization, pesticide spraying (Santos et al., 2014), crop temperature sensing (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013), remote sensing and control of an irrigation system (Kim et al., 2008), autonomous closed-loop zone-specific irrigation (Goumopoulos et al., 2014) and valve control (Coates et al., 2013, Dobbs et al., 2014), automated irrigation management based on the water content and temperature of soil, humidity, temperature, wind speed, and irradiance (Nikolidakis et al., 2015), and frost protection and dew condensation prevention (Park and Park, 2011, Pierce and Elliott, 2008). Specifically, for a precision viticulture (PV) application, researchers have conducted outstanding projects using WSNs. Burrell et al. (2004) presented a study on the potential use of sensor networks to aid work in vineyards. They described a variety of sensor network configurations and applications that can address different priorities of the vineyard. Beckwith et al. (2004) implemented a 65-node multi-hop WSN in a vineyard for six months. The collected information was used for addressing two important parameters of heat summation and potential frost damage in wine production. Morais et al. (2008) used a ZigBee multi-powered wireless acquisition device for remote sensing applications in PV. They designed a platform for that purpose called MPWiNodeZ, as a ZigBeeTM network element that provides a mesh-type array of acquisition devices for vineyards. Shah et al. (2009) designed a PV framework in the vineyards at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. They deployed wireless sensor nodes equipped with soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and leaf wetness sensors. Data collected by the sensors were wirelessly transferred in a multi-hop manner to a base station node (approximately 700 m away from the mote) connected with an embedded gateway for data logging and correlation. The embedded gateway base station performed elementary data aggregation and filtering algorithms and transmitted the sensory data to an agri-information server via GPRS. Additionally, Matese et al. (2009), designed a remote real-time system for monitoring and collecting micrometeorological parameters in a vineyard. The system comprised a base agro-meteorological station (Master Unit) and a series of peripheral wireless nodes (Slave Units) located in the vineyard. In this project, the Master Unit stored all of the Slave Unit data and, using a GSM/GPRS device, sent all the collected data to a remote central server. In 2011, an autonomous intelligent gateway infrastructure for in-field processing in precision viticulture was designed and installed in a vineyard. The infrastructure, named iPAGAT (Intelligent Precision Agriculture Gateway), ran an aggregation engine that fills a local database with environmental data gathered by ZigBee WSNs and it possessed embedded communication capabilities such as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, GPRS (for accessing both gateway and remote data by local and remote users), and the internet, and it ran site-specific management tools using authenticated smartphones (Peres et al., 2011). Accordingly, Fernandes et al. (2013) utilized this infrastructure (iPAGAT) and introduced a framework for WSN management for PV and agriculture based on IEEE 1451 standard. The framework consisted of a ZigBee end device (sMPWiNodeZ), an IEEE 1451 WTIM (Wireless Transducer Interface Module), and an IEEE 1451 NCAP (Network Capable Application Processor) that acts as a gateway to an information service provider, and a WSN coordinator. More recently, Reiser et al. (2017) designed and utilized a small 4-wheel autonomous robot that assembled the data from nodes distributed in a vineyard in order to overcome the limited transmission range of spatially separated nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN). The current innovative systems and projects applying WSN technology to vineyards have their own merits for solving the multiple challenges existing in the modern vineyards. However, there are some factors that should be considered, improved, and ameliorated such as • Cost: The existing research and development state for selecting and implementing the components are considerably expensive. Specifically, in the traditional and deprived regions such as South Azerbaijan (wherein the devices are imported from foreign countries), the devices are not affordable to the end-users. For applications in such regions, reducing the system cost is utterly urgent. Thus, a low-cost application design is extremely necessary for selecting and implementing sensor nodes and hardware. • Energy-efficiency: In any WSN-based system, energy management is one of the most challenging issues. The amount of energy consumed by sensor nodes can be reduced by reducing the amount of communication in the network. This can be done by designing different system components and algorithms, or alternatively, by considering other potential energy harvesting solutions such as solar power, wind power, biomass, vibrations, power banks, and so on. • Complication: The hardware components and designed platforms used in the proposed WSN systems are sophisticated and therefore should be simplified and easy to use. In this manner, in order to ensure ease of operation for the end-users who are typically farmers and non-technical persons, human–computer interaction issues such as accessibility and usability should be considered in designing and developing the system’s architecture. • Traditional vineyard issues: Unlike in developed countries, the traditional vineyards in the region are partitioned, smaller, and personalized farming lands. Additionally, the structure of the vineyards is completely different from the modernized trellis ones. Thus, a specific and suitable deployment architecture is needed. • Raisin quality: Virtually all of the existing research projects are concerned with grape and wine quality only. However, the characteristics of grapes (such as sugar level, alcohol level, acidity, etc.) that are grown for wine are completely different from the grapes that are produced for raisins. To our knowledge, there is not any research on traditional vineyards and grape drying (raisin producing) structures. The aim of this research is to integrate and equip the traditional vineyards with simple and easily used architecture, low-cost devices, and low powered components, which are more felicitous and tailored to the need of the region’s farmers. 4. Materials and methods In this section, the implementation of the proposed system is described. First, the hardware-software design of the system, the communication protocols, and the topology of the system are presented. Finally, the energy issues and implementation details are explained. 4.1. Architecture design The hardware architecture of the system resembles the Master/Slave configuration (Fig. 3). The Slave Unit (SU) is composed of a series of wireless motes located in the various locations of the vineyard with their sensors for monitoring meteorological and environmental parameters. The SU utilizes wireless technology to communicate and transmit the data to the Master Unit (MU). The MU is a base station, i.e., the gateway, which collects data from the entire vineyard, and then stores and processes them. Additionally, the web page designed as the management software for the transmission function is used to provide a connection between the operator and the gateway. Other software is used for designing the database and hardware programming and is detailed in the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (367KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Gateway and a typical sensor package (Mote). 4.1.1. Hardware architecture 4.1.1.1. End devices (Motes) Each End Device (ED), or mote consists of one or more sensor and module inputs. Motes are composed of a processor, a radio module, a power supply and one or more sensors mounted on the mote itself or connected to it (López Riquelmea et al., 2009). The gateway sends a data reading request to the end device and consequently, the end device responds with the value from the sensors. The ED consists of two interface parts: the sensor and the wireless communication interfaces. The interfaces are imbedded in Arduino Board and are included as a sensor shield and nRF24L01 module for sensing and sending the data, respectively, so that the sensor interface receives the data from the sensors and sends it to the gateway via the wireless communication interface (nRF24L01 module). Therefore, the end device’s components are Arduino boards, modules, and sensors: Arduino Board: Arduino is an open-source project that creates microcontroller-based kits in order to build digital devices and interactive objects, whereby they sense and control physical devices. The main component of an Arduino board is an Atmel 8-, 16- or 32-bit AVR microcontroller with other synchronized components that provide programming and collaboration with other circuits. The Arduino project provides a cross-platform application written in the Java programming language, named Arduino’s integrated development environment (IDE). IDE is a programming environment in which the codes (sketches) are written, compiled and uploaded into the embedded microcontroller. The Arduino series that was used in this project was the Arduino Uno, Nano, and Micro, which are based on the ATmega328P and ATmega32U4 microcontrollers’ board. Modules: Various sensor modules are connected to a mote (ED) in order to acquire the data and transmit them wirelessly to the base station (gateway), where the data are stored. The modules utilized in this work include nRF24L01 module, VS1003 acoustic module, GSM module, and U-blox NEO-6M module (GPS receivers). Sensors: To monitor and acquire real-time data from the field, multiple types of sensors were integrated into the data acquisition network such as DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor, TGS 813 sensor for SO2 gas, PIR motion sensor, soil pH sensor, and EC-5 soil moisture sensor. 4.1.1.2. Gateway architecture An Intel Atom processor with a 1.83 GHz has been used as the motherboard of the gateway (Fig. 3). This mini motherboard works with x86 architecture, wherein it supports all the software that can be installed on the real windows. Its size is 10 × 10 cm and it has 2G RAM and 32G eMMc. Other features of the device have been detailed in Table 1. Table 1. Detailed features of the coordinator motherboard. Features Details CPU Atom Chipset Intel atom processor z3735f (2M cache up to 1.83 GHz) Cache Memory 2 Mb RAM 2 G Storage Emmc 32G GPU Intel HD Graphics 311.00 MHz Wi-Fi Yes Bluetooth Yes LAN 10/100 Mb Video Output HDMI Port 4xUSB2.0 Operating system Windows 10 Dimensions (10 cm × 10 cm) Power 5 V 3 A The Mini PC is connected to the peripheral motes through the receiver circuit. The receiver circuit’s components include Arduino UNO, Arduino Nano and Micro, a GSM module, an NRF24L01 receiver module, a power supply, M2596 (regulator), an external sound card, and antennas. The gateway is the heart of the proposed system, and it runs all the management operations such as managing the received and transmitted data, optimizing the energy consumption in the motes, pooling the motes, and managing the alarms. The gateway consumes a 5 V–2 A energy source, and it uses mains electricity. However, two rechargeable batteries are also used in the case of emergencies. To manage the limited energy capabilities and consequently prevent the system’s shutdown, a “pooling” technique was ingrained into the gateway architecture. Pooling is one of these methods, which functions based on an on-demand approach. In the continuous approach, the motes send the data periodically according to the defined amount of time, without any management techniques. In this form of operation, the motes are working in continuous mode and, since the maximum amount of energy is consumed by the receiver and transmitter modules, the energy consumption and lifetime of the network are affected. However, the system can be designed based on on-demand measurements, as well. In this method, the gateway inspects the mote data in order to shift their sleeping mode to the active mode and actuates them to send their data to the gateway and then return to the sleeping mode. Additionally, the time of the inspection operation can be adjusted according to the different seasons and conditions. For example, inspection can be done in minute, hourly, or daily rates instead of every 250 ms. Accordingly, the energy-efficiency and performance of the system can be optimized. In general, the gateway functions as the sink node of the WSN system, whereby the gateway’s Mini PC is connected to the sink motes (via the receiver circuit) and monitoring center (Fig. 3). The gateway also executes other duties such as data aggregation, real-time warning system, web access with Ethernet cable and Wi-Fi, network management, and environmental data resource. 4.1.2. Software design In this section, all the software specifications that were used in this project are described. In Fig. 4, the flowchart of the end device and the gateway function is presented.

Software specifications include the following: (a) Microcontroller: The Arduino IDE was used as a code editor and code burner. By connecting to the Arduino hardware, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment – or Arduino Software) makes it feasible to upload programs and communicate with them. (b) Web-Server: A simple HTML/AJAX running on the gateway was used in this work. Using AJAX, web pages can be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. In other words, updating parts of a web page can be executed without reloading the entire page. The XAMPP application was used for the web server, which is comprised chiefly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and interoperates for scripts written in the PHP programming language. (c) On-line warning system: The warning system is a software that is installed within the overall system. The online warning system designed for the project is a system based on a webpage, which works according to the defined threshold of parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil pH, soil moisture, motion, and gas concentration level. The codes were written in Brackets IDE with HTML and JavaScript. In this system, an alarm is sent to the operator via the webpage. Accordingly, the operator (farmer or manager) will manually or automatically take appropriate actions in order to obviate the problems. Additionally, the system stores the alarms in the database, and by using the designated lights on the webpage, warns the operator. Furthermore, the proposed system is able to send these alarms to the operator via SMS. To perform this kind of communication and connectivity, a SIM900A module was used on the gateway board. SIM900A module is a simple Arduino GSM module for sending SMS. The module supports communication in a 900 MHz band. Programming of this module, like other modules such as nRF24L01, is performed in Arduino IDE. Hence, the online warning system alarms the operator via SMS and the webpage. The system generates alarm signals in order to warn of probable frost, likely disease, irrigation schedule, pH abnormality, an anomaly in fumigation and drying processes, and motion changes. The online warning system checks the data from the gateway in order to compare the sensor readings stored in the database with the limits defined by the minimum and maximum amounts of parameters for every measured condition such as frost, excessive fumigation and so forth. While the evaluated parameters are exceeded or declined, a signal (alarm) is sent by the system to the operator via SMS and the webpage. For instance, if the air humidity reaches 95% and air temperature decreases to 3 °C, an automatic alarm is generated and sent via SMS and webpage. The operating rule codes are uploaded to the gateway, which contains the defined threshold values of the parameters that are used by the online warning system in order to send the alarms. For example, the “frost Prediction” alarm can be scripted as the following schematic algorithm (rule): If (Day > 80 && Day < 120) {  if (Temp < 3 && Hum > 95)   {   char number [ ] = “0914∗∗∗∗∗∗”;   char message [40] = “Frost Prediction”;   sms.SendSMS (number, message);  } } (d) Database: MySQL programming language was used to run on the client computer. The software architecture of the gateway is constructed as a relational database management system. Similar to the hardware and software of this system, the database architecture has been designed more simply. Fig. 6 shows the structure of the designed database as part of the employed software. The database system functions in a real-time manner. While the system operates based on the continuous mode, the system receives real-time data (every 250 ms) and stores them in the relevant tables in the database. However, in the on-demand mode, the system receives data according to the operator’s request. While the data are stored in tables, their values are relationally compared with the threshold values of the warning conditions, which are specified in the alarm table. Therefore, once each condition occurs, the system informs the operator by means of the provided methods (SMS or webpage). In Fig. 7 the functional flowchart of the overall system is depicted.

Connectivity capabilities In this project, the nRF24L01 module was used for communication and transmitting data between the EDs (motes), sink motes, and the gateway (base sink). The standard SPI protocol and pins (CSN, SCK, MOSI, MISO), with the additional CE (for controlling the RX/TX and standby modes) and IRQ signals (for informing the SPI master about the completion of a packet reception/transmission) are used by this chip. To ensure a smooth data flow between the radio front end and the system’s MCU (Master Control Unit) or the gateway, internal FIFO manages the data flow. Furthermore, communication between the gateway and the monitoring center is executed with Ethernet cable and Wi-Fi. Communicational protocols used in this proposed monitoring system consist of the two following categories (Fig. 8): (1) The connection between the sink motes (of the EDs), the receiver circuit, and the Mini PC of the gateway: This connection between the sink motes of the EDs, and between sink motes and the receiver circuit, is performed based on SPI protocol. Using this protocol, it is possible to manage hardware-software properties (such as baud rate, bit rate, configuration register, etc.), to synchronize all EDs, sink motes (N1, N6, and N11 motes), and the gateway and to ensure receipt of the data (ack or nack). Moreover, the connection between the receiver circuit and the Mini PC of the gateway is performed using USB protocol. The USB is also a power resource for modules and Arduino boards. The C# coding language was used for port scanning functions, whereby the Mini PC scans the data (received by the receiver circuit), puts them in the variables, and does the following operations: (a) using an Ethernet interface (or Wi-Fi), sends the data to the monitoring center and (b) stores the data in the database in order to access them as it is needed. (2) The mechanisms and protocols between the gateway and monitoring center: Ethernet port (using the network cable) and Wi-Fi were used for this kind of connectivity in order to enable the users to access the gateway. In addition, SMS sending and Bluetooth link capabilities are provided. Furthermore, the data aggregation task is performed simply and robustly. The gateway receives the EDs’ transmitted data and stores them in the database and the relevant tables. Download : Download high-res image (93KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Diagram of connection methods between the hardware. 4.1.4. Topology Topology determines how the devices are interconnected. A star topology was used in this investigation. In this kind of topology, the gateway functions as a central processing unit so that it gathers sensor readings from all EDs. In a star topology, every sink mote is connected to a central node (gateway or MCU), which acts as a channel to transmit messages. 4.2. Energy Sensing, computation, and radio operations such as receiving and transmitting are three types of activities that consume the majority of the power in a mote. Since radio operation activity uses the majority of the power, an energy efficient plot should be concentrated on decreasing the amount of time devoted to receiving and transmitting operations. The power consumption of a mote’s receiving activity is higher than the transmitting activity. There are two modes of receiving and transmitting, wherein each mode has a different energy consumption level and has a direct effect on the network’s durability. (1) Continuous mode: In this method, the motes continuously send the data, and they have to be active and respond to the gateway’s requests. Obviously, in this mode, the lifetime of the motes and network will be decreased. (2) On-demand mode: During this mode, the motes are in the sleep condition. When the motes receive a request from the gateway they turn on and, having responded to the request, they return to the sleep mode. Accordingly, the network traffic is reduced because of the decrease in the sampling frequency. Hence, this mode has less energy consumption than the continuous mode, and the network’s lifetime is increased. Since the energy consumption in the WSN is the most challenging issue and the battery is a more common source of energy, using the best mode for optimizing consumption of energy is inevitable. 4.3. Stipulation and deployment Before installing the system in the harsh and natural conditions of the vineyards, the system was tested under laboratory conditions between December 2015 and February 2016, in order to assay the accuracy and channel resolution of the motes and gateway boards. Subsequently, all the hardware were calibrated according to their data sheets and installed in the WSN. All the executable codes were manually downloaded into the associated microcontrollers of the motes. A unique identifier was attributed to each mote. Both the source and binary codes were checked in order to detect and correct faults and errors. The energy source for the motes was provided in two methods and every method was evaluated and tested. For the EDs, two means of energy supply were used and tested: (1) rechargeable common batteries and (2) rechargeable lithium batteries. Since the power bank was utilized in the second method, the system was able to have an approximately one-month duration. However, for the gateway, DC power was used. Since the gateway had access to unlimited electricity, it was able to work permanently. To create wireless connectivity, nRF24L01 was used. This module can transfer data in a 1600 m distance range and has “auto ack” capability, which provides certainty in receiving the data. For testing this module, one thread of data was sent 1000 m from the transmitter and on the other end, the data was received correctly without errors. Finally, by adding this module to the project’s board, the data were received singularly and wholly. Accordingly, the sensor motes were physically located in the fields. 4.3.1. Vineyards Having carried out the tests, the system components were implemented in the vineyards. Three disparate and distant experimental vineyards were used in the project (Fig. 9). The climates of these three vineyards were different. The climate of the first vineyard, named Yovşanlıq, is dry, the second vineyard (Mıncıqlı sector) is a medium climate, and the third one (Minə) is semi-humid. The cultivated grapes of the vineyards were white and red Thompson seedless grapes. However, the majority of the grapes were white (more than 98%). The area of the Minə, Mıncıqlı, and Yovşanlıq vineyards is 130 × 138 m2, 130 × 141 m2, and 210 × 132 m2, respectively. The vine trees in every vineyard were pruned during the spring. As is shown in Table 2, five motes were implemented in each the Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, and seven motes in the Yovşanlıq vineyard were in the desired spots (totally 17 motes). To protect the motes from rain and environmental damages, a package was designed to plug in the mote’s components. The motes were fastened to a bar with the height of 0.5 m to keep soil sensors close to both the ground and vines. The gateway was placed outside the vineyard in the monitoring site in order to evaluate the system’s performance in term of range, robustness, and flexibility and to assess the microclimatic variability corresponding to the management practices within the various areas.

Drying building Thirteen motes were installed within the drying building, with three of them being used for the fumigation process and the remaining ten motes used for the drying process. For the fumigation process, just one sensor was used (SO2 gas sensor), but for the drying process, two sensors including humidity and temperature were utilized. Once the field tests, installation, and implementation processes were completed, the motes were activated and the WSN system was initiated. The data from each mote were received by the gateway (base station). Subsequently, the data were stored in a database in order to be processed and depicted in the web page. The updated data obtained from the vineyards were extracted and presented by the web page. The operator or vineyard owner exploits the provided information to make the right decisions and takes appropriate actions to handle and manage the problems and issues relevant to the vineyards. All the data received from the motes were stored in textual files in the database and were presented in the webpage in the monitoring center. This webpage is the software of the monitoring system, which is used for management. Storing the data in a text file in the database makes it possible to create graphs of hourly, daily or longer interval data reports and trends to analyze the environmental variables. 5. Experimental results and discussions The designed system was user-friend and easy to use. The web page (Fig. 10, Fig. 11) provided the following main functions: real-time data, historical data, mote management, and user management. The user can observe the data from each sensor of the motes in real-time and access the historical data by selecting the time range for acquiring the data with a simple point-and-click. In addition, the mote management functions allow the user to check the status of the network and actual motes. By using this option, the user can check the condition of each mote in order to replace batteries or to troubleshoot the technical faults and re-deploy the troubled motes. The user can reach to every mote and observe each sensors’ data by means of the displayed charts and numerical presentations. Moreover, a user carrying smart devices such as a smartphone, tablet, or PDA (via SMS and Wi-Fi) can monitor the state of the field and the in situ sensors.

In the proposed system, adding new motes can be done without further change or expense. Compared to the other proposed systems, changing the hardware-software architecture of the current system is not costly because it is not necessary to upgrade hardware boards or to change their programming logics. The gateway, despite having lower software-hardware complications, was able to operate all the desired functions and tasks in the traditional vineyards, and it monitored the defined warning conditions accurately. Furthermore, using a Mini PC as the motherboard of the gateway obviated traditional systems’ limitations. One of the conventional methods of designing a gateway board is to utilize an Ethernet shield or the RS232 connector, which has some disadvantages. For example, an Ethernet shield has a lower speed, uses an SD card for saving the data and is limited in connection methods to the monitoring center. By using the Mini PC, these limitations were eliminated. Particularly, using the Mini PC in the proposed system was beneficial for enhancing the connection and communication capabilities and performance speed, reducing the SDOF (Single Point Of Failure) malfunction potentiality (by installing the security software), being used as the monitoring center (because of having of the HDMI interface), having remote access desktop capability (using remote access software tools such as TightVNC and so on), installing various desired software (due to possessing the Windows operating system), and getting access to the database comfortably and speedily. Additionally, the operating system of the Mini PC is flexible and easily usable. Its OS toolsets are easily extensible to user’s specific needs. Moreover, the communication stack in the default libraries has the considerable characteristics of usability, simplicity and resource efficiency so that the users can use it without extra complexity. External memory support for user data storage in the Mini PC is provided. The users do not have to worry about sensor data—they are depicted automatically. Finally, all the required software can be installed easily. The tests pertaining to the energy consumption indicated that using common batteries makes the motes stable for one week. However, as shown in Fig. 12, by using an on-demand approach, the energy consumption of the batteries was decreased and their lifetime was increased. Fig. 12 shows a typical daily and weekly energy consumption of the utilized batteries with the continuous mode vs. the same application using the on-demand mode. As depicted in the figure, in comparison with the continuous mode, the lifetime of the system was increased by 43.75% using the power source with the on-demand mode. Additionally, when utilizing the power bank facilities, the lifetime of the batteries increased to one month. During continuous weeks of monitoring, every battery’s condition was monitored by the operator using the webpage in order to recharge or replace the weak batteries.

Typical daily and weekly energy consumption of the used power supplies with continuous mode versus on-demand mode. The results regarding the connectivity showed that the nRF24L01 modules were easily able to perform data transference with a 1600 m distance range. In addition, instead of using overpriced boards, these low-cost modules were utilized, and by modifying and changing their baud-rates and registers, it was possible to provide the modules’ performance analogous to the costly ones. The results of the vineyards and drying process monitoring are detailed below. 5.1. Vineyards The developed system was deployed in three vineyards located in Qurijan (Qurucan) village in South Azerbaijan. The system was used from March to November 2016. The farmers were using traditional irrigation methods within the vineyards. The prime objective of utilizing this technology was to provide predictive information about the gardens in order to improve the quality of the grapes and raisins. The measured parameters were humidity, soil pH and moisture, movement detection, GPS, and temperature. Data acquisition processes were mainly divided into the following seasons: (1) Spring (lasting from March to June): During April, temperature and air humidity sensors were simultaneously activated in order to monitor variations in temperature and predict the frost. The sensors were demanded to monitor nocturnal and diurnal variation of the temperature and humidity from 20o’clock until 8o’clock in the morning (of the next day). Fig. 13 depicts two typical nightly and daily variation of the temperature and humidity in the vineyards. Three motes were selected from each vineyard (N2, N7, and N12 motes). It was observed that the hours near to dawn (between 4 and 6o’clock) are the hours most at risk of frost damage. This means that during these hour intervals, the vineyards are extremely susceptible to frost harm, which resulted from “radiation freezes”. Radiation freezes occur on calm, clear nights (without any clouds) when the heat from the ground radiates upward. Since the cold air is heavier than the warm air, it settles in areas of lower elevation. As the cold air stays low and the warm air rises, the air becomes stratified and a temperature inversion forms. Additionally, as seen in Fig. 13, before the break of dawn, the air humidity reaches its maximum range in the vineyards. Simultaneously, an increase in air humidity and a reduction in temperature can precipitate frost occurrence. The data from the sensors showed that Minə vineyard was the most vulnerable vineyard to the frost harm. Hence, it was suggested that the farmer install and apply frost protection equipment and methods during April (of every year) within the vineyards.

During this season, other sensors including humidity, PIR, GPS, and acoustic modules were active. A GPS sensor was installed on just one end device of every vineyard (N1, N6, and N11). The PIR sensor was utilized to protect the implemented end devices from intruders such as wild animals. During the season, no intruders were observed. Additionally, the acoustic modules were activated during May in order to record the sounds of depredating insects. During this month, the acoustic modules were activated daily around lunchtime. In Yovşanlıq vineyard, cricket songs were detected. Accordingly, insecticides were deployed to the vineyard in order to extirpate the nuisance insects. Furthermore, during this season, the pH sensors were turned on weekly in order to record soil pH variations. (2) Summer (June to September): During this season, soil pH, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors were active. Concurrently, acoustic modules were actively used. During these consecutive months, soil moisture records provided updated data in order to irrigate the vineyards. As shown in Fig. 14, continuous monitoring of the soil moisture level provided the data for scheduling irrigation times within each vineyard. The peak points in every linear graph indicate the times that the vineyards were irrigated. Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards were irrigated five times, but the Yovşanlıq vineyard was irrigated six times. The data indicate that because of the dry climate, water evaporation speed within Yovşanlıq vineyard is greater than in the other two vineyards. However, it is possible to accumulate and save moisture content by increasing irrigation duration and frequency. In addition, it was observed that while the irrigation duration increases, the moisture content also increases. This correlation demonstrates that longer irrigation times lead to the deeper penetration of water and higher moisture content.

In addition, during early June it was observed that the soil pH of Mıncıqlı was trending towards alkalinity (Fig. 14). To lower the pH to 6.5 and 6, a urea fertilizer was used in the vineyard. As depicted in Fig. 14, applying a urea fertilizer had a significant effect on maintaining the desired soil pH level in Mıncıqlı vineyard. Furthermore, zonal (beneath leaves) humidity sensors were also active during the summer months. Zonal humidity (spaces under the leaves) is extremely critical during August and September. As presented in Fig. 15, in Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, the zonal humidity was observed to be increased on 4 and 7 August, respectively, during which the farmer received the warning alarms via SMS. To avoid being exposed to probable fungal diseases, the leaves of the vines were thinned by the employed artisans. However, for Yovşanlıq vineyard, since the air temperature was immoderate, in order to protect the grape bunches from sun burning damage, the leaves were not thinned. Download : Download high-res image (121KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 15. Zonal humidity and temperature. It has been found that temperature and humidity are the most crucial parameters for improving the quality of the final products. In the cases of Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, humidity had the highest effects, whereas in Yovşanlıq vineyard, the temperature had the paramount importance. Another conducive parameter with a direct impact on the quality of the grapes and raisins is the sugar level of the berries. Since the WSN reported excessive zonal humidity (between the leaves and the face of Qanas) of Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, the leaves were trimmed in order to increase the amount of sunlight received by the vines. Consequently, the sugar level, flesh, and volume of the mature berries increased. However, because of the inherently dry climate of Yovşanlıq vineyard, the leaves of the vines were not trimmed. Accordingly, the schedule of harvesting time was determined and postulated by the system, resulting in the farmer first harvesting Yovşanlıq vineyard in early September and Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards in late September. 5.2. Drying structure The WSN system was used during October in order to monitor the fumigation and drying processes. In the fumigation process, three motes were utilized in every round of fumigation. To keep even and uniform diffusion, circulation, and concentration of the SO2 gas through the grape bunches, the motes were used in three disparate sections of the fumigation chamber inside the covering nylon. The motes were used in every round of fumigations. Using the WSN system, direct-close inspection and monitoring procedures were eliminated. Fig. 16 displays continuous monitoring for a typical round of the fumigation process. The webpage provided continuous monitoring via the relevant diagram and warning system. Additionally, the SMS module sent alarms in case of inordinate and lesser amounts of SO2 gas. As seen in Fig. 16, after 30 min, the amount of SO2 gas was decreased to 1392 ppm (57,907.2 µmol m−3). The operator received this inconvenient insufficiency by SMS, and, subsequently, an amount of sulfur powder was added to the sulfur container inside the chamber. This calibrated amount of sulfur powder was consumed in the next round. Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Continuous monitoring for a typical round of the fumigation process. After every fumigation round, the nylon was unwrapped in order to let atmospheric air circulate through the grapes inside the building. One mote was implemented between every two columns in the back side beyond the hung grapes (between the wall and suspended grape bunches), where it is not approachable or accessible (Fig. 2). Generally, 10 motes were used inside the building during October and November in various locations of the drying building (structure). The humidity and temperature of the inside building were continuously monitored. During late October, since the air temperature plummeted in the region, the online warning system sent a rot prediction alarm via SMS and webpage. Subsequently, the raisin producers avoided the problem by providing a constant ventilated hot air flow inside the drying structure at 60 °C. Finally, in November, all the produced raisins (at 18% moisture content level) were gathered and stored in the storage room. The result showed that applying the WSN monitoring system in the vineyards and drying structure increased the quantity and quality of the grapes and final products. Particularly, grape and raisin production yield was increased 4 t/ha compared to the yield of the year before. Grape yield depends greatly on cultivation and climatic conditions and varies from one variety to another. This leads to a wide range of yields across the world: from 6 to 12 t/ha in France to 20–30 t/ha in the USA, especially in California (http://www.oiv.int/public/medias/4911/fao-oiv-grapes-report-flyer.pdf). According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the average yield of grape production in Iran is approximately 12 t/ha. In comparison with the average national yield, the yield was nearly increased to 6 tons per hectare (0.544 kg/m2). This means that the system was able to increase the yield more than 28%. Furthermore, inside the drying structure, raisins were produced without any dissipating damages stemmed from excessive fumigation or fungi. 6. Conclusion This paper shows WSN-based precision viticulture in traditional vineyards and drying processes. The system was developed on the basis of other successful experiences with wireless sensor network systems and decision-making supports in agriculture. The main components of the system are a gateway (composed of a Mini PC and receiver circuit) and thirty peripheral motes with installed relevant modules (nRF24L01 module, VS1003 acoustic module, GSM module, and GPS receivers) and sensors including temperature, humidity, soil pH and moisture, SO2 fumigation, and PIR. To display and browse the data, a web interface (Graphical User Interface; GUI) was designed to provide the vineyard locations on Google Maps, the graphical representations, the gauge charts, and the numerical data display. The webpage provides the desired data at the user’s request with simple clicks. The experimental results proved that the system reliably and satisfactorily performs the desired duties with simple architecture and devices and at reasonable prices. Using a Mini PC as the motherboard of the gateway has some considerable advantages such as a lower implementation cost, extended capabilities and easy changing of software-hardware, and being user-friendly, portable, and easy to use. Particularly, the proposed system offers great flexibility for using continuous modes and on-demand requests based on pooling mechanism. The results indicate that by using the system with an on-demand approach, the lifetime of the motes and the utilized power supply is increased. The implemented approach actuates the motes at the user’s demand to switch their sleeping/active modes whenever they are needed and to consequently save the energy supply. The system is able to predict imminent frost using real-time data of temperature and air humidity sensors located in the vineyards. By measuring the soil moisture and air humidity parameters, the system provides feasibility of scheduling the irrigation frequency. More importantly, the system is able to determine the optimum irrigation duration for each vineyard according to their climatic conditions. The overall results imply that since the amount of irrigated-evaporated water is high, flood irrigation (traditional irrigation) is not an efficient method. By obtaining soil pH data, the system is able to predict, warn, and monitor the nutrition deficiencies of the terrain. Furthermore, by measuring the data of the zonal (between the surface of the ‘Qana’ and leaves) humidity sensors, the system is able to prevent probable fungal diseases and sun burning damages. Consequently, the leaves controlling procedure is decided by the farmer so that in the case of immoderate humidity, the leaves of the vines can be thinned and in the case of too much heat, the leaves can remain untouched. As a result, the vineyards that receive more controlled sunlight grow larger berries. Finally, using the data obtained from the vineyards, the system can predict and schedule the harvesting time. Regarding the drying building (structure), the fumigation process can be continuously monitored in order to control the amount of SO2 gas inside the fumigation chamber. Importantly, by monitoring the process, the farmer can calibrate the amount of sulfur powder used. Subsequently, by continuously monitoring the humidity and temperature inside the building, the system can detect and predict the imminent rot damage. These experimental results suggest that a traditional drying building equipped with the proposed WSN-based system can serve as a useful platform for monitoring the drying process and subsequently for increasing the quality of the produced raisins. Finally, the proposed system is helpful for increasing the quality and quantity of the grapes and raisins. It is able to prevent probable diseases, foresee the nutrition demands, schedule and determine irrigation duration and frequency, and warn of predating insects. Specifically, by using the WSN data, farmers are able to schedule harvesting time based on maturity, quality, and productivity. 7. Future improvements This project can be extended in future studies in order to improve the system in various domains such as (1) The online warning system was not able to generate an alarm warning of the presence of nuisance insects. This warning system needs a comprehensive signal processing research project in order to detect and distinguish the depredating insect sounds from other environmental sounds. Moreover, an image processing method can be added to the system for recognizing deficiencies, pests, diseases, and other detrimental agents in the vineyards. (2) Sap-flow measurements as an indicator of vine transpiration and plant water status throughout the season can provide an alternative tool to optimize and manage irrigation. In future work, this method can be applied in the current WSN system. (3) Luminosity as a key factor of brightness analysis for estimating light radiation on plants can be applied for determining the sugar concentration, controlling the amount of sunlight received by the vines, and determining the optimum time for harvesting more accurately and timely. Furthermore, by utilizing light sensors, the WSN system can detect the presence of clouds or rain that are extremely deleterious during harvesting time. (4) Future studies can be focused on applying automated control for decision support systems through integration with an automatic irrigation system, frost preventing system, SO2 fumigation system, nuisance insect extirpating system, etc. The control commands can be counted in a locally centralized manner and then transmitted wirelessly to the actuators located in the vineyards and drying structures. (5) The dried raisins are stored in bulk (in the storage or packing house) before further processing. The raisins should be stored in cool, dry rooms. Specifically, the equilibrium moisture content (EMC), the point at which the raisins are neither gaining nor losing moisture, is important. The value of the EMC depends on the material and the relative humidity and temperature of the air. To maintain such equilibrium in moisture content of the stored raisins and to monitor the other parameters of the stored raisins, a WSN can be applied inside the storage or packing houses.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

Introduction Wireless communication systems have experienced substantial revolutionary progress over the past few years. Various stakeholders, including commercial solutions providers, academic research groups, standards bodies, and end-users, have all greatly benefited from the radical changes led by the most recent 5G developments, which include paradigm-defining techniques such as network softwarization and virtualization, massive MIMO, ultra-densification, and the introduction of new frequency bands. Numerous burgeoning applications and verticals, including virtual and augmented reality (VAR), e-commerce, contactless payment, machine-to-machine communications, and enhanced mobile broadband, among others, have demonstrated the vast potential of 5G, which continues to evolve and adapt to a wide variety of emerging use cases. However, as societal needs continue to evolve, there has been a marked rise in a plethora of emerging use cases that cannot be served satisfactorily with 5G. For example, the next generation of VAR, i.e., holographic teleportation, requires Tbps-level data rates and microsecond-level latency, which cannot be achieved with even the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands within 5G. Further, increasing industrial automation and the move from Industry 4.0 to the upcoming Industry X.0 paradigm will push connectivity density well beyond the 10 6 k m 2 metric that 5G is designed for, in addition to requiring an overhaul of existing network management practices. Further, an increase in the connection density will also result in demands for improved energy efficiency, which 5G is not designed for. Consequently, the research community has gravitated towards addressing the aforementioned major challenges, and we posit that ongoing research in the domains of terahertz band communications, intelligent surfaces and environments, and network automation, for example, may very well hold the key to the future of wireless. To this end, an amalgamation of societal needs and technological breakthroughs that serve to enable those needs are the key drivers for a generational leap beyond existing wireless systems. Together, these factors make a strong case for a focused discourse on the next frontier in wireless communications, i.e., 6G systems. We envision that 6G will not only enable a pervasively intelligent, reliable, scalable, and secure terrestrial wireless network, but will also incorporate space communications to form an omnipresent wireless network, in keeping with the need for true wireless ubiquity. This paper details our vision for the future of wireless communications, highlighting emerging use cases and detailing the key enabling technologies that are essential to the realization of 6G. We begin our discussion on 6G by formally introducing the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are expected to guide the design of 6G systems. While the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is working on a set of official recommendations for the KPI metrics, the tentative values have appeared in the public domain recently [1]. Table 1 presents these values and contrasts them against the metrics associated with 5G. These KPIs serve as the fundamental metrics to evaluate system performance. In particular, from the table, we note the following classes of KPIs: System Capacity: This class of KPIs primarily deals with metrics that are associated with system throughput. These include peak data rate, experienced data rate, peak spectral efficiency, experienced spectral efficiency, maximum channel bandwidth, area traffic capacity, and connection density. Within this context, the experienced data rate and spectral efficiency metrics refer to the values that should be guaranteed to 95% of all user locations [1]. System Latency: This class of KPIs includes the end-to-end latency metric, along with delay jitter. We note that jitter is a new KPI for 6G that quantifies the latency variations in the system, and is absent from 5G. System Management: This class of KPIs primarily deals with metrics related to the management and orchestration of networks such as energy efficiency, reliability, and mobility. Here too we note that while 5G does not specify a target KPI for the energy efficiency metric, 6G introduces a target energy efficiency of 1 Tb/J. Achieving the KPIs highlighted in Table 1 will require revolutionary breakthroughs across all domains of wireless communications. In particular, we identify the following major thrusts: New Spectrum Usage and Radio Design Paradigms: While 5G ensured the mainstream adoption of mmWave spectrum, the need for higher data rates and consequently larger channel bandwidths will necessitate the incorporation of terahertz (THz) and sub-THz spectrum within 6G. At the same time, the opening up of new spectrum bands will also require novel radio designs that can simultaneously sense and communicate over the entire EM spectrum. Novel Network Architectures: The classical cell-based architecture of wireless networks cannot scale to meet the area traffic capacity and connection density requirements put forth by 6G. Instead, 6G will need to incorporate communications infrastructure into the very fabric of the environment. Increasing Intelligence and Automation: The strict spectral efficiency, reliability, and latency requirements associated with 6G imply that manual configuration of the network will no longer be possible. Rather, network intelligence and automation will occupy centre stage, helping build an increasingly autonomous network. Enhancing Network Coverage Beyond the Terrestrial Domain: In order to achieve true wireless ubiquity, 6G will need to expand beyond terrestrial networks, incorporating both near-Earth as well as deep-space connectivity. TABLE 1 The Evolution From 5G to 6G Wireless Systems [1] Towards the fulfillment of this grand vision, we note that several enabling solutions have been conceived and are being actively studied. As shown in Figure 1, these technologies include: (i) a network operating at the THz band with abundant spectrum resources, (ii) intelligent communication environments that enable a wireless propagation environment with active signal transmission and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence, (iv) large-scale network automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end for dynamic spectrum access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy savings, (vii) the Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and (viii) cell-free massive MIMO communication networks. We also make note of three very promising technologies that are expected to shape the future of communications, yet will not be sufficiently mature for 6G. These include: (i) the Internet of NanoThings, (ii) the Internet of BioNanoThings, and (iii) quantum communications. Further, in addition to the aforementioned key technologies, holistic security solutions will also be vital to the success of 6G. However, these fall outside the purview of this paper. FIGURE 1. The envisioned key enabling technologies for 6G and beyond wireless communications systems. Show All Further, we posit that while prior art concerning 6G wireless systems has been become increasingly commonplace over the past year [2]–[7], a majority of the past publications in this domain focus on a select few topics, potentially hampering a comprehensive overview in terms of key aspects that are expected to shape the future of wireless communications. In addition, discussion concerning beyond 6G systems such as the Internet of NanoThings, the Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications is equally critical but largely absent from existing publications. As research on 6G wireless systems continues to evolve and break new ground, this paper is intended to equip readers with a targeted insight into the next generation of wireless communications. More specifically, through this paper, we aim to deliver a holistic roadmap for 6G and beyond wireless systems, replete with a detailed discussion surrounding the use cases and key enabling technologies. The larger goal here is to encourage the scientific community to work together towards tackling the critical research challenges associated with the realization of the 6G systems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present a wide variety of use cases that will be enabled by 6G. Further, Sections III–VI present details concerning key technologies that are critical to the success of 6G, along with a discussion on the major challenges faced by each. Then, in Section XI, we discuss promising enablers for beyond 6G systems, followed by a timeline for the evolution of 6G in Section XII. Finally, in Section XIII, we conclude this paper. SECTION II. Use Cases The lessons learned from the continued evolution of 5G systems will serve as the backdrop for use cases that will be best served by 6G. 5G first introduced the targeted use cases of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC), intended to serve a wide variety of applications. However, as noted in Section I, there exist a plethora of applications for which the 5G KPIs are not strict enough. As we come to realize the performance trade-offs in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, energy efficiency, and reliability, associated with 5G systems, we can better posit the applications that would benefit the most from 6G. As shown in Figure 2, in the following, we present a variety of critical use cases that will be enabled by 6G. FIGURE 2. Use cases best served by 6G systems. Show All A. Multi-Sensory Holographic Teleportation While virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have immensely benefited from eMBB and URLLC introduced as part of 5G, there are many applications such as advanced healthcare including remote diagnosis and surgery, high-resolution sensing for remote exploration, and near-real person video conferencing that cannot be adequately served by a combination of AR and VR. To this end, holographic teleportation has been recognized as the natural successor to AR and VR-based solutions. Unlike existing solutions, holographic teleportation operates in a true three-dimensional space and leverages all five senses– sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, to provide a truly immersive experience. At the same time, we note that holographic teleportation requires data rates close to 5 Tbps and an end-to-end latency of less than 1 ms [8], both of which are impossible to achieve with 5G systems. Thus, 6G, with its expected Tbps-level throughput and sub-millisecond latencies, will play a vital role in building upon the groundwork established by eMBB and URLLC. B. Real-Time Remote Healthcare The success of remote healthcare solutions primarily depends on both the quality as well as the availability of connectivity [9]. Concerning the former, we note that through its use of key enabling technologies such as THz band communications and network automation solutions, 6G will usher in the highest possible wireless communications quality focusing on very-high throughput augmented with ultra-low latency. Concerning the latter, the Internet of Space Things will play a vital role in providing pervasive connectivity, thus enhancing the availability of rural healthcare solutions. Further, we expect that within the domain of healthcare, advances in 6G and beyond will not only serve as a connectivity solution, but will also play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases as detailed in Section XI-B. C. Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems Autonomous vehicles and UAVs are some of the most promising cyber-physical systems in existence today [10], [11]. The operation of these autonomous systems is characterized by the exchange of large amounts of data between the constituent nodes, i.e., both vehicles and UAVs, relating to high-resolution real-time mapping of the terrain, route optimization, and traffic and safety information. While the resulting large volumes of data must be delivered within strict deadlines in an error-free manner, it also imperative to note that these nodes typically operate at speeds in excess of 100 km/h. Therefore in addition to providing sub-millisecond latency and very high reliability, the connectivity solution that enables autonomous cyber-physical systems must also offer robust operation at very high speeds, which is not possible with existing 5G systems [12]. D. Intelligent Industrial Automation Over the past few years, Industry 4.0 [13] has been the driving force behind industrial automation based on the concepts of supply chain optimization, autonomous equipment, additive manufacturing, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Yet, these concepts are treated as silos working in isolation, limiting the true potential of industrial automation. On the other hand, the upcoming Industry X.0 paradigm [14] seeks to realize synergies between the various nuances of industrial automation through its use of artificial intelligence. Vital to this vision are networked factories that serve as critical sources of big data that helps inform decision making. To this end, the modern industrial floor is expected to require reliable high-throughput connectivity across thousands of devices often with sub-millisecond response times, making it the perfect use case for the next frontier in wireless communications. E. High-Performance Precision Agriculture Within the broader domain of precision agriculture, soil moisture measurements have been a mainstay in irrigation decisions for decades now. However, real-time measurements and irrigation automation solutions still face challenges stemming from a lack of robust wireless coverage. Going beyond simple automated irrigation solutions, high-performance precision agriculture is largely centered around delivering data-driven insights to address the specific needs of customers, farms, crop, and soil. At the same time, scalable and timely access to such data is a major challenge owing to gaps in rural connectivity. Therefore, we expect that 6G, with its focus on ubiquitous wireless access, will play a major role in enhancing the adoption of technology in agricultural production. F. Space Connectivity While near-Earth and deep-space connectivity are still nascent within 5G, there are a wide variety of use cases ranging from radio astronomy and remote sensing to navigation and backhauling that would stand to benefit from the pervasive connectivity offered by 6G. More specifically, such applications include freight tracking, terrestrial cellular offloading, environmental monitoring, and long-range UAV coordination, to name a few. To this end, the Internet of Space Things as described in Section IX, will serve as the key enabling technology for beyond-Earth connectivity, furthering the reach of 6G systems. G. Smart Infrastructure and Environments The use cases discussed thus far primarily deal with the use of third-party systems that seek to leverage advanced telecommunications infrastructure. Simultaneously, the evolution of such infrastructure itself is an important use case. Going beyond network optimization strategies, there is also a need for exercising control over the propagation of wireless signals. To this end, we note that in 5G and its predecessor systems, the wireless communication environment has always played a passive role. However, with the ever increasing demand for data, as evidenced by the applications presented herein, control over the manner in which electromagnetic waves interact with the indoor and outdoor environment will be critical to the success of 6G. In this direction, we posit that the intelligent communication environments described in Section IV will play a leading role in the ubiquity and pervasiveness of the next generation of wireless systems. SECTION III. Terahertz Band Communications Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in wireless data traffic brought forth by numerous exciting technologies in wireless communications. This exponential growth has been accompanied by the demand for higher data rates and better coverage [15]. Among emerging research and development trends in wireless communications, terahertz band (0.1-10 THz) communications has been envisioned as one of the key enabling technologies for the next decade. Buoyed by the availability of ultra-wide spectrum resources, the THz band can provide terabits per second (Tbps) links for a plethora of applications, ranging from ultra-fast massive data transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks to high-definition videoconferencing among mobile devices in small cells. Recently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released the frequency bands above 95 GHz for research purposes [16]. While a handful of cellular operators have adopted low millimeter wave frequencies for their 5G services with the intention of achieving a maximum data rate of 100 Gbps, the test results thus far leave much to be desired, showing a peak data rate of around 1 Gbps.1 This gap between the targeted and practically achievable data rates is influenced by multiple factors, including a high complexity in realistic communication channels, imperfections in circuitry design, and interference from other systems operating in adjacent frequency bands, among others. Nevertheless, even though the THz bands have been applied in imaging and object detection, as well as for THz radiation spectroscopy in astronomical research, their use cases in wireless communications are still under investigation. Lying between the mmWave spectrum and infrared light spectrum, as shown in Figure 3, THz bands, with their abundant spectrum resources, have been previously deemed as a “no-man’s land”. However, major progress in the domains of transceiver and antenna design has seen THz links become a promising option for realizing indoor communications networks. More recently, there has been significant progress on realizing wireless network on chip (WNoC) using THz bands [17]. FIGURE 3. The THz band offers hundreds of GHz usable spectrum resources for wireless communication links in long, medium, short, indoor, and near-field range. Show All A. Use Cases of THz Band Communications Different from wireless networks at lower frequencies, THz-band wireless communications has several unconventional application scenarios, owing to the distinct electromagnetic and photonics characteristics of this tremendously high frequency band. In addition to the promised Tbps-level links for cellular systems, THz-band spectrum can also be leveraged for the following scenarios: Local Area Networks: Several spectrum windows are feasible for short-range links within ten meters, including 625-725 GHz and 780-910 GHz [18]. THz band communications is expected to form the THz-optics bridge to enable seamless transition between fiber-optics and THz-band links with zero latency. Personal Area Networks: THz band communications can provide “fiber-like” data rate without the need of wires, between multiple devices at a distance of a few meters. Such communication scenarios can be found in indoor offices and multimedia kiosks. Data Center Networks: Conventional data centers manage and maintain connectivity in wired networks using cables, resulting in high costs in terms of both installation and reconfiguration. On the other hand, THz links provide promising prospects for seamless connectivity at ultra-high-speeds in fixed networks and adaptability for hardware reconfiguration. Wireless Network on Chip: As the trend in transceiver hardware development motivates a higher level of integration and miniaturization as well as weight reduction, the THz band links can serve as a promising candidate to establish wireless connections among different modules within the transceiver chassis, in order to replace the wired connections commonly found in existing transceiver hardware products. Nano-networks: With its wavelength falling into the nanometer (10−9 m) range, the THz band can operate better than any other frequencies in nano-networks. Within this context, a nano-network is a set of interconnected nano-devices or nano-machines for information exchange, storage, and computation. A more detailed overview can be found in Section XI-A. Inter-satellite Communications: Lying largely outside the Earth’s atmosphere, inter-satellite links are not constrained by atmospheric attenuation, which makes the THz band a favorable candidate for such communication links. Compared to existing spectrum resources allocated for inter-satellite links, the THz band has a much wider bandwidth which can accommodate more satellites and achieve higher link performance. Unlike the widely used optical links, the THz band does not impose stringent requirements on beam alignment, which can help maintain a high level of link stability as satellites drift out of their orbits. B. Devices in the THz Band The need for higher output power, lower phase noise, and better receiving sensitivity in THz band transceivers has driven advances in corresponding device development. Currently, three main directions are deployed in THz band signal generation: photonics-based, electronic-based, and emerging material-based, respectively. In the photonics-based approach, many III-V semiconductors, including gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), which provide high electron mobility, are excellent candidates especially for high frequency (i.e., above 100 GHz) applications. Such photonics-based techniques generate time-domain pulses with lengths of femto-seconds (10−15 s) and experimental works have demonstrated 50 Gbps data links in an indoor scenario at 300 GHz using the uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) technique [19]. The UTC-PDs and modified UTC-PD structures, an effective photomixing solution which allows wider spectrum tuning and simpler construction compared to laser pulse generators, has pushed the output signal range from 300 GHz to 2.5 THz, with output powers of 10 μW at 300 GHz and 1 μW at 1 THz [20]. Additionally, a design based on slot-antenna-integrated UTC-PDs has shown superior performance in generated THz band signal strengths at 350-850 GHz and 900 GHz-1.6 THz, compared to that of the bowtie-antenna integrated UTC-PD [21]. Similar photonics-based THz signal generation at above 1 THz can be realized using quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and other solid state lasers [22]. However, the operations of such devices are limited at room temperatures, requiring liquid helium cooling, which affects their deployment in local area networks with space restrictions. Furthermore, photoconductive antennas (PCAs) have been utilized widely for both pulse and continuous-wave signal generation at THz band [23], demonstrating a wide spectrum (up to 4.5 THz) with a remarkable dynamic range of up to 100 dB [24]. In parallel to the photonics-based approach for THz band device design which down-converts the optical frequencies, the electronic-based THz band signal generation relies on frequency up-conversion using multipliers [25], including frequency doublers and triplers, as well as backward wave oscillators [26]. A recent experiment has demonstrated an all-electronics-based wireless link at 240 GHz with a throughput of 50 Gbps and a maximum 29% error vector magnitude using QPSK modulation [27]. The backward wave oscillator, which is a compact design to generate THz band signals based on the mechanism of energy transfer from an electron beam to an electromagnetic wave through a vacuum tube, has been used to generate signals at 300 GHz with an output power of 1 W in plasma diagnostics [26]. Among the two commonly used approaches, the photonics-based design benefits from a relatively simpler transceiver architecture based on the photomixing technique, while the electronics-based solution relies on cascaded frequency up-conversion of RF signals, which sets stringent requirements on linear-range operation and potentially limits the terahertz bandwidth. On the other hand, the electronics-based approach is less sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, among others, which makes it more favorable for outdoor operations, whereas the link reliability from its photonics-based counterpart is affected by scattered particles in the channel, making the THz band link less robust. Besides these classical approaches for THz band device development, new materials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanoribbons, are gaining more attention due to their extremely high electron mobility in the order of 8,000−10,000c m 2 /(V⋅s) at room temperature, as compared to 1,400 c m 2 /(V⋅s) of silicon, and 8,500 c m 2 /(V⋅s) of GaAs, which means that the link throughput can be potentially up to ten times higher than is currently achievable with most semiconductors [28]. The graphene-based devices, offering outstanding mechanical, electrical, and optical properties, have been utilized in the development of power detectors at 600 GHz [29] and 200 GHz [30], as well as plasmonic antenna arrays and transceivers [31], [32]. Graphene-based devices have the potential to break new ground in reaching the desired level of performance at much higher frequencies above 1 THz. C. Physical Layer Modeling at the THz Band The realization of wireless communications at THz frequencies requires the development of accurate channel models to capture the impact of both channel peculiarities including the high atmospheric attenuation and molecular absorption rates at various transmission windows, as well as the propagation effects including reflection, scattering, and diffraction, with respect to different materials. Current research has reported several efforts to provide fundamental understanding of such channels. For example, an early work in [33] demonstrates the remarkable capacity the THz band channel can support for short transmission distances. The model provides a detail analysis on the effect of attenuation caused by the molecular absorption and spreading loss, on which the performance of channel throughput is heavily dependent. One step further, in order to extend the transmission distance at THz bands, an idea dubbed as the ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM MIMO) communications, enabled by an element array size of 1024×1024 with plasmonic nano-antennas, can drastically boost the signal strength by steering and focusing the transmitted beams in both space and frequency [34]. Correspondingly, a UM MIMO channel model has been developed in [35] which takes into account the role of such arrays. Additionally, a stochastic channel model for indoor THz band communications at 300 GHz has been reported in [36] which characterizes both spatial and temporal domain channel information. More recently, based on the aforementioned applicable scenarios in the THz band, a stochastic channel model for kiosk applications has been reported in [37] which ranges from 200-340 GHz. The main takeaway from current models validated using either measurements or the ray-tracing technique is that the direct path between the transmitter and the receiver and the single-bounce reflected paths dominate the received power, while other channel effects, including diffraction and scattering, attenuate power significantly along propagation. On the basis of the ultra-wideband channel characterization, THz band communications faces a critical and challenging task of synchronization in the receiver design. Existing pulse-based modulation schemes permit the use of low-complexity non-coherent analogue detectors, e.g., energy detector and auto-correlation receiver, which involve the multiplication of the received signal with itself, followed by an integrator. However, a more advanced non-coherent receiver architecture in [38] based on a continuous time moving average symbol detection scheme demonstrates better performance compared to previous detection schemes for pulse-based modulations in terms of the symbol error rate. In addition, robust frequency and timing synchronization for multi-carrier communication in the THz band is desirable to decode multiple incoming signal streams. The work presented in [39] realizes both a low-rate sampling scheme for channels with high SNR values and a maximum likelihood-based algorithm for low SNR channels with satisfying bit-error-rate performance. More recently, a synchronization scheme based on medium access control protocols is reported in [40], which shows good performance in both a macro-scale scenario to overcome the distance limitation at the THz band and a nano-scale scenario for nano-devices for energy harvesting. Similarly, given the peculiar ultra-wideband nature and frequency selectivity of THz band communications, equalization solutions pose another relevant challenge [15], [41]. In [42], three equalization solutions, including the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding, a waveform with interference management for time-reversal systems, and an iterative algorithm with adaptive soft feedback, are reviewed and compared for an indoor channel. Results show that the iterative algorithm with adaptive soft feedback yields the most promising BER performance [42]. D. Medium Access Control in THz Band Communications On top of physical layer channel models, the medium access control (MAC) schemes in THz band communications should adopt certain spatial and spectral features in order to provide solutions in resolving issues such as the deafness problem and LoS blockage, among others [43], [44]. Different from commonly used MAC solutions in RF systems that utilize omnidirectional antennas, such as carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), the MAC protocols designed for THz band rely on handshakes between transceivers with highly directional beams. These razor-sharp beams can provide higher power radiation gain and prolong the transmission distance, but when misalignment happens, the deafness problem arises. As such, the deafness avoidance approach is required in MAC scheme design. Existing solutions utilized in IEEE 802.15.3c [45] and others employ a beam-training phase to estimate and steer beams towards destined devices. Recent works also propose methods based on angular division multiplexing [46] and a priori aided channel tracking schemes [47]. The results in such proposed solutions suggest that with good beam alignment strategies the channel throughput can be improved significantly. Moreover, the MAC protocols can also resolve the issue of LoS blockage where the received power of a user device may undergo deep fading due to the device being held in a manner that blocks the LoS path. Studies have shown that such attenuation by the human body can be as high as 20 dB at 60 GHz and up [49], [50]. To mitigate the blockage problem, researchers have proposed a multi-hop scheme at the mmWave and THz bands to form alternative routes [51], [52]. A careful link-level scheduling and neighbor discovery process is necessary to achieve high throughput while maintaining low interference. E. Open Problems in THz Band Communications Currently, the fabrication and testing of THz band antenna arrays remains a relevant challenge. Some techniques based on photolithography, electro-beam lithography, among others, are able to produce the front-end with hundreds of plasmonic antenna elements. The utilization of large antenna arrays can extend the signal coverage by forming array radiation patterns with main lobes of high directivity, thus focusing energy towards desired directions. However, such highly directional beams limit coverage in the angular domain, causing low energy efficiency at the transmitter to serve each user. A recent solution named “THzPrism” has been proposed to form multiple beams with slight frequency shifts towards different directions while maintaining good distance coverage [53] in addition to other proposed solutions discussed in Section III-C to solve the transmission distance problem. This design employs true time delays for RF chains before phase-shifters to obtain a prism-like effect, which spreads the original beam into several beams, each with a slight frequency shift with respect to the center frequency. In parallel to the quest for more novel solutions in antenna design, other remaining challenges reside in the control and signal processing schemes associated with transceiver designs in the THz band. On the one hand, real-time control algorithms are needed. On the other hand, communication protocols for coordination between the transmitter, receiver, and reflectarrays are needed. Among others, in [54], researchers reported a smart reflectarray-assisted mmWave system compatible with IEEE 802.11ad. Besides the design of the reflectarray and a study on deployment strategies, a three-way beam-searching protocol is developed, in which the reflectarray coordinates with the transmitter through a 2.4 GHz control channel in order to discover the best joint transmit and reflect sectors for which the signal at the receiver is maximized. However, this work does not capture the extended functionalities of plasmonic reflectarrays. Furthermore, when highly directional beams are utilized at mobile transceivers, a relevant challenge arises from the limited field-of-view of antenna arrays for each transceiver to locate the next hop to forward its data; thus, new routing solutions are necessary for THz band communications to efficiently discover and establish links. A study in [55] reports a solution in link discovery at THz band using a leaky-wave antenna to sense the angular information of a user. SECTION IV. Intelligent Communication Environments Along with the rapid growth in the number of wireless devices, services, and applications, a corresponding demand for higher speed wireless communications has burgeoned in recent years. Nevertheless, the major challenge at mmWave and THz-band frequencies is the limited communication distance because of the remarkably high path loss inherent to small wavelengths and the limited transmission power of mmWave and THz-band transceivers [56]. Current solutions primarily focus on the advancement of wireless transceiver hardware and software, as well as network optimization strategies. However, the wireless propagation medium has been largely neglected. The wireless communication environments, for both indoor and outdoor scenarios, can be actively utilized in order to become controllable for signal propagation. To control signal propagation in environments is essentially to control how electromagnetic waves interact with scatterers, which include indoor furniture and outdoor buildings as well as other infrastructure. Typically, the controllable behaviors of electromagnetic waves include controlled reflection, absorption, wave collimation, signal waveguiding, and polarization tuning, as illustrated in Figure 4. The notion of “Intelligent Communication Environments” resides in the control algorithms where deep learning and reinforcement learning are to be exploited to dynamically configure the environments. In the following subsections, we elaborate on these controllable wave behaviors, current research efforts, as well as corresponding open issues. FIGURE 4. Conceptual design of a plasmonic reflectarray able to unconventionally manipulate EM waves [48]. Show All A. Basics of Intelligent Communication Environments The intelligent environments can be seen as a three-dimensional structure with several layers, each with different functionalities. Recent research under the EU Research Project “VisorSurf” has demonstrated a structure with five main layers, which are (from top to bottom) the EM behavior layer, the actuation and sensing layer, the shielding layer, the computing layer, and the communication layer, respectively [57]. Specifically, the EM behavior layer is composed of metasurfaces, a two-dimensional representation of metamaterials, and has a tunable impedance to control directions of reflection of the EM waves. Some other works use reflectarray antennas as the top surface [58], [59]. The actuation and sensing layer consists of circuits for phase shifting and sensors for impinging signal sensing. Some options for actuation include PIN diodes with controllable biasing voltage as switches in reflectarray antennas, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) transistors as well as micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) switches for metasurfaces. The shielding layer isolates the upper and lower parts of the layered structure so as to minimize the possible interference. The computing layer serves to control the phase shifts and process sensed impinging waves. To this end, another reported solution makes use of field-programmable gated arrays (FPGAs) to fulfill such functions on metasurfaces [60]. Finally, the communication layer connects all upper layers and serves as the gateway towards the central controller which processes all connection requests, forwards and receives signals, and conducts the aforementioned controlled wave functions. Compared to existing relays with multiple antennas which are widely deployed in wireless networks, Intelligent Communication Environments offer the following advantages: (i) a higher spatial diversity due to the wide coverage of the intelligent surface with controllable antenna arrays, (ii) a reduced processing time given that the computing and communication layers are directly underneath the surface layer, and (iii) a higher flexibility in network routing when impinging signals come from different directions and the intelligent surfaces are able to collimate waves and reflect them towards desired directions. B. Functionalities of Intelligent Environments Bolstered by the layered structure, intelligent surfaces can enable controlled EM wave operations. At micro- and mmWave frequencies, metasurfaces are considered as a good candidate. While at THz bands, graphene-based plasmonic antenna arrays are desirable. In metasurfaces, a meta-atom is the smallest unit, which is a conductor with a size smaller than half the wavelength of the signal. Metasurfaces can thus control the impinging EM waves with a very fine granularity. The meta-atoms are interconnected by a set of miniaturized controllers that connect the switches of the metasurfaces in the computing layer, while a gateway serves as the connectivity unit in the communication layer to provide inter-element and external control. At THz bands, when the metasurfaces do not yield optimal performance, the graphene-based plasmonic antenna arrays serve as a promising alternative. Compared to metallic antenna arrays, the plasmonic antenna arrays can have much denser element layout and go beyond the conventional λ/2 sampling of space towards more precise space and frequency beamforming, owing to the physics of plasmonics. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that, graphene can be used to build nano-transceivers and nano-antennas with a maximum dimension of λ/20 at THz frequencies, allowing them to be densely integrated in very small footprints (1024 elements in less than 1 mm2), as shown in Figure 4 [34]. Therefore, by incorporating the graphene-based plasmonic antenna arrays at THz bands and metasurfaces operating at mmWave bands, we can expand the operational spectrum of intelligent environments and utilize them in transmission and reception in a controllable manner. C. Layered Structure of Intelligent Communication Environments Based on the operating principles of the aforementioned Intelligent Communication Environments, in this subsection, we anatomize the layered structure and detail each layer’s functionality. 1) Metamaterial Plane The metamaterial plane is also the surface plane, as shown in Figure 4. In designs based on reflectarrays, phase shifts are applied to each element to improve useful signals while canceling interference [58], [61]. The metasurface element proposed in [62] with millimeter-scale dimensions is connected to a PIN diode with a bias voltage to control operation modes, such as altering polarizations. In general, this layer comprises the supported EM function of the tile as well as its operation principle. In particular, reflectarray employ modifiable phase shifts applied over their surface. In the far field of radiation, reflected rays can be considered co-directional, and their superposition–constructive or destructive–is controlled by the applied phase shifts [63]. Hence, wave scattering or controlled reflecting functions can be attained. Metamaterial tiles, however, operate as surfaces with tunable local impedance [64]. Impinging waves create inductive surface currents over the tile, which can be routed by tuning the local impedance across the tile. Notice that the Huygens Principle dictates that any EM wavefront can be traced back to a current distribution over a surface [65]. As a result, in principle, metamaterials can produce any custom EM function as a response to an impinging wave. Common functions include wave steering, focusing, collimating (i.e., producing a planar wavefront as a response to an impinging wave), polarizing, phase altering, full or partial absorption, frequency selective filtering and even modulation [60], [64]. 2) Sensing and Actuation Plane In order to control the EM waves per actual channel conditions, the programmable surfaces are expected to sense the propagation environment and actuate the upper surface plane accordingly. Such layer contains hardware elements that can be controlled to achieve a phase shift or impedance distribution across a tile. Commonly, the layer comprises arrays of planar antennas–such as copper patches–and multi-state switches between them. Reflectarray tiles usually employ PIN diodes with controllable biasing voltage as switches [62]. Metamaterials have employed a wider range of choices, both in the shape and geometry of the planar antennas and in the nature of switches. CMOS transistors, PIN diodes, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Switches (MEMS), micro-fluidic switches, magnetic and thermal switches are but a few of the considered options in the literature [66]. Notably, some options–such as micro-fluid switches–are state-preserving in the sense that they require power only to change state but not to maintain it (i.e., contrary to biased PIN diodes). Sensing impinging waves are also necessary for exerting efficient control over them. While this information can be provided by external systems [67], with dynamic channels and mobile end-users, tiles capable of incorporating sensing capabilities can be immune from the channel aging problem [68]. The sensing can be direct, employing specialized sensors, or indirect, e.g., via deducing some impinging wave attributes from currents or voltages between tile elements. 3) Computing Plane The computing functionality serves the processing functionality in the controllable surface system. In the metasurface designs in [60] and [62], FPGA-based controllers are connected to the metasurfaces to implement the computing functions. This layer comprises the computing hardware that controls the actuation and sensing elements. Its minimum computing duties include the mapping of local phase or impedance values to corresponding actuator states. Reflectarray tiles commonly implement this layer using FPGAs and shift registers [62]. Metasurfaces, and specifically HyperSurfaces, can alternatively employ standard IoT devices for the same purpose. Moreover, they can optionally include computing hardware elements (ASICs) distributed over the tile meta-atoms [69], [70]. This can enable autonomous and cognitive tiles, where meta-atoms detect the presence and state of one another, and take local actuation decisions to meet a general functionality objective. Nonetheless, these advanced capabilities are not required for programmable wireless environments. 4) Communication Plane The communication plane passes the signals from the processing layer to corresponding metasurface layer and collects signals from the sensing and actuation plane. In complicated programmable surface systems, communication occurs among planes to realize various EM wave control functions. The command signals normally operate at much lower frequencies compared to the ones emitted from programmable surfaces; such signals prove to be more efficient in tuning the bias voltage of the PIN diodes [60]. This layer comprises the communication stack and connects actuation and sensing layer as well as computing layer with tile-external devices such as controllers. In the simplest case, this layer is implemented within the computing hardware, acting as a gateway to the external world using any common protocol such as the Ethernet. HyperSurface tiles with embedded distributed computing elements additionally require inter-tile communication schemes, to handle the information exchange between smart meta-atoms. Both wired and wireless intra-tile communication is possible [69], [70]. In both cases, the ASIC hardware employs custom and nonstandard protocols. D. Use Cases of Intelligent Environments With the utilization of well-coordinated tiles in the Intelligent Environments, the wireless system can be greatly improved in terms of communication efficacy. 1) On Signal Propagation Enhancements From the perspective of multiple users and moving users, the Intelligent Environments system is envisioned to serve a large number of users with more realistic user patterns, including mobile users and users in a cluster. Additionally, the Intelligent Environments system should ensure physical layer security against jamming and eavesdropping, an increasingly important problem that remains to be solved. Transmission Distance: For users in the NLoS areas relative to the transmitter, the Intelligent Environments system is expected to extend the transmission distance and reach previously uncovered areas through waveguiding or reflection. Simulation results in [67] demonstrate that at 60 GHz the coverage can be extended to an entire NLoS area. Interference Mitigation: Due to the scenario with multiple users, there is inevitably concern of interference. As in the envisioned scheme, each Intelligent Environment unit is dedicated to an individual user, thus the majority of interference will reside in the wireless section of the end-to-end link. Reliability: The primary efforts in terms of physical layer reliability include using highly directional antennas to nullify jamming, forming exclusion areas, assigning secret keys to legitimate users, and so on. From the perspective of fundamental propagation channels with Intelligent Environments, good reliability is achieved when the eavesdroppers do not have the knowledge of the frequencies where packages are transmitted, or the eavesdroppers are in the same frequency channel but with much higher noise which makes the intercepted data impossible to decode [71]. Therefore, the dedicated links in Intelligent Environments are inherently secure. 2) On the Physical Layer Security The more frequent data exchange between users and service providers exposes a higher risk of personal and private data leakage. The 6G wireless network should not only inherit existing network secrecy measures, but also provide enhanced physical layer security associated with new enabling techniques. In current 5G networks, highly directional beams are used for mmWave communications in spatial domain to prevent signals from being intercepted. However, a recent study has shown that such pencil-sharp beams are still vulnerable to agile eavesdropping [72]. Other physical layer encryption algorithms, including source coding approaches such as the low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, are demonstrated with optimal performance under specific conditions [73]. Furthermore, existing solutions in the reconfigurable intelligence surface apply reflectarrays, which do not have the capability to effectively distinguish target users from malicious attackers. Hence, a solution based on the Intelligent Environments serves the purpose of identifying unintended recipients, creating null areas, and improving link secrecy rate. Essentially, the envisioned Intelligent Environments have the capability to sense user locations and exchange such information with a system controller to verify the user’s authenticity. Only affirmative users shall be served with signal streams from the sender. On the other hand, connection requests from unauthorized users (i.e., eavesdroppers) will be nullified from attempting to access secure information or even trying to establish links with the sender. In practice, the Intelligent Environments can be configured to tune the phases of multipath components in the channel, such that those arrived at intended users can be coherently combined with boosted received signal strengths, whereas those intercepted by eavesdroppers will be scrambled or even cancelled due to non-coherent combining [74]. Simulation results demonstrate a 6-dB attenuation observed at the received signal strength from the eavesdropper, validating the proposed physical layer security solution [74]. Hence, the good channel secrecy is achieved when such unintended users do not own the knowledge of equalizer to recover the transmitted signals from noise. E. Open Problems in Intelligent Environments A number of open problems need to be addressed in order to facilitate the Intelligent Environments in becoming a market-ready solution. Trade-off Between Dimensions and Energy Consumption: In terms of real-world applications, the Intelligent Environments are expected to be coated onto surfaces of interior walls and/or ceilings, and building facades, which require dimensions that can both fit specific installation areas and satisfy link requirements. Meanwhile, with more reflectarray elements and RF chains built into the system, the energy consumption will also increase, due to the advanced signal processing circuitry. Therefore, how to achieve an economic solution to balance the overall dimension and energy consumption while serving users to its desired performance is a nontrivial issue. Compatibility With Existing Solutions: Current Wi-Fi access points have a mature protocol stack to sense the channel and establish links with users. In order for the Intelligent Environments to assist with improving indoor signal coverage, it needs to be compatible with the IEEE 802.11 series standard. For now this is still under research and serves as a worthy problem for novel solutions. Standardization: With many candidate approaches being investigated in reflectarrays, metasurfaces, frequency selective surfaces, among others, there has not been a consensus on how to standardize the device architecture, maximum emitted power, and communication protocols. As more ideas evolve, a standardization effort within a work group is necessary towards a solidary framework. Inclusion of advanced application scenarios: as a promising solution for future generation of wireless systems, the Intelligent Communication Environments should be designed to fit to more advanced scenarios, for example, in use cases with a very large quantity of devices as in the Internet of Things, under high demands of real-time video streaming, with devices of high mobility, among others. Smart resource allocation solutions: resources in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains should be allocated in an optimal manner to satisfy per-user demand. AI-driven design and optimization: in complicated scenarios under which no closed-form solutions can be found using conventional optimization approaches, advanced algorithms in artificial intelligence can assist in the deployment of Intelligent Communication Environments, especially when complex surface layout or structures are in presence. SECTION V. Pervasive Artificial Intelligence In the past few years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed immense growth, leading to its application in a wide variety of fields across both academia and industry. In the realm of communications and signal processing, AI can be readily applied to cognitive radios, remote sensing, computer vision, and network management. More specifically, in the domain of wireless communications, AI and its associated algorithms are also gradually proving their utility in various emerging techniques such as massive MIMO communications which requires efficient channel estimation and symbol detection. Such tasks often do not yield low complexity optimal solutions in complex channels [75], and thus parallel processing inherent in machine learning can be favorably leveraged to enhance computational capacity. Admittedly, even though current wireless communication networks follow a layered structure, in which each layer primarily serves several functions, applications of AI and relevant algorithms are gradually bridging the gap across layers in a way that can globally optimize the performance in the entire wireless network. However, in order to provide a marked trail to navigate through a plethora of pervasive AI applications, this section is organized based on the existing layers. It is worth noting that AI is a broad concept, under which reside several branches covering interleaved research topics, such as robotics, natural language processing, machine learning (ML), computer vision, among others. In this section, we focus specifically on the ML algorithms and their applications in wireless communications under the AI umbrella. These two terms are thus used interchangeably in this section. As shown in Figure 5, artificial intelligence can be applied to each layer of the wireless network. At the network layer, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used for traffic clustering to further adapt the network resources to various scenarios [76]. At the physical and MAC layers, deep learning can optimize resource allocation strategies for power distribution, and modulation and coding schemes, among others. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms can also assist with channel estimation and multi-user detection. FIGURE 5. Applications of artificial intelligence at different layers of wireless systems. Show All A. AI in the Physical Layer Traditionally, physical layer modeling has been model-oriented—a practice in which mathematical models following a certain framework are proposed and optimized under constraints to satisfy a series of pre-determined performance requirements. For example, in order to conduct channel estimation, a channel model is assumed along with other parametric configurations. These model-based solutions usually perform well if the derivation of mathematical models is relatively straightforward or there exists a closed-form solution. The models can then be validated by field measurements or numerical simulations. However, in real-world scenarios, the applicability of such model-based solutions falls short in complicated environments, due to factors such as non-linearity inside systems and uncontrollable interference, among others. On the other hand, another approach, which is based on statistics, or data sets, builds the model through learning from the data. This method is particularly useful when theoretical analysis is intractable or when a closed-form solution is difficult to obtain. For example, in diffusion-based channels commonly found in molecular communication, the channel characteristics depend largely on the environment, making them challenging to model theoretically [77]. In such cases, some data is used for training, which can help establish a model, while other data is used for testing in order to validate the model. To date, artificial intelligence has demonstrated its usefulness in various physical layer techniques. For example, in channel estimation and symbol detection, deep learning approaches reported in [78], [79] have shown that the proposed deep learning-based symbol detection algorithms can provide robust and accurate results with reduced complexity. Furthermore, a deep learning method based on the deep neural network architecture also demonstrates an improved channel estimation accuracy under the effects of non-linearities of power amplifiers, I/Q imbalance, and quantization errors induced by hardware impairments [80]. An autoencoder-based communication system is proposed to reconstruct the transmitted signals from channel impairment based on trained deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner [81]. Furthermore, self-supervised learning is becoming a trend for user localization since it has been demonstrated that relevant methods can significantly reduce the size of labeled dataset for efficient processing [82] B. AI in Wireless Networks In other essential layers of a wireless network, the existence of rich datasets lends itself to the applicability of machine learning-based solutions. In routing protocol design for wireless sensor networks, researchers have successfully utilized reinforcement learning methods to achieve a more energy-efficient routing scheme for underwater sensor networks [83]. In the vehicular industry, autonomous driving has already been studied and become a reality in some cities in Arizona, US.2 With respect to vehicular communication networks, due to the constant movement of vehicles, a predictive model based on real-time data has superiority over traditional theoretical models in terms of accuracy. Artificial intelligence and its plethora of algorithms can be applied in varied ways in such networks: autoencoders for predicting traffic flow [84], k -means clustering for traffic congestion control [85], and Q -learning for intelligent resource management [86], among others [87]. In the Internet of Space Things, with our envisioned multi-band communication capabilities in both inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links, we have proposed a deep neural network-based resource allocation strategy to enable a flexible scheme for CubeSats to stay connected without human intervention from the ground [88]. Apart from advancements in algorithm development, a potential issue dwells on the location of data storage and processing, which has largely happened in central data centers in the cloud. For devices distributed in a wide geographic range, this undoubtedly adds significant delays in performing tasks which require real-time operation. Moreover, a centralized computing manner is not desired from perspectives of data security and constraint in processing capacity [89]. In order to relieve such challenges, edge AI pushes local devices to fulfil operation and management tasks. Admittedly, this could lead to possible overburden in local devices, since they are not equipped with as powerful processing units as the cloud processing center, however, research efforts in this direction are dedicated to: (i) acceleration in boosting the hardware’s processing capability, and (ii) leveraging the coordination between local and central processing units to optimization task distribution. C. AI in Network Management and Orchestration AI, or more specifically ML, has an integral role to play in the management of networks [90]–[92]. In fact, Clark et al. introduced the concept of the Knowledge Plane [93] back in 2003, describing it as a pervasive ML-based system within the network that is geared towards providing services and advice to other elements of the network. More recently, with sofware-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) becoming mainstream, large-scale data acquisition has become easier than ever before, making a strong case for ML-based management and orchestration primitives within 6G, ultimately leading to full network automation as discussed in the next section. In particular, the domain of network management presents a wide variety of problems that can be broadly categorized into: [91] Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is typically applied to problems relating to traffic prediction [94] and classification [95], as well as slice resource prediction [96]. While the former primarily involves preemptively determining the network traffic load, as well as determining the applications, protocols and QoS classes the traffic belongs to, for fine-grained traffic engineering, the latter involves predicting the resource requirements associated with different network slices based on the anticipated traffic load. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning typically finds use in problems associated with resource management [97], [98]. For example, the popular virtual network embedding problem wherein the network orchestrator performs optimal placement of virtual network functions onto the underlying physical substrate, is highly amenable to reinforcement learning [99]. Other applications include elastic scaling of network infrastructure [100], failure prevention, and configuration rollback [101]. Unsupervised Learning: While both supervised learning and reinforcement learning have shown significant promise in the network management domain, we note that there exist certain use cases such as those relating to optimizing the end-users’ Quality of Experience (QoE) [102] and network security [103] where: (i) labeled data for training is simply not present and (ii) the real-time nature of the application makes it impractical to wait for feedback. In such cases, unsupervised learning can prove to be an indispensable tool. For example, intrusion detection systems based on autoencoders have been shown to outperform supervised learning-based systems [104]. D. Open Problems for Pervasive AI During early years of 5G standardization, researchers have discussed potentials of AI in achieving high time and spectrum efficiency once incorporated in 5G. Specifically, AI algorithms can help facilitate the following tasks which would yield low efficiency with conventional solutions: identify network anomalies, allocate network resources, perform network management, among others [106]. However, so far these solutions have not been officially adopted in 5G standards worldwide. In June 2020, the ITU has initiated an AI/ML in 5G challenge to motivate researchers to identify and solve real-world problems using AI/ML solutions in relevant 5G directions.3 As such, it is envisioned that such efforts would be factored in later 5G development but will be materialized in a more concrete and pervasive manner in 6G. While pervasive artificial intelligence in wireless communication networks will undoubtedly bring a paradigm shift towards data-oriented approaches, there are still open problems to be resolved. First, thus far no agreement has ever been reached on which algorithms work the best to solve a generalized problem in wireless networks, such as modulation and coding scheme design, channel estimation, and resource allocation, among others. Almost all published works claim significant accuracy or reduced complexity with either analytical theories or practical data sets [107]. Additionally, we note the absence of an effective method to draw a fair comparison among all proposed solutions, due to variations in selected data sets, assumptions, evaluation criteria, and so on. However, when it comes to realistic deployments, a careful gleaning process should be performed in order to identify algorithms without loss of general applicability. Second, the limited availability of quality datasets is detrimental to the testing and validation of proposed classification or regression algorithms. SECTION VI. Network Automation SDN and NFV have been widely recognized as the major paradigm shifts that occurred with the advent of 5G [108]. In particular, SDN has paved the way for the separation of the data and control planes, while NFV has been instrumental in decoupling the software from the hardware. Consequently, both wired and wireless networks have witnessed significant benefits from the adoption of SDN and NFV, including but not limited to simplified network management and service deployment, availability of advanced traffic engineering solutions and fine-grained network slicing techniques, and reduced CAPEX and OPEX. A major contribution of network softwarization has also been the commoditization of key network components such as switches [109] and base stations [110], [111], allowing for their implementation on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. In addition, the large open-source community supporting these projects has played a pivotal role in engaging a wider set of stakeholders than was previously possible. As networks evolve further, the traditional network operations routine, rooted in manual configuration and static script-based primitives, cannot keep up with the increasing complexity. Instead, we posit that automation will serve as the major driving force behind building upon the improvements brought forth by SDN and NFV. More specifically, network automation is defined as the process of automating the configuration, management, testing, deployment, and operations of physical and virtual devices within a network [112]. Network automation is intended to speed up the delivery of network services while adhering to dynamic and robust service-level agreements (SLAs), and reducing the potential for errors through minimization of manual intervention. Standardization efforts in this domain have led to the introduction of the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in the control plane and the Management Data Analytics Service (MDAS) in the management plane, for enhanced data collection and analytics functionalities within 3GPP Releases 15 and 16 [113], [114]. Both these functions form a critical segment of the Service-Based Architecture (SBA) within 5G, highlighting the growing importance of network automation. To this end, we explore three key tenets of network automation in this section– software-defined programmable data planes, automated service decomposition and orchestration, and self-driving networks. While the first two are primarily concerned with automating specific aspects of the network, i.e., the data plane and the network slicing procedure, self-driving networks are the holy grail of network automation, requiring absolutely no manual intervention. A. Software-Defined Programmable Data Planes Being the most popular Southbound API, OpenFlow [115] is synonymous with SDN and has been featured widely in 5G networks. Yet, the stateless match-action abstraction implemented by OpenFlow precludes true data plane programmability since it relies largely on static header field matching. Within the context of this paper, we define data plane programmability as a feature that allows data plane devices, such as switches, to expose their packet-processing logic to the control plane in order for it be completely reconfigured if required. For example, the controller should be seamlessly able to modify the packet parsing and processing pipeline as required, add support for new protocols, and modify existing ones. To this end, P4 [116] is being increasingly recognized as “the programming language for the data plane”. P4 supports a wide variety of hardware ranging from ASICs to commodity CPUs, and allows the controller to specify: (i) a packet parser for extracting header fields, and (ii) a collection of match-action tables that process these headers. Further, we note that the operation of many applications depends upon the real-time state of the system, and relying on the controller to update the forwarding state each time introduces a significant latency burden. Consequently, there has been a growing body of research that seeks to develop stateful data planes, wherein some of the stateful packet processing and control tasks are offloaded to the data plane switches [117]–[119]. For example, a stateful data plane device may store some form of packet metadata, using it to process new packets belonging to the same flow. The general packet forwarding rules are still set by the controller, however, the presence of state information provides context for rule selection at the switch level. Programmable stateful data planes present a variety of inter-related research challenges. First, there is a need for a generic broad-based definition of state, along with abstractions that expose this state. Second, since packet-level state maintenance will be done by distributed switching devices, there is a need for a state consistency mechanism. A mechanism of this kind could potentially be enforced through the controller, to prevent conflicting forwarding actions. Third, security considerations present another important challenge. If the data plane switches are going to perform actions based on packet metadata, a malicious actor could easily use malformed packets to trigger state transitions for example. In this case, ultra-lightweight mechanisms will be needed to verify packet integrity. B. Automated Service Decomposition and Orchestration Network slicing allows for the provisioning of differentiated services over the same physical infrastructure [120], and has been a major research focus in the cellular domain [121]–[124]. However, the slice instantiation and deployment process is largely template-driven and requires manual configuration. For example, current 3GPP network slicing specification [120] is primarily based on the concept of network slice templates (NSTs). An NST explicitly defines the virtual network functions (VNFs) and associated service function chain that comprise a network service. Consequently, such network slicing primitives allow for the deployment of a limited set of network services, i.e., only those services for which a template has already been defined. Clearly, an approach of this kind is not scalable because: (i) it does not provide a mechanism to deal with new kinds of network services, and (ii) as network services increase in complexity, the effort required to create and maintain templates will become an operational burden. Going beyond the traditional template-driven model, we propose the concept of automated service decomposition and orchestration for network slice automation, as shown in Figure 6. To this end, and in line with 3GPP terminology, we identify three major stakeholders– the communication service customers (CSCs), the communication service providers (CSPs), and the virtual infrastructure service providers (VISPs). The CSCs request communications services from CSPs, who instantiate network slices and deploy them over infrastructure owned by VISPs to deliver the requested services. As part of the slice automation workflow, the CSCs provide high-level requirements such as those relating to latency, throughput, reliability, etc., along the lines of the emerging intent-based networking paradigm [125]. Next, the CSC automatically decomposes the request into a constituent VNF-forwarding graph (VNF-FG). It is important to note here that the service to VNF-FG mapping is not a based on a template, but instead makes use of deep learning models to extract service requirements and construct the corresponding VNF-FG. The resulting service-specific VNF-FG also contains the resource requirements for the constituent VNFs, allowing for seamless deployment onto the underlying infrastructure. Once the service has been deployed, continuous monitoring and real-time telemetry are used to ensure operational optimality. FIGURE 6. Automated network slicing framework. Show All C. Self-Driving Networks For decades, the network operator has served as the centerpiece of network operations. However, the increasing complexity of communications networks coupled with the constant state of flux brought forth by an ever-increasing number of connected devices has made the task of real-time network management nearly impossible for human operators. Therefore, there is a strong case for transitioning from operator-driven networks to self-driving networks. More specifically, self-driving networks are expected to allow for elastic utilization of resources, error-free operation, prompt and targeted responses to security incidents, and proactive rather than reactive service handling [126, §2]. Seeking complete automation of network management, a self-driving network is defined as a network where: (i) network measurements are task-driven and tightly integrated with the control of the network, and (ii) large-scale data analytics and machine learning models are used for network control, as opposed to closed-form models of individual protocols [127]. In a nutshell, self-driving networks should be capable of measuring, analyzing, and controlling themselves in an automated manner [128]. At the outset, a self-driving network should take a high-level goal or intent as input. Expanding upon the concept of intents, we note that there are broadly two types of intents– imperative and declarative. While the former describes in explicit detail how a particular procedure should be carried out, the latter just describes the end-goal without specifying how the stated goal should be achieved. For example, “reduce network congestion by shifting incoming traffic originating at ingress node 1 from load balancer 2 to load balancer 3” is an imperative intent since it explicitly defines the steps that network must undertake in order to relieve congestion. On the other hand, “optimize network operations” is a declarative intent. However, a truly declarative intent of the kind described here would be extremely difficult to implement in the near future. Instead, semi-declarative intents that define more concrete goals would be far more helpful. “Minimize network congestion”, is one example of such an intent since it tasks the network with optimizing its operation by focusing on a specific objective, i.e., minimizing congestion. Based on the intent, the network is expected to determine: (i) the measurements that need to be performed, (ii) the corresponding inferences and learning that is required, and (iii) the actions that must be undertaken in response to the input intent. While a formal representation for self-driving networks is yet to be realized, a high-level architecture has been presented in Figure 7, highlighting the importance of large-scale data acquisition, real-time analytics and inference, and programmable data planes. FIGURE 7. High-level architecture for self-driving networks. Show All However, the realization of self-driving networks brings forth several research challenges as described next. Accurate Intent Definitions: As discussed previously, good intent definitions must toe the line between imperative and declarative. If the intent is primarily imperative, it defeats the point of automation. On the other hand, if the intent is purely declarative, the automation procedure becomes unnecessarily complex. Therefore, there is a pressing need for formal guidelines that put forward a clear framework for intent definitions. For example, a framework of this kind could take into account customer expectations in terms of throughput and latency, network-wide resource optimization goals, along with other application-specific functions and services that are required from the network. Automated Real-time Inference: Machine learning is vital to the automated decision making process in self-driving networks. However, previous work in this domain has largely focused on applying pre-existing learning techniques for network control, which are not well-suited for network data, given its high-volume, distributed nature, and rapid evolution. The major challenge here is the native integration of inference and control algorithms with the network’s decision and control fabric. In addition, network design needs to evolve to improve the quality of data that is input to the designed control algorithms [127]. Within the domain of self-driving networks, it is widely accepted that quality of data (QoD) is a pre-requisite for quality of service (QoS) [127]. In-band Telemetry: Research into in-band telemetry (INT) has been largely driven by the need for high quality network monitoring data, without introducing additional overhead. The INT approach makes use of programmable data planes to encapsulate additional metadata within the data packets themselves [129]. Examples of such metadata include switch processing times, buffer occupancy levels, and even specific policy rules. As packets traverses the network, they keep accumulating additional metadata, which can be extracted as desired, thus providing highly-detailed accurate sets of network data. To this end, there is a need to quantify the impact of INT on network performance [130]. In particular, metrics such as the relationship between the amount of metadata and packet size, the additional processing burden introduced, and the accuracy of the measurements obtained are all important parameters that merit careful consideration. SECTION VII. 6G Radio: Reconfigurable Transceiver Front-Ends The massive increase in the number of wirelessly interconnected devices, combined with the ever-growing demand for higher wireless data rates, is leading to an overcrowded electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. To overcome the spectrum scarcity problem and increase the capacity of wireless networks, communication at frequencies beyond RF (i.e., from the mmWave to the THz bands) is required. To meet the data-rate, reliability, and scalability requirements from RF to THz, transformative solutions are needed which include the design, implementation, and optimization of frequency-agile, ultra-broadband reconfigurable systems. A system of this kind is able to simultaneously sense and communicate over the full EM spectrum (1 GHz to 10 THz), and serves as a major contributor towards the infrastructure needed for the next generation of wireless communications. To realize this vision, pioneering contributions are required in terms of: (i) new devices that surpass the limits of CMOS technology by leveraging the state-of-the-art in materials science and nanoscale physics, (ii) heterogeneous integration of such devices which is compatible with the electrical, thermal, and EMI requirements for reconfigurability and manufacturing scalability, and (iii) novel all-spectrum dynamic sensing and communication algorithms, which maximize the achievable network capacity. The primary goal for 6G radio is to establish dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication from RF to THz bands, therefore, transforming the way in which wireless devices sense, access, and share the EM spectrum. To achieve such a goal, key steps include: (i) intelligent all-spectrum sensing solutions, (ii) transceiver hardware design and implementation, and (iii) spectral and energy efficiency optimization as well as resource management. It is worth noting that currently reported works are fulfilling part of this grand goal by achieving dynamic spectrum sensing or multi-band communications over several frequency bands. It is our hope to motivate advanced solutions to realize all-spectrum communications through this section. A. Dynamic All-Spectrum Sensing and Access In recent times, a concentrated research effort at the physical and link layers has driven exciting progress at RF frequencies for individual cognitive radios (CRs). For example, a recently awarded research project by the Research and Innovation Program in the United Kingdom named “6G Mitola Radio” aims to establish self-regulating societies for wireless communications with fairness and high efficiency.4 This research will facilitate seamless convergence across heterogeneous wireless networks with intelligent decisions made by radios to maximize the quality of experience for end-users. One step further, a major challenge is to develop innovative spectrum sensing and sensing-informed communication and network optimization techniques for dynamic access to all-spectral resources. Within this context, the targeted breakthrough would be the development of wireless network-aware state inference using all-spectrum cartography for cognition over the swath of frequencies from RF to the THz bands, along with cartography-constrained algorithms for the physical and cross-layer control protocols. Artificial intelligence and associated learning algorithms should be investigated for dynamic spectrum sharing with a minimum cost in interference. The techniques developed should wholly exploit the capabilities of the hybrid front-ends, which include a multi-band transceiver design and solutions for resource management. B. Multi-Band Transceiver Design The optimal selection of materials and devices needed to enable all-spectrum communications is vital to the success of any multi-band transceiver design. Existing solutions mostly rely on CMOS for multi-band operations, but such an approach only works well in narrowbands. Moreover, solutions based on software-defined radios (SDRs) have high energy consumption and carbon footprint, consuming several Watts in operation [131], [132]. Instead, novel approaches based on metamaterials, MEMS switches, and even nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) switches should be sought to implement hybrid front-ends (Figure 8), which are able to simultaneously sense the EM spectrum, identify the best available band, and communicate over it, at frequencies anywhere from 1 GHz to 10 THz. Furthermore, fast-evolving deep learning algorithms serve as an efficient solution for identifying available spectrum, tuning channels, and adjusting RF power levels. FIGURE 8. Conceptual design of a hybrid front-end for dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication in 6G. Show All To realize this vision, new techniques in materials and devices, integration and packaging, and spectrum sensing and communication are necessary. At the RF and microwave frequency bands, a combination of low-risk mature CMOS technology, with less-mature, potentially transformative technologies, including quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and new plasmonic technologies based on graphene and other 2D materials will be able to provide optimal tunabilities as well as a high quality factor (i.e., the Q-factor). The heterogeneous integration of discrete devices into a fully functional front-end will require innovation to satisfy material compatibility, EMI shielding, thermal dissipation, and scalability requirements. On the other hand, metamaterial and nano-materials will be deployed at sub-THz and THz bands, based on recent advances in nano-tubes and graphene, as well as other single-atom-thin semiconductors. Space-time-frequency coding in metasurfaces will also allow programmable and fine-tunable radio access at mmWaves. Optimal control of the front-ends requires innovative all-spectrum sensing, utilization and sharing techniques, new waveform and hierarchical modulation designs to maximize the capacity and distance in ultra-broadband systems, and scalable networking solutions which are able to support the envisioned node density in future cyber-physical systems. The combination of several cutting-edge techniques can help maximize: (i) spectrum utilization (toward all-spectrum utilization), (ii) data-rates (toward terabit-per-second links) and, (iii) network user capacity (billions of interconnected wireless devices). The proposed technology will enable a plethora of applications in the consumer, military, industrial and medical fields, including transformative networking architectures designed to meet the scalability demands in future cyber-physical systems. C. Reconfigurable Front-End Scheme Accompanying the dynamic all-spectrum sensing and multi-band operation, agile front-ends should also be equipped with reconfigurability. In terms of hardware design, the plasmonic reflectarrays can be deployed in the 3D environment, with a size ranging from 1 mm2 to 100 mm2 depending on the operating frequency (mmWave/THz-band). Owing to the sub-wavelength size of their elements, the plasmonic reflectarrays are able to reflect signals in non-conventional ways, which include controlled reflections in non-specular directions as well as reflections with polarization conversion [133]. In order to adapt to dynamic frequency operation, achieve various levels of directivity, and allocate multiple beams, the aperture of plasmonic reflectarray antenna can be controlled mechanically through folding, splitting, or combining in a 3D space. Existing prior art using origami antennas works well in systems using a single metal antenna, as reported in [134], [135]. However, to achieve reconfigurable continuous aperture antenna arrays, plasmonic reflectarrays offer a higher degree of freedom with the compactness of unit element distribution. On the other hand, electronically-controlled reconfigurable antenna arrays are envisioned by leveraging the tunability of plasmonic antennas. In particular, one of the relevant properties of graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas is the possibility to change their resonant frequency by utilizing a small voltage to modify their Fermi energy [136]. The possibility to tune an antenna (or group of antennas) at different frequencies without any mechanical modification (as opposed to other multi-band antenna arrays that utilize MEMS or NEMS to create origami type structures [137]) enables beamforming not only across space but also across frequencies. D. Open Problems The biggest hurdle to be overcome lies in the implementation of an integrated ultra-broadband hybrid front-end that is capable of sensing and communication from the RF to the THz bands, over a target distance of a few hundred meters. Meeting this multidisciplinary challenge requires us to: (i) close the THz gap by developing new device technologies, (ii) design and integrate re-programmable circuitry, interconnects and antennas that can support all-spectrum operation, (iii) develop new material integration and packaging techniques to satisfy the electrical, thermal and EMI requirements of disparate bands, and, (iv) develop scalable all-spectrum communication using the front-ends. SECTION VIII. Ambient Backscatter Communications In the realm of IoT, sensors are expected to function in various environments with long-lasting battery life. Solutions such as radio frequency identification (RFID) utilize the backscatter technique to modulate and reflect RF signals instead of generating them, which can achieve a significant degree of energy saving. However, existing modulated backscatter solutions have stringent requirements in terms of the proximity between the backscatter transmitter and the RF source, due to the attenuation of the signal over long distances. Besides, the modulated backscatter transmitters are passive, which means that they cannot transmit data without requests initiated by backscatter receivers [138]. Furthermore, the issue of self-interference may arise when the backscatter receiver and RF sources are co-located. Hence, in order to achieve better energy efficiency with a higher degree of flexibility and scalability, new solutions are required in the 6G IoT network. Currently, with more small cells being deployed in outdoor and more access points in indoor environments, the RF signals are covering a wide range of surroundings, and can be considered as a resource to be utilized by secondary radio links without requiring extra power. The system that employs such a technique is called an “ambient backscatter communication system”. In an ambient backscatter communication system, transmitters can harvest the surrounding and continuous electromagnetic waves radiated by TV towers, base stations, as well as access points, use simple circuits for modulation, and reflect them towards receivers. There is no need for dedicated spectrum bands for such ambient backscatter transceivers to operate, nor complex electronic components (e.g., analog-to-digital converters) to process signals. A. Operation Principles of Backscatter Communications In general, as the name suggests, backscatter communication systems reflect signals impinged on a backscatter transmitter in the direction of the signals’ origin, and since it is not a perfect specular reflection, the signals are scattered within a certain angular range of the environment. A backscatter communication receiver within the range can thus pick up the signals. In particular, backscatter communications have three variations in terms of architecture, which are monostatic, bistatic, and ambient backscatter communications, respectively. Here we briefly explain the first two types and then focus on the last one. As the most commonly adopted backscatter communication approach with widely-used RFID applications, monostatic backscatter communication systems have the simplest setup, which consists of a backscatter transmitter and a reader. The reader has both an RF signal source and a backscatter receiver embedded with a switch to change the operation mode. Once the receiver sends out a request, the RF source activates the backscatter transmitter, which then modulates and reflects the EM waves impinged on it back to the receiver, as shown in Figure 9. Such a design is mainly used for short-range RFID applications [138]. Nonetheless, two drawbacks of the monostatic backscatter communication architecture are (i) the reader cannot perform full duplex communication due to the switch mechanism, and (ii) the signals experience round-trip path loss being sent from the reader to the transmitter and then reflected back to the reader. FIGURE 9. Illustration of backscatter communication systems. Show All On the contrary, in the bistatic backscatter communication architecture, the RF source and receiver are separated, as shown in Figure 9, which provides higher flexibility in the spatial domain. With multiple RF sources and backscatter transmitters well placed, the serving range can be remarkably extended compared to the monostatic backscatter scenario. Despite this improvement, it is more costly for bistatic backscatter communication systems to operate in real networks, since they require RF sources and transmitters to be well-placed so as to achieve desired performance, and most of the times this condition can be difficult to satisfy, especially in a sophisticated network environment, such as an indoor office or dense urban scenarios. B. Mechanism of Ambient Backscatter Communications Different from the monostatic backscatter device where the transmitting and receiving components are separately located and the RF source is co-located with the receiver, devices of ambient backscatter communication systems consist of both the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, distinct from bistatic backscatter communications, ambient backscatter communications do not require dedicated RF sources to provide exclusive services, which can reduce infrastructure and maintenance expenditure significantly. Therefore, the ambient backscatter communications provide the most energy-efficient solution for sensors in the IoT network in 6G. Specifically, in one proof-of-concept study for utilizing the always-on radio signals for ambient backscatter communications reported in [139], TV signals serve as the RF source, which can be amplitude and sometimes frequency-division modulated. In the ambient backscatter transmitter design, a simple switch consisting of a transistor and connected to the antenna can be used to modulate the impedance of the antenna: a mismatch of impedance indicates a reflection mode of the impinging signals, whereas a matched impedance allows for the signal being absorbed by the antenna [139]. The power consumption of such 1-bit modulation of signals is minimal. At the receiver side, by demodulating the received sequence of “1” and “0”, signals can be successfully recovered. However, it is worth noting that since the reflected signals from the ambient environment already contain encoded information from the RF source system (e.g., cellular or TV networks), the receiver design should take into consideration how to extract the backscattered signals from the mixture. Besides the simplicity in transceiver implementation, ambient backscatter communications are not restricted to a single-band operation. In fact, the ambient backscatter transceivers can operate in the wide range of super high frequency (SHF) bands, covering Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other bands [138]. C. Open Problems in Ambient Backscatter Communications Spectral and Energy Efficiency: Currently, the research and development of ambient backscatter communications is still in its infancy. As mentioned before, careful planning of backscatter devices is crucial for achieving good performance. Due to the randomness in IoT device deployment, current solutions fall behind in terms of the targeted spectral efficiency. Specifically, the randomly-located IoT devices should utilize ambient backscatter links to achieve a satisfying throughput while maintaining an extended transmission distance. Additionally, even though individual backscatter communication devices demonstrate good energy performance, an IoT network comprising hundreds or even thousands of such devices might still require optimization of energy efficiency on a system level. Protocol Design: Existing ambient backscatter communication systems are mostly used for dedicated application-specific purposes, and thus lack good compatibility with other wireless communication systems. Standardization and protocol design are necessary to formalize the key operation and management aspects of ambient backscatter communications, such as packet size, routing protocols, among others. SECTION IX. Internet of Space Things With CubeSats and UAVs The Internet of Space Things (IoST) is a spatial expansion of the Internet of Things which primarily focuses on terrestrial use cases. For future communication networks, this expansion is necessary for the following reasons: (i) the IoT relies heavily on existing infrastructure and hence lacks flexibility as well as scalability, (ii) global coverage is impossible using traditional IoT solutions, especially in remote areas including the North and South Poles, due to the imbalance of construction expenditure and service revenue, and (iii) limited heterogeneity and spectrum resources in the IoT network. To this end, IoST is envisioned as a ubiquitous cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, with applications in monitoring and reconnaissance, in-space backhauling, and holistic data integration [140]. More specifically, as shown in Figure 10, IoST consists of the ground station, customer premises, and on-Earth sensing devices which form the ground segment, and the CubeSats, UAVs, and near-Earth sensing devices that form the space segment. The ground-to-satellite links (GSLs) connect the IoST Hubs with CubeSats to exchange requests and data, and the inter-satellite links (ISLs) relay information to neighboring CubeSats, in both the same orbit as well as adjacent orbits. Further, the UAVs establish links with each other, as well as sensors and CubeSats to form a localized data aggregation layer. To this end, we note that UAVs are expected to feature heavily in the upcoming 3GPP Releases 16 and 17 [142]. Further, since the space segment forms a vital component of the system, research relating to the development of small satellites, or CubeSats [143], for use within IoST is of critical importance [140]. FIGURE 10. Illustration of the IoST [140]. Show All CubeSats are a set of miniaturized satellites with sizes ranging from 1U to 6U (a “U” is 10×10×10c m 3 ). Currently, CubeSats are being deployed for a variety of applications including Earth sensing [144], positioning, and IoT and machine-to-machine communications. Compared to traditional LEO satellites, CubeSats present a number of advantages relating to (i) lower costs and shorter development cycles and (ii) higher flexibility and scalability [141]. Normally the development cycles range from three to seven years for traditional LEO and GEO satellites and the costs are extremely high. Also, since the payloads are pre-determined in the LEO and GEO satellites from the period of development until deployment, it is difficult to reconfigure any component in the middle of the process. However, CubeSats’ development can be done in a remarkably shorter time using COTS components with much lower costs. This also guarantees that CubeSats are easily reconfigurable. To this end, we have recently proposed a new next-generation CubeSat hardware concept as shown in Figure 11 [141]. The proposed CubeSat design includes an all-new communications subsystem for seamless operation in a wide variety of frequency bands. More specifically, the novelty of our design concept is characterized by the presence of multi-band transceivers and antennas that are able to support wireless communications at microwave, mmWave, and THz frequencies as detailed in the following section. Through this unique CubeSat design, we can potentially achieve data rates in excess of 100 Gbps [141]. FIGURE 11. Conceptual design of a next-generation CubeSat [141]. Show All A. Multi-Band Communications Subsystem The primary motivation for a multi-band communications subsystem comes from the fact that existing CubeSats have limited communications capabilities, largely relying on spectrum ranging from the L- (1–2 GHz) till the Ka- (26.5–40 GHz) band. There are two major drawbacks associated with this approach. First, the traditional frequency bands are becoming increasingly prone to congestion [145]. Second, the Tbps-level throughput required by IoST cannot be achieved with existing frequency bands. To overcome the spectrum scarcity and capacity limitations in current satellite networks, we have proposed the use of multiple frequency bands from RF to THz spectrum, in IoST [141]. The use of such frequencies has been made possible by advances in high-frequency device development [26], [146]. More specifically, as part of the multi-band communications subsystem, we have developed both multi-frequency transceivers as well as antenna systems, as described next. As shown in Figure 12, in our proposed multi-band transceiver, we use two complementary approaches, namely, an electronic frequency up-converting chain and an optical frequency down-converting chain, to generate signals at different frequencies. With regard to the electronics-based approach, the primary idea is to use frequency splitters in order to extract the intermediate frequencies for outputs. For example, as shown in Figure 12, the signal at frequency f 1 is considered as the intermediate output when producing signals at a higher frequency f 2 . FIGURE 12. The proposed all-spectrum signal front-end designs [141]. Show All On the other hand, the photonics-based approach involves the down-conversion of optical signals. As shown in Figure 12, multi-band signals are generated by heterodyning two input signals with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. The resulting RF signal has a frequency equal to the difference between the two inputs. The generated signal, along with the two input signals, serves as the final output. Distinct from the commonly used up-conversion and down-conversion techniques where intermediate frequency products are abandoned, our approach harvests them and utilizes them as part of the multi-band communication system. These multi-band frequencies can be assigned to the GSLs and ISLs dynamically to accommodate various service requirements. To this end, within IoST, the GSLs make use of the more robust microwave and mmWave frequencies, while high-capacity THz links form the ISLs. In addition to multi-band transceivers, CubeSats in the IoST are also equipped with multi-frequency antenna systems. In particular, as discussed in Section III, the use of THz links allows for very large antenna arrays that serve as the basis for massive MIMO and UM MIMO communication schemes. More specifically, we note that there exist multiple options when it comes to the design of multi-band antenna arrays. The first approach involves the use of NEMS, MEMS, and origami structures to create physically re-configurable antennas, wherein the size of the radiating elements can be changed physically with a view to adjust their resonant frequency. On the other hand, the second approach proposes the use of materials such as graphene to create electronically tunable nano-antenna arrays [147], [148]. In this case, the resonant frequency can be controlled by modulating the graphene Fermi energy or chemical potential. This allows for tuning of the antenna to resonate at different frequencies without physically changing its size, in contrast to the MEMS-based approach. B. System Constellation Design Within the context of IoST, an ideal constellation design is crucial to achieve true global coverage and satisfactory link performance. However, conventional LEO constellations are typically characterized by the presence of fewer than a hundred satellites, for example, the CubeSat-based IoT system, Astrocast, has a maximum of 64 satellites [149]. At the outset, the coverage and connectivity offered by such systems leaves much to be desired. Motivated by the need for improved coverage, reliable connectivity, and increased redundancy, mega-constellations of several hundred satellites have gained significant traction over the past year [150]. Mega-constellations provide several advantages over traditional constellations including but not limited to increased coverage density, improved connectivity, and higher redundancy. More specifically, constellation design typically involves solving for several inter-related parameters such as: (i) the apogee and perigee radii, (ii) the orbital eccentricity, (iii) the number of CubeSats per orbital plane, (iv) the number of orbital planes, and (v) the initial longitude of the ascending node, argument of perigee, and true anomaly of the CubeSats. While a fairly challenging problem in itself, the presence of an extremely large number of satellites further serves to complicate the system design. Consequently, the existing state-of-the-art constellation design frameworks are largely geared towards the design of systems with a few dozen satellites at best. To this end, we have proposed a highly-scalable and customizable constellation design framework that takes into consideration both coverage and connectivity parameters [151]. Through the use of novel metrics such as spherical Voronoi tessellation based coverage characterization and ISL feasibility-based connectivity parameters, we are able to demonstrate that the resulting IoST constellation achieves a performance level that is similar to existing state-of-the-art mega-constellations such as Starlink, while requiring only a quarter, i.e., less than 500, of the satellites [151]. C. Network Management IoST encompasses a vast infrastructure spanning both the Earth as well as space. A complex network of this kind has much to benefit from fine-grained real-time control that is well suited for tackling the peculiarities of the space environment, namely temporal topological variation and long delays. Going beyond the traditional bent pipe nature of satellite communications systems, IoST makes extensive use of SDN and NFV to significantly improve network resource utilization, simplify network management, and reduce operating costs [140]. In a manner similar to the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) paradigm, IoST intends to deliver CubeSats-as-a-service, with promising results as shown in [140]. In particular, we have demonstrated that through the use of SDN, it is possible to achieve sub-second end-to-end latencies. More specifically with the domain of network management, IoST introduces the novel concepts of virtual CSI (vCSI) for joint optimal physical-link layer resource allocation, and stateful segment routing (SSR) for overcoming challenges associated with the high latency space segment. In particular, concerning the latter, IoST extends the traditional SDN paradigm by including support for state-based packet forwarding that takes into account the topological configuration of the network at any given instance of time, while the use of segment routing helps in the minimization of control traffic, in addition to a higher level of demand satisfaction and load balancing as demonstrated in [152]. Further, IoST also employs predictive algorithms to preemptively detect GSL outage events, which when coupled with gateway diversity result in the realization of proactive handovers that minimize handover interruption time. In addition, IoST proposes the use of containzeration [153] in CubeSats for achieving lightweight hardware virtualization without significant overhead. Going forward, we note that the aforementioned techniques will play a vital role in the realization of pervasive cyber-physical systems of this kind. SECTION X. Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications In 5G wireless networks, massive MIMO communications have been tested and deployed at base stations (BSs) which are equipped with more than one hundred antenna elements to increase the antenna array gain and take advantage of the diversity gain. A related concept is network MIMO, which, instead of packing more than one hundred antenna elements at a single BS, forms a coordinated framework consisting of multiple BSs, each with multiple antennas. A coordination scheme of this kind can achieve spatial diversity by allowing a single user to be served by more than one BS at the same time, overcoming the disadvantage of bad channel conditions if only one BS is connected to the user, and eliminates inter-cell interference [154]. However, a detailed comparative study has shown that massive MIMO communication schemes outperform network MIMO with respect to end-user received signal strength and overall costs in configuration [155]. Going one step further, in order to effectively eliminate inter-cell interference caused by users located at cell boundaries, based on the ideas of distributed MIMO communications and coordinated multi-point (CoMP) communications, researchers have proposed the concept of cell-free massive MIMO communication. In a scheme of this kind, the originally densely-packed antenna array set with a few hundred elements at the BS is distributed in a fairly large area in the form of smaller sets with fewer than 10 antenna elements, while still serving a similar number of users in the same area [156]. As shown in Figure 13, the main difference between cell-free and classic massive MIMO communication systems is that instead of associating each user terminal to a cell with a BS equipped with a large number of antenna elements, it relaxes the restriction of cell boundaries, which can significantly reduce or even eliminate the inter-cell interference. Without cell boundaries, all BSs, or a subset of BSs, can serve users simultaneously in a coordinated manner. In coordination, the cell-free massive MIMO BSs can share with each other the data to be sent to users through fronthaul links. FIGURE 13. Cell-free massive MIMO in comparison with classic massive MIMO. Show All It has been shown that the BSs can use their local channel state information (CSI) to achieve satisfactory performance and avoid the excessive computation complexity associated with sharing global channel conditions with all BSs [157]. The local CSI can be estimated in the uplink channel in a time division duplex (TDD) mode. Then, precoding is performed based on the obtained channel information at the BSs, before data transmission in the downlink channel. The transmit power and precoding vector can be determined based on the geographic proximity of users to the BSs. Compared to the small-cell architecture in 5G, which consists of non-cooperative base stations that can serve up to 100 users per cell with a smaller area (e.g., up to a 200-meter cell radius) and reduced power in signal transmission (e.g., up to 10 Watts), a cell-free massive MIMO communication system achieves significantly better performance, since each user can be served by a dedicated access point. A reported study in [158] has demonstrated that the cell-free massive MIMO scheme improves 95%-likely per-user throughput by five times and by ten times under correlated shadow fading, with respect to the small-cell solution. More specifically, the same study has reported that when considering realistic channel conditions, including pilot contamination and imperfect CSI, cell-free massive MIMO systems demonstrate much higher throughput compared to small cells and, more importantly, are more robust to impacts such as shadow fading, non-coherence interference, as well as noise [158]. However, we also note the following challenges: (i) due to the issue of aliasing, channel estimation for signals received by different antenna elements is more complicated compared to that of ordinary massive MIMO communications, (ii) with the significantly increased synthesized aperture size, the range of near-field propagation grows larger, hence requiring a different channel model for characterizing the large- and small-scale channel parameters. A. Channel Characteristics of Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communication Systems It has been theoretically proven that as the number of antenna elements approaches infinity, adversarial channel effects, including inter-cell interference, small-scale fading, and others, will disappear [159]. In cell-free massive MIMO communications, such effects will also have a negligible impact on propagation channels. Specifically, channels under a coordinated scheme of this kind will satisfy the conditions of favorable propagation [160]. Favorable propagation conditions imply that the channel vectors between the BSs and UEs are orthogonal, so that the sum-rate can be maximized. This characteristic is most prominent in classic massive MIMO communications [161]. In cell-free massive MIMO systems, it has been shown that favorable propagation conditions can be achieved given that the number of APs is fairly large (with an approximate density of 1000/km2). B. Open Problems in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications As the domain of cell-free massive MIMO communications is relatively new, there are several open problems that merit further investigation. Among them, we posit that coordination and optimization challenges will critically affect the entire system performance and future deployments. User Scheduling: Extensive studies have been conducted on channel characterization and capacity analysis. However, the prior art does not take into consideration scenarios involving networks with a large number of users to serve. In such cases, there might be an upper bound for the number of APs to serve a user in order to maintain an acceptable-level of average throughput. Current works assume that all users will be served simultaneously under the same frequency resource block. However, when the number of users grows to a threshold where they can no longer be served at the same time, a scheduling scheme that achieves fairness should be considered. Location Optimization of APs: Existing works in cellular networks draw heavily upon stochastic geometry where cell structures follow 2D Voronoi tessellation and geographically separated BSs that serve cell-edge users under the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) scheme to improve overall system efficiency and overcome inter-cell interference through scheduling [162], [163]. It is therefore crucial to optimize the placement of BSs under practical link-level constraints such as signal-to-interference ratio as well as success probability for individual links to enhance network fairness [164]. In cell-free massive MIMO, since no cell boundaries are assumed, system-level performance pertaining to locations of APs, random scatterers, as well as users should be thoroughly investigated and optimized. SECTION XI. Technologies for Beyond 6G Thus far, we have presented in great detail the key drivers that are expected to play an integral role in the next-generation of wireless networks. However, in addition to these, we also note the presence of several promising early-stage technologies that are tipped to revolutionize how we perceive data communications in the near future. To this end, in this section, we discuss three such promising paradigms, namely, the Internet of NanoThings, Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications. A. Internet of NanoThings In addition to the need for more spectrum resources to accommodate a plethora of wireless devices and services, a variety of transformative wireless communications scenarios are also envisioned to become a reality in the near future. In particular, with the advent of wireless ubiquity, we note the existence of situations where electromagnetic waves do not yield acceptable performance or lack reachability due to hardware limitations, such as in high-salinity water or intravascular channels where the transmission range can be extremely short. In the aforementioned application scenarios for THz band communications, as the frequencies of operation increase, the wavelengths of signals fall into the nanometer range (i.e., 10−9 to 10−7 meter in size), thereby motivating studies on nano-network communications [165], [166]. Different from those operating at lower frequencies in the microwave range, the devices and transceivers used in the Internet of NanoThings (IoNT) are in the scale of nanometers, and thus behave differently from classical wireless communication systems. Given the much smaller size, each nano-thing consumes much less energy and is envisioned to be self-powered (e.g., via vibrational energy harvesting using piezoelectric nano-generators [167]). Besides conducting signal transmission tasks, the nano-things can also perform basic processing and data storage, as well as enabling new nano-sensing capabilities with higher sensitivity. Current advancements in nanotechnologies provide several promising candidate materials with various dimensions for creating such nano-machines, including a thin strip of graphene named graphene nanoribbons, graphene in form of a three-dimensional (3D) roll named carbon nanotubes, and graphene spheres. Communications in the paradigm of nano-networks mainly falls under two categories, which are (i) encoded signal bits being carried with molecules, which follows a diffusion-based mechanism elaborated in Section XI-B1 and (ii) plasmonic radiation on metamaterial-based antennas including graphene and carbon nano-tubes operating in the THz band. These plasmonic antennas [136], [168]–[170] leverage the physics of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves, i.e., confined EM waves resulting from the global oscillations of electrons at the interface of a conductor material and a dielectric material, to efficiently radiate at the target resonant frequency while being much smaller than the corresponding wavelength. This property allows them to be integrated in very dense arrays, beyond traditional antenna arrays. The ratio between the free-space wavelength λ and the SPP wavelength λ SPP is known as the plasmonic confinement factor, and depends on the plasmonic material properties and the operation frequency. The higher the confinement factor, the smaller the antennas and the higher the density in which they can be integrated. 1) Essential Components in the IoNT Similar to traditional communication networks, several key components are seen in IoNT [171]: Nano-nodes are the basic functional units in the nano-network, and have sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers, and can form a cluster to forward and receive signals. A typical nano-node with full transceiving capability contains the following elements: a nano-antenna and a plasmonic nano-tranceiver based on graphene advancements to propagate SPP waves, a nano-processer with operating frequency close to 1 THz, nano-actuators, nano-sensors which can sense external force, gas molecules, and biological objects such as antigens and antibodies, a nano-memory which allows storage of a bit signal in a single atom, a nano-battery, and an energy nano-harvester which transfers energy to power other elements [172]. Limited by the computation capabilities and battery life, the signals are mostly pulse-based for the easiness of detection and transmission. Nano-routers control the behavioral patterns of the nano-nodes, aggregate information, and determine the optimal paths for signals to be forwarded. The nano-routers are equipped with higher energy and computational resources. When a specific query is created from the command center, nano-routers need to select the optimal routes that can reach the nano-nodes to collect their data and report back. Due to the limited transmission range, a pulse-based signaling is preferred to assess the reachable range of nano-nodes in order to minimize outage probability and establish the desired routes. Gateways serve as the remote controller of the IoNT and connect over the internet to service providers. The gateways can be common smart devices such as smartphones and tablets, among others. In order to achieve a manageable network with hundred or even thousands of nano-nodes dissipated in sophisticated communication environments, gateways should devise a holistic approach in disseminating commands and queries, coordinating between possible collisions, and processing noisy data, which requires a drastically different network framework than the conventional network architecture. Based on the arbitrary pattern of the nano-nodes, potential solutions can be found with the assistance of artificial intelligence, which does not require pre-established model for prediction. It is worth noting that major device technology in the IoNT is still under design and development. Although a few types of individual components, such as nano-sensors, have been made available, it is estimated that a major paradigm shift for the IoNT is expected to occur in the second half of the 2020s. 2) Applications of the IoNT In the realm of IoNT, applications can be primarily found in body area networks and short-distance local environments. Three typical application scenarios are described as follows (also illustrated in Figure 14): Nano-Cameras: The nano-cameras are based on nano-photosensing and nanotechnology to sense, combine, and process light signals before transforming them into electric signals. This system includes nano-photodectors, nano-lens, nano-batteries, and nano-memories in order to achieve fine-resolution imaging and signal processing. The nano-cameras can be applied to a wide range of scenarios including but not limited to intravascular imaging and fracture detection in oil pipelines [171]. On-Chip Networks: With microchips getting more compact in dimension while the complexity of functionality grows, on-chip signal transmission has become significantly more challenging. Currently, issues relating to CPU scalability and efficient memory synchronization have driven research trends towards wireless network-on-chip (WNoC) solutions, which can replace wired connections on conventional chips and take advantage of short-range communication in the nano-network at THz-band frequencies [173]. Nano-robots for IoNT: The nano-robots in nano-networks can be deployed in environments such as nuclear power plants and oil pipelines which might be hazardous for humans to perform tasks but require high precision and do not allow massive drilling or digging over existing infrastructure. Under these circumstances, nano-robots can be dissipated to sense and collect data relating to chemical concentration, and fluid speed, among others. By forming ad-hoc networks, the nano-robots can aggregate and forward data packets to gateways in the IoNT. Nano-robots are also being widely researched in biomedical engineering fields. To this end, Section XI-B will delve into nano-robots for healthcare applications. FIGURE 14. Application scenarios of molecular communications in IoNT and IoBNT. Show All 3) Open Problems in the IoNT The significant size shrinkage brings three major challenges. The first one is power efficiency optimization. Even though nano-devices consume power at the level of microwatts when transmitting femtosecond long pulses, in order to cover an area of a few square meters such as an office or a meeting room, the energy consumption factors in as a major constraint in maintaining a satisfying overall network performance. New designs on duty cycles for nano-transceivers should be proposed and evaluated, as well as new clustering algorithms in order to group nano-transceivers in close proximity for adaptive operations. The second open issue is interference control, which has been extensively studied in classic wireless network scenarios. However, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to the IoNT realm, due to the higher density of nano-transceivers in space and pulse-based signal transmission schemes. Self-interference becomes the most prominent issue for nano-transceivers when full duplex mode is deployed and hence requires novel scheduling algorithms to mitigate this adversarial effect. Additionally, new modulation and coding schemes should be developed to fit the need of nano-devices on spectral and power efficiency while maintaining a low probability of crosstalk among links. The third challenge resides in the network protocols. Since the IoNT will foreseeably function in a manner that is drastically different from the IoT due to differences in channel conditions, limited scale of operation, as well as miniaturized devices, the protocol stack design still remains an open field for exploration. B. Internet of BioNanoThings for Health Applications Highly relevant to IoNT, with its unique characteristics and applications, is the concept of the Internet of BioNanoThings (IoBNT). First introduced in 2015, the IoBNT has garnered significant traction in its efforts to synergistically combine telecommunications with healthcare solutions [174]. The IoBNT is a network of molecules which can communicate with each other. The types of molecular communications include artificial cells which act as gateways to translate between different molecule types, or a bio-cyber interface which can convert molecular signals to electrical ones and transmit to external devices for further processing [175]. In applications relating to human healthcare, the IoBNT harbors many unique challenges and opportunities. First, the interdisciplinary research on both communications and data analytics can greatly facilitate the modeling of biological processes, including cancer cell formations and Alzheimer’s disease, and further design effective control measures for such diseases. Second, even though expressions of genetic codes at the cell- and organ-level can vary remarkably, in a manner analogous to various types of data applications in wireless networks, communication models can be developed and exploited to conceive a generally applicable health information framework. Third, the holistic network architecture envisioned in the IoBNT will integrate components at heterogeneous levels including within cells and among tissues, organs, as well as systems, before eventually connecting to the outside Internet for physicians to perform metric evaluations and propose treatment plans accordingly. However, healthcare solutions that are to be realized in such complicated biological and molecular environments should be built upon a solid understanding of the physics behind molecular communication and advanced statistical analysis tools in order to unveil the principles behind the seemingly random molecular movement. 1) Essential Communication Models in IoBNT Different from classic wireless communication channels based on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, molecular communication (MC) channels rely on the mechanism of molecular movement to transmit information. The main difference between an MC channel and the classical wireless channel is that the transmission medium presents different forms, such as fluids of several chemical compositions in blood vessels, plasma membranes of neurons, and so on. Based on the motion of molecules in such diverse mediums, end-to-end channel models have been developed to characterize the capacity, noise, and interference in various communication scenarios [176]–[178]. Particularly, in the diffusion-based MC model, information is encoded in various forms, for example, based on different concentration intensities and distinct release times of molecules. The nano-device acting as a transmitter emits such encoded molecules to the wireless molecular channel. At the receiver side, another nano-device decodes the signals based on the quantified received intensities or times of arrival, given that the channel remains stationary for the duration of transmission. In such transmissions, some molecules will get dispersed in the channel and will not be received by the target nano-devices, they are hence treated as noise, and channels with such residual molecules are characterized as channels with memory. For such channels, the theories of Fick’s diffusion and particle location displacement are used to characterize the channel capacity as a function of a collection of parameters, including the diffusion coefficient of the channel, the temperature, the distance between end-transceivers, and the bandwidth of the transmitted signal [178]. 2) IoBNT in Public Health Applications Late 2019 and 2020 have seen the novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 spread worldwide, causing high fatalities and a plethora of other public health issues. More generally, such outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the Ebola virus disease in 2014, and the seasonal influenza, raise questions about the manner in which public health systems should react to such epidemics and pandemics. The widespread havoc caused by pandemics calls for effective means to identify new viruses, understand their mechanisms of viral infection, and devise efficient tools for treatment and vaccination. In order to facilitate the development of antiviral and preventive solutions, researchers have looked into creating biosensors that can monitor the cleavage of proteases within infected cells [179]. Proteases are generated as a result of the cell being infected by the genome of coronavirus, which is a type of RNA virus. Other byproducts include synthesized polyproteins which can replicate and transcript to generate more RNAs, and structural proteins that can construct new virions [180]. Two types of proteases found in the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS (i.e., SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov) are papain-like protease and 3C-like protease. The biosensor, which is based on luciferase, is used to identify potential broad-spectrum coronavirus papain-like or 3C-like protease inhibitors. The SARS-CoV-2 virions that cause the COVID-19 disease have a diameter of 50–200 nanometers approximately [181], and infect the human respiratory system via human-to-human spread, in the form of droplets discharged when an infected person coughs or sneezes [182]. COVID-19 has thus far posed unprecedented challenges worldwide in testing, treatment, and vaccine development. The IoBNT is envisioned to have immense potential in the molecular diagnosis of emerging viruses of this kind. The nanosensors, which can be firefly luciferase-based or other reporter genes, can be used to examine the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in collected samples. Other tests include using bio-nano-sensors to identify antibodies from blood samples to examine if the person is infected. In terms of treatment, although no antiviral drugs are available for COVID-19 yet, studies on influenza treatment can shed light on how the IoBNT could assist in future solution development. A critical step for treatment is the antiviral intervention, which blocks the intracellular signaling pathways to prevent influenza viruses from replication. A reported solution preventing the virus from replication is to use engineered bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) to trap the Ebola virus [183]. In the reported work, the blood of a patient with the Ebola virus infection is transmitted to a microfluidic chamber tube outside the body which contains the engineered bacteria. The scattered bacteria can then achieve protein binding with the Ebola virus using chemical bind force and synthetic protein binding receptors [183]. More importantly, the IoBNT serves a unique role as a holistic solution to not only monitor limited types of cells (e.g., squamous epithelial cells from nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests), but also across different tissues and systems. It is found that such coronaviruses can also cause damage to digestive and neurological systems [181], [184]. Hence, a series of connected bio-nano-things consisting of various types of engineered bacteria can operate simultaneously to improve test reliability and treatment efficiency. 3) Artificial Intelligence in IoBNT for Health Applications In the IoBNT network, different systems demonstrate a wide variation in characteristics, thereby requiring varied analytical approaches. For example, in cardiovascular systems, the speed of molecular transmission is determined by the speed of blood flow and heart rate, among other factors, which may vary per person; whereas in the nervous system, the time required to propagate information-carrying electro-chemical stimuli through neurons depends on the connectivity of synapses. In order to estimate the error rate and capacity, the existing diffusion-based MC model normally requires several channel parameters to formulate the model for computation. The generic modeling approach provides initial insights into the behavior of molecular signal transmission, however, recent advances in statistical learning, that utilize artificial intelligence, provide increasingly refined solutions for modeling sophisticated molecular information exchange processes. For example, in [77], a signal detection algorithm based on neural networks has been shown to achieve good performance without prior knowledge of the molecular channel, thus lending support to the use of statistical inference for characterizing molecular communication channels. Furthermore, a neural network-based nano-receiver design has been proposed in [185] which shows good bit error rate performance under the effect of inter-symbol interference. 4) Open Problems for IoBNT Currently, IoBNT primarily focuses on studies in the domains of physical layer channel modeling, capacity analysis, modulation and coding schemes, and nano-transceiver design. However, research gaps relating to the following aspects need to be overcome: Experimental Validation: The theoretical models of molecular communications should be validated under realistic channel environments, which include experimental testing. Traditionally, these experimental tests have posed high requirements on lab equipment and the nurturing process of cells and bacteria. While the procedures for such experiments should be strictly followed and executed, at times the cost for testing can be remarkably high. In such situations, simulations based on realistic assumptions serve as an alternative means, which have been commonly adopted in research. The convergence between analytical and experimental approaches should be a joint effors by researchers across fields in telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and signal processing. Data Storage and Management: The large data sets obtained from experiments or simulations can have many control variables which require efforts to manage and update. Open databases have become a popular trend for sharing raw data to benefit the entire research community for collaboration, and can be a foreseeable direction for research in the IoBNT. C. Quantum Communications As networks continue to evolve beyond 6G, they are expected to incorporate more spectrum, a larger variety of transceiver front-ends, higher complexity in processed signals, and stricter requirement on reliability, and therefore, it is expected that the computational requirements of wireless systems will also increase [186]. To this end, quantum computing has been widely recognized as a key enabling technology for realizing computationally complex systems [187]. Quantum systems are particularly useful for solving complex optimization problems. For example, in the optimal routing problem with multiple objectives, traditional methods, including the geographic routing algorithm, demonstrate significant complexities to yield optimal solutions, and less complex ones often sacrifice optimality [188]. It has been demonstrated that using quantum computing for such problems can efficiently reduce complexity while achieving optimality [189]. However, such computationally intensive tasks often require several hundreds of thousands or millions of interconnected quantum bits, and therefore cannot be performed on a single quantum chip. The need for interconnecting several chips of this kind has given rise to the concept of quantum communications. Quantum communications is thus indispensable for operating quantum systems at scale [190]. More specifically, quantum communications is defined as the exchange of information that adheres to the laws of quantum mechanics, and offers several key advantages: (i) the capability of large-scale parallel computation, (ii) the ability to transfer data in a tamper-proof manner, and (iii) the potential to encode and transmit a large number of multiple data streams simultaneously. We begin our discussion of quantum communications by describing the following four postulates or rules that govern the operation of such systems [191]: Postulate 1 - The Quantum Bit: Within the context of classical communications, a binary value of either 0 or 1 per bit is used to represent data. On the other hand, in quantum communications, the quantum bit, or qubit, contains the superposition of both logical values at the same time, of the form |Φ⟩= a 0 |0⟩+ a 1 |1⟩, (1) View Source where |Φ⟩ represents a two-dimensional vector, with the coefficients a 0 and a 1 being complex numbers, and 0 and 1 being the two logical values. Postulate 2 - The Quantum Register: Just like computing registers that are used to store multiple bits, quantum registers are used for storing qubits. However, unlike classical registers that are deterministic, the output of a quantum register is probabilistic, i.e., when reading or measuring the quantum register, a different value may be returned each time, thus presenting a major challenge in the implementation of quantum information exchange systems. Postulate 3 - Exponential Speed-up: Exponential speed-up is a key property of quantum information processing systems. We know that classical systems employ parallelization wherein multiple computing units process parallel streams of data simultaneously. On the other hand, in quantum systems, the entire input information is placed in a single quantum register, and a single quantum computing unit can process multiple register states simultaneously, thus achieving a significant reduction in the time required for computation. Postulate 4 - The Q/C Conversion: Since it is far easier to perceive information in terms of 0s and 1s, i.e., classical information, it becomes imperative to interpret the results of any quantum operation in the classical domain. To this end, the classical interpretation of (1) implies that, if we were to measure such a qubit, we would receive value 0 with probability p 0 =| a 0 | 2 and value 1 with p 1 =| a 1 | 2 . Closely related to the four postulates is the concept of entanglement [191]. Entanglement is a phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more particles are described with reference to each other. Within this context, these particles exist in a shared state, and are referred to as entangled pairs. Any action on a particle within the entangled pair immediately affects all other particles within that pair, irrespective of the physical separation between them. For example, if a photon traveling through an optical fiber is entangled with another photon outside the fiber, the photon inside the fiber will experience the same effects as those experienced by the photon on the outside. In this case, entanglement serves as a source of noise in the quantum channel. Continuing our discussion of quantum channels, we note that classical information theory does not apply to these channels. Unlike traditional wireless communication channels where the large- and small-scale parameters are deterministic or can be stochastically characterized, the capacity of qubit carrying quantum channels is defined as the rate at which classical or quantum information increases with each use of the quantum channel [192]. Moreover, there exist several different types of capacities for quantum channels, including but not limited to the classical capacity, the quantum capacity, the private capacity, the entanglement assisted capacity, and the zero-error capacity. The classical and quantum capacities are the two most commonly used definitions. In particular, while the classical capacity measures classical information transmission over a noisy quantum channel, the quantum capacity represents the amount of quantum information, i.e., qubits, that can be transmitted through a noisy quantum channel. We refer the interested reader to [192] for additional insight into each of these channel capacity types. In the following, we discuss the different types of channels, data routing, and open problems within the domain of quantum communications. 1) Types of Channels Within the broader domain of quantum communications, we take into consideration the following types of channel, the dephasing channel and the depolarizing channel [193], [194]. The Dephasing Channel: The dephasing channel, also known as the phase damping or phase flip channel, applies a bit flip in the conjugate basis. The impact of the dephasing channel can be best described as equivalent to measuring the qubit in the computational basis and then forgetting the result of the measurement. A more detailed treatment of the nuances of the dephasing channel can be found in [193, §4]. The Depolarizing Channel: The depolarizing channel is often referred to the “worst-case scenario” and describes the fact that the qubit may be left unchanged with a probability 1−p , with p ∈[0,1] , or that an error may occur with probability p . In this case, the error could be one of three types, with each being equally likely– the bit flip error, the phase flip error, or both. In the event of an error, it is assumed that the channel replaces the lost qubit with a maximally mixed state [194, §2], i.e, all states become equally likely. For example, the maximally mixed state with reference to (1) implies that a 0 = a 1 . 2) Quantum Communications Networks Quantum networks are key to the success of distributed quantum computing, and in turn rely on the ability to share quantum states between different quantum devices. However, unlike conventional networks that are based on the store-and-forward paradigm, quantum networks must adhere to the no-cloning theorem which prohibits making copies of an arbitrary quantum state [195]. In order to overcome this restriction, quantum networks rely on the concept of entanglement [196] described earlier, along with quantum teleportation. The process of quantum teleportation [197] leverages entanglement to transmit unknown quantum states between remote quantum devices, through remote entanglement distribution [198]. Further, as shown in Figure 15, we note the following physical entities that constitute quantum networks [190]: Quantum Nodes: These are the quantum devices that are interconnected to each other. Communication Links: These include both classical as well quantum links that interconnect the quantum nodes in the network. Entanglement Generator: This device is responsible for generating the entangled pairs that are distributed between the quantum nodes. Quantum Memories: These are primarily used for storing quantum states for the purpose of communication. Quantum Measurement Devices: Their primary function is the assessment of the generated entangled states. FIGURE 15. Physical entities associated with quantum networks [190]. Show All While the aforementioned entities play a vital role in enabling quantum networks, the process of quantum teleportation is affected by the exponential decay of communication rate with distance, which in turn is offset by the use of quantum repeaters. The routing problem then involves the selection of the optimal path from the source to the destination traversing one or more quantum repeaters resulting in a high-quality entanglement distribution. Further, the routing framework must also take cognizance of the fact that the physical mechanisms underlying quantum entanglement are stochastic, and that the passage of time leads to loss of entanglement between the entangled pair [198]. Expanding upon this, in the following section, we delve into some of the major challenges faced by quantum networks today. 3) Open Problems and Major Challenges Given the vast differences between the classical and quantum domains, there are several fundamental research challenges, that are vital to the success of quantum networks, as detailed next. Quantum Error Correction: There are three major challenges faced by error correction techniques for qubits [199]. First, while classical error correction codes assume that data can be duplicated freely, the no-cloning theorem precludes the arbitrary duplication of quantum states. Second, since qubits are susceptible to both bit-flip and phase-flip errors, quantum error correction techniques need to be able to detect both error types simultaneously, unlike classical techniques that take only bit-flips into consideration. Third, there exists the possibility of wavefunction collapse [200] due to measurements on the qubits performed as part of the error correction procedure. Entanglement Distribution: Long distance entanglement distribution is a key challenge in the realization of quantum networks, impacting the physical, link, and network layers [196]. More specifically, at the physical layer, there is a need for quantum error correction techniques, while the no-cloning theorem necessitates a re-design of the link layer. At the network layer, novel quantum routing metrics are required to ensure optimal path selection. Deployment Challenges: Quantum computing devices require highly specialized data centers equipped with ultra-high vacuum systems and ultra-low temperature cryostats. Further, while quantum teleportation has been proposed as a means to realize quantum networks, it requires the integration of classical and quantum communication resources, which is a fairly complex problem in itself. SECTION XII. Tentative Timeline for 6G Thus far, we have described the manner in which the evolution of societal needs will guide the transition from 5G to 6G, along with a plethora of new and upcoming use cases that will be best served by 6G. We have also discussed the tentative KPIs associated with 6G and the key enabling technologies that will play a vital role in achieving these next-generation KPIs, as summarized in Table 2. As shown in Figure 16, the increasing technological readiness and worldwide deployments of 5G systems have set the stage for a thoughtful discussion on the future of wireless communications. TABLE 2 A Brief Summary of the KPI Impacts and Open Problems Associated With Each Key Enabling Technology for 6G and Beyond FIGURE 16. Projected timeline for 6G and beyond systems. Show All While 3GPP standards over the next few years, up to and including Release 18 in 2024, are expected to primarily deal with 5G, the ITU has recently convened the Focus Group on Technologies for Network 2030 (FG NET-2030) [201], to study the capabilities of networks for the year 2030 and beyond. More generally, as we have seen in the preceding sections, each of the presented key technologies has witnessed significant traction in terms of research and development, laying the groundwork for the next generation of wireless communications. Both the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) initiative [202] and the European Commission [203] are expected to play a major role in the development of 6G. At the same time, going beyond academia, we expect a significant rise in industry involvement in the development of these technologies over the next few years, culminating in key hardware and software technology demos by 2025, followed by full-scale 6G testbeds in 2026 and beyond. We envision that these testbeds will serve as the perfect backdrop for showcasing the potential of 6G and demonstrating its suitability for use cases such as multi-sensory holographic teleportation, real-time remote healthcare, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure and environments, to name a few. SECTION XIII. Conclusion This paper surveys the key enabling techniques for the next generation of wireless communication networks, outlines their essential use cases, and provides a perspective on current as well as future research and development efforts. We envision that 6G and beyond wireless systems will be largely driven by a focus on wireless ubiquity, i.e., the unrestricted availability of high quality wireless access. To this end, we have highlighted the key enabling technologies that are vital to the success of 6G and beyond systems. By detailing both the operational nuances and open challenges associated with each, we not only hope to provide a detailed insight into the next frontier in wireless communications, but also encourage readers to play their part in the realization of the envisioned ubiquitous wireless future.

In this task, the researcher is asked to study the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing wireless communication in the presence of interference and congestion. CRNs and DSA are two promising technologies that have been proposed to address the challenges of interference and congestion in wireless networks. CRNs allow nodes to cognitively learn about the spectrum environment and adapt their transmission parameters accordingly.

Abstract: Numerous municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality
of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating expenses. This model
incorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom). However, effective networking and
communication protocols are required to provide the essential harmonization and control of the many
system mechanisms to achieve these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics
of smart city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking protocols
that can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are required between the dissimilar
mechanisms. Additionally, we show examples of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,
such as smart transport, smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,
and control systems.
Keywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures; Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);

1. Introduction
Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve
the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources. Intelligent
services can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure in smart cities. They can
enhance performance and operations in a wide variety of smart city applications (SCAs)
including transportation, healthcare, energy, education, and many more. Smart services are
provided by various cutting-edge technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples
of these technologies include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data
analytics, and robots.
IoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful human life beneﬁts [2].
IoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart things into urban environments
where innovative services are offered to support every activity at any time and from any
location [2]. Things are monitored by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their
efﬁcient management. Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and
fault reporting for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state
of the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices can also
obtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a CPS, the computation,
networking, and physical processes are put together to control and monitor the physical
environment of a smart city [4]. In smart cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical
connections between the virtual and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can
be sustained by the ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform

for computation and IoT data storage [5]. FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,
location awareness, streaming, and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have
dispersed vast numbers of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex
infrastructure. Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications
that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by smart cities,
big data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal temporary and lasting
decisions [8].
The abovementioned technologies are used to implement numerous smart city ser-
vices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent transportation services are applied to improve route
planning and avoid jamming in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety
and make possible self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light
controls are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management
and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.
These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional smart
services are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water networks, train and
subway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health monitoring is also feasible using
smart services [11]. Last but not least, there are smart services that focus on monitoring the
environment, public safety, and security of citizens [12].
All these smart city services necessitate a reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-
ciently exchange messages between the modules of a smart city system implementing a
particular smart service. In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and
communication technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-
ilar scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented based
on Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols. On the other
hand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented using the WiMAX
(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart city services can exploit
dissimilar network and communication models and solutions.
Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have
received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart cities does not exist
and is the goal of this study. The communication and networking issues involved in smart
city systems are examined in this study. This paper considers networking technologies,
topologies, and communication requirements for such systems. It also examines if current
network protocols are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent
developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active area, this
paper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper contributes as follows:
1.
It presents network requirements of the major SCAs including intelligent transporta-
tion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring and control, smart water networks, smart
grids, and manufacturing control and monitoring.
2.
It reviews networking architectures used for the above applications focusing mainly
on the protocols’ suitability.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;
Section 3 presents network requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;
Sections 4 and 5 analyze protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-
ings, smart water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6
summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly, Section 8
concludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.

2. Smart City Applications
This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what
type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs, their
advantages and design problems were addressed.
In the energy sector, SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and
sustainability of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart grid
is a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available information
about supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply self-monitoring and
superior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer demand, improving grid
reliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used to manage the process of producing
renewable energy from wind turbines [15].
Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy
consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,
Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.
Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the environment
and energy consumption, are typically included in smart building systems. A centralized
monitoring and control system receives observations and measurements from these sensors.
Based on reported observations, current operational circumstances, and environmental
factors, the control system employs intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems
employed in the buildings to optimize energy consumption.
Intelligent transportation is another SCA that has attracted a lot of interest in the
transportation sector. Applications related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial
types of such applications. Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,
such as blind spot monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane
change warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-
automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response are these
applications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing vehicle safety must
be dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects such as threat observations,
decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software cannot handle
high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices and guarantee real-time and

trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].
They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment
to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed data and intelligent
software that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,
which incorporate device monitoring across numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc
patterns, are another application of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present
an example of intelligent trafﬁc lights.
Water networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase their intelli-
gence, efﬁciency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems are integrated into water
networks to add smart characteristics to the processes of water distribution [19]. Offering
early warning systems to identify problems in water networks is one of these duties. For
instance, it is simple to identify leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary ﬁxes can be
implemented to prevent water wastage and future network threats or damage [20].
WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides
well-organized control for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level in green-
houses [21]. Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control,
monitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare systems
based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical health of
users [25].

management, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.

crucial SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and

tems based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical 
health of users [25].

agement, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.

Analysis of Smart City Applications/Systems
This subsection analyses the SCAs shown in Figure 2.
Smart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are based on centralized pro-
cesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus, to automate such an innova-
tive system, centralized and distributed methods must be used to maintain local servers.
Javaid et al. [26] suggested a smart trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-
ized and decentralized processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm
to manage a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-
tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes
trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered a theoreti-
cal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management. Notably, existing
decision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and highway trafﬁc management,
not considering the closed campuses and collector roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-
tiﬁed this weakness and proposed an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,
and stores real-time trafﬁc data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-
agement system, various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,
extremely sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,
and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as higher costs.
Smart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health parameters, these sys-
tems are progressively being associated with and connected via the Internet to numerous
types of available smart wearable sensing and computing devices. These systems face
several problems [29] that must be resolved. A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-
thentication, interoperability issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-
tion and management of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]
addressed issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They
sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-
tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys and
reviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of integrating IoT
systems with any healthcare application particularly.
Weather and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental
monitoring stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,
these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts. Therefore, it is
impractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead, they are often deployed
sparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial resolutions for useful measurements.
Lately, cheap monitoring sensors have evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in
reﬁning the granularity of monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]
emphasized the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality
monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the issue of
cross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants. Moreover, these sensors
are extremely susceptible to unexpected variations in humidity, temperature, and wind
direction, and as a result, their accuracy deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine
might be a way to maintain and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take
a lot more time and work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for
large-scale deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex
and involves three steps [34]:
(1)
Observing: It can be performed by monitoring satellite imagery, precipitation reports,
surface data, and gathering data from other nearby forecasters.
(2)
Forecasting: It can be performed by forecasters as short-term and long-term forecasting.
Short-term forecasting is carried out by evaluating the current weather conditions
and projecting them over the next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics
of the weather. Long-term forecasting, however, is possible through weather (nu-
merical) modeling and the projection of such modeling using computer simulations.
To produce these simulations for future forecasting, these modeling techniques use
environmental data from satellite photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
7 of 63
servations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters translate the
produced simulated expected output into a perceptible format for non-specialists so
that they can respond appropriately.
(3)
Communicating: Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to
appropriate authorities.
Despite the fact that all of these computer models are used to forecast the weather, the
success of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three different elements: (a) the quantity of
precise data; (b) the length of time needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of
dynamic atmospheric weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region
is the placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from rural
areas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough information for desert,
sea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models used to predict weather conditions
accurately. Forecasters also use satellite data to combat this issue. However, because
of cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,
satellite data accuracy can occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and
map information or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,
it further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further makes
things harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there is a need to re-
evaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations so that they can predict the
changes more accurately.
Smart Waste Management Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for
the following reasons: (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate
waste collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;
(4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies; and (5) lack
of workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical skills to handle
garbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart waste management schemes
include various steps such as (1) waste collection; (2) differentiation of waste as per their
biological and physical properties; (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage
disposal infrastructures/treatment plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova
and Porras [35] identiﬁed issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from
smart deployed sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues
such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly managing
waste vehicle routes.
Smart Street Lighting Systems: This system is a network-oriented solution that uses
streetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities
and connectivity interfaces [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a
mechanism that gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting
with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors and
actuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the streetlights, and
they are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device. Zanella et al. [37] insist
that their system could assist in gathering environmental parameters such as humidity, air
temperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors stated that optimizing street lighting
efﬁciency is a paramount concern that must be addressed. This monitoring system makes
it possible to maximize efﬁciency since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity
in response to the time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this
system is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns that
require particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions and communication
among heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right light lamp is critical for a
power-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection is based on how effective they are in
terms of power usage and lifespan. The existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide
(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen
as being inefﬁcient in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,
which adds signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following
the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201) [36].
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

Currently, there are three kinds of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:
centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a
variety of security assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem
thus far.
Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security of
its residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing with natural
calamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection is ﬁrst and foremost
important for the designing portion of these applications. Depending on the gathered
facts, the development of intelligence (which aids in making important decisions) and the
ability to respond swiftly and quickly are the issues that require special attention. When
it comes to gathering data, we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc
sensors. A developer can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will
conduct predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,
this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information that
will help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the police department,
and law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and preventive measures. The
concept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts for security and safety. However,
keeping track of such vast amounts of data also prompts a lot of worries and issues for
designers and developers, including storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,
most importantly, the question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track
of each individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether this
kind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such as China and India,
where a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation. Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]
claimed that combining information transmission technologies with well-implemented
data analytics models is necessary for quick and swift collaboration. To save as many lives
as possible during natural disasters, it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate
vital information to the relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work
being done to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this
system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important problems
that need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and information sharing
across heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).
Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems
such as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems, TVs,
and other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances that may send
users remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing machines. A user can control
the majority of smart home appliances remotely with two recently produced gadgets:
Google Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart home, the end-user demands a high-speed
internet connection, so they can access networking sites that control the home with HD live
streaming services. In contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to
computing servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data
management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate
on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending
distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of smart home
automation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks. A smart home includes
security monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly opening smart door locks,
televisions, phones, and other smart appliances that are highly outﬁtted with cameras and
microphones. Although these gadgets improve the system, little research has been done on
their privacy and security features. If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we
will discover that their manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.
Indeed, Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining
Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They
argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already more
privileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated applications. As a
result, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this, according to a published document
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
9 of 63
by WikiLeaks [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,
and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal
entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate private
information, and exploit that information immorally typically through user tracking and
proﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these smart applications, grab vital
information, and then use it to launch any kind of attack. For instance, based on motion
sensors, security camera feeds, and power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where
and when to break into the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized
parties, they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and
software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard against
all these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators, etc., are impervious to
such security and privacy attacks.
Smart Grid Networks: The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-
tional (i.e., electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).
Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks to
the deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in an open-loop
fashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures in the distribution
sector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little or no real-time knowledge of the
system’s operating conditions and dynamically changing load. There are also several tech-
nical, economic, and environmental problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,
this conventional system must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as
ﬂexible, secure, and interoperable [42].
The smart grid is the next invention of the Electric Power System (EPS) that incor-
porates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication networks [43]. Smart grids
supplement the conventional electricity grid by incorporating renewable energy sources
such as biomass, solar energy, and wind energy. These energy sources are much cleaner
and more ecologically friendly than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.
However, it is important to identify the most suitable communication technology for the
smart grid’s successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-
nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns. The
communication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle information
exchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices, and numerous smart meters
in such a particular environment with little to no human intervention. This type of com-
munication, called Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, is autonomous and may be
initiated in response to an event or at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these
smart grid applications were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly
in terms of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement
of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent grid
networks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the same network
present the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications based on the smart
grid can be developed and implemented using the current wireless and wired networking
infrastructure and technologies. For some devices, such as smart meters, designing and
standardizing acceptable smart grid-based protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,
these smart grid-based networks are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and
other devices. This makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These
smart grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain
unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as the existing
electricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid systems, high-level adjustments
to current power infrastructure scenarios are required. Subsequently, these smart systems
require high installation costs because the installation requires a large number of smart
meters, sensors, and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of
such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free network
channel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent applications.
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

Many surveys [42–45,47] reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-
grid-based networking technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-
ous smart grid applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on
transmission grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.
3. Network Requirements for SCAs
This section considers several communication requirements including reliability, delay
tolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security, network type, heterogeneous network
support, and mobility support. It also studies the aptness of different network protocols for
dissimilar SCAs.
Smart city services and applications need robust and dependable communication
support as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent
message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49]. Every
smart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of various networking
components. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required to have a variety of net-
working requirements. To access the far-off destination, which may be clouds, the network
trafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse applications uses a common networking
architecture and resources. These resources may consist of switches, routers, communica-
tion connections (links), and other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing
faraway clouds or far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings
up problems with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network
bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when develop-
ing, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart cities. Otherwise, users
would be reluctant to approve the use of such applications in the absence of adequate secu-
rity safeguards. Such intelligent applications need a high-speed networking environment
where the quick reaction may be managed with the support of the ability of a fast-processing
speed. Furthermore, a variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,
based on their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have
different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security [50]. For
example, the networking requirements of smart emergency response systems are quite
different compared to other applications such as smart healthcare systems. Emergency
response smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick to react [50]. In contrast,
smart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily need to be especially dynamic.
−
Network Protocols: Monitoring applications for smart cities often use a dense network
of heterogeneous sensor nodes, including ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,
and crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),
extended coverage GSM IoT, and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing
options to support such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing
nodes (smartphones) is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no
further wireless communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can
be utilized on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered
by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations (the
backbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.
−
Zigbee [53], WiFi, and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes
to communicate within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor
node clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-
ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance
simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also make
possible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance of real-time
monitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance, can accommodate video
streams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles. The fast data rates
provided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous for the sink nodes or clusters.
The use of vibration data (accelerometer readings) in structural health monitoring
applications of bridges, tunnels, or towers is fairly common. The cluster heads will be
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
11 of 63
able to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion, practically
all applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data throughput and
minimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there are some new
sensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56], and Narrowband-
IoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous advantages: greater
coverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and increased device longevity.
Researchers have tested these standards in more than a few applications, including
street lighting, energy metering, and home automation, even though some are still
being discussed and revised. The new narrowband communication standards enable
the sensor nodes to run more sustainably, which is beneﬁcial for applications that
aim for long-term monitoring. In addition to these protocols and standards, the FogC
architecture [58] aids in monitoring smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile
users (the potential crowd-sensing providers) and the cloud are connected via fog
servers. These fog servers are WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users
are more inclined to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing
measurements to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and
energy usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give
us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the
WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the FogC
architecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency and response
time are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates directly from
the fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone network. Lastly,
using the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is crucial to getting the
best possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and cost. The networks may be
hierarchical so that diverse roles and functions can be assigned at various layers to
increase the networks’ dependability and cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes
may be able to transmit data utilizing various protocols.
−
Bandwidth requirements: Many video applications in smart cities require high band-
width [59]. In these applications, sensors capture video from the physical environment.
Moreover, video transmission is more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar
data trafﬁc in IoT. Examples of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-
lance systems for home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,
trafﬁc monitoring systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring
of an environmental system.
−
Delay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate a small
amount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger to the ve-
hicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed must arrive within
microseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react in time. However, other
applications have a higher tolerance for delays [49]. Such applications rely on data
monitoring and information gathering for upcoming analysis.
−
Power Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power consumption.
Smart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy sources can tolerate
protocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45]. Other applications have medium
power needs and require energy sources with limited capacities. One example of such
an application is intelligent transportation. Other applications demand protocols with
low or very low energy consumption characteristics since they have limited energy
resources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline
monitoring for gas and oil are a few examples of such uses.
−
Reliability: The majority of applications have medium reliability requirements. A
typical example of such applications is smart water networks. Some other applications
have high-reliability necessities such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].
−
Security: The majority of applications need medium to high security. Applications
such as production control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
12 of 63
others, such as smart grids, need high security because of the sensitivity of the data
and the importance of the operations carried out [50].
−
Heterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city systems use network-
ing protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent transportation and smart
buildings are two examples of such systems. These protocols must coexist in such
situations without conﬂicting with one another. To ensure seamless and effective
operation, it is also necessary to correctly map the control information in the head-
ers at the various networking stack tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols
and networks.
−
Wired/wireless connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity
are UAVs and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent
transportation and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In
these situations, wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc
physical system (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used
to link the physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the
backbone and infrastructure networks.
−
Mobility: Some systems, such as the smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,
and smart water networks, have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such
as UAVs and intelligent transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility
smart city systems can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and
adaptable to node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control
messages and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.
Table 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each
SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network with
low, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility of devices. Each
SCA is based on different protocols and requires different bandwidth and latency tolerance.
In each SCA, the number of devices involved differs.

3.1. Additional Challenges
−
Interoperability: Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking
protocols that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-
cal and data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-
lessly, these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE
1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between physi-
cal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this function. Future
research should focus on the creation of similar protocols to increase the support
system for smart city systems.
−
Scalability: A smart city platform must manage many devices that are connected to
the city’s infrastructure. Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously
produced and consumed by devices and client applications, must be stored and
processed. The platform must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests
from users and services that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change
depending on the features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.
Recently, Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-
source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale
systems, apps, and services for smart cities.
−
Load Balancing: To maximize the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-
priate resources (i.e., network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,
and energy resources) to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and
avoids overload thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,
cost, throughput, performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of
QoS parameters.
−
The Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation of
smart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,
upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that demand
advanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems
for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time applica-
tions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently, FogC and
Edge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing, imple-
menting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These paradigms
bring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that the primary computa-
tion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm offers particular assistance
based on the requirements of the application at hand. For example, to support a cloud-
based SCA, ClCom offers centralized storage and processing capacity. For certain
SCAs, ClCom can offer scalable processing power and data storage [5]. The features of
ClCom (e.g., powerful processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge
software services) can be used to provide various support services for a variety of
SCAs. ClCom can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The
city’s ClCom services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs
to gather, process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes
of data are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The
sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount of
data to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing. To
effectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators and
ClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures
used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require
the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function well
with a robust network that offers good communication services linking both sides.
The fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central location or across
numerous distributed platforms in various locations is another problem that occurs
when adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications, the distributed
ClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability support [67]. However,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
14 of 63
it is frequently necessary to establish effective communication channels between the
distributed ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability
and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another
problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and
unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,
the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control of
network resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot be
avoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated the QoS require-
ments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment to recognize
QoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog) that is
inspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture [69] for
a FogC system.
3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks
A smart city network has the following features [70]:
1.
Large Densities: A smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart
devices are distributed in the area of a city.
2.
Abnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading or synchronization among smart devices produces
extremely bursty or correlated trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from
the regular social-generated trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and
technology used in our society are based.
3.
Disorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless connectivity features,
smart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology. The problem arises
when smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless channels, where packet
losses caused by wireless channel special properties are extremely common and even-
tually have an impact on the functioning of the smart city system. Therefore, it appears
very improbable that a single high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.
4.
Heterogeneity: SCAs use a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,
latency, throughput, and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates
at a unique trade-off threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on
a single platform.
5.
Coexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used in smart
cities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time, independent radio
infrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless channels. Under such
circumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues with competence.
6.
Security and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to several risks from malevolent
users. The majority of specialized smart sensors, actuators, and other intelligent
devices are developed by designers without considering security measures. Such
applications may be highly vulnerable due to hostile actors’ ease of access to these
cutting-edge technologies and potential threats to people’s security and privacy.
The main challenges for smart city networks are as follows [70]:
•
Lack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal
Area Networks (PANs) and the IEEE 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the
concept of single-hop ad-hoc networking. These standards permit direct communi-
cation between two devices that are in the transmission range of each other. At the
same time, the multi-hop ad-hoc networking paradigm enables the communication
between any two devices which are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A
problem that researchers must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of
devices (i.e., actuators, sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly
without any standardization. Global distributors and manufacturers must propose
and accept standardized network solutions that enable communication between di-
verse devices on homogeneous communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
is the dominant solution that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.
This standard deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
15 of 63
power consumption. Several revisions or amendments (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE
802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released. The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment
allows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing data rates and communication ranges
compatible with neighborhood mesh (wide) networks. Then, it is followed by another
cutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances
the method used by devices to access wireless channels while also using time-slotted
channel hopping mode. This hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption
and improved dependability. From another viewpoint, many researchers customized
appropriate upper-layer protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary
modiﬁcations there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-
tructure. Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers
developed numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-
able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],
which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.
•
Interference problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio
space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless channels.
Because of this, the smart application must handle interference problems in such
situations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate and be
compatible with one another.
•
Vertical handover (soft): Multiple radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of
smart devices being developed. These devices should be able to recognize and use the
best interface that is currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.
•
D2D Communications: In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-
mands. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated
messages from heterogeneous devices.
•
Short Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support and recommend
acceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However, smart devices
communicate with one another using short messages (since most of them are tiny
and operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end, short communicating
messages will positively impact network congestion detection and avoidance policies
and promote in-band aggregation.
•
Local Network Trafﬁc Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the
same network infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively
planned, implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc
from these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge
that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc from these
two types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure due to several
intrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional network. Additionally,
D2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce resources than smartphones,
unnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness in the system [74]. Therefore, we
must ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns
generated by smartphones. Understanding trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into
managing and allocating shared network resources more effectively and guarantee
the highest level of service quality for both types of devices.
•
Security mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a remarkable threat to the
security of smart city networks and must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods
have been proposed to solve this problem. Such a statistical method is presented
in [75] that is based on feature distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis
process. Another security mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying
users and devices in a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-
manipulated devices. Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT
systems such as the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation
attack, and the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be
encrypted. However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
16 of 63
be able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for this task. In addition, low
resources and constrained devices can only embed application-speciﬁc integrated
circuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic primitives are not suitable for low-
resource smart devices due to their low computation power, limited battery life, small
size, small memory, and limited power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography
may be an efﬁcient encryption for these devices. Trust management is another security
mechanism that detects and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access
control. Automated and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust
values of the participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management
schemes focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control
methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of smart
things storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated, transparent, and
easy access control management so that different nodes/users can be granted different
levels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain technology can be used to
create secure virtual zones where things can identify and trust each other [77]. Self-
organization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can also be planned to set up the relationship
between Blockchain and IoT, as suggested in [78].
•
Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow through the IoT system
can vary to a great extent, in terms of either format, shape (in time and space), and
semantics. Therefore, the process of separating normal from abnormal sensed data is
extremely demanding. In the context of IoT applications, sensors are the real source
of big data, which suggests that anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful
tool to address the inevitable data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is
concerned with identifying data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected
behavior. This is critical in the process of ﬁnding out important information about
the IoT system’s functioning, detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult
to model or, otherwise, to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to
preventing IoT system failure.
•
Advanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learn-
ing (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the
smart city sectors [80]. These techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-
pletely automated IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of
the big data is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches
can improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase
precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,
person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation
system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving vehi-
cles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques are also used to
precisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data in an urban environment.
In SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned techniques can enhance the
safety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing, management, and power
grid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective use of smart meter big data
for different applications such as load assessment and prediction, baseline estimation,
demand response, load clustering, and malicious data deception attacks. In health
intelligence, extensive use of AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to
high-performance IoT devices, Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These
techniques can play a vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-
lytics for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role of
AI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques can be used
from an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security threats. Notably, the
accuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques can be further enhanced by
increasing the amount of training data to strengthen their learning capabilities and
hence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].

create a system that enables effective communication between several indoor and out-
door devices. Nevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need to 
be improved by the absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.

3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards 
and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs. Smart 
home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require 
short-range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth and 
Zigbee) from the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower bandwidth 
requirement, minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication infrastructure 
environment. In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for SCAs that require 
longer-range communication. Such applications are smart transportation management 
systems. 
The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX, can be adopted by 
applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart emergency response 
systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart grid systems. These 
features designed in terms of standards or protocols have enough capability that allows

SCAs involve numerous smart things that operate on low-powered battery devices [83].
New connectivity solutions are being investigated in light of the following question:
do the currently available methods, tools, and techniques—especially those for wireless
networks—allow for the reliable handling of such a large number of smart devices?
Yaqoob et al. [84] provided details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN
technologies such as ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-
munication. In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-
nected devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies
(e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only
partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies and commu-
nication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication perspective.
IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput performance
for fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior context. Due to the
limitations of its initial design, this standard does not support IoT applications. Hence,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
18 of 63
to enable IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah
Task Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create a
system that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor devices.
Nevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need to be improved by
the absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.
IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular
3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards
and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs. Smart
home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require short-
range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth and Zigbee) from
the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower bandwidth requirement,
minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication infrastructure environment.
In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for SCAs that require longer-range
communication. Such applications are smart transportation management systems.
The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX, can be adopted by
applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart emergency response
systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart grid systems. These
features designed in terms of standards or protocols have enough capability that allows for
both synchronous and asynchronous data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can
effectively tolerate latency) allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked
with smart city services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-
tions is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating strict
QoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity [49]. Since IEEE
802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication protocol that often suggests
higher ﬂexibility for small devices running on low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly
increase network lifetime. Moreover, such a protocol encourages and indicates support
for applications and services with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in
WPANs. The authors of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-
gent system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using wireless
emulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment, relatively easier in
expanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due to the use of wireless technology,
which supports the usage of heterogeneous devices in the same implemented and deployed
structure. Furthermore, they emphasized the advantages of employing the same intelligent
infrastructure for a variety of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,
and cost-effectiveness. For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as
water or gas meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established to
target smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering applications.
5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called BDMA and FBMC
multiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case of BDMA multiple access, an
orthogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that resources can be distributed in parallel to
each mobile base station by dividing the antenna beam in accordance with the position of
the mobile stations to enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps
in improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving towards
5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on unique customer
needs. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented 5G cellular networks should
address noteworthy complications that are not successfully addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced
network capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-
sistent user QoE provisioning. In addition, massive and rapid growth in the number of
highly developed connected devices leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a
widening range of applications with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta
and Jha [86] studied numerous facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive
MIMO, trafﬁc and power management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and
organizing networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing
and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days thanks to 5G. 5G

ultimately targets some networking possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-
munications (uRLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type
Communications (mMTC). In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a
variety of networked user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC
aims to manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-
sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for managing
highly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication, base stations, and
edge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely brought about a new
revolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown challenges still are possible in
these cases of communication when 5G is deployed in the context of smart cities. One major
problem is power-efﬁcient communication, especially when communicating low-powered
battery devices such as sensors and other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when
two distinct technologies (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-
level compatibility problems might always persist when communication infrastructures
migrate to next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to
handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach
places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining 5G
networks.

WiFi/IEEE 802.11
(Legacy) (a/b/g/n)
General features:
It can aid both in an infrastructure-mode and an ad-hoc
manner. These standards are quickly utilized in temporary
and permanent LAN installations and deployments because of
their ﬂexibility and performance. It supports network
management service and asynchronous communication. It
suggests time-constrained delivery services and support for
broadcast and multicast services. Moreover, it offers support
for long-range communication.
Speciﬁc features:
IEEE 802.11a—works on the 5 GHz band, has a lesser
interference level than other devices but has higher
propagation losses compared to the 2.4 GHz band.
IEEE 802.11b—works on the 2.4 GHz band. There may be
interference issues with those devices, which, too, operate on
the 2.4 GHz band. However, it offers a higher capacity and
reachability than the 5 GHz spectrum to get through
obstructions. It can also provide support for the ARS
method [79], which allows an IEEE 802.11b device to
dynamically switch from its theoretical maximum data rate
(11 Mbps) to lower data rates such as 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or
even 1 Mbps if interference rises.
IEEE 802.11g—faster operating speed and generally has better
signal range, being not easily obstructed. The IEEE
802.11g-based devices used OFDM to carry higher data rates
while providing robustness against multipath fading/effects.
However, additional modulation techniques (as shown in
Table 2) are also used to preserve and manage compatibility.
IEEE 802.11n—offers superior performance to its other peer
standards by suggesting modiﬁcations in MIMO, OFDM,
power saving, antenna technology, and wider channel
bandwidth. The IEEE 802.11n-based access point can operate
in Legacy, Mixed, and Greenﬁeld modes [89]. This standard
effectively exploits MIMO to take complete beneﬁt of the
available data rate.

WiMAX/IEEE 802.16
It was introduced initially to overcome the disadvantages of
mobile networks and WLANs. It supports high data
transmission rates while allowing more coverage than
WLANs. It provides numerous QoS scheduling mechanisms
supporting heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as VoIP, voice data
(trafﬁc), video data/streams, and Internet trafﬁc. Moreover, it
has speciﬁc features such as high-speed Internet; a
long-distance communication facility; and support for security,
mobility, and scalability.
P2MP, Mesh
MAN
Not widespread and
operationally expensive.
LoRaWAN/LoRA
Alliance
It provides long-range transmissions and offers robustness
from interferences. The PHY layer of this standard or protocol
modulates the signal in the SUB-GHz ISM band. This
speciﬁcation aims to provide low-power WANs with
capabilities speciﬁcally required to facilitate low-cost mobile
secure bidirectional communication. Additionally, it deﬁnes
the idea of geolocation, which can be quickly applied to enable
GPS-free tracking applications.
It utilizes minimum amounts of power, and hence IoT-based
sensors and actuators can operate for a long time.
Additionally, it manages less bandwidth utilization, making it
their default choice for IoT-based deployments.
The overall architecture (i.e., star) is relatively straightforward
since a LoRaWAN-based GW can be designed to manage
numerous end devices or nodes. It also offers secure
communication between the end device or node and the
application server using the AES-128 encryption standard.

3G (WCDMA
Technology) (BIS)
This MNwT was initially engineered and designed to transmit
and receive multimedia trafﬁc with variable and high bit rates.
This standard (having a comparable spectrum everywhere it is
used) enables seamless worldwide networking. It utilizes the
packet switching concept for data communication and circuit
(or optional packet) switching technique for voice
communication. It allows global roaming across a similar type
of network (wireless) called a cellular network at 384 Kbps or
even higher (up to several Mbps).

GPRS
As an enhancement over GSM, GPRS adds several nodes
called GSNs to support end-to-end packet-switched services in
the system. It operates by aggregating several separate data
channels by the concept of packetization. Moreover, it is a
low-cost technology that suggests a packet-based radio service.
It offers the capabilities such as a high transfer rate,
volume-based billing, shorter access time, improved radio
resource utilization, and simpliﬁed access to packet data
networks [90].

It allows for operation in the low-frequency range, hence
offering better performance. It supports low-power mesh
networks and employs BFSK modulation. The lower frequency
with longer wavelength allows Z-Wave devices to establish
more reliable and faster connections since these parameters
assist these devices in easily penetrating objects and walls.
Six layers of backward compatibility provide version
interoperability. The interoperability facility among
Z-Wave-based smart or conventional devices assists in

LTE/3GPP
It is a 3GPP interface (radio) based on UMTS/HSPA and
GSM/EDGE networking technologies. It suggests
improvements in data rate and capacity by employing new
and modiﬁed modulation schemes. Moreover, it offers support
for FDM and TDM techniques. It adopts an IP-based network
model that promises a seamless handoff of voice and data to
cell towers using an older technology.

because extra antennas
are used at network base

LTE-A/3GPP
Through modifying and proposing novel PHY layer
speciﬁcations or implementations and reforming the CN,
LTE-A offers much-improved performance over UMTS/HSPA
MNwTs. It can speed up to 3 Gbps download and 1.5 Gbps
upload. Additionally, it has various antenna systems that
simplify switching between cell regions, as well as
cutting-edge transmission techniques that pack more data per
second into each hertz of the spectrum and improve
throughput performance at the level of cell boundaries.
Subsequently, it leads to superior performance in terms of
consistent connection and capacity (network) [89,91,92].
P2P

The installation of towers
to improve signals while
a smart device is in

signiﬁcant costs.
Device compatibility is a

models of devices that
do not support 4G LTE
cannot connect to LTE
networks.
5G (New Radio (NR) Air
Interface) (Single Uniﬁed,
4G + World Wide
Wireless Web (WWWW))
This technology addresses signiﬁcant challenges: a massive
and quick increase in highly sophisticated connected devices
contributes to a sharp escalation in network trafﬁc and an
expanding variety of applications with distinct dynamic
demands and features.
Since LTE user equipment is not required to be able to operate
on an NR carrier, NR is designed to be optimized for
performance without taking backward compatibility into
account. Moreover, NR can support operations in licensed
spectrum bands from below 1 GHz to 52.6 GHz with a
spectrum expansion facility.
In the case of mmWave frequencies, excellent capacity and
high data rates are possible. This technology’s ultra-lean
design seeks to decrease interference and improve system
power efﬁciency by effectively reducing always-on
transmissions [93,94].
This technology utilizes sophisticated access procedures such
as Beam Division and FBMC Multiple Access to adapt 4G to
5G networks. Beam Division Multiple Access (BDMA)
schemes’ central design principle is concurrently serving
numerous mobile users. This technique typically uses an
orthogonal beam, which suggests that resources can be
allocated in parallel to each mobile base station by separating
the antenna beam in accordance with the position of the
mobile stations to enable numerous accesses to the base
stations. This subsequently assists in improving the capacity
of 5G networks [79].

In the case of the NLoS

4.1. IEEE 802.11 Standards
Table 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features.
Table 4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features.
Standards (Year Released)
Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *
Target
IEEE 802.11 (1997) (Original)
The standard and its amendments serve as the foundation for
wireless network products bearing the WiFi brand. This signiﬁes
two raw data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps that must be transferred via
DSSS and FHSS at 2.4 GHz in the ISM band.
Wireless Standard (basic)
IEEE 802.11b (1999)
This standard is intended to operate in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;
however, the level of interference issues is higher when this
standard-based device tries to interoperate with many other
devices/standards operating on the same band. It can attain a
theoretical data rate of 11 Mbps. Nevertheless, dynamic
adaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject to the current
interference level and signal power to minimize the error rate (ARS
Policy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates
can be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it
provides somewhat simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading
the current chipsets) as it demonstrates backward compatibility
with the original standard due to the use of CDMA and DSSS (same
as the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor
ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.
WiFi-1
IEEE 802.11a (1999)
Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least
amount of interference compared to other devices. Depending on
the needs, the raw data rates can be changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,
24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps. However, it can
reach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage indoor
and outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].
WiFi-2
IEEE 802.11g (2003)
Allows for device compatibility with devices that operate and
follow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical
transfer rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a
practical data rate of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE
802.11b-based devices are introduced into IEEE 802.11g networks,
or when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate, the
rate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based
transmission speeds every time that the compliant device tries to
communicate [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are
148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.
WiFi-3
IEEE 802.11e (2005)
It speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications
through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed
QoS requirements by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:
(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme and (2) the contention-free
HCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides trafﬁc
prioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to
differentiated services). Conversely, this standard suggests
parameterized QoS (similar to integrated services) via HCCA. It
also speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional IEEE 802.11
power saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95]. It
is designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to
2.4835 GHz or from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes
that a high transmission rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS
requirements imposed by real-time audio, voice, video, and
live-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions of trafﬁc
prioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.

Standards (Year Released)
Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *
Target
IEEE 802.11n (2009)
This standard was suggested while keeping the increased speed
requirement in mind. Later, it was able to boost the attainable
speeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with 802.11g.
Achieving such high performance required several new features,
including a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,
antenna technology, MIMO, and wider channel bandwidth.
Nonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard has been
signiﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.
Whenever or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts
to communicate with an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g
network, the network’s operation, performance, and other
capabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based APs can
operate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst
802.11a/b/g), Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and
operate on heterogeneous conditions), and Greenﬁeld mode
(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89]. It can
reach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor
and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.
WiFi-4
IEEE 802.11ac (2013)
This standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping
increased speed requirements in mind (likewise with other
standards). This standard was later able to increase the achievable
speeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps (maximum)) of WiFi
networks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard
enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,
live-streaming, and other demanding applications. It operates
using MU-MIMO technology, which enables a single AP and its
antenna to send data concurrently to several devices. As a result,
this helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated
client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally
receives the amount of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending
on the technology used.
WiFi-5
IEEE 802.11ah (2017)
Designed to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz, it can
provide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional
802.11 standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.
This standard can be employed in those scenarios where accessible
bandwidth is comparatively narrow. It can normally apply with
WiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale WSNs (i.e., smart
grid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably large
transmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale
networks where the number of devices may be much greater than
what the conventional 802.11 standard can support. It advises that
changes to the PHY and MAC layers be made to provide important
improvements including energy-saving capabilities, support for
accommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access
techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using
small frame formats [96].
Extended coverage, low-power
WLAN
IEEE 802.11ax (2021)
This standard was proposed with the consideration of higher speed
requirements. Later, this standard increased WiFi network
achievable speeds above what was made possible by earlier
standards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data rate,
consistency, and low power consumption. It operates using
MU-MIMO and MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which
enables a single AP and its antenna to send data concurrently to
several end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard is where
MU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows
for groups of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also
suggests several improvements in spatial reusing policies and
power-saver schemes [97].

4.2. IEEE 802.15.1
The IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave
time division duplex mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a
1 Mbps data rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed
to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth and
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98]. The deployment
of services offered for tracking and localization devices is typically suggested by BLE-based
devices, which are recognized as BLE beacons. These beacons produce a signal that other
compatible devices can pick up between 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises
greater indoor localization accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can
be used for a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch
of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally, to provide
speciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine the BLE technology with
other technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth
Classic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth
Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR). It became the perfect option for the IoT
since it permits connectivity and audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-
distance radio, which lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need
not be connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE
speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous devices
(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected to wearables
in LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends to broadcast data
across 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. Wireless audio streaming is
primarily made possible through BCR, which has evolved into the industry-standard radio
protocol for in-car entertainment systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to
transmit data over 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the
deployment of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support
for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most notably,
mesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution and locating
maps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user localization. Due to BLE’s
greater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial changes in received signal strength,
it has been proven that using BLE is more efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].
However, Bluetooth technology has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly
when its BR/EDR mode is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the
master nodes to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.
The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered a variety
of scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the BR/EDR mode reveals
a lack of scalability that further restricts the performance of the system.
4.3. LoRA
The LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications and operated as a low-
data-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum that could go up to 10 km.
LoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth: 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while
this technology can function at the largest bandwidth class, which further improves data
rate, it still causes issues with high power consumption, a shorter communication range,
and an increase in the likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider
frequency spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation
and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission range
will expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption will rise
as well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby making it resilient to
channel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not differentiate the noise in the channel
such as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes
signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology
to sense, perceive, and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
26 of 63
architecture uses a star network topology and includes gateways and end nodes. In this
design, end nodes are referred to as slaves and run on battery-powered devices with
limited power, but gateways are thought of as powerful machines that gather data from
slave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN is a communication layer that operates on top of
LoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability
and suitability for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over
cellular technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,
LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept of
a specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types to meet
the needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet ﬁltering, and
packet scheduling are all made possible using specialized network servers. LoRaWAN
has also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission power and rate, which
aids in optimizing network performance in terms of power consumption and throughput.
This technology can be employed for a wide range of applications, such as smart health
nursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105], agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],
and smart grid applications [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-
sensitive applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al. [109]
and Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart metering,
tracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time, it is not so feasible for
real-time monitoring and video surveillance.
4.4. WiMAX
WiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60 Mbps for an
entire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely uplink operation, based on
the original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-
ment [112]. It can be done using two antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.
Additionally, it may provide support for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-
teristics and wide area mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety
of QoS scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet data
trafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video streams [113].
Table 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational parameters [114].
This standard provides a communication channel between geographically separated de-
vices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges between 30 km and
100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as high installation costs
and the possibility of complications and irregularities when dealing with high-deﬁnition
multimedia trafﬁc.
Wireless network trafﬁc has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-
liferation of smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with
smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices, are
the most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In such a dense
network environment, interference is a critical issue that must be addressed if satisfactory
performance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency reuse is required. Subsequently, the
standards IEEE 802.11 were designed and implemented to support these requirements.
Numerous international organizations, including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved
their technologies in response to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,
the original IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior
throughput performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as a
result, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a result, to address
the challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah Task Group (TG) was formed by
the IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to redesign and extend the applicability
of WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They focused on the critical issue of power-aware
efﬁcient schemes and protocols to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based
networks while dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and
indoor devices [55,97].

4.5. Challenges in IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite
In IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique features such as
constrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the need for facilitating real-time
requirements of smart applications; extremely vulnerable radio environments; and little to
no human involvement after deployment [115]. By enabling communication amongst these
devices utilizing low-power-cost technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart
services has been formed. Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might
provide a solution and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication
scenarios. Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,
designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the best way
to install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally use the system’s limited
resources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of such power constraints, researchers
highlighted the requirements of low-power Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)
and low-power WiFi usage. In contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies
operate with smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission
speeds. IoT network protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining
the ideal MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless
networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies. This
vulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:
(1)
The current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it relies on
a multi-link subnet prototype) at all.
(2)
In mesh communication, the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are
quite expensive, power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely
power constrained. Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.
(3)
Unicasting is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while
forwarding and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,
idle nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-
ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,
reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful
delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective
coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].
(4)
There is a high requirement for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-
cation to take place over mesh architectural systems.
(5)
For many IoT applications requiring data prioritizing and customized control, original
TCP-suited features such as those operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)
that further lead to silly window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure
dependability, are unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard
Internet protocols such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize
protocol overheads that impair the computing ability and memory management of
these specialized resource-constrained devices.
WiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling support, which helps estab-
lish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart IoT devices. In smart home wireless
networks, this form of connectivity can be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP
protocol suite supports dependable data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-
tain network throughput performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been
regularly modiﬁed and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of
byte-stream in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency
needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP protocol
suite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns adequately [119].
There are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with an IoT application:
(1)
TCP connection establishment and termination (three-way handshaking) incur signiﬁ-
cant overhead in the system as most communication in an IoT application includes
the transmission of brief segments and relatively little data.
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
29 of 63
(2)
TCP functionality needs resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-
nections in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected
devices switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].
(3)
Some IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,
and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead in the
entire IoT system and high-power consumption.
(4)
Some IoT services have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in
the form of connection establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the
entire MSS) is completely unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to
provide much support for these IoT services.
(5)
IoT applications that rely on wireless communication scenarios must deal with crit-
ical wireless channel characteristics such as channel error, interference, and wire-
less interface properties that result in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer
contention-induced, and collision-induced packet losses. When TCP operates in such
a setting, its stringent in-order delivery requirements and retransmission policies
(i.e., fast retransmission) may occasionally result in very serious system problems
such as Head-of-Line (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in
a reduction in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].
Furthermore, wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-
ther impair TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP
Retransmission Time Out timer.
Some standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement Layer-4
functionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed to utilize UDP as an
underlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should depend on an application’s
requirements, which may vary from application to application. However, TCP and its
updated variants rely on the concept of data delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-
missions from an already created copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only
approach to dealing with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to
accept packet delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-
tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution. Additionally,
retransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should handle this retransmission
rather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data
bits, doing so enables the source application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations
where real-time services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit
fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the initial loss [126].
Clark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and subsequently introduced the
concept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself
brings the idea of employing ALF into the system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,
a network can recognize individual Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently
can offer support for ﬂexible Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission
procedures for diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using
in-network caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding
any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails to provide
support for the ALF scheme [119].
4.6. Compound TCP for IoT
Compound TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel
utilization and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with
WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].
Pokhrel and Williamson [115] studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an
IoT scenario involving sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home
appliances). They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-
nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks in the
presence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded transmission
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
30 of 63
channel circumstances. The authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements
for all IoT devices as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-
hungry Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a
thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical
devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly
deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested models
that aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of several concurrently
running competitive long-lived compound TCP connections. In evaluating and developing
these models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions, link-layer contention, channel
failures, and collision. The authors of [130] utilized a transient model suggesting a new
queue management scheme to capture the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most
workable ﬂows in IoT scenarios) over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.
However, the performance of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using
a single shared Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and
provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when wireless
channels are often reused by several APs [131].
4.7. Viewpoints of Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems
The network architectures for IoT are heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless
Mesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks
(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing
devices, survivability and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A
WSN is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and military
applications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which the sensor nodes
communicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered, low-power sensors
capable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating, and regulating communication.
Numerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2, TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have
been suggested. Therefore, some standards were introduced to enable interaction and
other compatibilities among these numerous heterogeneous platforms. For example, the
IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide
critical functionalities for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated
End Devices (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be
considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes. Due
to the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be obtained from the
viewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability issue, various works
suggested a standardized arrangement that could enable the usage of IP over LoWPAN.
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability for Low power and Lossy
Networks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard outlines the physical and data link
layers of the network and offers a low-cost framework for network operations. To link
LPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors
to implement an IP stack and become approachable by other conventional devices over
the Internet. This adaptability layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables
a variety of applications and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding
algorithms at the Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot
be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72] considers
the LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained, and they are
connected by some lossy links that only support low data rates. These links are thought
to be extremely unstable and have poor performance in terms of packet delivery rates. In
such specialized networks, the trafﬁc patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint
(MP2MP) rather than just P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.
This makes the implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,
numerous existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and
AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing
and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult due to the
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
31 of 63
mobility aspect and the resource limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’
design principles emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end
latency [134,135]. The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations
take into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the node
energy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and maintain solely
inside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible. However, the interoperability
of these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when such networks are integrated with
IoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration with IoT needs novel routing policies
that support scalability and assure QoS, fairness, and connectivity between two nodes
(both in APs and ad-hoc networks) with the least amount of power consumption. The
standard classical forwarding strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of
devices/nodes. In the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest
enough fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate with
nearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions are followed
to decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers have often raised
concerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which lead to the consumption of
excess energy in networks while taking into account mobile and static ad-hoc network
scenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood of frequent network disconnections,
route failures, and even network partitioning, all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant
MAC-level and routing-level overhead problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the
high-power consumption problem, many researchers presented numerous smart routing
paradigms [118,134,135,137]. Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the
desired QoS.
Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion
control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless channel
attributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas. These designs provide
support for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely variable channel parameters
at lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing and Transport layers to further
optimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations decisions [121,134,135,138–140].
The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) indicates how well a device can hear a
signal from an AP or router. A network layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the
RSSI (accessible through lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR
are examples of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding
systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing mecha-
nisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and link disjoint paths
while discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes do not shed light and discuss
anything related to performance issues when there is a signiﬁcant level of interference in
the network because of trafﬁc running parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned
techniques do not always perform well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.
Recently, the scheme [140] considered different critical factors such as interference level,
link-layer contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to
wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution policies’
efﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless, different possible
disjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might be able to interfere
with one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting behavior in wireless
communication. Consequently, such separate disconnected pathways could be utilized to
enhance the performance of the network as a whole [138,140].
When employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend on WSN-based
networking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from smart things to sink
nodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes (IoT-GW). To balance
energy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous such static and mobile IoT-GWs
can be deployed in the system. In the whole system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous
types of critical data, are connected to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed
three forms of devices: Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
32 of 63
three forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh. Moreover, the Zigbee stack
embraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the case of star network topology, the
Reduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e., RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the
PAN central coordinator only. They are not capable of communicating with one another.
Here, the PAN coordinator may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on
low-powered limited battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,
any device can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this
topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and FFDs.
Furthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of the integrated
forwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing procedures. Lastly,
the tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of mesh networking topology, consisting
of RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators). However, the FFD count could be
more than the RFD count in the network. RFDs may attach to tree (cluster) network
topology as the end nodes in the system. The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization
functionalities to other connected coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single
PAN coordinator amongst these coordinators [144].
4.8. IoT Application Protocols
Each IoT application is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.
These protocols can be the following:
•
Representational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is
the primary client/server protocol that adopts the request/response model. HTPP has
been related to the REST architecture [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar
entities over web-based services. The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices
to make their status readily available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,
update, delete) functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,
PUT, and DELETE techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build
a REST model for dissimilar IoT devices [148].
•
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately
standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT
devices for IP-based, HTTP-like interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-
sages to set up reliable communication based on a request/response interaction. It has
reduced complexity, and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications
and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.
•
Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is established for IoT messaging.
According to MQTT design principles, network bandwidth and device resource re-
quirements should be kept to a minimum while also aiming to assure dependability
and some level of delivery assurance. Since June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by
ISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The protocol continues to progress by formalizing
popular capability options and adding new functionalities. The most recent version,
MQTT v5.0, was released in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe
paradigm. Clients connect to a centralized broker when using MQTT.
•
Open Platform Communications Uniﬁed Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-
ability standard is used for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial
automation domain and other industries. It is platform independent and ensures
the seamless ﬂow of information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-
ports two different communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as
Publish/Subscribe (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-
quirements from the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main
IoT vendors including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage
secure, standardized information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on
OPC UA.
•
Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is
based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
33 of 63
it can implement both request/response and publish/subscribe methods by using
suitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant messages between clients, and this
happens in real-time using a push mechanism to avoid increasing unnecessary network
loads. XMPP also determines the state of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.
•
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing
business messages between applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-
tems, feeds business processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits
onward the instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-
lish/subscribe interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of
message orientation; queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.
•
Data Distribution Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management
Group (OMG). DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-
performance, interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.
DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability in publish–
subscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs of various
IoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed using DDS. Such
applications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and
smart grid management.
Lastly, Glaroudis et al. [155] provided a comparison among IoT application protocols
in terms of well-accepted key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the
framework of smart farming.
5. Networking Architectures and Protocols
5.1. Generic Architectures
Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-
gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of an IoT
island as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT, two methods provide
data access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying multi-hop mesh networks with
short-range communication among network nodes using unlicensed frequency. The second
involves using licensed frequency band long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).
Centenaro et al. [156] presented a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-
less connectivity) called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based
on a star topology characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in
the unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide
connectivity in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed
the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,
and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled SCA
that uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled street
lighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental research
facility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander supports testing
proposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic setting at an appropriate
scale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana
and Dohler [159] reviewed currently used smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data
loggers, wireless modems, and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-
ment use cases, i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount
of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways
cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control model for
M2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into delay-sensitive
and delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant requests by routing them into
one low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the number of requests from various devices
to the access point in the IoT for smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up
architecture after analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four
layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates
security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the bottom of the
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
34 of 63
architecture, collects data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above
the sensing layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the
transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer
performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable
information that various applications use at the application layer to provide services.
The majority of the above works mainly focus on a single characteristic, such as quality
of service [162].

The Physical Objects Layer enables IoT sensors to collect data that will feed the smart 
city architecture with information used to offer services. After the sensors collect 
data, a Communication Device is used to collect sensor data. A communication de-
vice can implement different technologies (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sen-
sor data are processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Pro-

are processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing unit
responsible for gathering information used by the application providing a service.
The local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as it pushes part of the
computation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating all the computation in
a centralized remote server.
2.
The Communication Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access
technologies. The communication layer supports the implementation of various
wireless technologies. The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer
deﬁnes the technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using
the interface of a network access point.
3.
The Cloud Platform Layer provides three services: processing, database queries, and
data storage. In the context of providing services for smart cities, each of these services
can be dynamically allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,
only some applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.
This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation
is optional.
4.
The Services Layer implements four groups, which are called classes of services:
(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III) Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-
nology. In each class, different kinds of applications can be implemented to deal with
the challenges of smart cities.
This architecture is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer
support to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-
tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to a waste
management scenario.
Another multi-level smart city architecture [164] was built on semantic web technolo-
gies, and its design is mostly used in smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data
collection, data processing, integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make
up its four layers. Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]
suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects privacy.
Saadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile object authentication in the
context of IoT smart cities. Their architecture is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-
archical elliptic curve identity-based signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]
presented a Fog-based smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network
(FOCAN). To reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with
various capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating
on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through the smart
city environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT device can deliver
services effectively and with less energy consumption.
5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures
Software-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-
cient network conﬁguration to enhance a network. SDN can provide many advantages
for conﬁguring city networks to support different applications. For example, SDN can
improve the QoS of city networks against link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-
mands [170]. While some efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there
is room for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN
for efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri et al. [171]
considered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN, and IoT technologies and
reviewed different frameworks and platforms.
Liu et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications
from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers manage
physical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission, and processing services
to develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173] proposed a scalable SDN-enabled
architecture that integrates a variety of smart city components and provides reliable and
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

timely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services. They also studied
the time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under this architecture
and proposed a heuristic with an intelligent scheme that can maximize the throughput and
schedule the multi-ﬂow transfer dynamically.
IoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy
threats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative and intelligent-network-based in-
trusion detection system (NIDS) architecture, namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT
networks. SeArch is a security architecture in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS
nodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS, and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration
among nodes.
Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy in smart
cities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network architecture for the
smart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN and Blockchain technologies. To
achieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations, their architecture is divided into
core and edge networks. By designing a hybrid architecture, their architecture inherits
the strength of centralized and distributed network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]
is a Blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data
sharing in a smart city environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting
the blockchain network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved
businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto, smart
energy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain access control rules
that regulate who has access to the users’ data within a channel. In addition, private
data gathering and encryption are used to further isolate and safeguard the data within
a channel.
Islam et al. [178] designed a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT
ecosystem that addresses the existing challenges through the use of the technologies
Blockchain, SDN, and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-
ture confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,
and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.
5.3. Architectures for Smart Grid
The automated and intelligent management of the next-generation electric power
systems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart Grid (SG) is the name given to
the next generation of electricity systems, which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts
over the current systems in terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-
ability, and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies
to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric
devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate their local
devices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented by using the electrical and
communication infrastructures that connect the transmission and customer domains. The
distribution domain includes distribution feeders and transformers to supply electricity.
It interacts with much different equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),
plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with
communication capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity
to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality electricity,
the stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.
Typical applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic
meter reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.
DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution system.
Distributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination of renewable
and non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar panels, wind turbines,
combustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems, etc., are a few examples of DER.
An electric power system with one or more DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

The communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities of the
smart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure connects a huge
number of electric devices and manages complex device communications. As a result, it is
built in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected individual sub-networks, and each
sub-network is responsible for separate geographical regions. The extremely dispersed
smaller area networks that support the power systems at various locations are connected by
WANs, which act as the communication’s backbone. When the control centers are located a
great distance from the substations or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at
the electric devices are transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the
opposite direction, the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control
centers to the electric devices.
The authors of [43] present a communication architecture in an SG. This architecture
includes (1) an energy smart house with electric appliances connected to the smart grid,
(2) a residential complex with AMI, (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,
(4) a PEV charging station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this
architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed sub-
networks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication network
standards that have been established for smart grids and should be considered in planning
and implementing new infrastructures. Such standards are IEC 61850 for substation
automation. This standard is based on open architecture and incorporates sampling
and timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].
Notably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a precision clock synchronization protocol for
networked measurement and control systems [182].
Due to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs) throughout the
power grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution networks in smart grids would
undergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the
most part, the low-voltage distribution networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be
attached are not monitored by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-
quisition (SCADA) systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,
Abdrabou [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse
structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage distribu-
tion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also presented as a useful
method for prioritizing data transfer across the newly introduced network architecture.
HetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method
for power distribution grid applications. It delivers QoS assurances across the network
while taking into account three factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors
created two components to accomplish this:
•
A multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical applications for their high-
reliability requirements by using end-to-end physically disjoint paths, and
•
Altruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing mechanism that targets communi-
cation with QoS guarantees for applications with strict QoS requirements.
The ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay network architecture enables ex-
tremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware communication in heterogeneous networks.
The major characteristics that set SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are
the ability to execute two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time
pricing. The present SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to
be protocol independent. Therefore, global communication network management and
monitoring approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network
administrators may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane
from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication
networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency
and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and protocols
by virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity capabilities to
cope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185] presented SDN-based
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
38 of 63
SGC architectures, along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-
based SGC and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to
SDN-based SGC.
Alam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication networks in
terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies, and applications.
They proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication Network for Smart Grid.
CR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can quickly reconﬁgure its operating
parameters, such as modulation/demodulation, compression algorithm, and error coding
techniques, according to changing circumstances and requirements, through cognition. In
such an SDR platform, radio transceivers can switch functions and operations on demand
only. Molokomme et al. [187] reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various
and strict QoS requirements in SG communication systems.
Wireless communication networks have been motivated to harvest energy from
ambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic and ecological beneﬁts
through improvements in the smart power grid and the advocacy of “green communica-
tions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments in energy harvesting, redistribution,
trade, and planning for future wireless networks integrating with smart grids. The authors
considered the optimization of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-
tional models of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how
to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for energy
under dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way energy
trading using smart grids.
From a different viewpoint, including IoT devices and providing connectivity, au-
tomation, and monitoring for such devices enables SG systems to sustain multiple network
operations during the generation, distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.
Numerous IoT-aided SG systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on
IoT-aided SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.
5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings
There are various building applications such as heating, cooling, load control, air
quality, ventilation, lighting, water management, and cooking gas management. A smart
building incorporates the major building systems on a common network and functionality
to provide operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture
(SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,
air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation
and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management); a
smart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart building [190]
has security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality system, a ﬁre alarm system, a
water management system, and an energy management system. Moreover, it can detect
intrusion and supports HVAC services.
Diverse SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication
technologies. Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-
vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices driven
through IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings. Tradi-
tionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking protocols and
cabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex and highly infeasible
from both a deployment and a system administration standpoint [191]. SBAs entail making
plans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational technologies that improve the
application’s, service’s, or provision’s operational steps while also boosting the well-being
of its users. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers should pay attention to several
crucial issues, such as reliable communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient
measures, competent security measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-
ics procedures. Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)
technologies to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

deployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-
puting paradigms; big data engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction
procedures [192]. The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-
edness of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical
entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology
have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies for
a particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including heterogeneity
of IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols and architectures, power
efﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One solution is the SDN paradigm, which
manages the network more efﬁciently than a customary one. SDN also assists network
services, including storage, routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,
these simpliﬁcations offer a creative environment through the implementation of proper
software tools for smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-
telligent infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation
and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based on
SDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves critical SB
parameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency, security, and reliability.
Silva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT) SBA that is integrated with the repre-
sentational state transfer (RESTful) application programming interface (API). The RESTful
API employs HTTP requests (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT
data. Regarding network performance and smart building power management, the authors
showed how their recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.
Smart sensing devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or
modifying vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These
functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties. These sys-
tems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms, power, and transceiver
modules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based SBAs for assessing and regulat-
ing air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre detection systems, power management, and
other basic building operations.
An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for
monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing
system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature, and
relative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198]. Con-
sidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed in the
literature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system to satisfy the users’
needs. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption reduction via energy-efﬁcient
smart lighting systems. Today’s smart building employs low-power usage LED-based
light sources that last longer than Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the
development of control technologies, heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems
has made it promising to create smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively
address the problem of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by
integrating different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved
energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user satisfac-
tion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors, as opposed to a
single expensive sensor, would result in improved performance and higher power savings.
Considering the same motivation, various authors [202–204] have suggested similar types
of smart lighting systems for several room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],
the authors provide a deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing
on power savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration of
visible light communication technology [206].
Recently, researchers focused on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-
mance and thermal comfort, to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented
Technologies (OOT) have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal
comfort while conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
40 of 63
drawbacks of the automatic control used today. In practice, thermal comfort analysis is
based on parallel objective and subjective evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises
monitoring, assessing, and recording the status of environmental parameters through dedi-
cated sensors and instruments following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation
involves monitoring, assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and
thermal environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative
method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].
Green building refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to
predetermined circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes
full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently
allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence concept aims
to conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of them to offer comfort to the
occupants. Through unconventional energy sources, it also meets some of the conventional
energy requirements [207]. Many aspects of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and
power efﬁciency, are the subject of extensive study. However, one of the most important
functions of an SB system is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by
HVAC systems [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial
buildings for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for this
context. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of rated fan energy
can be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect on a building’s indoor
temperature. The method of computational control for passive and active sources was
used in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized the problem that the ambient and
active sources of lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and shading are not synchronized
in buildings. Such a computational control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power
usage. Similarly, numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been
proposed with respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.
An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes
when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-
tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed
times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed spaces)
than outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved along with that of the
external surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).
The basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal
conditioning circuit, a small amount of external memory, and a communication module
that is typically wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can
detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and O3, as
well as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and temperature. These
sensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values of the real-time indoor air quality
parameters and an external memory used to store real-time data [214]. When deploying
such systems, various communication (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and
LoRAWAN technologies, are considered.

Figure 5. Air Quality Monitoring Sensor System. Adapted from [215,216]. 
Figure 6 shows an SBA architecture [217]. The system of this architecture collects 
vital information about the various air quality parameters, including CO2, CO, particles 
(Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial parameters such as hu-
midity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the authors created 
a method for collecting and monitoring the indoor atmosphere. For monitoring CO2 and 
CO parameters, they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas sensors. These sensors usually 
work using the resistive heating principle. The TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity 
to fluctuations in CO gas concentration. This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is in-
versely proportionate to the amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the IR falls. 
While TGS 4161 also offers low power consumption and suggests better performance in 
detecting changes in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is ideally suited for indoor air 
control applications as it can measure 350–10,000 ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used 
the DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol laser photometer that simultaneously measures 
mass and size fraction, for PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create an 
interface to the deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol data, this 
photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors also set up ZB 
(ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which sent updates on the air 
quality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that had already been set up. 
This system assesses the indoor air quality to assess the current state of the indoor 
environment while simultaneously providing real-time inputs for HVAC system man-
agement. The authors also designed a toolkit that analyzes real-time air quality data and 
displays them through meaningful representations to service the SBAs. Likewise, Lozano et 
al. [216] proposed another IAQMS technique that considers a star topological architecture 
[217]. The ZB (ENs) in this technique is based on the XBee and XBee pro-version modules.

ergy-related SB technologies, including energy management systems, renewable energy 
applications, and current advanced smart technologies. Undoubtedly, the electricity sec-
tor of smart cities is impacted by the Internet of Energy (IoE), which aims to increase en-
ergy efficiency, prevent energy waste, and enhance environmental conditions by inte-
grating IoT technologies into distributed energy systems. Two examples of IoE technol-
ogy are intelligent sensor use and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. As a 
result, the IoE is becoming a tool for legal science to support the goals of a smart city. 
Metallidou et al. [219] discussed the factors that prompted the European Union to create 
regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart cities, starting with 
existing structures. To achieve energy efficiency, the authors suggested a smart building 
template that uses IoT technology to manage the performance of all technical systems. In 
addition, they suggested an automated remote-control technique supported by a cloud 
interface to enhance the certification of existing buildings for energy performance. This 
technology reduces time-consuming processes and stores the energy performance of each 
building on a cloud platform to make decisions and put measures in place. A review of 
current tactics in the field of active building energy management systems (BEMS) was 
offered by Mariano-Hernández et al. [220]. The authors reviewed articles on several 
BEMS management techniques for residential and non-residential buildings, including

grating IoT technologies into distributed energy systems. Two examples of IoE technology
are intelligent sensor use and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. As a re-
sult, the IoE is becoming a tool for legal science to support the goals of a smart city.
Metallidou et al. [219] discussed the factors that prompted the European Union to create
regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart cities, starting with
existing structures. To achieve energy efﬁciency, the authors suggested a smart building
template that uses IoT technology to manage the performance of all technical systems. In
addition, they suggested an automated remote-control technique supported by a cloud
interface to enhance the certiﬁcation of existing buildings for energy performance. This
technology reduces time-consuming processes and stores the energy performance of each
building on a cloud platform to make decisions and put measures in place. A review of
current tactics in the ﬁeld of active building energy management systems (BEMS) was
offered by Mariano-Hernández et al. [220]. The authors reviewed articles on several BEMS
management techniques for residential and non-residential buildings, including Model
Predictive Control (MPC), Demand Side Management (DSM), Optimization, and Fault
Detection and Diagnostics (FDD). MPC predicts building response to control requests,
while DSM is an agreement of actions to improve the energy system on the user side. FDD
is an automatic procedure of detecting and separating ﬂaws in BEMS to protect a system
from additional harm. Moudgil et al. [221] examined cutting-edge academic and industrial

research to discover signiﬁcant technological solutions that improve the integration of IoT
in building infrastructure (BI). Their review also identiﬁes key technical and non-technical
problems that must be resolved through extensive research for BI to fully incorporate IoT.
The authors contend that IoT in BI is still not operationally capable. IoT and BI stakeholders
must make a concerted effort to give modern BI access to a generic IoT framework with
cognitive intelligence and context-aware computing capabilities.
5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring
Retroﬁtting the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some
beneﬁts, including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].
For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert utilities
to pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network, allowing them to remotely
adjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224]. Automation can be used for both
operational procedures and components that provide functionality. For instance, when a
water problem occurs during operation or with the element itself, the smart components
inform the system center and then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also
determine a sensor’s requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic
self-veriﬁcation mechanism [225].
In [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid architecture that includes
technical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework. Moreover, this smart water
system (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms, simulation procedures, diag-
nostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-
porates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance is deﬁned by online procedures such
as online data monitoring, online data assimilation, online modeling, online charting,
and online results output. An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the
necessary smart features [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-
ter systems that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time
controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system output,
should be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered that using SCADA
would considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229]. A smart water architec-
ture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;
(3) the communication layer; (4) the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.
Within the framework of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system
that allows for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a
user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are saved
and processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and the individual user level.
Meanwhile, the processed data are returned to the Water Utility and can be used for billing.
On the other hand, they provide regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness
of their consumption behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework
based on FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-
ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of various
FIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis et al. [232]
considered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding conventional water
metering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted bi-directional (whenever re-
quired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices, metering equipment, and end-users.
The authors’ ultimate objective is to design, implement, and deploy more sophisticated
infrastructure offering improved performance in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit
the amount of data that needs to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-
proach makes use of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water
grid model.
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the Efﬁcient
Water Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission under the
auspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the Smart Water project is
to examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively managing urban water systems,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
44 of 63
with a focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related
decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues such as
leakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth. Kulkarni
and Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity, proposed
a framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost of ownership, and
highlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’ Smart Water case studies.
Pipelines are used to transport water, gases, and oil. Since they are frequently under-
ground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes them, which may result in leaks. In addition,
water in the pipelines may get contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are
mistakenly or purposely introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline
networks is crucial for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-
sor node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline
network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection time.
The sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s junctions [234].
Given the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor node deployment challenges
are therefore formulated as integer optimization problems, where the integer variables
represent the maximum amount of sensor nodes that must be placed at each junction. The
deployment difﬁculties for pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve
because of the integer decision variables.
Pipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,
the sensing performance of a deployed sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern
is taken into account in [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to
decide how to deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious
contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a branch
and bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify the ideal answer,
the time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that large pipeline networks cannot
be used with the method. Similarly, the study in [236] considers the various demand
patterns of water ﬂows through pipes. The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the
best deployment locations to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand
patterns. The global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.
The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.
Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.
Singapore’s WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate
burst incidents [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline
leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure. To
reduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track water
consumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System [240] has been
created to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks and bottlenecks. With the
aid of all these technologies, the investigators had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency
of the monitoring algorithms. However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we
still need to put innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and
mobile WSN into place.
5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation
The Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion
and accidents. It also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities
that may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the two
technologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that compose
vehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and mobile network.
VANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication. Providing remote loca-
tion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information services is referred to as an
onboard information service. Every car can be utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks
to mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
45 of 63
(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people and vehicles, as well as between
vehicles and the environment, infrastructure, or other vehicles.
Vehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and inter-vehicle communica-
tion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible layered architecture to handle
characteristics such as interoperability, scalability, dependability, and modularity. Recently,
the research community proposed efﬁcient vehicle network architectures. For example,
the Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and
choosing messaging protocols are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-
cessing, big data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia
and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s ClCom and
cloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms, infrastructure, and
software services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication layer and the intra–inter
devices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity of many heterogeneous objects
and networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter devices layer in classical architecture. The
UIoV system’s physical objects layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter
devices layer for additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are
identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.
Liu et al. [242] suggested another IoV network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of
application management while enhancing the scalability and dependability of information
services. This architecture has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety
of nodes with various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV
is frequently changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-
mitted at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,
the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,
communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road safety
management and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible for schedul-
ing the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and interacting with the application
layer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture design is dealing with diverse networks.
Interoperability, scalability, dependability, and adaptability are some of its network features.
The design seeks to increase layer separation and network architecture’s total number of
layers. In addition to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate
the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.
By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning ability
of autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both physical and network
data space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) paradigm [243] improves network
security and transportation safety. CIoV enables IoV to bear more accurate perceptive
ability through cognition in the intra-vehicle network (driver, passengers, smart devices,
etc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network
(road environment, cellular network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture
includes a cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of
data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition
investigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture of CIoV. The gathering
and preprocessing of big data from several sources are done by the sensing layer. As
opposed to the previous communication layer (of other architectures), the architecture’s
communication layer uses a cloud/edge hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-
tion schedules. The data cognition engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets
heterogeneous data streams (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety
of cognitive analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in
charge of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies such
as NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There are primar-
ily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application services and intelligent
transportation applications).
Efﬁcient message authentication and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-
vacy and safeguard vehicular communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

in the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats, Karim [244] provided
a cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes a data encryption and de-
cryption mechanism based on attributes and identity that has the lowest computational
overhead while keeping the optimum level of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]
suggested a seven-layer network architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-
mation exchange between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units
(RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing
and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data before
sending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission. Making
choices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities of control and
management. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing layer to create
the pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop assaults, the security layer
directly manages each of the layers above. A unique network architecture with enhanced
throughput, reduced latency, higher security, and widespread connectivity was recently
proposed by Ji et al. [246]. This architecture consists of four layers:
1.
Security authentication layer: The RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment
data in real-time after setting several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This
layer determines the legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.
Perhaps an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt
to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.
2.
Data acquisition layer: This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from
various networks. To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it
digitizes the data.
3.
Edge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result, processing and
analyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant delays. As a result, we
must process data more closely related to the data source. The edge node, a physical
device situated closest to the data source, is used by the edge layer to carry out basic
processing and analysis on the acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings
for nearby trafﬁc incidents and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a
local decision-making plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud
data center’s computing power.
4.
Cloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the information it has collected
about global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan, and rationally distributes trafﬁc
resources. This layer, having the ability to implement connection management, data
management, aided autonomous driving, intelligent navigation, path planning, and
information security, is the “smart brain” of the IoV.
A blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN) for the smart city was
presented in [247]. Building innovative distributed transport management systems is made
possible by the robust and secure Block-VN architecture. The authors considered how the
network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-
tion. To handle real-time transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing
transportation data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four
layers: data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application. Each
layer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the data processing
layer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing the suggested event and
decision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249], the data are made available
to a smart community member. The suggested approach was examined using transporta-
tion datasets from some reliable sources. The outcomes demonstrate data processing and
real-time distribution to citizens in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop
environment produces ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social
IoV (SIoV) are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes
share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable with
traditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware communication
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
47 of 63
architecture for social IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and
inter-vehicle communication architecture for SIoVs.
5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart Villages
The smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities using IoT
technologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried out, including smart
agriculture, waste management, irrigation management, livestock management, smart
energy, smart healthcare, and smart education. A smart village or smart rural area can
enable real-time data analytics and automate decision-making for local villagers regard-
ing healthcare, agriculture, environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a
smart city as there are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)
between urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-
pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to interfere
ICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning of “smart” in
rural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European Commission-funded
Smart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal of encouraging and motivat-
ing communities to create and execute smart village methods and tactics throughout
Europe as a tool for rural development, serving as the authors’ primary source. IEEE
Smart Village [256] also supports the world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-
viding a complete solution combining renewable energy, community-based education, and
entrepreneurial opportunities.
Malik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart villages with different
technologies. They concluded that digitization is only possible if a reliable and robust net-
work and communication infrastructure are installed in the village environment. Shrestha
and Drozdenko [258] proposed a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate
change using IoT and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University
campus. Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-
ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It consists of
the following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud Services, and a Web
Dashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into meaningful information from
which public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to or frustrate the effects of climate change.
Monzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural
system for gathering and processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional
communication coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in
separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Their
proposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs of the system in the
collection of IoT data from these remote rural areas, its coverage by space vehicles, and its
processing and storage through 5G terrestrial networks and cloud services. Their proposal
includes the deployment of IoT sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.
Conversely, the part of the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for
different space channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural
system that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet. To
provide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored the integration
of a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with IoT in improving security
and privacy solutions for villagers and consumer electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,
the authors designed and evaluated the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
in a DFC-based smart village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues
and challenges regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed
a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints in a smart
village. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge computing as applicable
to reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural facilities. Collaboration occurs
between the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g., the edge data centers or edge routers) for data
processing and storage. For example, in times of high computational load demand, one
village’s edge devices can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.

6. Summary
•
Various SCAs have different network requirements such as bandwidth, delay toler-
ance, power consumption, reliability, wireless connectivity, mobility, security, and
privacy. Therefore, they need different protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network
architectures for IoT are heterogeneous and include various network technologies such
as WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile
Communication Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these
architectures must allow interoperability, while cross-layer design-based recommen-
dations for power consumption and congestion control are well-suited proposals.
•
State-of-the-art generic network architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm
and are based on FogC to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.
•
Fog and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the
future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication
methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency. The
CR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this technology can
quickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication system to the
changing requirements through cognition.
•
By extracting usable data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible
to increase network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures
will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines that
will conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g., driving behavior
model analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.
•
The networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of smart
buildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been facing some
challenges such as network management in terms of maintenance, east–west interface,
southbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based SDN networking for SB,
and the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.
7. Open Research Issues
−Network slicing management is required: IoT services such as smart transportation and
smart energy have diversiﬁed requirements. To accommodate diverse IoT services, the
network slicing paradigm is suggested because it enables multiple independent logical
networks running on the same physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented
an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)
focusing on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory). The
authors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management
in this ﬁeld.
−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation
Group proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions that were before performed
by some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the ﬂexible provisioning of software-
based network functionalities on top of an appropriately shared physical infrastructure by
separating the network functions from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing
inexpensive commodity servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with
administering and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is
used in conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome
the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic resource
management [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service environment through
NFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll
a new service request is avoided. In conjunction with the use of SDN, NFV also allows
real-time and dynamic function provisioning along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The
SDN-IoT network may be improved and secured with NVF. It enables the software-based
deployment of network devices as virtualized components. Throughput is increased
because of NFV integration in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.
To this end, Sinh et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
49 of 63
SDN controller applications to show that SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.
Recently, Mukherjee et al. [265] proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV
implementation for smart cities.
−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology can address the
bandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can be enabled with cognitive
functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing, circumstantial
perceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs and services can be based on CR technology
because it can do dynamic sensing and cognition of the surrounding environment. For
example, in smart grid applications, cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling
users to know their energy consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-
plications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network
interference [268]. At the same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-
toring over longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum
availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in IoT demands
extensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware design, privacy
protection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility problems, etc. [270].
For this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures must be proposed to
solve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271] suggested a CIoT-based smart city
network architecture that outlines how data collected from SCAs may be analyzed using
the CogC paradigm and manage the scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.
−Challenges in IoT communication through TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access
Points (APs) can utilize identical WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-
ence problems that can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many
APs can provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with
the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY
layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the capacity
of WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations. As a result, it
is possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to the number of antennas on APs.
Thus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel and Singh [131] stressed the employment
of CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods with many APs to improve the Compound
TCP’s performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate
the learning processes of the transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training
data are dispersed across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-
atively slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized
model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to coordinate
numerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel characteristics and
WiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use of FL and CR approaches in
dual AP settings, it is now possible to improve the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.
Another study [274] assumed TCP Cubic [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the
FL approach for IoVs. The authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL
technique, which enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.
−Digital Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-
dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital twin technology
can be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans, IoT devices, aircraft en-
gines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original vehicle is created, for instance, when
an automobile business creates a virtual representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car
model. If a manufacturer creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the
replicated process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle of
the actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this virtual graphic, the
dynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation are depicted. The digital twin
can offer the location, state, and/or status of physical assets in real-time due to continual
learning and advancements. This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations
to monitor systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital twins
are created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure graphs,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
50 of 63
AI, software analytics, and the IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is
demonstrated. This technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to
the optimization of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting
them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize. If a digital twin
is in place, government organizations can only fully assess what might be achieved with
the data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic opportunity, and establish a more cohesive
community. Although the idea is currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few
years [277].
−The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense and
AI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc is estimated in
the future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted to the concept of Internet of
Everything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart cities should have a huge bandwidth, low
latency, and AI integration. Such networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and
on-demand content for thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the
problem-solving network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is
under development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data
networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular networks,
in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas (cells). It is expected that
6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,
together with new infrastructure. The network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:
(1) ultra-fast data rates as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased
mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects; (5) peak
spectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability; and (7) improved network
security [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is that transmitting at a higher frequency
spectrum is prone to high path loss, making the distance for transmission limited [280].
The expected 6G of the radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the
capability of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability of
carrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks, such as short-
range and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can introduce complications
and hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore, such complications of THz waves
must be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric multilayer physical network architectures of 6G
must be proposed for futuristic smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations
from a network of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed
a conceptual terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a
scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart cities. It
provides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to run AI applications
partially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore, the distributed and edge
computing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides security and reduces trafﬁc load on
the upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly, pervasive AI is the main enabling technology
in 6G, while some forms of AI are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of
using AI on wireless communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs
(e.g., channel estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control
and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell and
topology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc. However,
DL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might not ﬁt in current
mobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN)-based
RL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease the computational resources required
on these devices [282]. Quantum communication [283] offers a promising approach to
avoiding the challenge of limited computational resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying
Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy
and computational/energy requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above
issues and envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous
systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important enabling
technologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies are as follows:
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

•
Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places
where maintaining Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on
doors, windows, and buildings.
•
Cell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced in 5G with
a more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further developed in 6G
to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free Massive MIMO im-
proves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there are some health risks
associated with such a dense network of APs.
•
CubeSat communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class
spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up to 6U,
and U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.
•
UAVs/satellite communication.
•
Terahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].
•
Blockchain technology [290] and quantum communication [283].
The development of futuristic smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-
efﬁcient 6G communication. Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for
energy-efﬁcient 6G wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application
of IoT devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency rate,
up to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000 GHz frequency.
This will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other concerns in conventional
communication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient 6G in smart cities via IoT
devices probably will solve various problems that are encountered by existing smart city
systems. In futuristic smart cities, residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer
interface (BCI) technology [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals
and information that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and
devices. It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.
As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises ﬁve
datasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction with the
machine [292].
8. Conclusions
Utilizing resources efficiently, reducing operating expenses, and enhancing city
dwellers’ quality of life are the objectives of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-
tained by combining various technologies including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big
data analytics, and robots. For this model, the effective networking and communication
between the many components required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its
objectives. The ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable
platforms for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,
and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined
in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different system
levels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking protocols
and smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart transportation system
architectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a variety of networking designs, such as
energy savings, routing, security, dependability, mobility, and support for heterogeneous
networks. In addition, we presented open research issues.
This survey can assist researchers to recognize research gaps/problems working in the
networking architectures for smart cities, and it provides an overview of available protocols
and architectures for SCAs.

Abstract: Numerous municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality
of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating expenses. This model
incorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom). However, effective networking and
communication protocols are required to provide the essential harmonization and control of the many
system mechanisms to achieve these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics
of smart city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking protocols
that can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are required between the dissimilar
mechanisms. Additionally, we show examples of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,
such as smart transport, smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,
and control systems.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve
the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources. Intelligent
services can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure in smart cities. They can
enhance performance and operations in a wide variety of smart city applications (SCAs)
including transportation, healthcare, energy, education, and many more. Smart services are
provided by various cutting-edge technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples
of these technologies include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data
analytics, and robots.
IoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful human life beneﬁts [2].
IoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart things into urban environments
where innovative services are offered to support every activity at any time and from any
location [2]. Things are monitored by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their
efﬁcient management. Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and
fault reporting for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state
of the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices can also
obtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a CPS, the computation,
networking, and physical processes are put together to control and monitor the physical
environment of a smart city [4]. In smart cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical
connections between the virtual and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can
be sustained by the ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform

for computation and IoT data storage [5]. FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,
location awareness, streaming, and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have
dispersed vast numbers of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex
infrastructure. Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications
that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by smart cities,
big data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal temporary and lasting
decisions [8].
The abovementioned technologies are used to implement numerous smart city ser-
vices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent transportation services are applied to improve route
planning and avoid jamming in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety
and make possible self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light
controls are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management
and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.
These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional smart
services are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water networks, train and
subway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health monitoring is also feasible using
smart services [11]. Last but not least, there are smart services that focus on monitoring the
environment, public safety, and security of citizens [12].
All these smart city services necessitate a reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-
ciently exchange messages between the modules of a smart city system implementing a
particular smart service. In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and
communication technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-
ilar scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented based
on Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols. On the other
hand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented using the WiMAX
(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart city services can exploit
dissimilar network and communication models and solutions.
Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have
received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart cities does not exist
and is the goal of this study. The communication and networking issues involved in smart
city systems are examined in this study. This paper considers networking technologies,
topologies, and communication requirements for such systems. It also examines if current
network protocols are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent
developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active area, this
paper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper contributes as follows:
1.
It presents network requirements of the major SCAs including intelligent transporta-
tion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring and control, smart water networks, smart
grids, and manufacturing control and monitoring.
2.
It reviews networking architectures used for the above applications focusing mainly
on the protocols’ suitability.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;
Section 3 presents network requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;
Sections 4 and 5 analyze protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-
ings, smart water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6
summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly, Section 8
concludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.

our concerned ﬁeld were also crossed out. After eliminating inappropriate articles, only
226 studies were identiﬁed.
2. Smart City Applications
This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what
type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs, their
advantages and design problems were addressed.
In the energy sector, SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and
sustainability of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart grid
is a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available information
about supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply self-monitoring and
superior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer demand, improving grid
reliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used to manage the process of producing
renewable energy from wind turbines [15].
Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy
consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,
Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.
Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the environment
and energy consumption, are typically included in smart building systems. A centralized
monitoring and control system receives observations and measurements from these sensors.
Based on reported observations, current operational circumstances, and environmental
factors, the control system employs intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems
employed in the buildings to optimize energy consumption.
Intelligent transportation is another SCA that has attracted a lot of interest in the
transportation sector. Applications related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial
types of such applications. Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,
such as blind spot monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane
change warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-
automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response are these
applications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing vehicle safety must
be dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects such as threat observations,
decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software cannot handle
high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices and guarantee real-time and
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].
They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment
to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed data and intelligent
software that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,
which incorporate device monitoring across numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc
patterns, are another application of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present
an example of intelligent trafﬁc lights.
Water networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase their intelli-
gence, efﬁciency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems are integrated into water
networks to add smart characteristics to the processes of water distribution [19]. Offering
early warning systems to identify problems in water networks is one of these duties. For
instance, it is simple to identify leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary ﬁxes can be
implemented to prevent water wastage and future network threats or damage [20].
WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides
well-organized control for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level in green-
houses [21]. Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control,
monitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare systems
based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical health of
users [25].
Figure 2 shows some important applications including smart trafﬁc surveillance
and management, smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste
management, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.

monitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare sys-
tems based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical 
health of users [25]. 
Figure 2 shows some important applications including smart traffic surveillance and 
management, smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste man-
agement, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.

Analysis of Smart City Applications/Systems
This subsection analyses the SCAs shown in Figure 2.
Smart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are based on centralized pro-
cesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus, to automate such an innova-
tive system, centralized and distributed methods must be used to maintain local servers.
Javaid et al. [26] suggested a smart trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-
ized and decentralized processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm
to manage a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-
tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes
trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered a theoreti-
cal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management. Notably, existing
decision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and highway trafﬁc management,
not considering the closed campuses and collector roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-
tiﬁed this weakness and proposed an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,
and stores real-time trafﬁc data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-
agement system, various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,
extremely sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,
and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as higher costs.
Smart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health parameters, these sys-
tems are progressively being associated with and connected via the Internet to numerous
types of available smart wearable sensing and computing devices. These systems face
several problems [29] that must be resolved. A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-
thentication, interoperability issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-
tion and management of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]
addressed issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They
sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-
tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys and
reviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of integrating IoT
systems with any healthcare application particularly.
Weather and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental
monitoring stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,
these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts. Therefore, it is
impractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead, they are often deployed
sparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial resolutions for useful measurements.
Lately, cheap monitoring sensors have evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in
reﬁning the granularity of monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]
emphasized the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality
monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the issue of
cross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants. Moreover, these sensors
are extremely susceptible to unexpected variations in humidity, temperature, and wind
direction, and as a result, their accuracy deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine
might be a way to maintain and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take
a lot more time and work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for
large-scale deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex
and involves three steps [34]:
(1)
Observing: It can be performed by monitoring satellite imagery, precipitation reports,
surface data, and gathering data from other nearby forecasters.
(2)
Forecasting: It can be performed by forecasters as short-term and long-term forecasting.
Short-term forecasting is carried out by evaluating the current weather conditions
and projecting them over the next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics
of the weather. Long-term forecasting, however, is possible through weather (nu-
merical) modeling and the projection of such modeling using computer simulations.
To produce these simulations for future forecasting, these modeling techniques use
environmental data from satellite photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
7 of 63
servations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters translate the
produced simulated expected output into a perceptible format for non-specialists so
that they can respond appropriately.
(3)
Communicating: Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to
appropriate authorities.
Despite the fact that all of these computer models are used to forecast the weather, the
success of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three different elements: (a) the quantity of
precise data; (b) the length of time needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of
dynamic atmospheric weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region
is the placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from rural
areas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough information for desert,
sea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models used to predict weather conditions
accurately. Forecasters also use satellite data to combat this issue. However, because
of cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,
satellite data accuracy can occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and
map information or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,
it further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further makes
things harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there is a need to re-
evaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations so that they can predict the
changes more accurately.
Smart Waste Management Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for
the following reasons: (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate
waste collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;
(4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies; and (5) lack
of workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical skills to handle
garbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart waste management schemes
include various steps such as (1) waste collection; (2) differentiation of waste as per their
biological and physical properties; (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage
disposal infrastructures/treatment plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova
and Porras [35] identiﬁed issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from
smart deployed sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues
such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly managing
waste vehicle routes.
Smart Street Lighting Systems: This system is a network-oriented solution that uses
streetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities
and connectivity interfaces [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a
mechanism that gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting
with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors and
actuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the streetlights, and
they are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device. Zanella et al. [37] insist
that their system could assist in gathering environmental parameters such as humidity, air
temperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors stated that optimizing street lighting
efﬁciency is a paramount concern that must be addressed. This monitoring system makes
it possible to maximize efﬁciency since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity
in response to the time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this
system is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns that
require particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions and communication
among heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right light lamp is critical for a
power-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection is based on how effective they are in
terms of power usage and lifespan. The existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide
(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen
as being inefﬁcient in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,
which adds signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following
the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201) [36].
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
8 of 63
Currently, there are three kinds of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:
centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a
variety of security assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem
thus far.
Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security of
its residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing with natural
calamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection is ﬁrst and foremost
important for the designing portion of these applications. Depending on the gathered
facts, the development of intelligence (which aids in making important decisions) and the
ability to respond swiftly and quickly are the issues that require special attention. When
it comes to gathering data, we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc
sensors. A developer can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will
conduct predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,
this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information that
will help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the police department,
and law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and preventive measures. The
concept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts for security and safety. However,
keeping track of such vast amounts of data also prompts a lot of worries and issues for
designers and developers, including storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,
most importantly, the question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track
of each individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether this
kind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such as China and India,
where a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation. Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]
claimed that combining information transmission technologies with well-implemented
data analytics models is necessary for quick and swift collaboration. To save as many lives
as possible during natural disasters, it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate
vital information to the relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work
being done to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this
system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important problems
that need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and information sharing
across heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).
Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems
such as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems, TVs,
and other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances that may send
users remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing machines. A user can control
the majority of smart home appliances remotely with two recently produced gadgets:
Google Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart home, the end-user demands a high-speed
internet connection, so they can access networking sites that control the home with HD live
streaming services. In contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to
computing servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data
management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate
on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending
distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of smart home
automation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks. A smart home includes
security monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly opening smart door locks,
televisions, phones, and other smart appliances that are highly outﬁtted with cameras and
microphones. Although these gadgets improve the system, little research has been done on
their privacy and security features. If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we
will discover that their manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.
Indeed, Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining
Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They
argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already more
privileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated applications. As a
result, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this, according to a published document
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
9 of 63
by WikiLeaks [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,
and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal
entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate private
information, and exploit that information immorally typically through user tracking and
proﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these smart applications, grab vital
information, and then use it to launch any kind of attack. For instance, based on motion
sensors, security camera feeds, and power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where
and when to break into the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized
parties, they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and
software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard against
all these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators, etc., are impervious to
such security and privacy attacks.
Smart Grid Networks: The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-
tional (i.e., electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).
Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks to
the deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in an open-loop
fashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures in the distribution
sector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little or no real-time knowledge of the
system’s operating conditions and dynamically changing load. There are also several tech-
nical, economic, and environmental problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,
this conventional system must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as
ﬂexible, secure, and interoperable [42].
The smart grid is the next invention of the Electric Power System (EPS) that incor-
porates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication networks [43]. Smart grids
supplement the conventional electricity grid by incorporating renewable energy sources
such as biomass, solar energy, and wind energy. These energy sources are much cleaner
and more ecologically friendly than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.
However, it is important to identify the most suitable communication technology for the
smart grid’s successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-
nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns. The
communication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle information
exchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices, and numerous smart meters
in such a particular environment with little to no human intervention. This type of com-
munication, called Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, is autonomous and may be
initiated in response to an event or at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these
smart grid applications were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly
in terms of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement
of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent grid
networks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the same network
present the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications based on the smart
grid can be developed and implemented using the current wireless and wired networking
infrastructure and technologies. For some devices, such as smart meters, designing and
standardizing acceptable smart grid-based protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,
these smart grid-based networks are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and
other devices. This makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These
smart grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain
unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as the existing
electricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid systems, high-level adjustments
to current power infrastructure scenarios are required. Subsequently, these smart systems
require high installation costs because the installation requires a large number of smart
meters, sensors, and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of
such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free network
channel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent applications.

Many surveys [42–45,47] reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-
grid-based networking technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-
ous smart grid applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on
transmission grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.
3. Network Requirements for SCAs
This section considers several communication requirements including reliability, delay
tolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security, network type, heterogeneous network
support, and mobility support. It also studies the aptness of different network protocols for
dissimilar SCAs.
Smart city services and applications need robust and dependable communication
support as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent
message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49]. Every
smart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of various networking
components. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required to have a variety of net-
working requirements. To access the far-off destination, which may be clouds, the network
trafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse applications uses a common networking
architecture and resources. These resources may consist of switches, routers, communica-
tion connections (links), and other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing
faraway clouds or far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings
up problems with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network
bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when develop-
ing, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart cities. Otherwise, users
would be reluctant to approve the use of such applications in the absence of adequate secu-
rity safeguards. Such intelligent applications need a high-speed networking environment
where the quick reaction may be managed with the support of the ability of a fast-processing
speed. Furthermore, a variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,
based on their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have
different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security [50]. For
example, the networking requirements of smart emergency response systems are quite
different compared to other applications such as smart healthcare systems. Emergency
response smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick to react [50]. In contrast,
smart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily need to be especially dynamic.
−
Network Protocols: Monitoring applications for smart cities often use a dense network
of heterogeneous sensor nodes, including ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,
and crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),
extended coverage GSM IoT, and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing
options to support such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing
nodes (smartphones) is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no
further wireless communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can
be utilized on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered
by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations (the
backbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.
−
Zigbee [53], WiFi, and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes
to communicate within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor
node clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-
ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance
simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also make
possible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance of real-time
monitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance, can accommodate video
streams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles. The fast data rates
provided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous for the sink nodes or clusters.
The use of vibration data (accelerometer readings) in structural health monitoring
applications of bridges, tunnels, or towers is fairly common. The cluster heads will be
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
11 of 63
able to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion, practically
all applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data throughput and
minimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there are some new
sensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56], and Narrowband-
IoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous advantages: greater
coverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and increased device longevity.
Researchers have tested these standards in more than a few applications, including
street lighting, energy metering, and home automation, even though some are still
being discussed and revised. The new narrowband communication standards enable
the sensor nodes to run more sustainably, which is beneﬁcial for applications that
aim for long-term monitoring. In addition to these protocols and standards, the FogC
architecture [58] aids in monitoring smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile
users (the potential crowd-sensing providers) and the cloud are connected via fog
servers. These fog servers are WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users
are more inclined to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing
measurements to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and
energy usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give
us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the
WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the FogC
architecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency and response
time are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates directly from
the fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone network. Lastly,
using the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is crucial to getting the
best possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and cost. The networks may be
hierarchical so that diverse roles and functions can be assigned at various layers to
increase the networks’ dependability and cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes
may be able to transmit data utilizing various protocols.
−
Bandwidth requirements: Many video applications in smart cities require high band-
width [59]. In these applications, sensors capture video from the physical environment.
Moreover, video transmission is more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar
data trafﬁc in IoT. Examples of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-
lance systems for home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,
trafﬁc monitoring systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring
of an environmental system.
−
Delay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate a small
amount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger to the ve-
hicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed must arrive within
microseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react in time. However, other
applications have a higher tolerance for delays [49]. Such applications rely on data
monitoring and information gathering for upcoming analysis.
−
Power Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power consumption.
Smart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy sources can tolerate
protocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45]. Other applications have medium
power needs and require energy sources with limited capacities. One example of such
an application is intelligent transportation. Other applications demand protocols with
low or very low energy consumption characteristics since they have limited energy
resources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline
monitoring for gas and oil are a few examples of such uses.
−
Reliability: The majority of applications have medium reliability requirements. A
typical example of such applications is smart water networks. Some other applications
have high-reliability necessities such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].
−
Security: The majority of applications need medium to high security. Applications
such as production control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
12 of 63
others, such as smart grids, need high security because of the sensitivity of the data
and the importance of the operations carried out [50].
−
Heterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city systems use network-
ing protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent transportation and smart
buildings are two examples of such systems. These protocols must coexist in such
situations without conﬂicting with one another. To ensure seamless and effective
operation, it is also necessary to correctly map the control information in the head-
ers at the various networking stack tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols
and networks.
−
Wired/wireless connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity
are UAVs and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent
transportation and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In
these situations, wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc
physical system (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used
to link the physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the
backbone and infrastructure networks.
−
Mobility: Some systems, such as the smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,
and smart water networks, have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such
as UAVs and intelligent transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility
smart city systems can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and
adaptable to node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control
messages and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.
Table 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each
SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network with
low, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility of devices. Each
SCA is based on different protocols and requires different bandwidth and latency tolerance.
In each SCA, the number of devices involved differs.

3.1. Additional Challenges
−
Interoperability: Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking
protocols that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-
cal and data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-
lessly, these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE
1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between physi-
cal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this function. Future
research should focus on the creation of similar protocols to increase the support
system for smart city systems.
−
Scalability: A smart city platform must manage many devices that are connected to
the city’s infrastructure. Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously
produced and consumed by devices and client applications, must be stored and
processed. The platform must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests
from users and services that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change
depending on the features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.
Recently, Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-
source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale
systems, apps, and services for smart cities.
−
Load Balancing: To maximize the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-
priate resources (i.e., network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,
and energy resources) to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and
avoids overload thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,
cost, throughput, performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of
QoS parameters.
−
The Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation of
smart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,
upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that demand
advanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems
for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time applica-
tions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently, FogC and
Edge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing, imple-
menting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These paradigms
bring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that the primary computa-
tion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm offers particular assistance
based on the requirements of the application at hand. For example, to support a cloud-
based SCA, ClCom offers centralized storage and processing capacity. For certain
SCAs, ClCom can offer scalable processing power and data storage [5]. The features of
ClCom (e.g., powerful processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge
software services) can be used to provide various support services for a variety of
SCAs. ClCom can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The
city’s ClCom services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs
to gather, process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes
of data are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The
sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount of
data to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing. To
effectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators and
ClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures
used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require
the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function well
with a robust network that offers good communication services linking both sides.
The fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central location or across
numerous distributed platforms in various locations is another problem that occurs
when adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications, the distributed
ClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability support [67]. However,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
14 of 63
it is frequently necessary to establish effective communication channels between the
distributed ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability
and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another
problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and
unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,
the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control of
network resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot be
avoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated the QoS require-
ments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment to recognize
QoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog) that is
inspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture [69] for
a FogC system.
3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks
A smart city network has the following features [70]:
1.
Large Densities: A smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart
devices are distributed in the area of a city.
2.
Abnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading or synchronization among smart devices produces
extremely bursty or correlated trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from
the regular social-generated trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and
technology used in our society are based.
3.
Disorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless connectivity features,
smart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology. The problem arises
when smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless channels, where packet
losses caused by wireless channel special properties are extremely common and even-
tually have an impact on the functioning of the smart city system. Therefore, it appears
very improbable that a single high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.
4.
Heterogeneity: SCAs use a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,
latency, throughput, and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates
at a unique trade-off threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on
a single platform.
5.
Coexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used in smart
cities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time, independent radio
infrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless channels. Under such
circumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues with competence.
6.
Security and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to several risks from malevolent
users. The majority of specialized smart sensors, actuators, and other intelligent
devices are developed by designers without considering security measures. Such
applications may be highly vulnerable due to hostile actors’ ease of access to these
cutting-edge technologies and potential threats to people’s security and privacy.
The main challenges for smart city networks are as follows [70]:
•
Lack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal
Area Networks (PANs) and the IEEE 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the
concept of single-hop ad-hoc networking. These standards permit direct communi-
cation between two devices that are in the transmission range of each other. At the
same time, the multi-hop ad-hoc networking paradigm enables the communication
between any two devices which are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A
problem that researchers must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of
devices (i.e., actuators, sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly
without any standardization. Global distributors and manufacturers must propose
and accept standardized network solutions that enable communication between di-
verse devices on homogeneous communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
is the dominant solution that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.
This standard deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
15 of 63
power consumption. Several revisions or amendments (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE
802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released. The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment
allows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing data rates and communication ranges
compatible with neighborhood mesh (wide) networks. Then, it is followed by another
cutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances
the method used by devices to access wireless channels while also using time-slotted
channel hopping mode. This hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption
and improved dependability. From another viewpoint, many researchers customized
appropriate upper-layer protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary
modiﬁcations there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-
tructure. Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers
developed numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-
able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],
which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.
•
Interference problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio
space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless channels.
Because of this, the smart application must handle interference problems in such
situations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate and be
compatible with one another.
•
Vertical handover (soft): Multiple radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of
smart devices being developed. These devices should be able to recognize and use the
best interface that is currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.
•
D2D Communications: In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-
mands. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated
messages from heterogeneous devices.
•
Short Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support and recommend
acceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However, smart devices
communicate with one another using short messages (since most of them are tiny
and operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end, short communicating
messages will positively impact network congestion detection and avoidance policies
and promote in-band aggregation.
•
Local Network Trafﬁc Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the
same network infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively
planned, implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc
from these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge
that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc from these
two types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure due to several
intrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional network. Additionally,
D2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce resources than smartphones,
unnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness in the system [74]. Therefore, we
must ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns
generated by smartphones. Understanding trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into
managing and allocating shared network resources more effectively and guarantee
the highest level of service quality for both types of devices.
•
Security mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a remarkable threat to the
security of smart city networks and must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods
have been proposed to solve this problem. Such a statistical method is presented
in [75] that is based on feature distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis
process. Another security mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying
users and devices in a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-
manipulated devices. Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT
systems such as the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation
attack, and the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be
encrypted. However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
16 of 63
be able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for this task. In addition, low
resources and constrained devices can only embed application-speciﬁc integrated
circuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic primitives are not suitable for low-
resource smart devices due to their low computation power, limited battery life, small
size, small memory, and limited power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography
may be an efﬁcient encryption for these devices. Trust management is another security
mechanism that detects and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access
control. Automated and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust
values of the participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management
schemes focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control
methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of smart
things storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated, transparent, and
easy access control management so that different nodes/users can be granted different
levels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain technology can be used to
create secure virtual zones where things can identify and trust each other [77]. Self-
organization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can also be planned to set up the relationship
between Blockchain and IoT, as suggested in [78].
•
Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow through the IoT system
can vary to a great extent, in terms of either format, shape (in time and space), and
semantics. Therefore, the process of separating normal from abnormal sensed data is
extremely demanding. In the context of IoT applications, sensors are the real source
of big data, which suggests that anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful
tool to address the inevitable data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is
concerned with identifying data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected
behavior. This is critical in the process of ﬁnding out important information about
the IoT system’s functioning, detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult
to model or, otherwise, to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to
preventing IoT system failure.
•
Advanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learn-
ing (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the
smart city sectors [80]. These techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-
pletely automated IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of
the big data is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches
can improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase
precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,
person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation
system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving vehi-
cles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques are also used to
precisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data in an urban environment.
In SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned techniques can enhance the
safety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing, management, and power
grid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective use of smart meter big data
for different applications such as load assessment and prediction, baseline estimation,
demand response, load clustering, and malicious data deception attacks. In health
intelligence, extensive use of AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to
high-performance IoT devices, Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These
techniques can play a vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-
lytics for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role of
AI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques can be used
from an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security threats. Notably, the
accuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques can be further enhanced by
increasing the amount of training data to strengthen their learning capabilities and
hence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].

create a system that enables effective communication between several indoor and out-
door devices. Nevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need to 
be improved by the absence of an appropriate interference mechanism. 
 
Figure 3. A taxonomy of technologies facilitating communication and networking for smart cities 
with IoT-enabled application protocols and suggested networking architectures and protocols. 
IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular 
3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards 
and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs. Smart 
home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require 
short-range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth and 
Zigbee) from the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower bandwidth 
requirement, minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication infrastructure 
environment. In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for SCAs that require 
longer-range communication. Such applications are smart transportation management 
systems. 
The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX, can be adopted by 
applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart emergency response 
systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart grid systems. These 
features designed in terms of standards or protocols have enough capability that allows

SCAs involve numerous smart things that operate on low-powered battery devices [83].
New connectivity solutions are being investigated in light of the following question:
do the currently available methods, tools, and techniques—especially those for wireless
networks—allow for the reliable handling of such a large number of smart devices?
Yaqoob et al. [84] provided details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN
technologies such as ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-
munication. In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-
nected devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies
(e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only
partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies and commu-
nication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication perspective.
IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput performance
for fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior context. Due to the
limitations of its initial design, this standard does not support IoT applications. Hence,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

to enable IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah
Task Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create a
system that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor devices.
Nevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need to be improved by
the absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.
IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular
3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards
and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs. Smart
home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require short-
range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth and Zigbee) from
the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower bandwidth requirement,
minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication infrastructure environment.
In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for SCAs that require longer-range
communication. Such applications are smart transportation management systems.
The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX, can be adopted by
applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart emergency response
systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart grid systems. These
features designed in terms of standards or protocols have enough capability that allows for
both synchronous and asynchronous data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can
effectively tolerate latency) allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked
with smart city services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-
tions is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating strict
QoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity [49]. Since IEEE
802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication protocol that often suggests
higher ﬂexibility for small devices running on low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly
increase network lifetime. Moreover, such a protocol encourages and indicates support
for applications and services with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in
WPANs. The authors of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-
gent system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using wireless
emulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment, relatively easier in
expanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due to the use of wireless technology,
which supports the usage of heterogeneous devices in the same implemented and deployed
structure. Furthermore, they emphasized the advantages of employing the same intelligent
infrastructure for a variety of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,
and cost-effectiveness. For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as
water or gas meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established to
target smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering applications.
5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called BDMA and FBMC
multiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case of BDMA multiple access, an
orthogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that resources can be distributed in parallel to
each mobile base station by dividing the antenna beam in accordance with the position of
the mobile stations to enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps
in improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving towards
5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on unique customer
needs. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented 5G cellular networks should
address noteworthy complications that are not successfully addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced
network capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-
sistent user QoE provisioning. In addition, massive and rapid growth in the number of
highly developed connected devices leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a
widening range of applications with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta
and Jha [86] studied numerous facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive
MIMO, trafﬁc and power management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and
organizing networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing
and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days thanks to 5G. 5G

ultimately targets some networking possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-
munications (uRLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type
Communications (mMTC). In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a
variety of networked user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC
aims to manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-
sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for managing
highly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication, base stations, and
edge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely brought about a new
revolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown challenges still are possible in
these cases of communication when 5G is deployed in the context of smart cities. One major
problem is power-efﬁcient communication, especially when communicating low-powered
battery devices such as sensors and other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when
two distinct technologies (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-
level compatibility problems might always persist when communication infrastructures
migrate to next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to
handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach
places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining 5G
networks.

(Legacy) (a/b/g/n)
General features:
It can aid both in an infrastructure-mode and an ad-hoc
manner. These standards are quickly utilized in temporary
and permanent LAN installations and deployments because of
their ﬂexibility and performance. It supports network
management service and asynchronous communication. It
suggests time-constrained delivery services and support for
broadcast and multicast services. Moreover, it offers support
for long-range communication.
Speciﬁc features:
IEEE 802.11a—works on the 5 GHz band, has a lesser
interference level than other devices but has higher
propagation losses compared to the 2.4 GHz band.
IEEE 802.11b—works on the 2.4 GHz band. There may be
interference issues with those devices, which, too, operate on
the 2.4 GHz band. However, it offers a higher capacity and
reachability than the 5 GHz spectrum to get through
obstructions. It can also provide support for the ARS
method [79], which allows an IEEE 802.11b device to
dynamically switch from its theoretical maximum data rate
(11 Mbps) to lower data rates such as 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or
even 1 Mbps if interference rises.
IEEE 802.11g—faster operating speed and generally has better
signal range, being not easily obstructed. The IEEE
802.11g-based devices used OFDM to carry higher data rates
while providing robustness against multipath fading/effects.
However, additional modulation techniques (as shown in
Table 2) are also used to preserve and manage compatibility.
IEEE 802.11n—offers superior performance to its other peer
standards by suggesting modiﬁcations in MIMO, OFDM,
power saving, antenna technology, and wider channel
bandwidth. The IEEE 802.11n-based access point can operate
in Legacy, Mixed, and Greenﬁeld modes [89]. This standard
effectively exploits MIMO to take complete beneﬁt of the

WLANs. It provides numerous QoS scheduling mechanisms
supporting heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as VoIP, voice data
(trafﬁc), video data/streams, and Internet trafﬁc. Moreover, it
has speciﬁc features such as high-speed Internet; a

It provides long-range transmissions and offers robustness
from interferences. The PHY layer of this standard or protocol
modulates the signal in the SUB-GHz ISM band. This
speciﬁcation aims to provide low-power WANs with
capabilities speciﬁcally required to facilitate low-cost mobile
secure bidirectional communication. Additionally, it deﬁnes
the idea of geolocation, which can be quickly applied to enable
GPS-free tracking applications.
It utilizes minimum amounts of power, and hence IoT-based
sensors and actuators can operate for a long time.
Additionally, it manages less bandwidth utilization, making it
their default choice for IoT-based deployments.
The overall architecture (i.e., star) is relatively straightforward
since a LoRaWAN-based GW can be designed to manage
numerous end devices or nodes. It also offers secure
communication between the end device or node and the
application server using the AES-128 encryption standard.

packet switching concept for data communication and circuit
(or optional packet) switching technique for voice

channels by the concept of packetization. Moreover, it is a
low-cost technology that suggests a packet-based radio service.
It offers the capabilities such as a high transfer rate,

It is a 3GPP interface (radio) based on UMTS/HSPA and

Through modifying and proposing novel PHY layer

MNwTs. It can speed up to 3 Gbps download and 1.5 Gbps
upload. Additionally, it has various antenna systems that
simplify switching between cell regions, as well as
cutting-edge transmission techniques that pack more data per

throughput performance at the level of cell boundaries.
Subsequently, it leads to superior performance in terms of
consistent connection and capacity (network) [89,91,92].

networks.
5G (New Radio (NR) Air

This technology addresses signiﬁcant challenges: a massive
and quick increase in highly sophisticated connected devices
contributes to a sharp escalation in network trafﬁc and an
expanding variety of applications with distinct dynamic
demands and features.
Since LTE user equipment is not required to be able to operate
on an NR carrier, NR is designed to be optimized for
performance without taking backward compatibility into
account. Moreover, NR can support operations in licensed
spectrum bands from below 1 GHz to 52.6 GHz with a
spectrum expansion facility.
In the case of mmWave frequencies, excellent capacity and
high data rates are possible. This technology’s ultra-lean
design seeks to decrease interference and improve system
power efﬁciency by effectively reducing always-on
transmissions [93,94].
This technology utilizes sophisticated access procedures such
as Beam Division and FBMC Multiple Access to adapt 4G to
5G networks. Beam Division Multiple Access (BDMA)
schemes’ central design principle is concurrently serving
numerous mobile users. This technique typically uses an
orthogonal beam, which suggests that resources can be
allocated in parallel to each mobile base station by separating
the antenna beam in accordance with the position of the
mobile stations to enable numerous accesses to the base
stations. This subsequently assists in improving the capacity
of 5G networks [79].

In the case of the NLoS

Table 4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features.
Standards (Year Released)
Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *
Target
IEEE 802.11 (1997) (Original)
The standard and its amendments serve as the foundation for
wireless network products bearing the WiFi brand. This signiﬁes
two raw data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps that must be transferred via
DSSS and FHSS at 2.4 GHz in the ISM band.
Wireless Standard (basic)
IEEE 802.11b (1999)
This standard is intended to operate in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;
however, the level of interference issues is higher when this
standard-based device tries to interoperate with many other
devices/standards operating on the same band. It can attain a
theoretical data rate of 11 Mbps. Nevertheless, dynamic
adaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject to the current
interference level and signal power to minimize the error rate (ARS
Policy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates
can be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it
provides somewhat simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading
the current chipsets) as it demonstrates backward compatibility
with the original standard due to the use of CDMA and DSSS (same
as the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor
ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.
WiFi-1
IEEE 802.11a (1999)
Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least
amount of interference compared to other devices. Depending on
the needs, the raw data rates can be changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,
24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps. However, it can
reach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage indoor
and outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].
WiFi-2
IEEE 802.11g (2003)
Allows for device compatibility with devices that operate and
follow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical
transfer rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a
practical data rate of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE
802.11b-based devices are introduced into IEEE 802.11g networks,
or when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate, the
rate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based
transmission speeds every time that the compliant device tries to
communicate [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are
148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.
WiFi-3
IEEE 802.11e (2005)
It speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications
through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed
QoS requirements by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:
(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme and (2) the contention-free
HCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides trafﬁc
prioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to
differentiated services). Conversely, this standard suggests
parameterized QoS (similar to integrated services) via HCCA. It
also speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional IEEE 802.11
power saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95]. It
is designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to
2.4835 GHz or from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes
that a high transmission rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS
requirements imposed by real-time audio, voice, video, and
live-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions of trafﬁc
prioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.

Target
IEEE 802.11n (2009)
This standard was suggested while keeping the increased speed
requirement in mind. Later, it was able to boost the attainable
speeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with 802.11g.
Achieving such high performance required several new features,
including a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,
antenna technology, MIMO, and wider channel bandwidth.
Nonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard has been
signiﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.
Whenever or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts
to communicate with an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g
network, the network’s operation, performance, and other
capabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based APs can
operate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst
802.11a/b/g), Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and
operate on heterogeneous conditions), and Greenﬁeld mode
(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89]. It can
reach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor
and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.
WiFi-4
IEEE 802.11ac (2013)
This standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping
increased speed requirements in mind (likewise with other
standards). This standard was later able to increase the achievable
speeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps (maximum)) of WiFi
networks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard
enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,
live-streaming, and other demanding applications. It operates
using MU-MIMO technology, which enables a single AP and its
antenna to send data concurrently to several devices. As a result,
this helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated
client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally
receives the amount of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending
on the technology used.
WiFi-5
IEEE 802.11ah (2017)
Designed to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz, it can
provide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional
802.11 standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.
This standard can be employed in those scenarios where accessible
bandwidth is comparatively narrow. It can normally apply with
WiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale WSNs (i.e., smart
grid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably large
transmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale
networks where the number of devices may be much greater than
what the conventional 802.11 standard can support. It advises that
changes to the PHY and MAC layers be made to provide important
improvements including energy-saving capabilities, support for
accommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access
techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using
small frame formats [96].
Extended coverage, low-power
WLAN
IEEE 802.11ax (2021)
This standard was proposed with the consideration of higher speed
requirements. Later, this standard increased WiFi network
achievable speeds above what was made possible by earlier
standards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data rate,
consistency, and low power consumption. It operates using
MU-MIMO and MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which
enables a single AP and its antenna to send data concurrently to
several end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard is where
MU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows
for groups of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also
suggests several improvements in spatial reusing policies and
power-saver schemes [97].

4.2. IEEE 802.15.1
The IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave
time division duplex mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a
1 Mbps data rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed
to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth and
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98]. The deployment
of services offered for tracking and localization devices is typically suggested by BLE-based
devices, which are recognized as BLE beacons. These beacons produce a signal that other
compatible devices can pick up between 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises
greater indoor localization accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can
be used for a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch
of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally, to provide
speciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine the BLE technology with
other technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth
Classic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth
Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR). It became the perfect option for the IoT
since it permits connectivity and audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-
distance radio, which lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need
not be connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE
speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous devices
(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected to wearables
in LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends to broadcast data
across 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. Wireless audio streaming is
primarily made possible through BCR, which has evolved into the industry-standard radio
protocol for in-car entertainment systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to
transmit data over 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the
deployment of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support
for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most notably,
mesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution and locating
maps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user localization. Due to BLE’s
greater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial changes in received signal strength,
it has been proven that using BLE is more efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].
However, Bluetooth technology has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly
when its BR/EDR mode is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the
master nodes to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.
The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered a variety
of scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the BR/EDR mode reveals
a lack of scalability that further restricts the performance of the system.
4.3. LoRA
The LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications and operated as a low-
data-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum that could go up to 10 km.
LoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth: 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while
this technology can function at the largest bandwidth class, which further improves data
rate, it still causes issues with high power consumption, a shorter communication range,
and an increase in the likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider
frequency spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation
and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission range
will expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption will rise
as well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby making it resilient to
channel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not differentiate the noise in the channel
such as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes
signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology
to sense, perceive, and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
26 of 63
architecture uses a star network topology and includes gateways and end nodes. In this
design, end nodes are referred to as slaves and run on battery-powered devices with
limited power, but gateways are thought of as powerful machines that gather data from
slave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN is a communication layer that operates on top of
LoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability
and suitability for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over
cellular technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,
LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept of
a specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types to meet
the needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet ﬁltering, and
packet scheduling are all made possible using specialized network servers. LoRaWAN
has also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission power and rate, which
aids in optimizing network performance in terms of power consumption and throughput.
This technology can be employed for a wide range of applications, such as smart health
nursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105], agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],
and smart grid applications [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-
sensitive applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al. [109]
and Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart metering,
tracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time, it is not so feasible for
real-time monitoring and video surveillance.
4.4. WiMAX
WiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60 Mbps for an
entire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely uplink operation, based on
the original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-
ment [112]. It can be done using two antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.
Additionally, it may provide support for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-
teristics and wide area mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety
of QoS scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet data
trafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video streams [113].
Table 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational parameters [114].
This standard provides a communication channel between geographically separated de-
vices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges between 30 km and
100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as high installation costs
and the possibility of complications and irregularities when dealing with high-deﬁnition
multimedia trafﬁc.
Wireless network trafﬁc has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-
liferation of smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with
smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices, are
the most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In such a dense
network environment, interference is a critical issue that must be addressed if satisfactory
performance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency reuse is required. Subsequently, the
standards IEEE 802.11 were designed and implemented to support these requirements.
Numerous international organizations, including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved
their technologies in response to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,
the original IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior
throughput performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as a
result, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a result, to address
the challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah Task Group (TG) was formed by
the IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to redesign and extend the applicability
of WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They focused on the critical issue of power-aware
efﬁcient schemes and protocols to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based
networks while dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and
indoor devices [55,97].

4.5. Challenges in IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite
In IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique features such as
constrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the need for facilitating real-time
requirements of smart applications; extremely vulnerable radio environments; and little to
no human involvement after deployment [115]. By enabling communication amongst these
devices utilizing low-power-cost technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart
services has been formed. Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might
provide a solution and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication
scenarios. Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,
designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the best way
to install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally use the system’s limited
resources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of such power constraints, researchers
highlighted the requirements of low-power Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)
and low-power WiFi usage. In contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies
operate with smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission
speeds. IoT network protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining
the ideal MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless
networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies. This
vulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:
(1)
The current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it relies on
a multi-link subnet prototype) at all.
(2)
In mesh communication, the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are
quite expensive, power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely
power constrained. Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.
(3)
Unicasting is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while
forwarding and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,
idle nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-
ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,
reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful
delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective
coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].
(4)
There is a high requirement for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-
cation to take place over mesh architectural systems.
(5)
For many IoT applications requiring data prioritizing and customized control, original
TCP-suited features such as those operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)
that further lead to silly window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure
dependability, are unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard
Internet protocols such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize
protocol overheads that impair the computing ability and memory management of
these specialized resource-constrained devices.
WiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling support, which helps estab-
lish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart IoT devices. In smart home wireless
networks, this form of connectivity can be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP
protocol suite supports dependable data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-
tain network throughput performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been
regularly modiﬁed and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of
byte-stream in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency
needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP protocol
suite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns adequately [119].
There are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with an IoT application:
(1)
TCP connection establishment and termination (three-way handshaking) incur signiﬁ-
cant overhead in the system as most communication in an IoT application includes
the transmission of brief segments and relatively little data.
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
29 of 63
(2)
TCP functionality needs resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-
nections in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected
devices switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].
(3)
Some IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,
and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead in the
entire IoT system and high-power consumption.
(4)
Some IoT services have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in
the form of connection establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the
entire MSS) is completely unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to
provide much support for these IoT services.
(5)
IoT applications that rely on wireless communication scenarios must deal with crit-
ical wireless channel characteristics such as channel error, interference, and wire-
less interface properties that result in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer
contention-induced, and collision-induced packet losses. When TCP operates in such
a setting, its stringent in-order delivery requirements and retransmission policies
(i.e., fast retransmission) may occasionally result in very serious system problems
such as Head-of-Line (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in
a reduction in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].
Furthermore, wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-
ther impair TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP
Retransmission Time Out timer.
Some standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement Layer-4
functionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed to utilize UDP as an
underlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should depend on an application’s
requirements, which may vary from application to application. However, TCP and its
updated variants rely on the concept of data delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-
missions from an already created copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only
approach to dealing with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to
accept packet delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-
tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution. Additionally,
retransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should handle this retransmission
rather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data
bits, doing so enables the source application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations
where real-time services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit
fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the initial loss [126].
Clark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and subsequently introduced the
concept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself
brings the idea of employing ALF into the system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,
a network can recognize individual Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently
can offer support for ﬂexible Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission
procedures for diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using
in-network caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding
any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails to provide
support for the ALF scheme [119].
4.6. Compound TCP for IoT
Compound TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel
utilization and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with
WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].
Pokhrel and Williamson [115] studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an
IoT scenario involving sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home
appliances). They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-
nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks in the
presence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded transmission
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
30 of 63
channel circumstances. The authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements
for all IoT devices as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-
hungry Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a
thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical
devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly
deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested models
that aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of several concurrently
running competitive long-lived compound TCP connections. In evaluating and developing
these models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions, link-layer contention, channel
failures, and collision. The authors of [130] utilized a transient model suggesting a new
queue management scheme to capture the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most
workable ﬂows in IoT scenarios) over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.
However, the performance of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using
a single shared Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and
provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when wireless
channels are often reused by several APs [131].
4.7. Viewpoints of Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems
The network architectures for IoT are heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless
Mesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks
(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing
devices, survivability and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A
WSN is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and military
applications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which the sensor nodes
communicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered, low-power sensors
capable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating, and regulating communication.
Numerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2, TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have
been suggested. Therefore, some standards were introduced to enable interaction and
other compatibilities among these numerous heterogeneous platforms. For example, the
IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide
critical functionalities for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated
End Devices (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be
considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes. Due
to the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be obtained from the
viewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability issue, various works
suggested a standardized arrangement that could enable the usage of IP over LoWPAN.
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability for Low power and Lossy
Networks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard outlines the physical and data link
layers of the network and offers a low-cost framework for network operations. To link
LPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors
to implement an IP stack and become approachable by other conventional devices over
the Internet. This adaptability layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables
a variety of applications and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding
algorithms at the Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot
be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72] considers
the LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained, and they are
connected by some lossy links that only support low data rates. These links are thought
to be extremely unstable and have poor performance in terms of packet delivery rates. In
such specialized networks, the trafﬁc patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint
(MP2MP) rather than just P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.
This makes the implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,
numerous existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and
AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing
and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult due to the
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

mobility aspect and the resource limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’
design principles emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end
latency [134,135]. The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations
take into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the node
energy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and maintain solely
inside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible. However, the interoperability
of these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when such networks are integrated with
IoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration with IoT needs novel routing policies
that support scalability and assure QoS, fairness, and connectivity between two nodes
(both in APs and ad-hoc networks) with the least amount of power consumption. The
standard classical forwarding strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of
devices/nodes. In the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest
enough fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate with
nearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions are followed
to decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers have often raised
concerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which lead to the consumption of
excess energy in networks while taking into account mobile and static ad-hoc network
scenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood of frequent network disconnections,
route failures, and even network partitioning, all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant
MAC-level and routing-level overhead problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the
high-power consumption problem, many researchers presented numerous smart routing
paradigms [118,134,135,137]. Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the
desired QoS.
Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion
control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless channel
attributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas. These designs provide
support for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely variable channel parameters
at lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing and Transport layers to further
optimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations decisions [121,134,135,138–140].
The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) indicates how well a device can hear a
signal from an AP or router. A network layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the
RSSI (accessible through lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR
are examples of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding
systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing mecha-
nisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and link disjoint paths
while discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes do not shed light and discuss
anything related to performance issues when there is a signiﬁcant level of interference in
the network because of trafﬁc running parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned
techniques do not always perform well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.
Recently, the scheme [140] considered different critical factors such as interference level,
link-layer contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to
wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution policies’
efﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless, different possible
disjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might be able to interfere
with one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting behavior in wireless
communication. Consequently, such separate disconnected pathways could be utilized to
enhance the performance of the network as a whole [138,140].
When employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend on WSN-based
networking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from smart things to sink
nodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes (IoT-GW). To balance
energy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous such static and mobile IoT-GWs
can be deployed in the system. In the whole system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous
types of critical data, are connected to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed
three forms of devices: Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
32 of 63
three forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh. Moreover, the Zigbee stack
embraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the case of star network topology, the
Reduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e., RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the
PAN central coordinator only. They are not capable of communicating with one another.
Here, the PAN coordinator may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on
low-powered limited battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,
any device can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this
topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and FFDs.
Furthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of the integrated
forwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing procedures. Lastly,
the tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of mesh networking topology, consisting
of RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators). However, the FFD count could be
more than the RFD count in the network. RFDs may attach to tree (cluster) network
topology as the end nodes in the system. The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization
functionalities to other connected coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single
PAN coordinator amongst these coordinators [144].
4.8. IoT Application Protocols
Each IoT application is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.
These protocols can be the following:
•
Representational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is
the primary client/server protocol that adopts the request/response model. HTPP has
been related to the REST architecture [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar
entities over web-based services. The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices
to make their status readily available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,
update, delete) functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,
PUT, and DELETE techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build
a REST model for dissimilar IoT devices [148].
•
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately
standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT
devices for IP-based, HTTP-like interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-
sages to set up reliable communication based on a request/response interaction. It has
reduced complexity, and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications
and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.
•
Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is established for IoT messaging.
According to MQTT design principles, network bandwidth and device resource re-
quirements should be kept to a minimum while also aiming to assure dependability
and some level of delivery assurance. Since June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by
ISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The protocol continues to progress by formalizing
popular capability options and adding new functionalities. The most recent version,
MQTT v5.0, was released in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe
paradigm. Clients connect to a centralized broker when using MQTT.
•
Open Platform Communications Uniﬁed Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-
ability standard is used for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial
automation domain and other industries. It is platform independent and ensures
the seamless ﬂow of information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-
ports two different communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as
Publish/Subscribe (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-
quirements from the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main
IoT vendors including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage
secure, standardized information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on
OPC UA.
•
Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is
based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
33 of 63
it can implement both request/response and publish/subscribe methods by using
suitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant messages between clients, and this
happens in real-time using a push mechanism to avoid increasing unnecessary network
loads. XMPP also determines the state of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.
•
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing
business messages between applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-
tems, feeds business processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits
onward the instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-
lish/subscribe interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of
message orientation; queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.
•
Data Distribution Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management
Group (OMG). DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-
performance, interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.
DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability in publish–
subscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs of various
IoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed using DDS. Such
applications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and
smart grid management.
Lastly, Glaroudis et al. [155] provided a comparison among IoT application protocols
in terms of well-accepted key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the
framework of smart farming.
5. Networking Architectures and Protocols
5.1. Generic Architectures
Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-
gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of an IoT
island as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT, two methods provide
data access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying multi-hop mesh networks with
short-range communication among network nodes using unlicensed frequency. The second
involves using licensed frequency band long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).
Centenaro et al. [156] presented a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-
less connectivity) called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based
on a star topology characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in
the unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide
connectivity in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed
the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,
and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled SCA
that uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled street
lighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental research
facility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander supports testing
proposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic setting at an appropriate
scale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana
and Dohler [159] reviewed currently used smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data
loggers, wireless modems, and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-
ment use cases, i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount
of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways
cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control model for
M2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into delay-sensitive
and delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant requests by routing them into
one low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the number of requests from various devices
to the access point in the IoT for smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up
architecture after analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four
layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates
security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the bottom of the
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
34 of 63
architecture, collects data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above
the sensing layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the
transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer
performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable
information that various applications use at the application layer to provide services.
The majority of the above works mainly focus on a single characteristic, such as quality
of service [162].
Marques et al. [163] proposed a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure
management architecture that allows the integration of physical objects, communication
infrastructure, cloud platform, and IoT-based services in a pervasive way. This architecture
(Figure 4) is generic and includes four layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication,
(3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.

data management layer. The data management layer performs data fusion, data analysis, 
data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable information that various applications 
use at the application layer to provide services.

The Physical Objects Layer enables IoT sensors to collect data that will feed the smart 
city architecture with information used to offer services. After the sensors collect 
data, a Communication Device is used to collect sensor data. A communication de-
vice can implement different technologies (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sen-
sor data are processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Pro-

are processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing unit
responsible for gathering information used by the application providing a service.
The local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as it pushes part of the
computation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating all the computation in
a centralized remote server.
2.
The Communication Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access
technologies. The communication layer supports the implementation of various
wireless technologies. The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer
deﬁnes the technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using
the interface of a network access point.
3.
The Cloud Platform Layer provides three services: processing, database queries, and
data storage. In the context of providing services for smart cities, each of these services
can be dynamically allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,
only some applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.
This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation
is optional.
4.
The Services Layer implements four groups, which are called classes of services:
(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III) Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-
nology. In each class, different kinds of applications can be implemented to deal with
the challenges of smart cities.
This architecture is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer
support to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-
tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to a waste
management scenario.
Another multi-level smart city architecture [164] was built on semantic web technolo-
gies, and its design is mostly used in smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data
collection, data processing, integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make
up its four layers. Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]
suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects privacy.
Saadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile object authentication in the
context of IoT smart cities. Their architecture is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-
archical elliptic curve identity-based signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]
presented a Fog-based smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network
(FOCAN). To reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with
various capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating
on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through the smart
city environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT device can deliver
services effectively and with less energy consumption.
5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures
Software-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-
cient network conﬁguration to enhance a network. SDN can provide many advantages
for conﬁguring city networks to support different applications. For example, SDN can
improve the QoS of city networks against link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-
mands [170]. While some efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there
is room for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN
for efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri et al. [171]
considered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN, and IoT technologies and
reviewed different frameworks and platforms.
Liu et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications
from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers manage
physical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission, and processing services
to develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173] proposed a scalable SDN-enabled
architecture that integrates a variety of smart city components and provides reliable and
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
36 of 63
timely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services. They also studied
the time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under this architecture
and proposed a heuristic with an intelligent scheme that can maximize the throughput and
schedule the multi-ﬂow transfer dynamically.
IoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy
threats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative and intelligent-network-based in-
trusion detection system (NIDS) architecture, namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT
networks. SeArch is a security architecture in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS
nodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS, and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration
among nodes.
Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy in smart
cities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network architecture for the
smart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN and Blockchain technologies. To
achieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations, their architecture is divided into
core and edge networks. By designing a hybrid architecture, their architecture inherits
the strength of centralized and distributed network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]
is a Blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data
sharing in a smart city environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting
the blockchain network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved
businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto, smart
energy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain access control rules
that regulate who has access to the users’ data within a channel. In addition, private
data gathering and encryption are used to further isolate and safeguard the data within
a channel.
Islam et al. [178] designed a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT
ecosystem that addresses the existing challenges through the use of the technologies
Blockchain, SDN, and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-
ture confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,
and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.
5.3. Architectures for Smart Grid
The automated and intelligent management of the next-generation electric power
systems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart Grid (SG) is the name given to
the next generation of electricity systems, which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts
over the current systems in terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-
ability, and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies
to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric
devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate their local
devices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented by using the electrical and
communication infrastructures that connect the transmission and customer domains. The
distribution domain includes distribution feeders and transformers to supply electricity.
It interacts with much different equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),
plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with
communication capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity
to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality electricity,
the stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.
Typical applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic
meter reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.
DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution system.
Distributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination of renewable
and non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar panels, wind turbines,
combustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems, etc., are a few examples of DER.
An electric power system with one or more DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

The communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities of the
smart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure connects a huge
number of electric devices and manages complex device communications. As a result, it is
built in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected individual sub-networks, and each
sub-network is responsible for separate geographical regions. The extremely dispersed
smaller area networks that support the power systems at various locations are connected by
WANs, which act as the communication’s backbone. When the control centers are located a
great distance from the substations or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at
the electric devices are transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the
opposite direction, the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control
centers to the electric devices.
The authors of [43] present a communication architecture in an SG. This architecture
includes (1) an energy smart house with electric appliances connected to the smart grid,
(2) a residential complex with AMI, (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,
(4) a PEV charging station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this
architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed sub-
networks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication network
standards that have been established for smart grids and should be considered in planning
and implementing new infrastructures. Such standards are IEC 61850 for substation
automation. This standard is based on open architecture and incorporates sampling
and timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].
Notably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a precision clock synchronization protocol for
networked measurement and control systems [182].
Due to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs) throughout the
power grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution networks in smart grids would
undergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the
most part, the low-voltage distribution networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be
attached are not monitored by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-
quisition (SCADA) systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,
Abdrabou [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse
structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage distribu-
tion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also presented as a useful
method for prioritizing data transfer across the newly introduced network architecture.
HetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method
for power distribution grid applications. It delivers QoS assurances across the network
while taking into account three factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors
created two components to accomplish this:
•
A multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical applications for their high-
reliability requirements by using end-to-end physically disjoint paths, and
•
Altruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing mechanism that targets communi-
cation with QoS guarantees for applications with strict QoS requirements.
The ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay network architecture enables ex-
tremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware communication in heterogeneous networks.
The major characteristics that set SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are
the ability to execute two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time
pricing. The present SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to
be protocol independent. Therefore, global communication network management and
monitoring approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network
administrators may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane
from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication
networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency
and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and protocols
by virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity capabilities to
cope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185] presented SDN-based
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
38 of 63
SGC architectures, along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-
based SGC and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to
SDN-based SGC.
Alam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication networks in
terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies, and applications.
They proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication Network for Smart Grid.
CR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can quickly reconﬁgure its operating
parameters, such as modulation/demodulation, compression algorithm, and error coding
techniques, according to changing circumstances and requirements, through cognition. In
such an SDR platform, radio transceivers can switch functions and operations on demand
only. Molokomme et al. [187] reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various
and strict QoS requirements in SG communication systems.
Wireless communication networks have been motivated to harvest energy from
ambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic and ecological beneﬁts
through improvements in the smart power grid and the advocacy of “green communica-
tions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments in energy harvesting, redistribution,
trade, and planning for future wireless networks integrating with smart grids. The authors
considered the optimization of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-
tional models of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how
to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for energy
under dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way energy
trading using smart grids.
From a different viewpoint, including IoT devices and providing connectivity, au-
tomation, and monitoring for such devices enables SG systems to sustain multiple network
operations during the generation, distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.
Numerous IoT-aided SG systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on
IoT-aided SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.
5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings
There are various building applications such as heating, cooling, load control, air
quality, ventilation, lighting, water management, and cooking gas management. A smart
building incorporates the major building systems on a common network and functionality
to provide operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture
(SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,
air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation
and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management); a
smart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart building [190]
has security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality system, a ﬁre alarm system, a
water management system, and an energy management system. Moreover, it can detect
intrusion and supports HVAC services.
Diverse SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication
technologies. Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-
vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices driven
through IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings. Tradi-
tionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking protocols and
cabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex and highly infeasible
from both a deployment and a system administration standpoint [191]. SBAs entail making

application’s, service’s, or provision’s operational steps while also boosting the well-being
of its users. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers should pay attention to several
crucial issues, such as reliable communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient
measures, competent security measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-
ics procedures. Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)
technologies to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN

deployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-
puting paradigms; big data engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction
procedures [192]. The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-
edness of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical
entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology
have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies for
a particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including heterogeneity
of IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols and architectures, power
efﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One solution is the SDN paradigm, which
manages the network more efﬁciently than a customary one. SDN also assists network
services, including storage, routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,
these simpliﬁcations offer a creative environment through the implementation of proper
software tools for smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-
telligent infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation
and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based on
SDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves critical SB
parameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency, security, and reliability.
Silva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT) SBA that is integrated with the repre-
sentational state transfer (RESTful) application programming interface (API). The RESTful
API employs HTTP requests (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT
data. Regarding network performance and smart building power management, the authors
showed how their recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.
Smart sensing devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or
modifying vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These
functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties. These sys-
tems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms, power, and transceiver
modules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based SBAs for assessing and regulat-
ing air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre detection systems, power management, and
other basic building operations.
An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for
monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing
system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature, and
relative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198]. Con-
sidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed in the
literature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system to satisfy the users’
needs. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption reduction via energy-efﬁcient
smart lighting systems. Today’s smart building employs low-power usage LED-based
light sources that last longer than Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the
development of control technologies, heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems
has made it promising to create smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively
address the problem of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by
integrating different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved
energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user satisfac-
tion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors, as opposed to a
single expensive sensor, would result in improved performance and higher power savings.
Considering the same motivation, various authors [202–204] have suggested similar types
of smart lighting systems for several room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],
the authors provide a deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing
on power savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration of
visible light communication technology [206].
Recently, researchers focused on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-
mance and thermal comfort, to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented
Technologies (OOT) have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal
comfort while conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
40 of 63
drawbacks of the automatic control used today. In practice, thermal comfort analysis is
based on parallel objective and subjective evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises
monitoring, assessing, and recording the status of environmental parameters through dedi-
cated sensors and instruments following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation
involves monitoring, assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and
thermal environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative
method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].
Green building refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to
predetermined circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes
full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently
allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence concept aims
to conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of them to offer comfort to the
occupants. Through unconventional energy sources, it also meets some of the conventional
energy requirements [207]. Many aspects of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and
power efﬁciency, are the subject of extensive study. However, one of the most important
functions of an SB system is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by
HVAC systems [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial
buildings for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for this
context. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of rated fan energy
can be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect on a building’s indoor
temperature. The method of computational control for passive and active sources was
used in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized the problem that the ambient and
active sources of lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and shading are not synchronized
in buildings. Such a computational control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power
usage. Similarly, numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been
proposed with respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.
An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes
when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-
tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed
times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed spaces)
than outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved along with that of the
external surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).
The basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal
conditioning circuit, a small amount of external memory, and a communication module
that is typically wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can
detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and O3, as
well as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and temperature. These
sensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values of the real-time indoor air quality
parameters and an external memory used to store real-time data [214]. When deploying
such systems, various communication (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and
LoRAWAN technologies, are considered.

Figure 6 shows an SBA architecture [217]. The system of this architecture collects 
vital information about the various air quality parameters, including CO2, CO, particles 
(Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial parameters such as hu-
midity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the authors created 
a method for collecting and monitoring the indoor atmosphere. For monitoring CO2 and 
CO parameters, they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas sensors. These sensors usually 
work using the resistive heating principle. The TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity 
to fluctuations in CO gas concentration. This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is in-
versely proportionate to the amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the IR falls. 
While TGS 4161 also offers low power consumption and suggests better performance in 
detecting changes in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is ideally suited for indoor air 
control applications as it can measure 350–10,000 ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used 
the DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol laser photometer that simultaneously measures 
mass and size fraction, for PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create an 
interface to the deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol data, this 
photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors also set up ZB 
(ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which sent updates on the air 
quality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that had already been set up.

tor of smart cities is impacted by the Internet of Energy (IoE), which aims to increase en-
ergy efficiency, prevent energy waste, and enhance environmental conditions by inte-

regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart cities, starting with 
existing structures. To achieve energy efficiency, the authors suggested a smart building

problems that must be resolved through extensive research for BI to fully incorporate IoT.
The authors contend that IoT in BI is still not operationally capable. IoT and BI stakeholders
must make a concerted effort to give modern BI access to a generic IoT framework with
cognitive intelligence and context-aware computing capabilities.
5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring
Retroﬁtting the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some
beneﬁts, including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].
For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert utilities
to pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network, allowing them to remotely
adjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224]. Automation can be used for both
operational procedures and components that provide functionality. For instance, when a
water problem occurs during operation or with the element itself, the smart components
inform the system center and then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also
determine a sensor’s requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic
self-veriﬁcation mechanism [225].
In [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid architecture that includes
technical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework. Moreover, this smart water
system (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms, simulation procedures, diag-
nostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-
porates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance is deﬁned by online procedures such
as online data monitoring, online data assimilation, online modeling, online charting,
and online results output. An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the
necessary smart features [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-
ter systems that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time
controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system output,
should be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered that using SCADA
would considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229]. A smart water architec-
ture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;
(3) the communication layer; (4) the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.
Within the framework of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system
that allows for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a
user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are saved
and processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and the individual user level.
Meanwhile, the processed data are returned to the Water Utility and can be used for billing.
On the other hand, they provide regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness
of their consumption behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework
based on FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-
ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of various
FIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis et al. [232]
considered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding conventional water
metering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted bi-directional (whenever re-
quired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices, metering equipment, and end-users.
The authors’ ultimate objective is to design, implement, and deploy more sophisticated
infrastructure offering improved performance in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit
the amount of data that needs to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-
proach makes use of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water
grid model.
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the Efﬁcient
Water Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission under the
auspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the Smart Water project is
to examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively managing urban water systems,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
44 of 63
with a focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related
decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues such as
leakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth. Kulkarni
and Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity, proposed
a framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost of ownership, and
highlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’ Smart Water case studies.
Pipelines are used to transport water, gases, and oil. Since they are frequently under-
ground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes them, which may result in leaks. In addition,
water in the pipelines may get contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are
mistakenly or purposely introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline
networks is crucial for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-
sor node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline
network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection time.
The sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s junctions [234].
Given the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor node deployment challenges
are therefore formulated as integer optimization problems, where the integer variables
represent the maximum amount of sensor nodes that must be placed at each junction. The
deployment difﬁculties for pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve
because of the integer decision variables.
Pipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,
the sensing performance of a deployed sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern
is taken into account in [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to
decide how to deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious
contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a branch
and bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify the ideal answer,
the time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that large pipeline networks cannot
be used with the method. Similarly, the study in [236] considers the various demand
patterns of water ﬂows through pipes. The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the
best deployment locations to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand
patterns. The global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.
The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.
Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.
Singapore’s WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate
burst incidents [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline
leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure. To
reduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track water
consumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System [240] has been
created to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks and bottlenecks. With the
aid of all these technologies, the investigators had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency
of the monitoring algorithms. However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we
still need to put innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and
mobile WSN into place.
5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation
The Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion
and accidents. It also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities
that may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the two
technologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that compose
vehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and mobile network.
VANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication. Providing remote loca-
tion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information services is referred to as an
onboard information service. Every car can be utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks
to mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
45 of 63
(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people and vehicles, as well as between
vehicles and the environment, infrastructure, or other vehicles.
Vehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and inter-vehicle communica-
tion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible layered architecture to handle
characteristics such as interoperability, scalability, dependability, and modularity. Recently,
the research community proposed efﬁcient vehicle network architectures. For example,
the Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and
choosing messaging protocols are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-
cessing, big data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia
and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s ClCom and
cloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms, infrastructure, and
software services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication layer and the intra–inter
devices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity of many heterogeneous objects
and networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter devices layer in classical architecture. The
UIoV system’s physical objects layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter
devices layer for additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are
identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.
Liu et al. [242] suggested another IoV network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of
application management while enhancing the scalability and dependability of information
services. This architecture has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety
of nodes with various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV
is frequently changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-
mitted at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,
the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,
communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road safety
management and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible for schedul-
ing the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and interacting with the application
layer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture design is dealing with diverse networks.
Interoperability, scalability, dependability, and adaptability are some of its network features.
The design seeks to increase layer separation and network architecture’s total number of
layers. In addition to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate
the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.
By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning ability
of autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both physical and network
data space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) paradigm [243] improves network
security and transportation safety. CIoV enables IoV to bear more accurate perceptive
ability through cognition in the intra-vehicle network (driver, passengers, smart devices,
etc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network
(road environment, cellular network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture
includes a cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of
data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition
investigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture of CIoV. The gathering
and preprocessing of big data from several sources are done by the sensing layer. As
opposed to the previous communication layer (of other architectures), the architecture’s
communication layer uses a cloud/edge hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-
tion schedules. The data cognition engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets
heterogeneous data streams (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety
of cognitive analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in
charge of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies such
as NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There are primar-
ily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application services and intelligent
transportation applications).
Efﬁcient message authentication and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-
vacy and safeguard vehicular communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490

in the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats, Karim [244] provided
a cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes a data encryption and de-
cryption mechanism based on attributes and identity that has the lowest computational
overhead while keeping the optimum level of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]
suggested a seven-layer network architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-
mation exchange between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units
(RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing
and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data before
sending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission. Making
choices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities of control and
management. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing layer to create
the pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop assaults, the security layer
directly manages each of the layers above. A unique network architecture with enhanced
throughput, reduced latency, higher security, and widespread connectivity was recently
proposed by Ji et al. [246]. This architecture consists of four layers:
1.
Security authentication layer: The RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment
data in real-time after setting several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This
layer determines the legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.
Perhaps an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt
to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.
2.
Data acquisition layer: This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from
various networks. To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it
digitizes the data.
3.
Edge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result, processing and
analyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant delays. As a result, we
must process data more closely related to the data source. The edge node, a physical
device situated closest to the data source, is used by the edge layer to carry out basic
processing and analysis on the acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings
for nearby trafﬁc incidents and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a
local decision-making plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud
data center’s computing power.
4.
Cloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the information it has collected
about global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan, and rationally distributes trafﬁc
resources. This layer, having the ability to implement connection management, data
management, aided autonomous driving, intelligent navigation, path planning, and
information security, is the “smart brain” of the IoV.
A blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN) for the smart city was
presented in [247]. Building innovative distributed transport management systems is made
possible by the robust and secure Block-VN architecture. The authors considered how the
network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-
tion. To handle real-time transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing
transportation data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four
layers: data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application. Each
layer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the data processing
layer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing the suggested event and
decision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249], the data are made available
to a smart community member. The suggested approach was examined using transporta-
tion datasets from some reliable sources. The outcomes demonstrate data processing and
real-time distribution to citizens in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop
environment produces ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social
IoV (SIoV) are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes
share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable with
traditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware communication

architecture for social IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and
inter-vehicle communication architecture for SIoVs.
5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart Villages
The smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities using IoT
technologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried out, including smart
agriculture, waste management, irrigation management, livestock management, smart
energy, smart healthcare, and smart education. A smart village or smart rural area can
enable real-time data analytics and automate decision-making for local villagers regard-
ing healthcare, agriculture, environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a
smart city as there are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)
between urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-
pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to interfere
ICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning of “smart” in
rural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European Commission-funded
Smart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal of encouraging and motivat-
ing communities to create and execute smart village methods and tactics throughout
Europe as a tool for rural development, serving as the authors’ primary source. IEEE
Smart Village [256] also supports the world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-
viding a complete solution combining renewable energy, community-based education, and
entrepreneurial opportunities.
Malik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart villages with different
technologies. They concluded that digitization is only possible if a reliable and robust net-
work and communication infrastructure are installed in the village environment. Shrestha
and Drozdenko [258] proposed a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate
change using IoT and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University
campus. Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-
ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It consists of
the following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud Services, and a Web
Dashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into meaningful information from
which public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to or frustrate the effects of climate change.
Monzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural
system for gathering and processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional
communication coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in
separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Their
proposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs of the system in the
collection of IoT data from these remote rural areas, its coverage by space vehicles, and its
processing and storage through 5G terrestrial networks and cloud services. Their proposal
includes the deployment of IoT sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.
Conversely, the part of the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for
different space channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural
system that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet. To
provide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored the integration
of a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with IoT in improving security
and privacy solutions for villagers and consumer electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,
the authors designed and evaluated the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
in a DFC-based smart village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues
and challenges regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed
a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints in a smart
village. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge computing as applicable
to reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural facilities. Collaboration occurs
between the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g., the edge data centers or edge routers) for data
processing and storage. For example, in times of high computational load demand, one
village’s edge devices can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.

6. Summary
•
Various SCAs have different network requirements such as bandwidth, delay toler-
ance, power consumption, reliability, wireless connectivity, mobility, security, and
privacy. Therefore, they need different protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network
architectures for IoT are heterogeneous and include various network technologies such
as WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile
Communication Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these
architectures must allow interoperability, while cross-layer design-based recommen-
dations for power consumption and congestion control are well-suited proposals.
•
State-of-the-art generic network architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm
and are based on FogC to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.
•
Fog and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the
future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication
methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency. The
CR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this technology can
quickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication system to the
changing requirements through cognition.
•
By extracting usable data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible
to increase network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures
will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines that
will conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g., driving behavior
model analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.
•
The networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of smart
buildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been facing some
challenges such as network management in terms of maintenance, east–west interface,
southbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based SDN networking for SB,
and the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.
7. Open Research Issues
−Network slicing management is required: IoT services such as smart transportation and
smart energy have diversiﬁed requirements. To accommodate diverse IoT services, the
network slicing paradigm is suggested because it enables multiple independent logical
networks running on the same physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented
an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)
focusing on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory). The
authors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management
in this ﬁeld.
−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation
Group proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions that were before performed
by some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the ﬂexible provisioning of software-
based network functionalities on top of an appropriately shared physical infrastructure by
separating the network functions from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing
inexpensive commodity servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with
administering and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is
used in conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome
the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic resource
management [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service environment through
NFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll
a new service request is avoided. In conjunction with the use of SDN, NFV also allows
real-time and dynamic function provisioning along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The
SDN-IoT network may be improved and secured with NVF. It enables the software-based
deployment of network devices as virtualized components. Throughput is increased
because of NFV integration in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.
To this end, Sinh et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
49 of 63
SDN controller applications to show that SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.
Recently, Mukherjee et al. [265] proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV
implementation for smart cities.
−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology can address the
bandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can be enabled with cognitive
functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing, circumstantial
perceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs and services can be based on CR technology
because it can do dynamic sensing and cognition of the surrounding environment. For
example, in smart grid applications, cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling
users to know their energy consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-
plications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network
interference [268]. At the same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-
toring over longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum
availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in IoT demands
extensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware design, privacy
protection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility problems, etc. [270].
For this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures must be proposed to
solve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271] suggested a CIoT-based smart city
network architecture that outlines how data collected from SCAs may be analyzed using
the CogC paradigm and manage the scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.
−Challenges in IoT communication through TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access
Points (APs) can utilize identical WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-
ence problems that can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many
APs can provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with
the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY
layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the capacity
of WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations. As a result, it
is possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to the number of antennas on APs.
Thus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel and Singh [131] stressed the employment
of CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods with many APs to improve the Compound
TCP’s performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate
the learning processes of the transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training
data are dispersed across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-
atively slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized
model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to coordinate
numerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel characteristics and
WiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use of FL and CR approaches in
dual AP settings, it is now possible to improve the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.
Another study [274] assumed TCP Cubic [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the
FL approach for IoVs. The authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL
technique, which enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.
−Digital Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-
dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital twin technology
can be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans, IoT devices, aircraft en-
gines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original vehicle is created, for instance, when
an automobile business creates a virtual representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car
model. If a manufacturer creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the
replicated process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle of
the actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this virtual graphic, the
dynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation are depicted. The digital twin
can offer the location, state, and/or status of physical assets in real-time due to continual
learning and advancements. This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations
to monitor systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital twins
are created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure graphs,
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
50 of 63
AI, software analytics, and the IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is
demonstrated. This technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to
the optimization of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting
them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize. If a digital twin
is in place, government organizations can only fully assess what might be achieved with
the data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic opportunity, and establish a more cohesive
community. Although the idea is currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few
years [277].
−The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense and
AI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc is estimated in
the future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted to the concept of Internet of
Everything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart cities should have a huge bandwidth, low
latency, and AI integration. Such networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and
on-demand content for thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the
problem-solving network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is
under development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data
networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular networks,
in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas (cells). It is expected that
6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,
together with new infrastructure. The network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:
(1) ultra-fast data rates as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased
mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects; (5) peak
spectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability; and (7) improved network
security [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is that transmitting at a higher frequency
spectrum is prone to high path loss, making the distance for transmission limited [280].
The expected 6G of the radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the
capability of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability of
carrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks, such as short-
range and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can introduce complications
and hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore, such complications of THz waves
must be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric multilayer physical network architectures of 6G
must be proposed for futuristic smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations
from a network of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed
a conceptual terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a
scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart cities. It
provides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to run AI applications
partially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore, the distributed and edge
computing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides security and reduces trafﬁc load on
the upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly, pervasive AI is the main enabling technology
in 6G, while some forms of AI are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of
using AI on wireless communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs
(e.g., channel estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control
and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell and
topology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc. However,
DL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might not ﬁt in current
mobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN)-based
RL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease the computational resources required
on these devices [282]. Quantum communication [283] offers a promising approach to
avoiding the challenge of limited computational resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying
Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy
and computational/energy requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above
issues and envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous
systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important enabling
technologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies are as follows:
Electronics 2023, 12, 2490
51 of 63
•
Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places
where maintaining Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on
doors, windows, and buildings.
•
Cell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced in 5G with
a more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further developed in 6G
to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free Massive MIMO im-
proves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there are some health risks
associated with such a dense network of APs.
•
CubeSat communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class
spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up to 6U,
and U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.
•
UAVs/satellite communication.
•
Terahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].
•
Blockchain technology [290] and quantum communication [283].
The development of futuristic smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-
efﬁcient 6G communication. Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for
energy-efﬁcient 6G wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application
of IoT devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency rate,
up to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000 GHz frequency.
This will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other concerns in conventional
communication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient 6G in smart cities via IoT
devices probably will solve various problems that are encountered by existing smart city
systems. In futuristic smart cities, residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer
interface (BCI) technology [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals
and information that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and
devices. It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.
As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises ﬁve
datasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction with the
machine [292].
8. Conclusions
Utilizing resources efficiently, reducing operating expenses, and enhancing city
dwellers’ quality of life are the objectives of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-
tained by combining various technologies including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big
data analytics, and robots. For this model, the effective networking and communication
between the many components required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its
objectives. The ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable
platforms for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,
and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined
in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different system
levels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking protocols
and smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart transportation system
architectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a variety of networking designs, such as
energy savings, routing, security, dependability, mobility, and support for heterogeneous
networks. In addition, we presented open research issues.
This survey can assist researchers to recognize research gaps/problems working in the
networking architectures for smart cities, and it provides an overview of available protocols
and architectures for SCAs.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

Abstract: In California, water is a perennial concern. As competition for water resources increases
due to growth in population, California’s tree nut farmers are committed to improving the efﬁciency
of water used for food production. There is an imminent need to have reliable methods that provide
information about the temporal and spatial variability of crop water requirements, which allow
farmers to make irrigation decisions at ﬁeld scale. This study focuses on estimating the actual
evapotranspiration and crop coefﬁcients of an almond and pistachio orchard located in Central Valley
(California) during an entire growing season by combining a simple crop evapotranspiration model
with remote sensing data. A dataset of the vegetation index NDVI derived from Landsat-8 was used
to facilitate the estimation of the basal crop coefﬁcient (Kcb), or potential crop water use. The soil water
evaporation coefﬁcient (Ke) was measured from microlysimeters. The water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) was
derived from airborne remotely sensed canopy thermal-based methods, using seasonal regressions
between the crop water stress index (CWSI) and stem water potential (Ψstem). These regressions were
statistically-signiﬁcant for both crops, indicating clear seasonal differences in pistachios, but not in
almonds. In almonds, the estimated maximum Kcb values ranged between 1.05 to 0.90, while for
pistachios, it ranged between 0.89 to 0.80. The model indicated a difference of 97 mm in transpiration
over the season between both crops. Soil evaporation accounted for an average of 16% and 13%
of the total actual evapotranspiration for almonds and pistachios, respectively. Veriﬁcation of the
model-based daily crop evapotranspiration estimates was done using eddy-covariance and surface
renewal data collected in the same orchards, yielding an R2 ≥ 0.7 and average root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 0.74 and 0.91 mm·day−1 for almond and pistachio, respectively. It is concluded
that the combination of crop evapotranspiration models with remotely-sensed data is helpful for
upscaling irrigation information from plant to ﬁeld scale and thus may be used by farmers for making
day-to-day irrigation management decisions.

1. Introduction
The State of California (CA) has the greatest production of tree nut crops worldwide. Among
them, almond acreage is estimated at 940,000 bearing acres and represents a 5.2-billion-dollar industry,
with around 1 million tons produced in 2016. CA also produces 98% of the pistachios in the United
States and is the second largest producer worldwide with more than 240,000 acres planted producing
over 0.27 million tons of pistachios per year [1,2]. Most of these two nut crops are planted in the
Central Valley, a region with a hot Mediterranean climate in which agricultural and environmental
needs, along with the increasing demand of a growing population, to compete for their share of the
limited water resources.
Almonds and pistachios are two high-value crops that have a reputation of being drought tolerant,
producing modest yields with very little water [3,4]. However, irrigation is critical in producing high
yields of top quality nuts [5,6]. Some research studies agreed that water productivity in almond and
pistachio is around 2.4 and 3.6 kg·m3, respectively [7,8]. To produce just these two crops, California
needs around 1.7 billion m3 of water per year. Because water resources are becoming scarce in CA
and drought periods trend to be more frequent and of longer duration [9], there is an urgent need
to continue to reduce water use during agricultural production. The historic drought from 2012 to
2016 increased grower awareness of efﬁcient water use practices and therefore forced them to put
into practice irrigation water-saving strategies (e.g., regulated deﬁcit irrigation). However, in order
to determine optimal irrigation scheduling and to adopt such strategies efﬁciently, it is necessary to
have reliable methods that provide information about the temporal and spatial variability of crop
water requirements and, to understand the seasonal physiological responses to water stress. Therefore,
the need for developing simple crop evapotranspiration (ET) modeling approaches with the inclusion
of water stress indicators is required to quantify stress under deﬁcit irrigation (DI) applications and for
scheduling irrigation [10].
Remote sensing data has been widely used in the assessment of crop ET and crop water stress
to obtain spatial information. Reﬂectance-derived vegetation indices (VI) such as the normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been empirically regressed with basal crop coefﬁcients (Kcb)
and applied to a reference ET (ETo) to estimate crop water use, such as with FAO56 [11,12]. Although
simple and widely-applied, this method may be too simplistic for crops undergoing deﬁcit-irrigation
scheduling because it only accounts for the potential evapotranspiration that a crop would have with
no modiﬁcation in stomatal conductance or crop coefﬁcient (Kc) due to water stress. In addition, these
techniques assume that variations in potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc) are linearly related to
canopy size, and are not sensitive to crop phenology and canopy architecture [13]. Other techniques
are based on combining both thermal and optical data to directly obtain actual crop evapotranspiration
(ETa) through energy balance models [14–16]. Although these models are able to estimate ETa
with ﬁne accuracy, they have limitations because they require the retrieval of a large number of
physical parameters and modeling options. In addition, some of these models, such as mapping
evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) [17] or the simpliﬁed
surface energy balance (SEBAL) [18] model are sensitive to the deﬁnition of hot (zero transpiration) and
cold (potential transpiration) pixels, which can lead to user subjectivity in deﬁning those anchor pixels.
When moderate crop water stress is imposed, ETa drops below ETc. Traditionally, the adoption
of DI strategies have been beneﬁcial for fruit and nut tree species to increase water productivity and
fruit quality [8,19–21]. DI aims at the partial replacement of water lost to ETc in order to reach speciﬁc
water deﬁcit thresholds in the soil and plant. However, when dealing with DI in commercial orchards,
implementing a water deﬁcit based solely on the ETa/ETc ratio may contain signiﬁcant errors. These
errors are due to (a) possible inaccuracies on ETa and ETc estimations, (b) the lack of knowledge on
the particular thresholds below which there is a reduction of transpiration due to water stress, and (c)

the difﬁculty of achieving a spatially-homogenous, targeted soil, or plant water status across the
orchard [22]. Spatial differences in soil type and depth, canopy architecture, and fruit load contribute
to variations in plant water status within the orchard. In addition, the relative insensitivity of canopy
ETa to stomatal closure suggests that approaches based on energy balance models currently used to
estimate ETa may fail to detect plant water stress [23]. Therefore, a sensitive physiological indicator
that integrates both soil and climatic conditions, and can quantify the impact of stomatal closure
on ETa is required in order to determine the inﬂuence of environmental and cultural conditions on
plant water status. For this reason, some researchers argue that plant-based approaches, whereby
plant water status threshold values are imposed, are preferable to ET-based approaches. Among
them, midday stem water potential (Ψstem) has been commonly used as a precise plant water status
indicator [24–26]. Nevertheless, due to major inconveniences in measuring Ψstem manually at large
scales, new approaches based on thermal remote sensing imagery have been successfully developed
to estimate Ψstem in woody crops [27–29]. These approaches regress Ψstem with the crop water stress
index (CWSI), which is a function of leaf temperature and can also be deﬁned as (1 − ETa/ETc) [30,31].
Therefore, our hypothesis is that since Ψstem has been successfully regressed with CWSI in many
different crops, the seasonal regressions of CWSI-Ψstem for almond and pistachio trees, obtained from
airborne thermal imagery, can be used to assess a water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) that can be assimilated
into an empirically-based ET model. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility
of using this simple ET-based model to estimate ETa of an almond and pistachio orchard during an
entire growing season by combining multispectral and thermal remote sensing imagery. Veriﬁcation of
the estimates of Kc and ETa will be achieved using data obtained with the eddy covariance and surface
renewal methods.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Site
The study site was located in Madera County, Central Valley, California, a few kilometers north of
the San Joaquin River (36◦49′15.85”N, 120◦12′1.20”W; Figure 1). The climate in the region is typically
Mediterranean with average annual high and low temperatures of 24.2 and 9.2 ◦C, respectively,
and an average precipitation (1928–2010) of 311 mm that falls predominantly during the winter season
(November–March). In 2016, the mean annual temperature, accumulated precipitation and reference
evapotranspiration (ETo) were 16.7 ◦C, 300 and 1357 mm, respectively. Daily maximum solar radiation
(Rs) in the area was 347 W·m−2 (DOY 187). Soil is classiﬁed as a deep sandy loam (6–14% clay,
67–78% sand), moderate to well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium from dominantly granitic
rocks [32].
Two commercial nut orchards were chosen to estimate crop evapotranspiration during the entire
growing season by using remote sensing. The ﬁrst, was an 18 year-old, 16-ha commercial almond
orchard. The orchard was planted with cv. Nonpareil and cv. Carmel, on alternating rows with a dense
canopy and high coverage. Trees were planted at a spacing distance of 5.5 m apart and with 7.3 m
inter-row. Trees in adjacent rows were offset by one half of the spacing distance. The irrigation system
consisted of a single dripline connected to micro-sprinklers (Fan-Jet, Bowsmith, USA), with a 3.5 m
wetting radius. Each tree was irrigated at a rate of 38–45 L·h−1. The second orchard was a 14-year-old,
16 ha cv. Kerman cultivar pistachio orchard. Trees were planted at a spacing distance of 5.2 m apart
with 5.8 m driveways between tree rows. The irrigation system consisted on two drip lines of eight
drippers per tree with a discharge rate of 3.8 L·h−1. The amount of irrigation water applied in the
almond and pistachio orchards during the growing season was 898.0 and 762.5 mm, respectively.
Irrigation in both orchards was scheduled following the protocol of the nut company. The almond
orchard was irrigated weekly with a timing ranging from 2 (beginning of the season) to 70 hours/week
(after harvest of cv. Nonpareil). From August through mid-September, the almond orchard was dried
for periods of 14 days to enable harvest. In pistachio, irrigation periods ranged from 5 (beginning of

the season) to 50 hours·week−1 (late July) and the orchard was dried for a period of 13 days before
harvest (early October).

2.2. Field Data 
In each orchard, three plots were designed to carry out field measurements. Each plot contained 
four rows of six trees, and measurements were taken from the four central trees in the two middle 
rows of each plot (Figure 2). All the other trees in the plot were guard trees. During the thermal 
airborne campaign days, an additional plot was set up. This additional plot consisted of 10 trees (2 
rows of 5 trees) and irrigation was interrupted a week before each image acquisition in order to 
increase water stress. We also established four plots outside of, but in orchards adjacent to, the 
primary orchard study plots; two plots each in younger almond and pistachio orchards that 
contained canopies with a low and medium canopy cover. These adjacent plots were in addition to 
the higher canopy coverage of the primary orchard study plots and allowed us to better understand 
the relationship between the NDVI and canopy light interception over a range of canopy sizes. 
The volume of water applied in the orchard was measured daily by installing into the dripline of 
each plot a water meter pulse sensor connected to a CR1000 (Campbell Scientific, UT, USA) 
datalogger. Soil water content was determined with a neutron probe (Hydroprobe 503DR; CPN 
International, Inc., Martinez, CA, USA). In each plot, three boreholes perpendicular to the row 
direction were augured between trees at a distance of 0.9 m each to a depth of 3.0 m using a soil hand 
auger (AMS, American Falls, ID, USA) and PVC neutron probe access tubes were installed. Readings 
were taken at 0.3 m depth intervals from the soil surface to a depth of 3.0 m, every one to two weeks. 
Neutron probe readings for the top 0.9 m, which corresponded to the active root zone observed on 
excavation, were converted to volumetric soil water content (θv) using a calibration curve that was 
determined in a previous study conducted in the same orchards [33]. 
Midday stem water potential (Ψstem) was measured every one to two weeks during the growing 
season in both orchards following the protocols described by McCutchan and Shackel [34]. All 
measurements were taken within one hour of solar noon, with four trees measured in each plot, as 
well as two additional measurements in the almond trees where canopy temperature (Tc) was 
continuously monitored with non-contact thermal infrared radiometers (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments 
Inc., Logan, USA). During the days of the thermal airborne campaigns, Ψstem was also measured in 
ten trees in the additional water-stressed plot. A pressure chamber (3005 series portable plant water 
status console; Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used. Shaded leaves

2.2. Field Data
In each orchard, three plots were designed to carry out ﬁeld measurements. Each plot contained
four rows of six trees, and measurements were taken from the four central trees in the two middle rows
of each plot (Figure 2). All the other trees in the plot were guard trees. During the thermal airborne
campaign days, an additional plot was set up. This additional plot consisted of 10 trees (2 rows of
5 trees) and irrigation was interrupted a week before each image acquisition in order to increase water
stress. We also established four plots outside of, but in orchards adjacent to, the primary orchard study
plots; two plots each in younger almond and pistachio orchards that contained canopies with a low
and medium canopy cover. These adjacent plots were in addition to the higher canopy coverage of the
primary orchard study plots and allowed us to better understand the relationship between the NDVI
and canopy light interception over a range of canopy sizes.
The volume of water applied in the orchard was measured daily by installing into the dripline of
each plot a water meter pulse sensor connected to a CR1000 (Campbell Scientiﬁc, UT, USA) datalogger.
Soil water content was determined with a neutron probe (Hydroprobe 503DR; CPN International, Inc.,
Martinez, CA, USA). In each plot, three boreholes perpendicular to the row direction were augured
between trees at a distance of 0.9 m each to a depth of 3.0 m using a soil hand auger (AMS, American
Falls, ID, USA) and PVC neutron probe access tubes were installed. Readings were taken at 0.3 m depth
intervals from the soil surface to a depth of 3.0 m, every one to two weeks. Neutron probe readings for
the top 0.9 m, which corresponded to the active root zone observed on excavation, were converted to
volumetric soil water content (θv) using a calibration curve that was determined in a previous study
conducted in the same orchards [33].
Midday stem water potential (Ψstem) was measured every one to two weeks during the
growing season in both orchards following the protocols described by McCutchan and Shackel [34].
All measurements were taken within one hour of solar noon, with four trees measured in each plot,
as well as two additional measurements in the almond trees where canopy temperature (Tc) was
continuously monitored with non-contact thermal infrared radiometers (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments
Inc., Logan, USA). During the days of the thermal airborne campaigns, Ψstem was also measured in
Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001

ten trees in the additional water-stressed plot. A pressure chamber (3005 series portable plant water
status console; Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used. Shaded leaves were
wrapped in plastic bags covered with aluminum foil for one hour prior to the Ψstem measurement.
The fraction of the intercepted PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) solar radiation (fIPAR) and
leaf area index (LAI) were measured following identical protocols for both orchards. Measurements
were conducted at solar noon every two to four weeks throughout the year during the growing season
using a portable ceptometer (AccuPAR model LP-80, Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA).
Incident PAR above and below the canopy were measured for each tree. The PAR intercepted by the
canopy (fIPAR) was calculated dividing the averaged below canopy PAR (fIPAR below) by the incident
PAR taken in full sunlight at an open site with no interference from the canopy (fIPAR above). Daily fIPAR
(fIPARd) was calculated by using the hourly model of light interception [35]. The parameter of porosity
of Oyarzun’s model was estimated so that the noon fIPAR value of the hourly simulation was equal to
that measured in the ﬁeld. Tree structural parameters such as tree height, crown width perpendicular to
and along rows, and branch insertion height were also measured. fIPARd was calculated by integrating
the diurnal course of simulated fIPAR. LAI was also obtained from fIPARd, using the approach presented
by Campbell and Norman [36] and setting a leaf absorptivity for light at 0.9.
2.3. Remote Sensing Data
A data set consisting of 25 dates of Landsat-8 Level 1 product images for atmospherically-corrected,
top of the canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) covering both orchards was acquired
from the USGS. The study orchards fall on two scenes, path/row 42/35 and 43/34, which provided L8
coverage four times each month for the period February to December 2016. The NDVI for each plot
and date were extracted from each image using the ArcGIS software (version 10.5.1). Then, in order to
remotely estimate fIPARd, the NDVI was regressed against fIPARd and LAI measurements. In addition,
the NDVI of the adjacent orchards with younger trees was also obtained and regressed with in-situ
measurements of fIPARd. These regressions were used to estimate the daily fraction of intercepted
radiation (fIPARd est) over a wider range of canopy closures throughout the growing season and used as
input to the model.
The airborne thermal campaign consisted of four ﬂights conducted on 17 May 2016 (DOY 138), 22
June 2016 (DOY 174), 21 July 2016 (DOY 203) and 11 August 2016 (DOY 224). Image acquisition and
pre-processing were managed by Ceres Imaging (Oakland, CA, USA; www.ceresimaging.net). Images
were acquired between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. (Paciﬁc Time, PST) (GTM-7) with the thermal sensor FLIR
A65 (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA). The image resolution is 640 × 512 pixels, with a ﬁeld of
view (FOV) of 45◦ × 37◦ using 13 mm lens. Spectral response was in the range of 7.5–13 µm. The spatial
resolutions differ between ﬂights and pixel size ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 meters, due to differences in the
ﬂight altitude between dates, which varied from 500 to 1000 meters. These differences in pixel size
did not affect the extraction of pure vegetation pixels, since crown area of both crops was signiﬁcantly
greater than the pixel size (Figure 2). In-situ temperature was measured for ground-based calibration
targets with a portable IR-gun (Fluke 572 infrared thermometer, Everett, WA, USA). As targets, we
used black and white 2.4 × 2.4 m painted panels and 2.0 × 2.0 m inexpensive textile sheets of cotton.
In addition, concurrent with image collection, we took temperature measurements of asphalt, concrete,
bare soil, and a tomato ﬁeld located adjacent to the almond orchard. Image orthorectiﬁcation was
completed using ground control points (GCP). The GCP panels were divided into quadrants and
painted black and white in opposite corners. The position of the center of each GCP was acquired
with a handheld GPS (Global Positioning System) (Geo7x, Trimble GeoExplorer series, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) and pixel-based geo-rectiﬁcation was done with the software package ENVI 4.7.

2.4. Evapotranspiration Measurements 
Crop evapotranspiration was measured with an eddy-covariance (EC) and surface renewal (SR) 
systems. In both orchards, the flux towers were located close to the experimental plots and facing 
into the predominant wind direction (west). Both the EC and SR systems were installed in the 
pistachio orchard, while only a SR was installed in the almond orchard. In the pistachio orchard, the 
flux tower included the following instrumentation at 6 m over the soil surface: Infrared Gas Analyzer 
IRGA (LI-7500, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, 
Campbell Scientific Inc. Logan, UT, USA); a REBS Q7.1 net radiometer (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, 
USA); and two FW3 Type-E fine-wire thermocouples (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA). In addition, 
the ground heat flux was measured using three sets of HFP01-SC soil heat flux plates (Campbell Sci., 
Logan, UT, USA) and soil temperature averaging sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, 
UT, USA). The sensible heat flux (H) was obtained from the 3D sonic anemometer on a half-hour 
basis. Instrumentation in the almond orchard was installed at 9 m above the ground and consisted of 
the following: Kipp & Zonen NR Lite 2 net radiometer, two FW3 Type-E fine-wire thermocouples 
(Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA) and two non-contact SI-121 thermal-infrared radiometer sensors 
(IRTs) (Apogee Instruments Inc., Logan, USA). The latter were installed at 1.5 m above the canopy of 
two almond trees, positioned with a 45˚ angle and ensuring that the targeted area was pure canopy 
vegetation. The sensor has a narrow 18˚ half-angle field of view and a response time of 0.6 seconds. 
We used the same instrumentation as in the pistachio orchard to measure the ground heat flux in the 
almond orchard. 
The SR is an alternative and inexpensive approach to EC for measuring sensible heat flux density 
(H) [37,38]. Although this system requires only a fast-response air temperature sensor, it needs to be 
calibrated [37]. The calibration factor alpha is obtained from the slope of the regression between a 
standard H (generally taken as eddy covariance measurements) forced through the origin versus 
uncalibrated surface renewal sensible heat flux measurements [39]. In this study, the alpha weighting 
factors (α) were obtained from another flux tower installed in an almond orchard located in Belridge 
(CA, USA) (35º30’25.47’’N, 119º40’04.99’’W). Almond tree from that orchard were of similar age and 
structural properties as those from our study site, and α was obtained from available data of both EC 
and SR [23,40]. Monthly averaged data for the period 2008–2011 was used to calibrate the H obtained 
from the SR system installed in the almond orchard (Table 1). Latent heat flux (LE) of both orchards 
was then estimated as a residual of the energy balance (LE=Rn-G-H). The averaged values of H and 
LE were calculated and recorded with an output frequency of 30 min and converted to ETa (ETaobs) by

2.4. Evapotranspiration Measurements
Crop evapotranspiration was measured with an eddy-covariance (EC) and surface renewal (SR)

included the following instrumentation at 6 m over the soil surface: Infrared Gas Analyzer IRGA

Scientiﬁc Inc. Logan, UT, USA); a REBS Q7.1 net radiometer (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA); and two
FW3 Type-E ﬁne-wire thermocouples (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA). In addition, the ground heat
ﬂux was measured using three sets of HFP01-SC soil heat ﬂux plates (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA)
and soil temperature averaging sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The sensible
heat ﬂux (H) was obtained from the 3D sonic anemometer on a half-hour basis. Instrumentation in the
almond orchard was installed at 9 m above the ground and consisted of the following: Kipp & Zonen
NR Lite 2 net radiometer, two FW3 Type-E ﬁne-wire thermocouples (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA)
and two non-contact SI-121 thermal-infrared radiometer sensors (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments Inc.,

a 45◦ angle and ensuring that the targeted area was pure canopy vegetation. The sensor has a narrow
18◦ half-angle ﬁeld of view and a response time of 0.6 seconds. We used the same instrumentation as
in the pistachio orchard to measure the ground heat ﬂux in the almond orchard.
The SR is an alternative and inexpensive approach to EC for measuring sensible heat ﬂux density
(H) [37,38]. Although this system requires only a fast-response air temperature sensor, it needs to
be calibrated [37]. The calibration factor alpha is obtained from the slope of the regression between

factors (α) were obtained from another ﬂux tower installed in an almond orchard located in Belridge
(CA, USA) (35◦30′25.47”N, 119◦40′04.99”W). Almond tree from that orchard were of similar age and
structural properties as those from our study site, and α was obtained from available data of both
EC and SR [23,40]. Monthly averaged data for the period 2008–2011 was used to calibrate the H
obtained from the SR system installed in the almond orchard (Table 1). Latent heat ﬂux (LE) of both
orchards was then estimated as a residual of the energy balance (LE=Rn-G-H). The averaged values

of H and LE were calculated and recorded with an output frequency of 30 min and converted to ETa
(ETaobs) by dividing LE by 2.45 MJ·mm−1 of water vaporized. Daily calculations of ETaobs were used to
validate the empirically-based ET-model approach developed in this study to estimate almond and
pistachio ETa.
Agrometeorological data was acquired from the CIMIS network of weather stations of
California [41]. The study site is located between two weather stations in the San Joaquin Valley:
Madera (#188; Lat/Long: 37.02◦N, 120.15◦W), and Westlands (#105; Lat/Long: 36.63◦N, 120.38◦W).
Thus, data from both stations was averaged to provide the weather input data sets and reference
ETo. In addition, air temperature (Ta) for each orchard was obtained from the FW3 type-E ﬁne-wire
thermocouples, installed in each ﬂux tower.

2.5. Estimates of Actual Crop Evapotranspiration (ETa) and Coefﬁcients
The actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) was calculated as
ETa = ETo (Kcb Ks + Ke + Kcc)
(1)
where, Kcb is the basal crop coefﬁcient from the dual crop coefﬁcient approach, which essentially
represents transpiration under non-water limited conditions [42]; Ks is a water stress coefﬁcient, Ke is
the soil water evaporation coefﬁcient, and Kcc is the crop cover coefﬁcient. The actual crop coefﬁcient
(Ka), which is considered as the ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration, was calculated as
Ka = Kcb Ks + Ke + Kcc
(2)
It is widely acknowledged that the fraction of crop intercepted radiation (fIPAR) is a major
determinant of the basal crop coefﬁcient (Kcb) [43,44]. As previously described in Section 2.3, fIPARd was
derived throughout the growing season by regressing it with the reﬂectance vegetation index NDVI,
which was acquired from Landsat-8. Since we could not ﬁnd any study that presented the fIPARd-Kcb
response for almonds, it has been assumed in this study that this regression is similar to that developed
for peach trees, another Prunus species [44]. Marsal et al. [44] used Cropsyst to simulate the seasonal
patterns of fIPARd, ETc, Kcb and Ψstem for peach trees; we borrowed Equation 4 from Marsal et al. to
estimate almond Kcb from fIPARd. For pistachio, Kcb was empirically derived using the crop coefﬁcients
(Kc) from Goldhamer et al. [45] and deducting the weekly averaged Ke derived in this study. Then,
to obtain the Kcb as function of fIPARd, we used the relationship between crop evapotranspiration (ET)
with the percent area shaded by the canopy developed by Fereres et al. [46], and assuming that fIR was
equivalent to shaded proportion. An empirical polynomial relationship relating fIPAR with fIPARd was
developed (R2 = 0.57, n = 93) using all measurements conducted in the pistachio plots throughout the
growing season (Equation 3).
fIPARd_pist = −2.981 (fIPAR)2 + 3.452 (fIPAR) − 0.37
(3)
Then, Kcb for both crops was calculated as
Kcb_alm = −0.982(fIPARd)2 + 2.559(fIPARd) − 0.474
(4)
Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001
8 of 22
Kcb_pist = −0.324 (fIPARd_pist)2 + 1.721(fIPARd_pist) + 0.045
(5)
The water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) was retrieved from canopy thermal-based methods.
The methodology consisted on the seasonal estimation of Ks from measurements of Ψstem, which
were conducted in each plot every one to two weeks, and using the seasonal regressions obtained
between the remotely sensed crop water stress index (CWSI) and Ψstem. Then, the Ks was obtained as
Ks = 1 − CWSI
(6)
In order to calculate the CWSI for almonds, canopy temperature (Tc) of two almond trees was
continuously monitored from mid-April to October 2016 with two infrared radiometer (IRT) sensors.
Tc was recorded every minute and stored as 30-min averages and these data were used to calculate the
almond baseline of the CWSI. The empirical CWSI was calculated as [30], which can be represented as
CWSI =
(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL
(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL
(7)
where Tc − Ta is the difference between canopy and air temperature; (Tc − Ta)LL is the lower limit of
(Tc − Ta) of a canopy which is transpiring at the potential rate, and (Tc − Ta)UL the expected differential
in the case of a non-transpiring canopy.
The non-water stressed baseline (NWSB) was obtained by regressing half-hourly values of
(Tc − Ta) against vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. Only data within two days
after each irrigation event, which had wind speed below 6 m·s−1, were used in the assessment of
the NWSB. The (Tc − Ta)LL was then obtained taking the minimum values of Tc − Ta for each VPD.
The upper limit (Tc − Ta)UL was obtained by solving the NWSB regression equation for VPD=0, then
correcting for the difference in vapor pressure induced by the difference in temperature Tc − Ta.
As previously reported by Bellvert et al. [28], a phenological response was identiﬁed in the NWSB.
Therefore, data was separated between early phenological stages (from April to beginning of July)
and late stages (from early July to harvest at the end of August). In pistachio, CWSI was calculated
using the baselines developed by Testi et al. [47]. Air temperature (Ta) was obtained from the ﬁne-wire
thermocouples and relative humidity (RH) was obtained using a Watchdog 1000 series micro station
(Spectrum Technologies, 3600, IL, USA) installed in each orchard. On the four dates of the thermal
airborne campaign, the CWSI was then calculated in those trees where Ψstem was measured and the
regression between both parameters was acquired for each day. Crown-averaged temperatures for
each tree were extracted and converted to CWSI by using image processing methods.
Soil evaporation was measured with simple microlysimeters (ML). ML were made by cutting
commercial PVC pipe and closing the bottom end with caps. These were positioned in a PVC pipe
outer casing installed into the soil. Dimensions of each ML were 0.12 m in height and 0.0974 m
of internal diameter. Three and four ML were installed in the soil wetted area of each plot of the
almond and pistachio orchard, respectively. In the almond orchard, microlysimeters were positioned
half-way between a tree and micro-sprinkler, separated by a distance of 0.92 m from each. In the
pistachio orchard, two ML were positioned on either side of the middle tree, between drip emitters.
Measurements were conducted seven times throughout the growing season and each time, the ML
measurements were weighted for two to three consecutive days. The procedure consisted on removing
the ML from the soil taking care to preserve the structure of the extracted and remaining soil. Then,
in order to ensure that only water evaporation from the ML was measured, soil clinging from the
external surfaces of the ML was removed. Soil evaporation (Esoil) and the soil water evaporation
coefﬁcient (Ke) were calculated by the relationship
Esoil = ∆MML
AML
× Awet mm·day−1

where, ∆MML is microlysimeter daily variation of mass (grams); AML is microlysimeter surface area
with a value of 74.55 cm2 (1 mm of evaporation corresponded therefore to 0.007455 liters or 7.455 g of
water evaporated); Awet is wetted soil area (%); and ETo is daily evapotranspiration (mm).
The wetted soil area around a tree was measured using a measuring tape. The procedure consisted
of dividing the tree spacing area into four quadrants and measuring the percentage of wetted area in
each quadrant. Ke was calculated during the growing season based on the number of days after each
irrigation event. Evaporation after a rainfall event was considered in the same way as an irrigation
event, but where the entire soil surface was completely wetted, Awet was considered equal to the
spacing per tree.
The cover crop coefﬁcient (Kcc) was obtained as
Kcc = CCw
SD (GC)
(10)
where, CCw is cover crop width (m), which was measured every two to three weeks, SD represents the
spacing distance, and GC is the percentage of green cover, which was estimated visually.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Stem Water Potential and Volumetric Soil Water Content
The seasonal pattern of stem water potential (Ψstem) and volumetric soil water content (θv) is
presented in Figure 3. Before harvest, Ψstem values ranged between −0.8 to −1.6 MPa and between
−0.5 to −1.4 MPa for almond and pistachio, respectively (Figure 3a). Ψstem of both crops decreased
through the season, reaching minimum values at harvest. Minimum Ψstem values for almonds were
−3.3 MPa, coinciding with the end of the drying period. Ψstem of both crops also showed a clear
response to θv, yielding coefﬁcients of determination (R2) of 0.89 and 0.74 for almonds and pistachios,
respectively. Soil texture in both orchards was sandy loam, with 19.5% and 10.3% of soil water content
respectively at ﬁeld capacity and wilting point across the entire soil proﬁle [48]. Similarly to Ψstem,
θv across both sites decreased throughout the season, except for a slight increase in the θv just before
harvest due to an irrigation event, which increased the Ψstem values to the same level as those measured
in pistachios (Figure 3b). The θv in the pistachio orchard at the top 0.9 m was slightly higher than in
the almond orchard throughout the growing season. Therefore, the lower θv in the almond orchard
may explain, in part, the reason why Ψstem values were lower.

3.2.Seasonal Trends of NDVI 
Relevant canopy biophysical parameters involved in canopy transpiration can be described by 
the NDVI [49]. The seasonal trend of NDVI indicated an initial phase of linear increase, followed by 
a plateau with a slight decreasing trend over time (Figure 4a). Significant differences in seasonal 
patterns were observed between almond and pistachio. These differences can be explained by 
differences in the fraction of ground cover. The NDVI in the almond orchard peaked before the 
pistachio, explained by an earlier vegetative growth in almonds. Maximum NDVI values were 0.86

the NDVI [49]. The seasonal trend of NDVI indicated an initial phase of linear increase, followed by
a plateau with a slight decreasing trend over time (Figure 4a). Signiﬁcant differences in seasonal

pistachio, explained by an earlier vegetative growth in almonds. Maximum NDVI values were 0.86
(DOY 80) and 0.63 (DOY 112) for almond and pistachio, respectively. The slight decrease in the NDVI
throughout the season was more notable in the almond orchard probably because of senescence of the
cover crop, while the NDVI in the pistachio orchard remained quite constant until the end of harvest.
After harvest, a noticeable decrease in the NDVI was explained by a reduction in the leaf area resulting
from leaf senescence as well as tree shaking.

between NDVI and daily fraction of intercepted radiation (fIPARd), and (c) relationship between NDVI

In woody crops, potential canopy transpiration has usually been derived from the NDVI through 
estimates of the leaf area index (LAI) or the fraction of intercepted radiation [50,51]. Other studies 
have used data from eddy-covariance flux towers to relate the NDVI to in-situ measurements of Kcb 
[52,53]. In this study, the NDVI was linearly correlated with the fIPARd over its entire range, (R2 of 0.88

In this study, the NDVI was linearly correlated with the fIPARd over its entire range, (R2 of 0.88 and
0.96 for pistachio and almond, respectively; Figure 4b). The little shift in this regression indicated that,
for any given value of the fIPARd, the NDVI was slightly higher in almonds than in pistachios. This
can probably be explained by a cover crop or even a leaf angle effect. While the pistachio orchard had
bare soil, most of the almond orchards had cover crop (i.e., weeds) between rows, in part, because
the almond orchard was irrigated by micro-sprinklers, whereas the pistachio orchard was irrigated
via drip irrigation under the trees. The regression with LAI, however, was non-linear and, above LAI
values of ~2, the NDVI tended to saturate and became less sensitive to variations in LAI (Figure 4c).
This saturation effect has been widely reported in many studies.
3.3. Soil Water Evaporation Coefﬁcient (Ke)
Ke was measured from mid-April to mid-August, when tree foliage had reached full development.
Data showed that Ke was dependent on the irrigation frequency and system. In both orchards, irrigation
was scheduled on a weekly basis and particularly during the summer, with long irrigation events
ranging from 24 to 36 consecutive hours. Therefore, Ke declines daily following each irrigation event
(Figure 5). On the same day of an irrigation event, Ke corresponded to maximum values of 0.24 and
0.18 for almond and pistachio, respectively. The shifting of soil evaporation between both orchards
was explained by the irrigation system. The micro-sprinkler irrigation system installed in the almond
orchard corresponded with a higher wetted soil surface, and consequently, a higher soil evaporation

rate in comparison to the drip irrigation system in the pistachio orchard. Comparing the accumulated
soil evaporation on a weekly basis, it was estimated that the pistachio orchard evaporated up to 35%
less than the almond orchard. Some studies have found that Esoil in a drip-irrigated almond orchard
(canopy cover (CC) = 63%, irrigation at full replacement of ET) accounted for 23.6% of ETc, on average,
during the growing season [54]. On the other hand, Iniesta et al. [55] reported Esoil losses that amounted
to 30% of seasonal ETc for fully-irrigated pistachios (CC = 57%) with a micro-sprinkler system. In our
study, Esoil for the growing season accounted for an average of 16.1 and 13.1% of ETa for almonds and
pistachios, respectively (Table 2). Overall, Esoil depends on the type of irrigation system, irrigation
frequency, fraction of radiation reaching the soil surface, atmospheric evaporative demand (ETo) and
soil inﬁltration rate [56]. Therefore, variations in reported Esoil values can be explained by variations in
these parameters. For instance, dissimilarities in Esoil comparing our almond orchard and results of
the pistachio orchard reported by Iniesta et al. [55] might be explained by differences in canopy cover.
Both orchards were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler system, but the almond average canopy cover
(~85%) was higher than the pistachios, reducing therefore the amount of radiation reaching the soil
surface, and thus Esoil.

irrigation events ranging from 24 to 36 consecutive hours. Therefore, Ke declines daily following each

orchard evaporated up to 35% less than the almond orchard. Some studies have found that Esoil in a

accounted for 23.6% of ETc, on average, during the growing season [54]. On the other hand, Iniesta et

average of 16.1 and 13.1% of ETa for almonds and pistachios, respectively (Table 2). Overall, Esoil 
depends on the type of irrigation system, irrigation frequency, fraction of radiation reaching the soil 
surface, atmospheric evaporative demand (ETo) and soil infiltration rate [56]. Therefore, variations in 
reported Esoil values can be explained by variations in these parameters. For instance, dissimilarities 
in Esoil comparing our almond orchard and results of the pistachio orchard reported by Iniesta et al. 
[55] might be explained by differences in canopy cover. Both orchards were irrigated with a micro-
sprinkler system, but the almond average canopy cover (~85%) was higher than the pistachios, 
reducing therefore the amount of radiation reaching the soil surface, and thus Esoil.

3.4. Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)
The non-water-stressed baseline (NSWB) of almonds relies on the relationship between Tc − Ta
and VPD. This regression was signiﬁcant and Tc − Ta tends to decrease as VPD increases (Figure 6).
However, a seasonal effect was also detected, indicating the necessity to distinguish between two
different seasonal responses. During the early growth stages (DOY 106 to 188), data from both IRTs

agreed and followed the same pattern, which indicated a lower intercept in the relationship between
Tc − Ta vs. VPD in comparison to the later growing stages (DOY 189 to 228; harvest). This implies
that for a given increase in VPD, early growth stages, which corresponded to vegetative growth (shell
expansion and hardening), had more transpirational cooling than the kernel and post-kernel ﬁlling
stages. Since signiﬁcant differences in fIPARd were not detected during the middle of the growing
season (from DOY 100 to 228), the seasonal changes in this relationship could be explained either by
a decline in the atmospheric evaporative demand due to a reduction in the radiation load, or by leaf
aging which inﬂuenced leaf loss and hydraulic functioning.
Jackson [31,57] showed that the NWSB of a crop is a function of VPD, wind speed, incoming
radiation, and crop resistances (both aerodynamic and surface).
Although the data analyzed
corresponds only to days with wind speeds below 6 m s−1, and under clear sky conditions, the
amount of energy available for evapotranspiration varies throughout the growing season. Usually,
the seasonal pattern of solar radiation (Rs), starts to decline after the summer solstice, coinciding with
the kernel-ﬁlling stage (DOY 188). This decrease in the radiation load could result in a reduction in
the dissipation of sensible heat (H) and latent ﬂux (LE). Thus, transpiration can be reduced beyond
that achieved solely by stomatal closure, explaining the higher intercept of the NWSB during the
kernel-ﬁlling stage.

3.4. Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) 
The non-water-stressed baseline (NSWB) of almonds relies on the relationship between Tc−Ta and 
VPD. This regression was significant and Tc−Ta tends to decrease as VPD increases (Figure 6). 
However, a seasonal effect was also detected, indicating the necessity to distinguish between two 
different seasonal responses. During the early growth stages (DOY 106 to 188), data from both IRTs

stages. Since significant differences in fIPARd were not detected during the middle of the growing 
season (from DOY 100 to 228), the seasonal changes in this relationship could be explained either by 
a decline in the atmospheric evaporative demand due to a reduction in the radiation load, or by leaf 
aging which influenced leaf loss and hydraulic functioning.

kernel-filling stage (DOY 188). This decrease in the radiation load could result in a reduction in the 
dissipation of sensible heat (H) and latent flux (LE). Thus, transpiration can be reduced beyond that 
achieved solely by stomatal closure, explaining the higher intercept of the NWSB during the kernel-
filling stage.

temperature sensors (IRT-1 and IRT-2). The linear regression equations for the non-water stress 
baselines (NWSB) at the early (DOY 106-190) and late (DOY 191-221) growth stages were 
y= − 1.248x + 0.922 and y = − 2.011x + 5.518, respectively. The regression equations for the lower limit 
(Tc−Ta)LL at the same dates were y= − 1.088x − 0.413 and y = − 1.553x + 2.860. 
Another explanation might be related to a seasonal decrease in transpiration rate, controlled by 
stomatal closure, and associated with changes in the hormonal balance, leaf aging or the loss of leaf 
hydraulic functioning [58–60]. Espadafor et al. [59] showed a slight drop in the ratio between daily 
transpiration and fraction of intercepted radiation (KT/fIPARd) just before harvest, which was explained 
by the coincidence of the latency period of shoot growth in summer with a low fruit load; which 
probably decreased the transpiration rate of the tree. A decrease in the gas exchange rate in fully-
irrigated almonds during kernel-filling stage was also reported in different studies [54,61]. It seems, 
therefore, that the stomatal response can be dependent on the phenological stage, and that the kernel-
filling stage typically follows a more conservative strategy, which avoids high water loss due to 
partial stomatal closure [62]. Nevertheless, more studies are necessary to get better understanding of 
the seasonal responses of transpiration in almonds.

In pistachios, the NWSB was obtained from Testi et al. [47], which developed the following
baseline for the period mid-June to the end of September: Tc − Ta= −1.33VPD + 2.44. Therefore,

pistachio throughout the season, which had an y-intercept in between those seasonal relationships
developed for almonds in this study.
The seasonal pattern of the CWSI, which was calculated using Tc from the two IRTs installed
on the almond trees, can be observed in Figure 7. CWSI ranged from zero to one throughout the
growing season, with sharp peaks before irrigation events and dropping close to zero once irrigation
was applied. The sandy loam soils of this orchard have little capacity to retain water, thus the low
frequency of irrigation events caused large oscillations of water status within a week. At the beginning
of the season, CWSI was unreasonably high for some speciﬁc days and there were large differences
between both IRTs. On those days, VPD was low, and because under these circumstances the difference
between (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL is very small, the signal-to-noise ratio to calculate CWSI is small,
so CWSI at these times may contain signiﬁcant sources of error. The CWSI reached maximum values in
mid-July, when the atmospheric demand was high and for a few weeks, the amount of water applied
was not enough to supply all crop water demand. Also, during the drying period prior to harvest,
irrigation was intentionally cut off for 14 days and CWSI peaked at a maximum value of 0.8. Upon the
resumption of irrigation during the post-harvest stage, CWSI recovered again. Measurements of Ψstem
in those trees agreed with CWSI, showing a signiﬁcant regression with a R2 of 0.89 (data not shown).
However, this regression only used data from those days in the middle of the growing season with
a VPD higher than 2.3 KPa and did not contain those measurements collected at the beginning of the
season (DOY 108, 116, and 131). Bellvert et al. [28] also showed in grapevines that VPD values below
2.3 KPa had a negative effect on the CWSI-Ψstem relationship.

The remotely sensed CWSI was regressed with Ψstem for the four thermal image acquisition days 
and in both crops (Figure 8). In almonds, the regression followed a linear model and R2 ranged from 
0.54 to 0.82 (Figure 8a). The shape of the relationships indicated that transpiration continuously 
decreases as Ψstem declines. Similar responses have been reported in almond [63,64]. There were no 
seasonal differences in the regression among the first three image acquisition days (DOY 138, 174, 
and 203), and Ψstem corresponded to −1.05 MPa and −2.48 MPa, when the crop was fully transpiring 
(CWSI = 0) and under complete stomatal closure (CWSI = 1), respectively. However, the flight of the 
11 August (DOY 224) was significantly different from the others, showing a lower intercept. At that 
moment, Ψstem corresponded to −1.53 MPa and −2.94 MPa, respectively at full transpiration and 
complete stomatal closure. Seasonal differences in the CWSI-Ψstem regressions due to osmotic 
potential and leaf turgor seasonal changes have been also described in other crops [28,29]. Across the

and complete stomatal closure. Seasonal differences in the CWSI-Ψstem regressions due to osmotic
potential and leaf turgor seasonal changes have been also described in other crops [28,29]. Across the
growing season, the CWSI was slightly negative when corresponding measurements of Ψstem were
high. This phenomenon is not unusual and has been reported in previous studies, which explain that it
corresponds to observations of Tc lying below the established (Tc − Ta)LL [47,65]. Also, the variability

shaded and sunlit areas, branches, and pixels affected by background soil), plays a role in the accuracy

for leaf thermoregulation and significant transpiration of water at higher levels of water stress. Other 
studies have also described a seasonal stomatal response in pistachio trees, where at the shell 
hardening stage, the stomatal opening is substantial and prolonged during the day, and a more 
conservative strategy later in the season which reduces water loss due to partial stomatal closure 
during the kernel filling stage [62]. Similarly, Gijón et al. [73] indicated a higher degree of osmotic 
adjustment during the shell hardening stage, suggesting that some physiological changes are 
occurring at that stage. These trends could not be confirmed with our data, where the CWSI-Ψstem

− 1.537x − 1.201, R2 = 0.74 (DOY 224).
In contrast, the pistachio regressions between CWSI and Ψstem followed a curvilinear response
(Figure 8b). R2 ranged from 0.61 to 0.77 and clear seasonal differences were detected in the CWSI-Ψstem
regressions, which might probably be explained by hydraulic conductance and leaf osmotic potential
changes [67–70]. As this crop developed, a given value of CWSI corresponded to more negative
Ψstem values. The ﬂight conducted in DOY 138 showed the highest Ψstem values, indicating, at that
period, a low osmotic adjustment for recently expanded leaves. The Ψstem required to close stomata
(−1.73 MPa) was also higher than in later stages. On the other hand, a completely different response
was detected for the other three image acquisition dates (DOY 174, 203, and 224), characterized
by a more anisohydric behavior, due to a lower efﬁciency at controlling Ψstem through stomatal
closure. The estimated minimum Ψstem at which stomatal conductance (gs) approached or equaled
zero (CWSI = 1) were −3.40, −4.60 and −5.00 MPa, respectively for DOY 174, 203, and 224. In this
respect, these values were similar to those reported by Behboudian et al. [71], who also established
that when Ψleaf reached extremely low values of −5.0 to −6.0 MPa, leaves were still able to continue
photosynthetic activity. Germana [72] reported the outstanding capacity of pistachio trees for leaf
thermoregulation and signiﬁcant transpiration of water at higher levels of water stress. Other studies
have also described a seasonal stomatal response in pistachio trees, where at the shell hardening stage,
the stomatal opening is substantial and prolonged during the day, and a more conservative strategy
later in the season which reduces water loss due to partial stomatal closure during the kernel ﬁlling
stage [62]. Similarly, Gijón et al. [73] indicated a higher degree of osmotic adjustment during the shell
hardening stage, suggesting that some physiological changes are occurring at that stage. These trends
could not be conﬁrmed with our data, where the CWSI-Ψstem regressions at shell hardening (DOY 174)
and kernel ﬁlling (DOY 203 and 224) had similar slopes and different y-intercepts.

3.6. Seasonal Trend of Crop Evapotranspiration
Total estimated actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) water consumption during the growing
season, from DOY 61 to DOY 335, was 1194.9 and 1021.5 mm for almond and pistachio, respectively
(Table 2); the cumulative ETo and rainfall were 1242 and 156.2 mm for the same period. The difference
between water used through evapotranspiration and that applied through irrigation and rainfall
accounted for 140.7 and 102.8 mm for almond and pistachio, respectively. This corresponded to the
averaged amount of water stored in a sandy loam soil for all of the growing season. As previously
mentioned, the amount of water loss due to soil evaporation (Esoil) accounted for 16.1% and 13.1%
for almond and pistachio, respectively. On the other hand, the water consumption coming from
vegetation ground cover (CC) was almost negligible, being 2.20% and 0.84% of total ETa for almond
and pistachio, respectively.
The seasonal trend of both modelled and observed (ﬂux tower data) actual crop
evapotranspiration (ETamodel, ETaobs) is shown for the almond (Figure 9a) and pistachio (Figure 10a)
orchards. In almonds, crop evapotranspiration increased sharply from early March to mid-July,
when maximum values of ~8.5 mm·day−1 were achieved. After mid-July, ETamodel, ETaobs, and
ETo dropped progressively until the end of the season. The decrease in ETa starting on DOY 226
corresponded with the drying period at harvest. During that period, transpiration declined to
minimum values of 2.2 mm day−1 when the cv. Nonpareil and cv. Carmel were harvested, which
corresponded to a measured Ψstem of −3.3 MPa. Although both ETamodel and ETaobs dropped during
periods of low Ψstem, values of modelled ET (ETamodel) were lower than ETaobs. This phenomenon was
observed to occur several times throughout the growing season (i.e., DOY 99, 100, 126, 162, 172, 193,
205, and 220), suggesting that either the model exaggerates water stress, or that it may be difﬁcult to
quantify water stress in almond using energy balance techniques. Spinelli et al. [23] suggested a similar
conclusion. They argued that the unresponsiveness of LE to reductions in canopy conductance during
periods of low Ψstem could be due to the inﬂuence of aerodynamic conductance (ga) [74], as well as
the overriding contribution of LE coming from shaded leaves within a canopy, which respond less
dramatically to water stress. The same study also indicated that because the response of LE to gs
depends on ga, stress-related reductions in ET are more likely on a high wind speed day (high ga),
than during a low ga (calm) day. Although these hypotheses may offer potential insights, this aspect
deserves more attention in further studies. Moreover, this singularity was not seen in pistachios,
though unfortunately we did not have the ﬂux data needed throughout the growing season to conﬁrm
it, particularly during the drying harvest period. Crop evapotranspiration in pistachios followed
the same trend as almonds, but ETa was slightly lower (Figure 10a). Maximum values reached to
~7.5 mm·day−1 (DOY 179).

harvest (Figure 9b). Similar values were reported in mature almond trees [23,75]. However, values
differ from those reported by Allen and Pereira [76] and Garcia-Tejero et al. [77], which indicated
maximum values of 1.1 for the same period, although the latter study was conducted in younger trees.
Ka also reﬂected weekly oscillations due to changes in water stress and Ke, which declined following
each irrigation event. During harvest, modelled Ks was 0.2 indicating the presence of a drying period,
which aligns with the observed depression of Ψstem during this period. The Kcb followed the same
behavior as fIPARd, increasing it from DOY 50 to 85, when it reached maximum values of ~1.0. After
that, Kcb followed a ﬂat response until just before harvest, when a slight decrease in the estimated
fraction of intercepted radiation (fIPARd est) was observed, probably due to start of leaf senescence.
Kcb for almonds was derived from Marsal et al. [44], which showed that the modelled CropSyst [78]
parameter Kcfc was the factor that linked fIPARd with Kcb. Therefore, Kcb from our study is comparable
with the KT obtained by Espadafor et al. [59], which compared the parameter Kcfc with KT/fIPARd,
and reported maximum KT values of 1.02 in almonds with 85 % of fIPARd.
In pistachio, Ka reached maximum values of 1.10 (DOY 120), coinciding with irrigation events, and
reﬂecting rapid canopy development (Figure 10b). Maximum Ka values continued in the range 0.9–1.1
during July and August followed by a decline starting on DOY 320 due to leaf senescence. Similar
values were reported by Goldhamer et al. [3] for mature pistachio trees with greater than 60 percent of
canopy cover, although Kc values shown by Kanber et al. [79] were slightly lower. Kcb followed the
same trend, increasing from 0.3 in April (DOY 90) to a maximum value of 0.9 in May (DOY 122) until
leaf senescence. Despite irrigation being cut off for few days just before harvest, Ks did not decrease as
much as in almonds, and minimum reported values reached to 0.65.
4. Conclusions and Perspective
We conclude from this study that remote sensing approaches based on the combination of simple
ET-based models and thermal-based plant water status indicators can guide irrigation management.
The simple ET model can be applicable at ﬁeld scales, showing a high linear correlation near the 1:1
line and yielding a RMSE between measured and modeled daily ETa of 0.74 and 0.91 mm·day−1 for
almond and pistachio, respectively (Figure 11). We have provided evidence that a dense time series
of satellite-based multispectral images could be used in an operational way to estimate the basal
crop coefﬁcients (Kcb) in heterogeneous crops, based on empirical regressions with crop biophysical
parameters such as LAI or fIPARd. This study also demonstrated that seasonal soil evaporation
accounted for 13% to 16% of total ETc, reaching maximum rates immediately after rain and irrigation
events, and depending in part, on the type of irrigation system.

In the absence of a useful, practical, and affordable tool for the grower to measure plant water
status of an entire orchard, we have shown that thermal-based remote sensing can be successfully used
to determine the water stress coefﬁcient (Ks). The CWSI-Ψstem relationship (where Ks = 1 − CWSI)
showed a temporally-variable seasonal response for both crops with r2 ranging from 0.54 to 0.82. These
regressions can be used in irrigation scheduling of almond and pistachio, if Ψstem is either measured
or estimated and a speciﬁc threshold value is selected.
Despite these results, the high cost and operational limitations of the acquisition of high resolution
thermal imagery across the growing season demonstrates a signiﬁcant constraint in using these
technologies operationally for scheduling irrigation. Therefore, we suggest that future studies should
focus on the use of decision-oriented crop models, which are fed by remote sensing data, and have the
ability to spatially simulate crop water status and water requirements across the season. Sentinel (2 and
3) satellites of the European Space Agency (ESA) currently offer multispectral imagery every ﬁve days
at 20 m resolution and thermal imagery at 1 km resolution on a daily basis. While most of scientiﬁc
community agrees about the necessity of having a high-resolution thermal mission for agricultural
purposes, new advances in image sharpening and data assimilation techniques can also be used to
obtain thermal information at higher resolution and to use this information to feed crop models.

1. Introduction
Precision agriculture (PA) is becoming highly signiﬁcant in today’s technologically
advanced world and has been considered as the farm for the future [1]. This is a modern
farming management concept using digital techniques to monitor and optimize agricul-
tural production processes by using technological advancements [2]. PA uses modern
technology and principles to manage the spatial and temporal variability in all aspects
of agricultural production for the goal of improving crop performance [3,4]. Spatial and
temporal variability are terms used to describe variability that have signiﬁcant impacts
on agricultural production. Examples of spatial and temporal variability include yield
variability [5], ﬁeld variability [6], soil variability [7], crop variability [8], and management
variability [9]. The goal is to reduce economical costs, decrease the impact on the envi-
ronment (e.g., by using less water and fertilizers), and increase food production quality
at the same time [10]. Typically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sensor technologies,
satellite navigation and positioning technologies, and the internet of things (IoT) are used
to achieve these goals. PA is increasingly aiding farmers with their job as it makes its way
into ﬁelds across Europe [11]. Larger yields need greater ﬁnancial investment because a
large amount of fertilizers, pesticides, water, and other resources is required. However,
by their proper management, growers can achieve considerable saving on the expected
expenses [12–14]. Further, in addition to increasing the yield by proper monitoring, the
plants’ health and productivity can also increase at the same time, which will allow growers
to meet the demand. Figure 1 depicts the last ten years of documents released by scien-
tists, researchers, and growers, demonstrating that the practice of PA is expanding day by
day. PA has evolved on digital-based farming management approach that monitors and

optimizes agricultural production operations [15]. PA has been now practiced frequently
in cultivation, monitoring and harvesting of: rice [16], wheat [17], maize [18], barley [19],
soybean [20], potato [21], orange [22], olive [23], and many other crops.

Precision viticulture (PV) is a subset of PA, where the same technologies are applied
only on grapevine care and development. In viticulture, the cultivation and study of grapes
are of concern, and it refers to a set of activities in the vineyard [24]. Typically, viticultur-
ists are mainly interested in monitoring and managing the vineyard [25], fertilizing, and
watering [26], canopy management [27], monitoring fruit growth and characteristics [28],
choosing when to harvest [29], and trimming during the speciﬁc months [30]. Viticulturists
and winemakers are commonly linked because vineyard management and grape char-
acteristics provide the basis for wine-making [31]. A vast range of varietals is presently
cultivated in the European Union as actual grapes for wine growing and viticulture [32].
Viticulture is one of the major factors which plays an important role in the economic
developments of majorly the European countries [33]. PV also involves the practice of
grape farmers and winemakers employing a range of information technologies to better
sense and comprehend variability in their production systems. Then, this information is
used to better match production inputs to desired or expected outputs [34]. Crop sensors
and yield monitors, remote sensors, geographic information system (GIS), and global
Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604

navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are some of the components of the PV’s technological
advancements. Therefore, they are a rising trend in the wine industry [35]. Furthermore, PV
is growing substantially because of the improved and cost-effective sensors, methodologies,
and equipment for data acquisition from drones [36].
This bibliometric study presents the analysis on the usage of UAVs in PA and more
speciﬁcally in PV, and presents the analyzed results. Readers can ﬁnd other bibliometric
reviews dedicated to PA and PV, such as research evolution on PA [37], advances in
precision coffee growing research [38], wireless sensor networks in agriculture [39], IoT
in PA [40], digital agriculture [41,42], an investigation of PV production, impact, and
interdisciplinary collaboration involved in viticulture [43], a bibliometric analysis of PV in
Italy [44], Mexican academicians’ contribution to viticulture [45], to gain further information
on PA and PV. Although numerous reviews have been published, to our knowledge, no
bibliometric study has explored on the use of UAVs in PV. The current article ﬁlls this gap
in the literature by identifying the important concerns and potential associated with the use
of UAVs in PV. The remaining sections of this manuscript are as follows: Section 2 discusses
the materials and methods used for the bibliometric analysis, Section 3 discusses brieﬂy
why the UAV is needed in PA, Section 4 discusses why the UAV is needed in PV, Section 5
presents the analyzed results, and Section 6 summarizes the ﬁndings and future scope.
2. Materials and Methods
The usage of UAVs in PA (UAV-PA) and usage of UAVs in PV (UAV-PV) are undeniably
transforming traditional agricultural operations. The number of contributions is constantly
rising throughout the years. In 2020 alone, the number of publications using the terms
UAV-PA and UAV-PV reached 224 and 40, respectively. It is difﬁcult to maintain track of
key developments in the area at such a rapid rate of publishing. By statistically evaluating
published data, bibliometric analytic tools can assist speed up the review process in this
context [41]. Authors working in the use of UAVs in PA research ﬁeld use a variety of
terminologies to refer to the same ideas. In such a fragmented subject, bibliometric analysis
becomes very important. So, to ﬁnd the most important publications, the most inﬂuential
sources, institutions, and nations, we have used bibliometrics tools.
2.1. Materials
In this bibliometric review, the articles from the Scopus database have been considered.
Scopus is an online database that contains nearly all signiﬁcant research publications and
has built-in analytical capabilities for generating representative data. Additionally, the
search results from Scopus can be exported to other software, for additional post process-
ing. For instance, the targeted study used VOSviewer [46] that provides algorithms for
bibliometrics-based analysis of publishing datasets. Co-citation, network analysis, collab-
oration, coupling, and co-word information fetching are also possible. A publication is
indeed the dataset’s base element. Authors, document type, document title, keywords, cited
references, source, year, author address, times cited, and others are connected with each
publication. The targeted study also used the science mapping analysis software tool (Sci-
MAT). SciMAT has been chosen because it facilitates all stages of scientiﬁc mapping, from
data preparation to the development of ﬁeld maps [42,47], and also has a comprehensive
preparation module that veriﬁes the quality of the data [42].
The quality and thoroughness of the outcomes in this work may still be hampered by
constraints in the analysis tools and data ﬁltering procedure. To begin with, the retrieved
data could have left out certain publications. Some publications that did not contain the
sought keywords in the title, abstract, author keywords may have been excluded from the
records because we used a search strategy presented in Table 1. Some publications may be
incorrectly eliminated as a result of manual selection. Finally, we want to express our grati-
tude to the VOSviewer tool and SciMAT for offering the data visualization functionalities
utilized in this study.

2.2. Methods
Research towards the application of UAV-PA and UAV-PV is trending, and further
knowledge should be obtained to progress in these ﬁelds, which is why bibliometric
analysis is vital. As a result, this review is conducted at the appropriate moment to give
a comprehensive knowledge of the utilization of UAV-PA and UAV-PV, as well as future
research possibilities.
2.2.1. Design of the Study
We deﬁned and explored the following questions in order to correctly gain signiﬁcant
knowledge and conduct a bibliometric study on UAV-PA and UAV-PV:
1.
Why are UAVs required in PA? Section 3 of this review study explored the solution to
this question. The purpose of this research question is to examine the developments
in the use of UAV-PV.
2.
What technologies are employed in UAV-PA and UAV-PV? The answer to this question is
explored in further detail in Sections 4 and 5 of this review study.
3.
What nations are pioneering research on the use of UAV-PA and UAV-PV? Sections 4.1 and 5.1
show the solution with their respective publications.
4.
Which journals are chosen by researchers for publication, which funding agencies are accessible,
which prominent researchers are active in the ﬁeld, and which universities/institutions are
active in the ﬁeld of UAV-PA and UAV-PV? The answers to these concerns can be found
in subsections of Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 contains information about
major universities/institutions active in the area of UAV-PA and UAV-PV. In addition,
the future scope towards the PV’s technological development is also reported in
this section.
2.2.2. Data Collection
To address the questions of Section 2.2.1, we examined the publications between 1
January 2006 and 15 November 2021. The most widely utilized publishing databases are
Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus and there were no other options available in the past [48]
about what databases to choose for the bibliometric analysis. However, WoS and Scopus
continue to have the highest data quality and completeness across several categories [49],
and as a result, they are the most commonly employed for bibliometric analysis. Scopus
demonstrated that it has a wider coverage than WoS, which justiﬁes our choice to use only
the ﬁrst.
The data are accessed on 15 November 2021 with keywords reported in Table 1. The
table also reports the type of database used, how many documents have been considered,
time-span of the data collection, the criteria for inclusion and the software used to analyze
the results.
2.2.3. Data Preparation
The data fetched have not been used directly because of missing values in relevant
ﬁelds. Thus, a manual checking has been carried out in order to remove the articles
with incomplete information. Then, the ﬁltered data have been uploaded to SciMAT and
VOSviewer for generating results.
The strategic diagram, thematic network structure and thematic evolution structure
for the most signiﬁcant themes have been generated via SciMAT. The evolutionary map
was constructed using the equivalence index, with solid lines indicating that clusters have
a common theme (Figure 2). In comparison, dashed lines indicate a connection between
non-major terminologies, whereas in some cases, the absence of lines indicates that the
topic gradually ceased to exist from one period to the other [42].

Figure 2. Thematic evolution structure. This demonstrates that the evaluation and association of
keywords increased from 5 to 17 between 2006 and 2021.
In total, 1084 documents were exported from Scopus related to use of UAV-PA with
duplicates being deleted from the list. The phrases that indicated the same thing were then
grouped together, and the data were preprocessed before being entered into software to
create a strategic picture of the topic of research. To achieve the evolutionary map, data
were divided into three sub-periods (2006–2013, 2014–2018, and 2019–2021). Using SciMAT,
it is not possible to create super-periods automatically; thus, it required a manual entry for
the sub-periods. It can be seen that, in the third sub-period (2019–2021), a large number of
articles were published, providing a good indication of what the study ﬁeld would look
Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604

like in the future (as pictorially shown in Figure 1). To determine which topics were most
essential and which clusters they were in, we used the keyword co-occurrence matrix. Data
were normalized and clustered into groups based on the simple centers algorithm using
the equivalence index (EI) to create a network of links between the themes. We compress
the data to a frequency resolution of 2 to create the diagrams. We established a maximum
and minimum network size of 14 and 3, respectively, when we examined the ﬁeld of study.
In the strategic diagram, the horizontal axis (centrality) depicts the importance of each
subject and the number of links it has with other themes, while the vertical axis (density)
depicts the number of connections between each cluster. This graph depicts the relationship
between two or more topics throughout time, for more information about the quadrants,

2.2.4. Data Analysis
In this bibliometric review, the strategies for data analysis is divided into the follow-
ing categories:
•
Worldwide published documents based on year-wise and country-wise on adopting UAV-PA
and UAV-PV: Under this analysis, we analyzed the documents published during the
considered time-span that are fetched from the database, and arranged them according
to the year of publication and presented in graphical form. We applied the same
methods for country-speciﬁc publications.
•
Inﬂuenced authors world wide on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV: The world recognizes
excellent research, and hence, we chose three different categories to identify leading
authors on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV. These are: (i) on the basis of author’s
citation count, (ii) on the basis of most cited documents, and (iii) on the basis of the
number of documents produced by an author, and accordingly, we presented the
results in this manuscript.
•
Most preferred journals and popular funding sponsors: To choose most preferred journals, it
is obvious to go for the number of articles published in the speciﬁc journals on adopting
UAV-PA and UAV-PV, and the same we applied to the popular funding sponsors.
•
Leading institutions based on the citation counts on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV: To
identify leading institutions, we again focused on the citation count of the articles
published by an institute on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV.

2.2.5. Evaluation of the Terminologies towards the Use of UAV-PA
The evaluation of PA terminologies since 2006 is shown in Figure 2 based on their
h-index. These terms can be found by looking at the strategic diagram (Figure 3) with the
help of SciMAT, a software that proved to be the most efﬁcient in determining the trending
keywords (themes). A few of the most frequently used terms (h-index more than 10) and
relevant to this bibliometric study have been extracted from the strategic diagram, and their
thematic network structures are shown in Figure 4, and also, they are brieﬂy introduced
below.
Figure 3. Strategic diagram shows keywords of (a) 2006–2013, (b) 2013–2018 and (c) 2018–2021. The
horizontal axis (centrality) depicts the importance of each subject and the number of links it has
with other themes, while the vertical axis (density) depicts the number of connections between each
cluster.
1.
Vegetation Index (VI): VI is a common term for a class of indices that are used in
agriculture to derive a plant’s status via the observation of their reﬂected spectrum in
multiple bands [50]. Plants take in these lights and reﬂect near infrared (NIR), which a
human eye cannot see. Stressed or dead leaves will show more red light than healthy
leaves. Another term associated with VI is the Normalized Difference VI (NDVI),
where the health status is derived by considering a plant’s reﬂected spectrum in the
near-infrared and that in the visible range (red wavelengths). It is good to use the
NDVI index to ﬁgure out how healthy the plants are and how much biomass they
have. When the ﬁeld is covered in healthy leaves, the NDVI index goes up. If an
area is there with a lot of vegetation, then NDVI may not be able to see very small
changes in the plants. Other approaches based on spectral indices are available and
are quite commonly employed, for more details on indices, one may consult [51].
In addition to monitoring plant health, VI is very important in determining canopy
height, chlorophyll content, when to start fertilizer, and when to start irrigation.
2.
UAVs: UAVs are now becoming more popular when it comes to monitoring, not
only when applied to agriculture but also the other important aspects, such as power-
line inspection, pipeline monitoring, building and structure monitoring etc. UAVs
can ﬂy autonomously over the area and take images of the various regions. The
information regarding where the vulnerabilities are present in the ﬁeld is extracted
from these snapshots using standard tools. A decision support system uses this
information to determine how much fertilizer, water, or other resources are essential
and in what quantities. UAVs are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring,
not just in agriculture, but also in other critical areas, such as power-line inspection,
pipeline monitoring, construction and structural monitoring, and so on.
3.
Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS): The term UAS refers to the ensemble drones,
ground control systems, the cameras, GNSS, the software, maintenance tools that are
required to operate and enable UAVs to ﬂy autonomously or remotely. UAS gives
freedom to the growers to make the decision online and, as an example of UAS system,
the article [52] can be followed to see how the UAV and the associated sensory devices
work in decision making.
Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604
8 of 30
It is critical to note that the term remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems has been
used multiple times to refer to UAS systems. A review of RPA applications in PA
is provided in [53], where the authors use the term RPA to refer to UAVs or drones.
Additionally, the review article [54] discussed drones and RPAs as well as those with
the same name as RPAs that have been used in agriculture. In [55], a technique
for developing and constructing a prototype of a low-cost quadcopter-type RPA for
precision agriculture applications is described.
4.
Sensors: Sensors are becoming less expensive and more advanced as technology
advances. The sensors are the backbone of the PA, providing vital information about
variability in farm areas. Sensors are also utilized to determine the viability of a given
crop being grown on farm area. Wireless sensors have been widely used to collect data
from farm ﬁelds and interact with UASs for further processing and decision making.
It is a good to follow [56] for additional information on sensors and sensory devices.
5.
Detection Methods: There are various kinds of detection methods from the farm
available in the literature that talk about, for example, disease detection [57], crop
row detection [58], fruit detection [59], tree detection [60], weed detection [61], etc.,
using UAV. These detection methods further help in the decision making process in
the farm.
6.
Soils: The ﬁrst and utmost importance is given to soil management for PA [7]. Soil
management is a way of bifurcating the ﬁeld into different categories depending on
soil content. The soil samples can be collected from different points/locations from
the ﬁeld. The soil quality can be measured in the laboratories using the collected
samples and, depending on the categorization, it can be implemented [62]. The color
variations in the images of the soil acquired by drones after plowing the ﬁelds play
an important role in segregating the ﬁelds [7]. However, soil management is usually
very expensive and time-consuming since, in order to be effective, it has to be run
continuously. Similar outcomes but with very less effort can be obtained using UAVs
equipped with RGB cameras: through the acquisition of several RGB images from
the ﬁeld, it is possible to infer whether the soil is sunny-wet, sunny-dry, shadow-wet,
shadow-dry and also other decisions via an off-line image processing [63].
7.
Neural Networks (NNs): PA practices rely on accurate mapping of farmlands. A
neural network is a system for managing and mapping UAV remote sensing for the
best outcomes. When applied to UAVs for PA, NNs proved to be the best in remote
sensing in several situations. A multispectral camera along with the NNs has shown
that a semantic segmentation of citrus orchards is highly achievable with deep neural
networks [64]. Based on an NN technique, a methodology given in [65] proposes an
automatic strategy for the large-scale mapping of date palm trees from very-high-
spatial-resolution UAV images. NNs also played an important role in spraying UAVs.
For example, Khan et al. in [66] proposed an accurate real-time recognition method
based on NNs which is critical for UAV-based sprayers.

3. Why UAV in PA?
It is convincing that as the world’s population grows, there is a need to enhance
what is done on the farm, and UAVs are a reasonable extension of improving productivity
and quality of the crops that will be cultivated [67]. The UAVs should hover over the
ﬁeld and detect areas that have a signiﬁcant infestation that cannot be seen from a distant
location, allowing a range of pesticides to be applied exclusively to smaller regions where
the infections are present [68]. The objective of these efforts is to achieve productivity
gains of 70% by 2050 to satisfy the growing requirements of the Earth’s population while
decreasing the area under agriculture [69]. UAVs fall under the category of aerial robotics,
which is the deployment of devices to perform beneﬁcial tasks, including agriculture which
is the focus of this review study. The designed UAV system should have the required
payload capacity [70] and can ﬂy to survey the area being monitored [71]. In addition (but
not limited to), the system may include near-infrared, visible cameras aboard, the potential
to use thermal cameras [72], and multispectral and hyperspectral cameras.
Technologies of UAV in PA
UAVs have recently been employed in agriculture for large-scale inspections as well
as irrigation [73] and fertilization [74]. A drone’s payload is made up of all the sensors and
actuators attached to it, i.e., (i) multispectral and hyperspectral cameras, (ii) infrared cam-
eras and RGB cameras, (iii) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems [75], and global
navigation satellite system (GNSS). More research into the integration of multi-sensors on
a UAV platform, such as RGB cameras, LiDAR, thermal cameras, and multi/hyperspectral
cameras, is needed to improve PA estimate accuracy [76]. The necessity for a thermal
camera aboard a UAV can be reduced by using the technique outlined in [77]. Due to
the restricted area available for picture collection, UAV photos seldom catch well-watered
plants or arid areas. The thermal camera is not required in the approach such as the one
described in [77], which focuses on certain mapping using just multispectral pictures, might
considerably decrease operating and investment expenses. A good quality image can be
achieved utilizing the suggested methods and control approaches of [78]. This research
also shows that the suggested methods can handle various image datasets, such as those
acquired by frame cameras with variable sensor-to-object distances over some crop ﬁelds.
When evapotranspiration is involved, it is sometimes apparent to utilize thermal
cameras. The current conventional technique for aligning thermal imaging employs GPS
logger data for the initial imagery spot; however, it does not account for changes in
meteorological conditions during the ﬂight, leading to unsatisfactory outcomes. To improve
this scenario, three alignment and calibration techniques based on RGB image alignment
were developed in [79]. According to the ﬁndings of [80], the suggested thermal calibration
technique based on temperature-controlled standards can provide appropriate precision
and accuracy for UAV-based canopy temperature estimates applied to PA.
4. Why UAV in PV?
The key to success for any PV strongly depends on the collection of the maximum
amount of geo-referenced information of the whole vineyard and the technologies used
to monitor. Since the late twentieth century, UAVs have advanced quickly. UAV remote
sensing has been swiftly put into reality as agricultural remote sensing has improved.
Vegetation coverage monitoring, growth tracking, and yield estimates are among the most
common types of ﬁeld growth data collected using UAV platforms [81]. In addition, UAVs
have partially solved terrestrial and high-altitude remote sensing shortcomings, offering
substantial support for PA crop information monitoring technologies [82].
4.1. Technologies of UAV in PV
The initial phase in the wine-making process is viticulture. The circumstances of the
vineyard and human decisions in the vineyard determine the quality of wine [83]. The
human decision for PV is based on the data received from the UAV sensors and attached
Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604
11 of 30
tools [84]. The location of the vineyard inﬂuences the ﬂavor of the grapes grown. The
majority of PV research is focused on vegetation index information [85]. The vegetation
index data may be gathered using multispectral cameras placed on the UAVs [86]. Changes
in items that affect our environment, such as water quality and plant cover, are measured
using these cameras. It is now feasible to build maps of vegetation coverage for the whole
region under examination using these cameras on UAVs. Using remotely sensed data, the
NDVI has been utilized to reveal discrepancies in grapevine performance. The NDVI is
calculated using the formula
NDVI = ρnir − ρred
ρnir + ρred
,
(1)
where ρnir and ρred are the reﬂectance levels in the near-infrared and in the red spectrum,
respectively [87]. In numerous investigations, NDVI readings in vineyards have been
related to leaf area index (LAI). The relationship between NDVI and vineyard LAI is well
known because NDVI is strongly linked to the gross quantity of chlorophyll. Increasing
leaf area leads to a higher gross quantity of chlorophyll per unit area of the vineyard. LAI
is a major physiological component for characterizing crop growth models and vegetation
indices for expressing crop growth status. The NDVI does not have a linear connection with
LAI. Using UAV platforms, many studies on spectral data monitoring growth indicators
such as LAI [88,89] have been conducted. Authors in [90] describe three models that use
a quad-rotor UAV platform with a digital camera to examine the link between LAI and
canopy coverage. A UAV ﬁtted with hyperspectral cameras was deployed to evaluate
different cultivars to illustrate the feasibility of LAI monitoring in the context of PA [91].
Various methods of calculating vegetation indices have been used throughout history;
however, the most often researched vegetation indices are given in [92].
Multispectral cameras collect data from the electromagnetic spectrum across different
bands, or frequency intervals [93]. In particular, they are used for the NIR spectrum,
speciﬁcally in the range 800–850 nm, since this band is important for determining the health
of plants [94]. In the NIR spectrum, plants emit up to 60% of their total electromagnetic
radiated energy [95]. For measuring vegetation on the ground, differences in reﬂected
light in the NIR part of the spectrum are critical. Multispectral remote sensing datasets
are used to detect light energy reﬂected from objects on the earth’s surface and estimate
various physical and chemical characteristics of things that are not visible to the naked
eye. Following that, the measurements provide us with information about what is on the
ground. For example, vegetation is typically indicated by pixels with a spectrum containing
much NIR light energy.
The growers starts with the grape variety, and once that is achieved, understanding
the soil for them becomes important. Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the decision
making process for the categorization of the soil (mainly the ﬁeld of plots on which the
grapevine is cultivated). The acquisition of aerial photographs takes place in the ﬁrst block.
The photographs are used in the second block to create a mosaicked image of the site under
consideration [96]. This mosaicked image is also used to analyze the relationship between
various surface soil properties, such as organic matter, moisture, clay, silt, sand, and other
soil content, and then, the soil is categorized accordingly. When the vegetation indices value
were utilized as input data in trained techniques, the best performance in the categorization
of vineyard soil RGB pictures was obtained, with overall accuracy values around 0.98 and
high sensitivity values for the soil [97]. To monitor farmland soil parameters and crop
growth, the UAV’s remote sensing have been equipped with high-resolution hyperspectral
sensors [98].

The use of UAVs equipped with RGB cameras has some limitations; indeed, during
the ﬁrst tillage process when the ﬁelds are usually covered in vegetation and/or crop
leftovers, soil images cannot be shot. In addition, sometimes it is challenging to take
photographs in uneven terrain that affects the grape production. Elevation, latitude, slope,
and aspect are among the geographical elements that inﬂuence grape production [99]. For
instance, in many of the world’s best wine areas, nearby water and mountains have a strong
impact [100] as also temperature, sunshine, and wind [36]. Degree days are used to quantify
the amount of heat that accumulates over the course of the growing season [101]. The
amount of heat necessary for grapes to reach maturity varies depending on the grape type.
Photosynthesis and taste development require sunlight [102]. However, too much
exposure to sunlight might result in sunburn and shriveling of grapes. So, when planning
a vineyard, row orientation and sunshine are critical considerations. It is required to make
sure the afternoon sun is shining on the non-exposed section of the fruit [103]. In [104], a
technique for evaluating heat and radiative stress impacts in terms of temperature at the
cluster and canopy level is suggested. A high-resolution thermal monitoring method is
described, which uses a UAV and a wireless sensor network (WSN) to integrate remote
and proximal sensing.
Irrigation is required frequently in the summer due to dry weather or a lack of water-
holding capacity while, on the other hand, it is a common practice to give a vine as little
water as possible once it has reached full maturity [105]. In this regards, the amount of
water stress is crucial in order to decide when the irrigation should start, as well as its
duration. Furthermore, in this case, UAV-endowed image acquisition equipment can be
fruitfully exploited for the inspection of the targeted area, as sketched in Figure 6. For
example, in [106], a model utilizing UAVs is developed to evaluate on a plant-by-plant
basis stress sectors within the vineyard for optimal irrigation management and to detect
geographic variability within the vineyards.
The quantity of water accessible to the vine and the nutrients it requires are determined
by the soil type [107]. The macronutrients that we require are mostly nitrogen, phospho-
rus, and potassium [108]. From vineyard architecture to clonal and rootstock selection,
viticultural decisions are made to suit the speciﬁc characteristics of each location [109].
For example, because grapevines are sensitive to phylloxera, a soil parasite, the resistant
rootstock is frequently utilized to protect the vine [110].
Growers must consider vine density, row spacing, and direction while creating a
new vineyard so that distant sensing would be simple [111]. Canopy management is
one of the important measures to take by the growers. It requires continuous inspection
throughout the year. However, these operations are time-consuming and difﬁcult for the
entire vineyard. The use of photogrammetric methods has shown to be effective to this
aim [27]. Increased airﬂow and sunshine in the fruiting zone and lower disease pressure
may be achieved by canopy management [112]. By maintaining the vineyard ﬂoor, farmers
may impact soil fertility and water availability [113]. Cover crops are mowed to limit
competition or used to reduce surplus soil moisture. Plants that affect the growth of the
vine are removed by tilling nitrogen-rich cover crops into the soil [114]. In [30], a novel
approach for assessing vineyard trimming is suggested, wherein UAV technology is used
to produce photogrammetric point clouds, which are then analyzed using object-based
image analysis algorithms.

The biggest obstacle for viticulturists is the weather, also because they have no control
on it. In a particular year, hail, spring frost, drought, extreme heat, and rain can lower
yields or degrade fruit quality. Pests and diseases also pose a danger to the vineyard’s
long-term viability. Powdery mildew is the most prevalent illness in most cases. In [115],
the authors propose a spatial-spectral segmentation technique for analyzing hyperspectral
imaging data obtained from UAVs and applying it to predicting powdery mildew infection
levels in undamaged grape bunches before veraison. Beginning with bud break, farmers
must be proactive in planning for and responding to this situation. Grapes are ﬁlled with
sugar as they get closer to ripeness, and when the fruit ripens, the sugar will leak through
the skin, providing a valuable food supply for the naturally existing fungus in the vines.
When this happens, it gets a disease called Botrytis bunch rot [116]. Grapevine viruses such
as leafroll, and bacterial infections like Pierce’s are spread by insects and require special
care [117]. It is required to employ integrated pest management to identify the appropriate
treatment approach. Control measures include anything from cultural techniques to canopy
management, vineyard ﬂoor operations, and perhaps, pesticides.
One of the most severe obstacles to present grapevine farming practices is a lack
of personnel. As technology develops and labor prices rise, we may expect increased
mechanization in the vineyard. As a result, growers must now address the problem of
sustainability and consider using an alternate strategy that incorporates UAVs to save time.

6. Findings and Discussion
This bibliometric analysis is intended to provide scholars working in this ﬁeld with
an update on UAV-PA and UAV-PV. This survey also recommended the popular journal
favored by researchers to publish their work, the popular funding agencies accessible,
popular nations, and popular authors based on their citations leading the research in using
UAVs for PA. This survey revealed the use of UAV-PA and UAV-PV plays an essential
role in increasing crop quality and yield by remote sensing the farm’s health and status.
This approach greatly reduces labor costs, manpower, and time for growers and vineyard
managers. Growers increase their production potential by using this approach since it
keeps the plants healthier and longer, allowing them to supply to the world, which is
the primary goal of using UAVs in PA. Viticulture is a key economic element in several
European nations. PV refers to the practice of grape growers and winemakers of using
various information technology tools. These tools required to better sense and grasp
variability in their production systems and then using that knowledge to better match
production inputs to desired or expected outputs. Crop sensors and yield monitors, remote
sensors, GIS, and GNSS systems rely on PV technical advances, which is a growing trend
in the wine business. The enhanced and cost-effective sensors, methods, and equipment for
data gathering from UAVs are driving signiﬁcant growth in PV. In a sense, the UAVs are
proving to be the backbone of PA. Furthermore, there are many other options of sensors for
vineyards available. Especially, the proximal sensors that have proved to be one of the key
elements for the management of treatments and interventions within the vineyards. For
example, tractors and also unmanned ground vehicles have been designed to be able to
perform site-speciﬁc tasks without human intervention, credit to sensors that can keep an
eye on the plant’s health on-the-go [130]; an experiment was carried out without human
intervention during the night using an all-terrain vehicle developed in [131] to which
various sensors were attached to obtain an image of the vine in order to identify the berries;
in [132], a technique based on optical sensors is proposed for different irrigation treatments
to vineyards, allowing a non-invasive evaluation of plant water stress dynamics in a timely
manner; in [133], an experiment is conducted on 21 individual branches under various
canopy treatments, utilizing the proximal sensor to improve the accuracy of vineyard
yield estimation.
In the ﬁeld of PV, there have been numerous developments in the use of UAV-PV. A
few of these are mentioned here, although there are more throughout the paper.
•
Soil categorization: When the vegetation indices values were utilized as input data in
trained techniques, the best performance in the categorization of vineyard soil RGB
pictures was obtained, with overall accuracy values around 0.98 and high sensitiv-
ity values for the soil [97]. To monitor farmland soil parameters and crop growth,
Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604
22 of 30
the UAV’s remote sensing have been equipped with high-resolution hyperspectral
sensors [98].
•
Weed detection and control: In vineyards, bermudagrass is a major issue. The spectral
closeness of grapevines and bermudagrass makes it tough to distinguish the two
species using just spectral information from a multi-band image sensor. Using ultra-
high spatial resolution UAV pictures and object-based image analysis, this problem has
been solved and the accuracy of this approach to distinguishing between grapevines
and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) is better than 97.7% [134]. Additionally, an al-
gorithm is proposed in [135] for detecting and mapping the presence of bermudagrass
based on spatial information, as well as for accurately mapping the presence of vines,
cover crops, Cynodon dactylon, and bare soil in order to apply site-speciﬁc treatment
to the vegetation. Furthermore, this research claims to be effective in controlling
bermudagrass in a short amount of time. As a result, the combination of UAV imagery
and the algorithm would enable farmers to continue cover crop-based management
schemes in their vineyards while also controlling bermudagrass.
•
Disease detection: Disease detection is essential in preventing the disease from spreading
further in the vineyard. If the disease spreads in vineyards, it has severe economic
effects for the growers, and detecting the disease in the vineyard is one of the most
difﬁcult tasks for viticulturists. A deep learning technique was reported in [136] to
identify areas of infection in the grapevine using the UAV by taking images in the
visible domain and then processing them with convolution neural networks to detect
the symptoms. This paper also claims that the technique used is more than 95.8%
accurate in detecting the infection. Flavescence dorée, a form of grape vine disease,
that can be identiﬁed using UAV multispectral data as reported in [57]. This study also
examines the potential for 20 variables, i.e., 11 related to vegetation indices, 5 depend
on spectral bands, and 4 associated with biophysical parameters, to be computed
from UAV multispectral imagery in order to remotely identify symptomatic from
asymptomatic areas in a vineyard.
•
Monitoring the vegetation and irrigation control: Due to the direct relation between ra-
diation interception and evaporative surface, the canopy cover maps are used for
irrigation management primarily in order to calculate the basic evapotranspire coefﬁ-
cient. Crop size and temporal development rely on the water supply, and crop canopy
maps are accordingly measured to identify spatial irrigation system consistency. The
results of [137] showed that the green-red vegetation index (GRVI) is appropriate for
assessing vegetation cover. When it came to recognizing phenological crop changes
and detecting variety in ﬁeld irrigation, the GRVI outperformed the NDVI. Motohka
et al. [138] suggested the usage of GRVI, which may be calculated using the formula
GRVI = ρgreen − ρred
ρgreen + ρred
,
(2)
where ρgreen is green reﬂectance, and ρred is reﬂectance of visible red. This GRVI is
used to determine (i) Green vegetation: ρgreen is higher than ρred, (ii) Soils: ρgreen is
lower than ρred, and (iii) Water or snow: ρgreen and ρred are almost the same.
•
Grapevine maturity: It was discovered in [139] that by using spectral information
gathered from a UAV, it is possible to distinguish between vines of various vigor in
a Guyot-trained, mature vineyard of ‘Sangiovese’ located in Tuscany. A system for
determining the ripeness of grape clusters has been developed by the researchers in
Spain [140]. When a grape begins to become bluish, it is presumed to be ripe, and
using simple image processing and ﬁltering, it is possible to identify mature grape
clusters in a short amount of time.
•
Yield estimation: Forecasting yields is critical for harvest management and scheduling
wine-making activities. Traditional yield prediction approaches are time-consuming
and depend on manual sampling, making it challenging to account for vineyards’
inherent geographical variability. In [140], an unsupervised and automated method for
Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604
23 of 30
detecting grape clusters in red grapevine types is established using UAV photogram-
metric technique and color indices, with R2 values greater than 0.82. This precision
gained in grape detection opens the door to red grape vineyard production prediction.
Every farmer aspires to forecast their vineyard’s yield estimation in advance, and
hence yield prediction is an important issue in vineyard management in order to
achieve the required grape production and quality. In [141], an automated system is
being developed that can predict yield estimation (5 weeks before harvest) using high-
resolution RGB photos and a UAV platform throughout the vineyard. A technique
has also been developed in [142] for capturing multispectral imagery through UAV,
which is then processed together with artiﬁcial neural networks to create a relationship
between the vegetation index, vegetated fraction cover, and yield. This technique
demonstrates that when machine learning is used, the outcomes are signiﬁcantly
more accurate. Although promising results were obtained earlier in the development
process, more exact yield forecasts were achieved when images were captured nearer
to the harvest date.
During the study and utilizing the Scopus database, it was discovered that more than
80 countries are working on UAV adoption in PA as of 15 November 2021, with a large
number of articles relevant to the use of UAVs for PA having been published internationally.
The United States have provided the most papers and is the country that has released
the most documentation on the use of UAVs for PA, followed by China, Italy, Spain, and
Brazil. The top three publications favored by researchers working on UAV adoption for
PA are (i) Remote Sensing, (ii) Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, and (iii) Nongye
Gongcheng Xuebao Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. There
are three major funding agencies in this ﬁeld: China’s National Science Foundation, the
European Commission, and China’s Ministry for Science and Technology.
PV is becoming more popular internationally as well. Globally, the use of UAV-PV is
trending towards Italy, where many researchers and academicians are working, followed
by Spain, and ﬁnally, the United States. Researchers preferred journals on using UAV-PV
are (i) Remote Sensing, (ii) Acta Horticulturae, and (iii) Computers and Electronics in
Agriculture. Two primary ﬁnancing agencies for this area are (i) the European Commission
and (ii) the European Regional Development Fund.
The major institutions working in this ﬁeld are also worth mentioning (based on their
citations), which are included in Table 6.

6.1. Some Lights on Economic Analysis
This section reports some costs that small growers can incur in case they want to
use/implement UAV-PA technologies, such that a rough idea of a possible investment can
be inferred. In particular, we brieﬂy discuss the economic analysis in [36], where typical
costs of service providers are given, and we also add further information regarding the
costs in case an ad hoc custom solution is going to be implemented.
Farmers using UAVs to perform PA are aiming for high-quality images with high
precision, as well as the ability to take measurements from the ﬁeld at any time they choose.
Due to high spatial resolution of imagery, high operational ﬂexibility, and low operational
costs, UAVs have demonstrated that they can compete with traditional acquisition plat-
forms (such as satellites and aircraft). It has been observed that for small landholders with
an area of around 5 ha, UAVs appear to be the most cost-effective solution due to their
Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604
24 of 30
low cost in data acquisition and use of advanced sensor technologies [36]. In [36], three
broad categories of cost analysis were considered with 100 images of the crop captured
by UAVs, and this service was purchased from a third party, namely data acquisition,
georeferencing and orthorectiﬁcation, and image processing. The cost of data acquisition is
e1500, which includes the cost of organizing and carrying out the acquisition campaign
to obtain the raw images; the cost of georeferencing and orthorectiﬁcation is e500; and
the cost of image processing is e200. Depending on where you live, services from UAV
providers can cost anywhere from $12 per hectare for raw image ﬁles to $70 per hectare
for an orthomosaic image in the United States [143]. If one does not wish to use a service
provider, another viable option is the AgriQ [144], which is a $1400 UAV that is developed
for PA. AgriQ consists of three subsystems: the drone, the multispectral imaging system,
and the open-source software that computes useful information for farmers [145]. The
authors approached the problem from four angles: (1) the drone’s construction; (2) the
vision algorithms; (3) the autonomous trajectory taking into account all parameters in
order to properly recover all of the crops’ visual information; and (4) the development of a
low-cost multispectral imaging system with multiple bands.
6.2. Future Possibilities
Acquiring and analyzing spectral data requires considerable additional cost and
skill sets that are frequently unavailable; therefore, the identiﬁcation of geometric indices
that enable the monitoring of spatial variability using low-cost instruments based on
photogrammetry techniques and high-resolution RGB cameras will be critical in future.
There is a need for the rapid evolution of a yield forecast methodology based on UAV data
and machine learning techniques in order to avoid routine human engagement. Various
techniques for irrigation monitoring in a vineyard using UAVs have been developed, but
research is still lagging, and future research directions could include automated irrigation
based on crop water needs and monitoring of vines based on their physiology, more
precisely, control of grapevine irrigation based on plant-based models. It is now necessary
to develop a web-based one-stop service for UAV adoption in PV (and PA), which will
assist in providing information related to supporting ﬁeld operations in the vineyard,
health monitoring of the vines and grapes, canopy management, and other key areas, as
well as providing online digital content that is accessible from any location. Finally, but
certainly not least, a UAV system with the bare minimal payload required for maximum
surveillance of the vineyards should be designed so as to make it cost effective and that can
be frequently used by the growers.

Abstract: This study investigates how wireless sensor network (WSN) applications in agriculture are
discussed in the current academic literature. On the basis of bibliometric techniques, 2444 publications
were extracted from the Scopus database and analyzed to identify the temporal distribution of
WSN research, the most productive journals, the most cited authors, the most inﬂuential studies,
and the most relevant keywords. The computer program VOSviewer was used to generate the
keyword co-occurrence network and partition the pertinent literature. Findings show the remarkable
growth of WSN research in recent years. The most relevant journals, cited countries, and inﬂuential
studies were also identiﬁed. The main results from the keyword co-occurrence clustering and the
detailed analysis illustrate that WSN is a key enabler for precision agriculture. WSN research also
focuses on the role of other technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artiﬁcial
intelligence, and unmanned aerial vehicles in supporting several agriculture activities, including
smart irrigation and soil management. This study illuminates researchers’ and practitioners’ views
of what has been researched and identiﬁes possible opportunities for future studies. To the authors’
best knowledge, this bibliometric study represents the ﬁrst attempt to map global WSN research
using a comprehensive sample of documents published over nearly three decades.
Keywords: wireless sensor networks; agriculture; precision agriculture; Internet of Things; bibliometrics
1. Introduction
The global population has witnessed considerable growth from 2.5 billion in 1950
to 7.8 billion today. It is estimated that the world population will reach 9.7 billion by
2050 [1]. As the most prominent food source, agriculture has played a major role in human
civilization [2,3]. However, the exponential increase in food demand due to population
growth creates several pressing problems: water and air pollution, greenhouse gas emis-
sions, and global warming. These issues, coupled with resource scarcity, accentuate the
urgent need for adopting novel and sustainable solutions [3–5]. Several researchers have
incorporated cutting-edge technologies to address these problems, including wireless sen-
sor networks (WSN) [6,7], the Internet of Things (IoT) [8–10], artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)
techniques [11–13], spatial technologies [14], remote sensing [15,16], computing technolo-
gies [17–19], blockchain technology [20,21], big data [8,22], and radio frequency identiﬁca-
tion (RFID) [23]. These technologies gave birth to smart and precision agriculture, which is
estimated to reach $15.3 billion in worth by 2025 [24].
As a collection of sensor nodes [25], WSN is of vital importance due to its enabling
role in providing data for other layers and technologies. Conceptually, WSN consists

of numerous smart battery-powered nodes connecting through a wireless network. En-
hancements in micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) make these nodes smaller, less
expensive, and energy-efﬁcient. These nodes are distributed across the ﬁeld and are respon-
sible for collecting data from the farm and environment. These various data include soil
moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop conditions, to name a few. Furthermore, minor
processing is enabled by the microcontrollers built in these nodes. Data and information
are transmitted directly or indirectly to a base station or a hub. This results in considerable
improvements in the decision-making process [2,26,27]. The signiﬁcant beneﬁts and capa-
bilities WSN offer (e.g., monitoring, automation, optimization, etc.) have prompted several
scholars to investigate the potential of this technology for agriculture. For example, [28]
highlighted the vital importance of WSN in precision agriculture. The authors discuss the
use of different sensors in sensing different parameters and the application of various com-
munication technologies for data transmission. Thakur et al. [29] investigated the extant
literature and summarized the different WSN technologies for implementing precision
agriculture. The role of WSN in monitoring ﬁelds, optimizing irrigation, and measuring
temperature and soil property is also illustrated. Similarly, Refs. [30,31] explored agricul-
tural challenges and WSN solutions, including resources optimization, decision-making
support, land monitoring, and energy efﬁciency. Ruiz-Garcia et al. [32] investigated the de-
velopments and applications of WSN and RFID in agriculture. Aznoli and Navimipour [33]
explored the enabling strategies as one of the most challenging aspects of incorporating
WSN in agriculture. Moreover, Refs. [2,26,34] were among a plethora of researchers who
synthesized WSN research in the agricultural literature. Although these studies contribute
to the WSN ﬁeld from different perspectives, a structured systematic review based on
a quantitative approach such as bibliometrics is still missing. Therefore, guided by the
study of [35], we aim to ﬁll this gap and examine the extant literature surrounding WSN
applications in the agriculture sector. More speciﬁcally, in this investigation we attempt to
seek answers to the following questions:
1.
What are the publication dynamics on the interplay between WSN and agriculture?
2.
How is WSN being used in agriculture?
3.
What are the main research gaps regarding WSN applications in agriculture?
By answering these questions, our study provides signiﬁcant insights, exploring the
entire ﬁeld of WSN applications and its journey in the agriculture domain. The current
study offers academicians and practitioners a signiﬁcant understanding of the potential
for WSN in agriculture, the current state of the literature, research hotspots, and future
research directions. This could advance their knowledge in the ﬁeld, identify research gaps,
and inform them of successful practices necessary to implement WSN in agriculture.
The article proceeds as follows. Bibliometric approach and protocols are discussed in
Section 2. The main ﬁndings, including descriptive analysis, keywords analysis, clustering
analysis, are explained in Section 3. Section 4 discusses in detail the results of the keyword
co-occurrence network. The last section brieﬂy concludes the paper.
2. Methodology
Among literature review methodologies, bibliometric analysis is a powerful quantita-
tive tool using different measures to extract the behavior and dynamics of a knowledge
domain [36–39]. We drew on best practices [38,40–42] to investigate in a comprehensive
and objective way the entire ﬁeld of WSN in agriculture. Scopus was selected to conduct
this study because it is regarded as one of the most reliable and trustworthy databases
with the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed research utilized by many
scholars [43–45]. Figure 1 illustrates the research process. Keywords including “wireless
sensor network”, “WSN”, “agriculture”, “farming”, “farmer*”, and “agricultural” were
searched in titles, abstracts, and keywords. The keywords were connected with the logical
connectors OR and AND. We carried out a truncated search for one keyword by including
one asterisk (*). For instance, “farmer*” can represent “farmers”. The timespan was set
from 2002 to 2021. All types of documents were included in the analysis. Table 1 shows the

and the web-based data analysis framework Biblioshiny [48] were adopted for the text
mining and quantitative analysis of the ﬁndings.

3. Descriptive Analysis
3.1. Annual Distribution of Papers
Figure 2 portrays the evolution of publications that addressed WSN applications in
agriculture. After the ﬁrst publication in 2002, research on WSN experienced slow and grad-
ual growth. This trend continued until 2006, when the number of publications increased
threefold compared to the previous year. Later, we observed a signiﬁcant increase between
2006 and 2010. This could be explained by advancements in computing technologies,
wireless network services, and the miniaturization of sensor systems. From 2011 to 2016, it
appears that the literature witnessed considerable growth. There was also an exponential
growth rate in the use of WSN in agriculture between 2017 and 2020; the publication count
soared remarkably. The incorporation of novel complementary technologies, speciﬁcally
IoT with WSN in agriculture, is important in this stage. The latest year, 2021, is still not
ﬁnished at the time of this analysis, and we expect that the number of publications will
continue to rise and reach a new peak.

is still not finished at the time of this analysis, and we expect that the number of publi
tions will continue to rise and reach a new peak.

Four papers have received more than 400 citations. The top-ranked paper, [58], inves-
tigated the applications and design challenges for wireless underground sensor networks
(WUSNs), including soil and environmental monitoring, problems of the underground
communication channel, and challenges at each layer of the communication protocol stack.
The second-most cited paper explored the role of WSN and RFID in agriculture and the food
supply chain [32]. The paper’s ﬁndings suggest that the agrifood industry could beneﬁt
from integrating these technologies in several ways, such as early warning in emergencies
and maintenance, energy efﬁciency, and cost efﬁciency. Furthermore, [27] provided a com-
prehensive review accompanied by global and Indian cases about WSN potentials, applica-
tions, architectures, different sensors, and challenges in agriculture. Likewise, [2] explored
the WSN and wireless sensor actor network (WSAN) applications in agriculture and
brought signiﬁcant insights. These applications include irrigation, fertilization, pest control,
animal and pasture monitoring, greenhouse, and viticulture.
Furthermore, four papers have achieved more than 50 citations per year. In the paper
with the most citations per year, [4] argued that the enabling role of IoT in integrating
several technologies, including WSN, might represent a paradigm shift in the smart agri-
culture domain and could contribute to resource efﬁciency, food security, and productivity.
The third publication in terms of citations per year [49] emphasized the importance of IoT
in WSN and agriculture. Muangprathub et al. [49] developed a system to optimize crop
watering based on WSN. The proposed system consisted of three components: physical,
web application, and mobile application. The authors also used data-mining techniques to
enhance watering efﬁciency and efﬁcacy for crop growth optimization.

From the table, the keywords used in the search algorithm are among the top ranks
on both sides. Considering the authors’ side, researchers have studied the importance of
different aspects of WSN in smart agriculture and greenhouse. For instance, the primary
applications of WSN in agriculture comprise environmental monitoring, irrigation, and soil
moisture sensing. In addition, energy efﬁciency is one of the most critical factors in design-
ing WSN applications, and it can be achieved by several mechanisms such as clustering
and routing protocols. WSN telecommunication protocols and methods such as long range
radio “LoRa” and “Zigbee” are among the top ranks. Furthermore, the combination of
WSN, unmanned aerial vehicles “UAV”, and RIFD is beneﬁcial for agriculture monitoring
and tracking of agricultural goods from farm to market [23,67–71]. The keyword “IoT”
is ranked second, indicating the vital role of IoT in enhancing precision agriculture and
smart farming by integrating several technologies, including WSN and cloud computing.
The keywords plus mostly reinforce the authors’ keywords with the various insights it
provided. Besides common keywords, the keywords “monitoring”, “energy utilization”,
and “wireless telecommunication systems” fortify the insights extracted from the authors’
side. Keywords plus also highlight the increasing importance of agricultural robots and
their integration with WSN.
3.6. Treemap Dynamics
To complement our keywords analysis, we conducted an analysis of abstract key-
words. Abstract keywords with high frequency are illustrated in the treemap (see Figure 3).
The size of rectangles is proportional to the frequency of the keywords. The larger the
rectangle, the more frequently the keyword is used in the abstracts. Abstract keywords
can provide more detailed information to authors’ keywords and keywords plus analyses.
Analyzing the three forms of keywords allows scholars to study keywords dynamics more
comprehensively and precisely [72]. From the ﬁgure, on the left side, “sensor”, “wireless”,
“data”, “network”, “system”, “agriculture”, “monitoring”, “WSN”, “paper”, “networks”,
and “nodes” are the most popular abstract keywords. The current analysis shows con-
sistency with previous analyses and provides more details. For instance, the primary
Sustainability 2021, 13, 12011

goal of WSN implementations in agriculture is to capture, monitor, and control data and
information from ﬁelds and surrounding environments. WSN can be used to sense soil
moisture, temperature, conductivity, and acidity. Furthermore, irrigation can be supported
by the use of WSN due to its ability to facilitate water quality monitoring and soil moisture
sensing. The critical importance of energy and power consumption and management,
paired with cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, is highlighted as a driving force toward
precision and smart agriculture development. Moreover, the architecture, algorithm, and
communication protocols for connecting sensor nodes such as IEEE are also emphasized.
Overall, abstract keywords analysis adds to our insights by underscoring the importance
of designing WSN applications and systems to improve crop yields, maximize operational
efﬁciencies, and increase sustainability in agriculture.

3.7. Trending Topics Analysis
To enrich previous analyses, we conducted trending topics analysis. We considered
authors’ keywords as the unit of analysis. The map was generated based on log frequency.
By carrying out trending topics analysis, we depicted the evolution of WSN applications
in agriculture and their related emerging and hotspot topics, as portrayed by Figure 4.
WSN gained the most signiﬁcant attention in 2017 as one of the most important enablers
of precision agriculture. In 2018, the energy efﬁciency and security of WSN applications
became a mainstream topic, followed by developments in clustering and computing
techniques for improvements in energy efﬁciency and performance in 2019. The most
critical keyword appearing more frequently as a trending topic in 2019 was IoT due to
its capability to integrate multiple technologies with high efﬁciency and efﬁcacy. Various
technologies have become popular topics in this ﬁeld. We expect that the evolution and
utilization of complementary cutting-edge technologies will occur alongside WSN in
agriculture as time passes.
At the starting point of the analysis in 2010, ubiquitous computing and informa-
tion technologies (U-IT) became popular, followed by the proliferation of open-source
lightweight operation systems (tinyOS) operating in 2011 and geospatial technologies,
including GIS in 2011 and GPS in 2016. Moreover, RFID for products, livestock, and agricul-
ture monitoring attracted attention in 2014, while remote sensing technologies (e.g., UAVs
or drones) started trending in 2016 and accelerated thereafter. In recent years, AI techniques
Sustainability 2021, 13, 12011

such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) and machine learning (ML) have been among hot
topics, reﬂecting the possibilities of these novel technologies and methods to revolutionize
and transform traditional agriculture into more intelligent agriculture and farming.

4. Discussion of Research Foci
We adopted keywords co-occurrence analysis among various clustering techniques
such as co-citation network analysis or bibliographic coupling [73,74]. Although all these
techniques are powerful methods to identify different paradigms in a research domain,
the method was conducted ﬁrst to enrich the previous keywords analyses and, second,
because the method enables us to extract the actual content of publications [43]. Keyword
co-occurrence analysis provides insights into various research foci that contribute to the
development of knowledge at the intersection of WSN and agriculture. This relational
bibliometric method ﬁnds the author keywords (unit of analysis) that have appeared in
articles simultaneously. It sets the more frequent ones as clusters. As a result, scholars
could gain important insights about knowledge divergence and different paradigms at
the intersection of WSN and agriculture [39,75]. To generate the network, we started by
extracting authors’ keywords in selected papers and reﬁning them when necessary. For
instance, the full-length keywords were abbreviated (e.g., the phrase Wireless Sensor and
Actuator Network was replaced with WSAN). Next, the resulting data were imported to
VOSviewer. The network was constructed by conducting density-based spatial clustering
based on the full counting method [76]. The minimum number of keyword co-occurrence
was set at ﬁve, which makes ﬁndings different if this cutoff is lower or higher than this
value (see Table 6). For instance, too low a cutoff value may result in a large number of
clusters in the network, which does not provide a clear view of the research topics focused
upon and entails some degree of subjectivity in regard to which clusters should be included
in the keyword co-occurrence analysis [77]. However, too high a cutoff value may lead to
Sustainability 2021, 13, 12011
10 of 22
only a few keywords being clustered, which reduces the representativeness and reliability
of the clustering outcomes [78]. Therefore, to obtain a meaningful visualization, a cutoff
value of ﬁve recommended by prior studies [79–81] was applied in our review to obtain
a manageable number of clusters for the analysis [78]. Accordingly, a network with ﬁve
clusters was generated (see Figure 5). In the ﬁgure, each node represents a keyword, and
the size of the node is proportional to its frequency. The color of nodes indicates cluster
membership for the keywords. Table 7 presents the top ten most frequent keywords in each
cluster. In the subsequent sections, we support our bibliometric analysis with a qualitative
review of WSN-related studies to provide in-depth details to the results of the keyword
co-occurrence network. More speciﬁcally, we discuss the studies addressing the content of
identiﬁed clusters. The analysis of each cluster offers valuable insights into existing and
emerging themes within WSN research in the agriculture context.

4.1. Potentials of WSN for Precision Agriculture
Table 7 reveals that cluster 1 revolves around the critical role of WSN in precision
agriculture. The most important keywords in this cluster are “WSN”, “Precision Agricul-
ture”, “Zigbee”, and “Agriculture”. As a promising technology in precision agriculture,
WSN is expected to modernize data collection in the agricultural ﬁeld and support the
automation of agriculture systems, which necessitate intensive sensing of environmental
circumstances at the ground level [82]. The increasing use of WSN applications in precision
agriculture enhances the efﬁciency and productivity of different agricultural production
systems. According to [83], farmers could gain additional insights about their ﬁelds and
identify their best solution by utilizing WSN. Elijah et al. [4] posit that the ability of WSN
to self-organize, self-conﬁgure, self-diagnose, and self-heal has made the technology an
excellent alternative for smart agriculture. WSN can be used to collect data related to
soil moisture, weather temperature, control irrigation processes, and support farming
decision-making [51]. Therefore, the basic aim of WSN adoption in agriculture is data
collection, environmental monitoring, and data analysis [28,29].
Scholars have developed several protocols for sensor nodes communication and WSN
implementation, including Zigbee, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. As one of the most suitable
tools for precision agriculture applications, Zigbee facilitates irrigation supervision, water
quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide monitoring, all of which need a cyclic
information update [51]. Because of its energy-efﬁcient, ﬂexible, reliable, and affordable
wireless protocol, Zigbee simpliﬁes the monitoring of a wide variety of environmental
conditions, including soil health, weed-disease detection, crop growth, and agricultural
product quality [84]. Precision agriculture is a well-suited ﬁeld for the integration of
Zigbee. For example, [85] developed an intelligent irrigation system based on the Zigbee
network protocol. In this system, the sensor node involves soil moisture sensors that aim
to control the water level in the soil, while the actuator node is meant to take actions
considering the soil’s water level. Zigbee also shows advantages in protected agriculture
due to its capability to overcome the limitations of wire connection and facilitate greenhouse
management development [86]. Incorporating Zigbee-based WSN systems is a step forward
in the automation and efﬁciency of greenhouse environment monitoring and control since
they can be easily maintained [87]. The climate conditions of greenhouses (e.g., humidity,
temperature, light, and air pressure) can be monitored and controlled in real-time owing
to WSN, thereby optimizing plant growth, increasing yield production, and mitigating
harmful disasters in farms [51]. Greenhouses could greatly beneﬁt from the low power
consumption and long communication range of WSN to monitor and predict the health
of plants, ensure adequate supply of nutrients, and provide a cost-effective approach for
precision agriculture in greenhouses [88].
With high similarity with WSN, RFID is another wireless sensor technology that
has gained scholars’ attention [32]. It is developed for identifying, categorizing, and
tracking the ﬂow of goods [5]. As such, RFID simpliﬁes the tracking of agricultural
products [5], irrigation facilities management [89], and wireless real-time communication
Sustainability 2021, 13, 12011
12 of 22
with agriculture sensors (e.g., soil temperature sensors) [55]. Furthermore, RFID tags
provide energy harvesting capabilities because the power of the radio-frequency ﬁeld
can exceed what the tag requires for its operation [23]. In agriculture, energy harvesting
is crucial to extend the lifetime of sensor nodes [51] and improve the performance of
WSN-based systems [27]. When powered by energy harvesting, WSN can contribute
to developing more sustainable agricultural systems that increase farming productivity
and efﬁciency.
While the importance of WSN in supporting precision agriculture has been widely rec-
ognized in the academic literature, several knowledge gaps can be usefully addressed in fu-
ture studies. For instance, more focus should be placed on designing more energy-efﬁcient
sensors to reduce the cost of wireless systems and improve the accuracy and efﬁciency
of farming operations [90]. One research direction worth examining is the improvement
of quality of service (QoS) of WSNs in terms of maintenance and implementation costs,
coverage, reliability, and energy consumption. This is crucial as the shift from traditional
agriculture to precision agriculture requires accuracy, easily conﬁgurable topology designs,
and appropriate hardware and software for coping with ﬁeld environments [91,92]. In
addition, the integration of WSN in agriculture may necessitate the effective management
and control of a large number of sensors through reliable connectivity and with a simple
conﬁguration [93]. Moving forward within this direction means that future studies will
have to identify the topologies, conﬁgurations, and communication protocols of WSNs that
should be considered in different agriculture scenarios. Future research also needs to inves-
tigate WSN system viability and how they achieve agriculture sustainability considering
their long-term impacts on economic, environmental, and social dimensions.
4.2. Potentials of IoT, Cloud Computing, and AI for Agriculture
The second cluster (shown in green) indicates the critical role of IoT and other comple-
mentary technologies in enhancing WSN implementation in agriculture. IoT has altered the
operation modes of agriculture and increased agricultural automation [4,5,94]. According
to [95], IoT facilitates crop monitoring, optimizes agricultural productivity, and increases
farmers’ proﬁtability. IoT provides a platform to maintain real-time data and alert farmers
to take necessary actions. Furthermore, with the support of IoT sensors across farms,
farmers can obtain an abundance of useful data, including soil, water, and temperature.
IoT’s ability to act as a framework to integrate several technologies, including wireless
sensor and actuator networks (WSANs), AI techniques and methods (e.g., ANN and ML),
computing technologies (e.g., cloud computing), UAVs, geospatial technologies, end-user
applications, among many others have recently gained scholars’ attention [4,5,49,96]. Key-
words such as “cloud computing”, “LoRa”, “ML”, “ANN” are therefore included in this
cluster. Coupled with WSN, cloud computing offers high-quality services, hardware-
agnostic application tools, and sufﬁcient storage capacity and computational resources
to maintain and process the data generated at the network [5]. Furthermore, cloud com-
puting helps to overcome the weaknesses of WSNs owing to its ability to offer open,
more ﬂexible, and reconﬁgurable applications for monitoring and controlling agricultural
processes [97]. Similarly, cloud-based agriculture systems could be utilized to develop a
reliable architecture for farmers to gain timely and on-the-spot data via WSN [98].
The contribution of LoRa to agriculture is also highlighted in the literature. As such,
LoRa represents one of the popular modulation techniques that could be implemented in
agriculture [99,100]. Owing to its long range, LoRa supports irrigation and several precision
agriculture applications and enables wireless communication to remote ﬁelds [101]. LoRa
can be adequately utilized in vast agricultural ﬁelds. Combined with LoRa transceivers,
WSN can augment sustainability in agriculture by equipping farmers with insightful and
usable data [102]. While the deployment of WSN generates massive and various data,
there is a need to process and make use of these data in agriculture. In this regard, machine
learning is a useful technique that could be applied to the data generated by WSN, thereby
performing predictions in agriculture. These include estimations of available water for
Sustainability 2021, 13, 12011
13 of 22
irrigation [101], nutrients [4], and plant growth [103]. As another AI technique, ANN is
also demonstrated useful to reinforce the predictive capabilities of farmers. ANN can use
agriculture data collected by IoT sensors to select crop varieties and predict their production
rate [104], estimate the levels of phosphorus in the soil [105], and support decision-making
processes [106].
Summarizing, the literature on the possibilities of these technologies is rich, and
several opportunities for future research exist. For example, scholars need to investigate
how IoT and WSN can be applied in protected agriculture to reduce human intervention,
save energy, and maximize efﬁciency in ﬁeld monitoring. Examination of the methods
and solutions to secure agriculture data is necessary to ensure that WSN becomes a re-
silient, safe, and trustable network. In the context of cloud computing, further studies are
required to understand the role of this technology to bring ﬁnancially economical agricul-
tural systems [107] and enhance their technical properties, including scalability, efﬁciency,
storage capacity, and overall performance [108]. To further accelerate the transition toward
data-driven agriculture, the development of more precise, accurate, and efﬁcient machine
learning algorithms constitutes an intriguing opportunity for future research. This is crucial
as farmers can rely on machine learning to extract insights from the data-intensive pro-
cesses and support decision-making in farming operational environments. As a popular AI
tool, scholars also need to examine the contributions of ANN at each stage of agricultural
production and how this technology can solve relevant tasks and pending issues in the
agriculture sector.
4.3. Potentials of Clustering and UAVs for Agriculture
Energy efﬁciency and consumption are the main research foci of the third (blue) cluster.
Currently, there are extensive debates about energy consumption, resource limitation, and
global warming at the global level [109–111]. WSN and other enabling technologies could
contribute massively to energy efﬁciency in agriculture. As shown in Table 7, the high
occurrence of “Sensor Network”, “Clustering”, and “Energy Efﬁciency” reveals that the
effective utilization of resources is of paramount importance in agriculture. To maintain the
stability of WSNs, clustering could be used to collect data from sensor nodes, achieve energy
efﬁciency, and prevent channel contention and packet collision [112]. Clustering is vital to
prolong the lifetime of sensor networks and respond to the needs of precision agriculture,
which requires advanced methods and technologies to minimize costs and maximize
productivity [113]. To solve the energy consumption of sensors and WSN in general,
several researchers developed various initiatives, including DEC routing protocol [114],
mobile data collector routing protocol [115], MAC protocol [116], clustering technique [117],
cluster-based routing protocol [118], LEACH protocol [119], localization and clustering
techniques [120], among many others.
Furthermore, agriculture implies large-scale monitoring, which can beneﬁt from the
merge of WSN and UAVs. For instance, [121] argue that UAVs can be a good alternative
for demanding activities that need long observation periods, multiple sensors, data man-
agement, long-term stability, energy and computational resources, and high temporal and
spatial resolution. With the evolution of UAVs and vehicular networks, WSNs can gain
additional functionalities because UAVs make some nodes dynamic and collect data and
maintain wireless communication in areas lacking ﬁxed communication infrastructure [122].
Through navigation data and the waypoints produced by the ground station, UAVs could
autonomously navigate the targeted waypoints and collect ﬁeld image data [123]. UAVs are
also equipped with the necessary features to capture the required images, map the ﬁelds,
and detect pests, diseases, or water stress on the crops [124]. By leveraging their software
and hardware, UAV activities (e.g., pesticide spraying) can be monitored by means of the
feedback from WSN placed at the ground level in speciﬁed locations on the agriculture
ﬁeld [125]. Nevertheless, the performance of UAVs rests on the routing protocol applied.
For example, geographic routing protocols, which offer high mobility networks and high
performance with large UAVs, could boost UAV navigation capability. Meanwhile, energy-
Sustainability 2021, 13, 12011

ware routing protocols and those requiring ample space are more suitable for improving
UAV power capability and storage capacity [126].
With the design of more energy-efﬁcient algorithms for WSNs, there is an urgent
need to propose clustering methods that can use available resources in agriculture WSNs
more efﬁciently, thereby extending network lifetime and increasing energy efﬁciency. The
investigation of how to optimize the performance of UAVs when WSNs are used as a
source of information is encouraged for future studies. This is important as after applying
the chemicals by the UAV, [127] discovered that some areas of the crop did not have enough
chemicals due to speed and wind direction. As a result, the effective development of WSN-
based agriculture systems with mobile nodes (i.e., sensors mounted on UAVs) and UAVs
require the deployment of lightweight software, the implementation of energy-efﬁcient
routing protocols, and the minimization of data transferred from WSN to UAVs.
4.4. Development of Smart Irrigation
The yellow cluster presents the WSNs’ role in developing smart irrigation systems.
On the one hand, water is a scarce resource necessary for the sustainability of the earth and
human beings that need to be preserved [128]. On the other hand, water is a necessary input
for agriculture productivity that should be managed to ensure optimal crop yields [129].
WSNs are one of the most promising solutions that can be applied to develop smart
irrigation systems [26]. Sensors distributed across the ﬁeld and connected through a
wireless network could provide more detailed and accurate information about soil moisture,
humidity, temperature, and other critical indicators compared to old wired methods. This
information could be utilized to automate irrigation and improve precision agriculture
practices [32]. In other words, each part of the land will receive the necessary optimum
amount of water based on the real-time data that WSN provides. WSN facilitates irrigation
management and rescheduling by automating access to inﬁeld soil moisture status and
controlling irrigation, maximizing the efﬁcient utilization of water, and improving crop
production [33].
Microcontroller-based gateways could be used to control the quantity of water [130].
Microcontrollers are essential in agriculture because they can convert analog data to
digital data and provide automation and digital remote access capability [131]. Equally,
GSM technology could be used to share the data and information with farmers [132].
Hence, farmers could optimize their crop yields and water usage simultaneously. The
researchers in this cluster are interested in WSN’s role in developing smart irrigation
systems. They explored how better monitoring systems utilizing wireless sensors should
be developed to provide helpful information (e.g., soil moisture and temperature) based
on different communication (e.g., GSM) and computing (e.g., Atmeag328P microcontroller)
technologies for irrigation automation and efﬁciency [26,29,133]. For example, Giri and
Pippal, [130] develop an automated irrigation system based on WSN and GPRS, [134]
design a system based on WSN and GPRS/GSM network to monitor soil and irrigation
water and optimize water consumption, and [135] utilize WSN for promoting a site-speciﬁc
precision irrigation system.
The cost of implementing WSN-based irrigation systems may not be affordable to
small and budget-constrained farmers; thus, future research should investigate the techni-
cal and economic factors that explain the acceptance of these systems in the agriculture
sector [124]. Additionally, scholars not only could contribute to research surrounding water
management by optimizing water use via the implementation of novel technologies such
as WSN, IoT, AI, and computing technologies [136–138], but they could also concentrate
on alternative water resources such as graywater, drainage water, and recycled wastewa-
ter [139], or developing various irrigation methods such as ﬂood irrigation, spray irrigation,
drip irrigation, and nebulizer irrigation [124].

4.5. Soil Management
The last (purple) cluster deals with the critical role of WSN in enhancing soil manage-
ment. The vital importance of soil property and conditions in agriculture is undeniable.
Any advancement in soil monitoring and management is a key factor in improving resource
efﬁciency, optimizing irrigation, maximizing crop yields, and minimizing environmental
effects [140,141]. WSN has the potential to play a vital role in soil management because
of its capability to handle huge amounts of data regarding different soil attributes [34].
With WSN, soil data are sensed and gathered continuously. Sensor nodes could perform
minor processing, and the data and information are sent to the base station for further
analysis. The resulting insightful information could be utilized to measure the needs of
crops, determine the schedules (e.g., irrigation), and overall improve decision-making and
productivity [29]. To be more speciﬁc, sensor nodes could be implemented to assess the
suitability of the farmland for cultivation [82], analyze the spatiotemporal variation of soil
temperature [142], and monitor temperature, humidity, and soil moisture in real-time in
greenhouses [143]. Furthermore, sensor nodes could monitor soil physical and biochemical
attributes to increase productivity and decrease environmental footprint [144]. Sensor
nodes also could measure, monitor, and integrate various soil quality parameters [145];
automate irrigation through humidity, temperature, and pH sensors [133]; and measure
soil resistivity [146].
While academicians and practitioners are increasingly studying WSN’s potential
for soil management practices, future research needs to address some challenges and
research gaps. For example, improving sensing performance and reliability, enhancing
energy efﬁciency, data processing capability of sensor nodes and wireless communication,
developing energy-independent sensors [141], and improving power sources [34] are
important research areas. In addition, future work should scrutinize the minimum number
of sensor nodes required to minimize the overall cost of WSN deployment in agriculture
and achieve acceptable sensing accuracy of soil.
5. Conclusions
5.1. Discussion of Findings
The main goal of this study was to synthesize WSN applications in the agriculture
sector and advance the existing literature by highlighting several knowledge gaps for future
research. Using a bibliometric analysis and qualitative review of selected publications,
we determine the most important topics in existing research and unravel emerging and
prospective avenues for future research. To perform the analysis, a set of 2444 papers was
chosen and considered for the ﬁnal review. The review ﬁndings can be useful to scholars
actively examining WSN within the context of agriculture. Despite the growing literature
on WSN, there is still a scarcity of publications providing a holistic view of the future
developments of WSN in agriculture, broadening the understanding of the subject and
bridging this knowledge gap. Therefore, our investigation attempted to achieve this by
identifying various topics and research foci at the nexus of WSN and agriculture. Several
relevant insights can be obtained from this review. First, the number of publications
dealing with WSN applications in agriculture has remarkably increased during 2002–2021.
The journal-wise distribution of WSN-related publications indicated that Sensors, Wireless
Personal Communications, and IEEE Sensors Journal are the major outlets contributing to
the WSN and agriculture literature. Our study highlights the relevance of these journals
and their role in advancing WSN applications in agriculture over time. Regarding the
worldwide impact, Asian countries were the most cited. The current review draws several
exciting insights concerning the role of WSN to support agriculture operations and increase
the efﬁciency of farming processes. From this perspective, we identiﬁed the most globally
cited papers (see Table 4). As per these publications, WSN applications are striving to
establish an efﬁcient and sustainable agriculture sector and respond to precision agriculture
needs. WSN technologies garnered signiﬁcant attention and gained momentum due to
their ability to increase farmers’ understanding of crop conditions, resource use, and

environmental circumstances, which would otherwise be challenging to capture. Another
beneﬁt of WSN consists in automating ﬁeld operations, maximizing crop yields, enhancing
food quality and safety, and increasing sustainability. As a result, farmers can rely on
the technology to support their decision-making procedures, reduce human intervention,
improve prediction accuracy, and decrease pesticide use.
By analyzing the keyword dynamics, our research found that WSN, IoT, Zigbee, RFID,
UAV, and cloud computing are some of the common technologies explored in the context
of agriculture. WSN represents a signiﬁcant enabler for precision agriculture since it helps
collect, monitor, and analyze data from agriculture [28]. Similarly, WSN combines IoT
sensors to interconnect, thereby sensing real-time soil and climate conditions [147] and
automating irrigation. IoT, clustering, RFID, and UAV are crucial enablers for establishing
smarter and more sustainable agriculture, beneﬁting farmers and consumers. Aside from
mirroring the progress of digitization, the identiﬁed themes illustrate that WSN applications
in agriculture are growing dramatically. However, despite the extensive research on WSN,
it is crucial to highlight the dearth of studies investigating the convergence of WSN and
other embryonic technologies such as blockchain, 5G, augmented reality, and vertical farms.
Integrating these technological developments enables farmers to perform more efﬁciently
and innovatively; nonetheless, the pending question remains how these solutions inﬂuence
negatively. Therefore, our review results uncover and emphasize the urgent need for more
research investigating how WSN can reshape farming policies and achieve holistic and
inclusive sustainability in agriculture supply chains.
5.2. Research Implications
This study offers insights for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers to better
grasp the applications of WSN in agriculture and draw their attention to scholarly output,
research foci, and prospects for ﬂourishing WSN systems in farming operations. Our
study is useful for scholars attempting to increase their understanding of what has been
researched to date in WSN and agriculture and what needs further examination. In this
respect, the relevant ﬁndings from employing the keyword co-occurrence clustering are the
predominant themes from the past literature on WSN applications in precision agriculture,
IoT, cloud computing, artiﬁcial intelligence, UAVs, smart irrigation, and soil management.
By taking advantage of these technologies, farmers can shift toward smarter agriculture
and make existing farming systems more robust, sophisticated, and efﬁcient. To illuminate
researchers’ views on WSN-related topics, seminal works in the literature can be built
upon to comprehend the entire ﬁeld and uncover the hot and neglected areas of WSN
research in agriculture. Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of research foci and topics was
made through analyzing the keyword co-occurrence network. Based on the generated
clusters, the core content of WSN research and knowledge gaps were discovered. The
three thematic hotspots in the WSN literature essentially focus on various technologies,
including IoT, AI, UAV, RFID, and cloud computing. The review ﬁndings indicate that
WSN is not a standalone technology; instead, it combines diverse hardware and software
technologies to improve agriculture. The relationships among the key topics also ascertain
the essentiality of WSN deployment in agriculture and the potential of the technology to
offer more efﬁcient agri-food processes. As a result, researchers, farmers, and practitioners
must work hard to improve the interoperability of WSN-based agriculture systems and
devise appropriate and responsive practices and measures.
Overall, the present study leverages a new approach to systematize WSN research
in the context of agriculture, using techniques derived from bibliometrics to reach an
objective and quantitative evaluation of the current state of WSN literature. To the authors’
knowledge, no exclusive and comprehensive review of WSN research exists so far, albeit
the mounting interest in the technology and its critical role in promoting more efﬁcient
and sustainable agricultural practices. Our analysis of the present status of this research
domain and knowledge gaps may favor the development of new studies and contribute to
the global scholarly production on WSN and agriculture.

5.3. Limitations and Future Research Directions
Despite its signiﬁcant contributions, this review has some shortcomings that need to
be considered when interpreting the ﬁndings. One of the main shortcomings is that we only
chose publications from a single scientiﬁc database, Scopus. Although Scopus is regarded as
a source of publications, further research may consider other alternative scientiﬁc databases
such as the Web of Science to extend our review ﬁndings by providing additional insights,
research trends, and other theoretical perspectives. Moreover, the literature clustering via
keyword co-occurrence network can be supplemented by other bibliometric techniques
such as co-citation network analysis or bibliographic coupling to generate additional
insights. Finally, as discussed in each cluster, we identiﬁed various research gaps to address
WSN applications in agricultural practices. Energy efﬁciency in all parts of the system
from design to sensors to communication and clustering protocols, implementation and
maintenance costs, various technologies’ integration and their complementarities, social
impacts and environmental footprints, and WSN systems’ viability and reliability are
among the exciting topics for further research.

  Main Objective: The primary goal of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, automated irrigation management systems with a focus on end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: Survey data
  Technologies Used: fluid dispersion device
  Key Findings: The use of a fixed water dispersion device for impact sprinklers can improve water distribution under low-pressure conditions, resulting in more uniform wetting of the soil while minimizing runoff and loss of irrigation water.
  Extract 1: There are several ways to improve the water distribution of sprinklers under a low pressure.  For example, an orifice nozzle, non-circular nozzles, vanes and fluidic devices can be installed on these sprinklers[30,31].  Li et al. developed a fluidic sprinkler based on the principle of “coanda effect” where water flows from the nozzle into a tube installed in the fluidic component to form low pressure area[32].  Although this application improved the water distribution, but there are still some difficulties in relation to the uniformity of rotation of the fluidic sprinkler.
  Extract 2: These nozzles shoot multi-trajectory, rotating streams that apply water more slowly and uniformly than conventional sprays and rotors, particularly when adjusted for specific site conditions (Figure 1).  In addition to reducing water use, the water jetting from these nozzles is more resistant to wind, less likely to mist, and significantly reduces run-off on the irrigated field.  Rotating nozzles compliment that simple principle.   Rotating nozzles for pop up spray heads apply water much Not all pop-up spray head bodies are compatible with these nozzles.   However, the compatibility list is available for check with the nozzle manufacturers directly, while the weather decides when the sprinklers come on to save water.
  Limitations: 1) Previous researches concentrated more on determining ETcrop using crop water uses under no stress conditions with no consideration for annual and perennial crops under different growth stages and stress conditions.   
2) For ETcrop controllers to be fully effective, the existing sprinkler irrigation system must be operated and maintained properly.  How water savings estimates obtained from field trials be extrapolated to other areas with very different characteristics and/or weather patterns still remains under researched.
3) Water saved between weather-based and soil-moisture based “smart” controller, and how these circumstances favor one over the other are currently not known.  Field evaluations report water saved in terms of percent reduction per crop without providing any sense for how these savings varied by different crop characteristics, such as total water use, irrigated area, longevity of saving, and level of wasteful irrigation prior to the retrofit.  Without such information, however, others cannot extrapolate a study’s results to their own service areas.

Abstract: Water saving is an essential part of sprinkler irrigation owing to the impact of climate change and rising energy costs.  
This review highlights the technologies that are emerging in sprinkler irrigation to optimize crop production.  While there have 
been notable advances in irrigation, the continued progress has occurred by the combination of current status with the 
postulation of new ideas such as conversion of high-pressure sprinkler to low-pressure ones, incorporation of smart controllers 
in sprinkler irrigation systems.  To enhance the adoption of these technologies, research on the dispersion device is needed to 
improve the performance of impact sprinklers to efficiently operate at low-pressure conditions.  It is also important to study 
how water savings estimates based on water use, irrigated area, longevity of saving, and level of wasteful irrigation prior to the 
retrofit obtained from field trials can be extrapolated to other areas with different conditions.  Research in the development of 
optimized method for irrigation scheduling is necessary.  This review emphasizes that the status of technologies should be 
considered a continuum, building on earlier knowledge and progress, and hopefully leading toward optimized crop production 
in sprinkler irrigated areas.

1  Introduction  
In most parts of the world, lack of efficient irrigation methods 
leads to excessive use of irrigation water, leading to reductions in 
crop yield.  Available data shows that many irrigation systems are 
inefficient with less than half of the irrigation water on average 
reaching the crop[1-5].  Hence, improvements in irrigation systems 
remains the key to optimize crop production and sustain future food 
demands.  Irrigation has the potential to increase crop production 
per ha by 2.3 times higher than those from rainfed areas[6-9]. 
Sprinklers uses mechanical and hydraulic devices to apply 
irrigation water to the soil surface.  Sprinkler irrigation can apply 
water, fertilizer and pesticides together with the correct amount and 
frequency, fertilizer and pesticide efficiency, reduce the occurrence 
of plant diseases and insect pests, inhibit the growth of weeds, keep 
the soil aggregate knot, provide good conditions for crop growth, to 
increase production and improve product quality[10].  Hence, it can 
be concluded that sprinklers can perform better than conventional 
irrigation methods.  As an example, the yield of field crops under 
sprinkler irrigation could be increased from 10%-20%, while 
economic and vegetable crops could be increased by 30%, 
respectively[6,11].  However, the major challenge that remains

unresolved is that crop foliage remains wet, thus increasing 
incidence of pests or diseases and foliage burn under sprinkler 
fertigation.  It is also possible that the nutrients may apply to other 
areas where roots are not active, decreasing fertilizer-use efficiency.  
Another challenge in sprinkler systems is how to avoid runoff and 
reduce the effect by the wind.  This helps to conserve water 
consumed by crops and moistens the soil for agricultural activities 
to be carried out.  A properly designed sprinkler irrigation has 
higher application efficiency that can avoid runoff.  Due to the 
numerous advantages, its adoption is gradually increasing around 
the world.  Its adoption is noted as 13.3, 10.1, 6.8, 1.9, and    
0.9 million m2 in Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceana, 
respectively[10-12].  Because of the rising energy-cost and impact of 
climate change, there is now the need to saving more water for 
optimum crop production through sprinkler technologies under low 
pressure.  
With the rising demands on water resources, the use of 
reclaimed water for irrigation has gained considerable interest in 
many parts of the world.  Irrigation controllers that incorporate 
soil moisture sensors (SMS) for feedback control can have 
improved performance, but there has been concern about using 
SMS with reclaimed water, which can affect the soil dielectric 
permittivity and thus affect the SMS values.  Smart irrigation 
control systems typically include either a stand-alone controller or 
an add-on device that interfaces with a conventional clock-type 
controller. 
 
The 
weather-soil 
moisture-based 
technologies 
incorporated into these devices allow them to function similar to a 
thermostat.  Like a thermostat, the devices permit irrigation to 
occur when needed rather than on a preset schedule.  Regardless 
of the specific method or technology, the concept is for the 
appropriate irrigation quantity to be applied at the appropriate time.  
The effectiveness of sprinkler irrigation in minimizing water 
losses requires both selection of appropriate sprinkler hardware and

implementation of appropriate management for the crop, soil, 
landscape, and weather conditions.  Many types of sprinkler 
nozzles can be selected for pivoted and lateral-move sprinkler 
irrigation systems.  Nozzles can turn the sprinkler head into other 
devices that can result in less than 20% use of the irrigation 
water[13-16].  Such sprinkler nozzles spray the water in multiple 
streams that fight the wind better with higher uniformity than 
conventional 
sprays, 
particularly 
under 
specific 
operating 
conditions[17-19].  
A major difficulty in sprinkler irrigation is how to achieve 
higher application efficiency under low pressure conditions, 
particularly for high pressure sprinklers such as impact sprinklers.  
Low pressure sprinkler irrigation is gaining momentum, and the 
sustainability of pressurized irrigation is being compromised.  
This is particularly important in the case of impact sprinklers for 
their pressure requirements are higher than pivoted sprinklers.  
The dispersion device can be optimized and mounted on impact 
sprinklers to facilitate jet breakup, providing a conducive 
microclimate for optimum crop production.  The present review 
highlights on major difficulties in sprinkler irrigation technologies 
for optimizing crop production.  Optimization of the fixed 
dispersion device for impact sprinkler and how water savings 
estimates obtained from field trials can be extrapolated to other 
areas with very different conditions is necessary.  This could be of 
practical importance for saving more water under low pressure 
conditions.  
2  Technologies that are emerging in sprinkler 
irrigation  
Sprinkler irrigation begun around the 19th century in Germany, 
Italy, the United States and Russia, the first generation of sprinkler 
appeared in 1917, but until 1920 the application was limited to 
watering vegetables crops and orchards[20,21].  The initial use of 
sprinkler irrigation was the fixed sprinkler systems.  Rotating 
sprinklers developed by USA, England, France, Germany and Italy 
emerged gradually after the 1930s.  After world war Ⅱ, towed, 
movable, center-pivot, reel traction, self-propelled and other large 
and medium-sized sprinklers emerged, so that sprinkler irrigation 
technologies developed rapidly all over the world.  Irrigation 
sprinkler can basically be categorized into low-pressure and 
high-pressure sprinklers[22-24].  Trends in sprinkler technologies 
show that different countries apply different sprinkler equipment.  
Every country develops a variety of sprinkler equipment and 
sprinkler systems according to their prevailing local conditions.  
For instance, USA promotes the use of center-pivot and 
self-propelled sprinklers.  Russia uses a double cantilever 
sprinkler, while countries like Australia, France and Germany and 
many other countries focus on developing hose reel irrigation.  
Many countries are expanding the single-machine control area to 
improve its efficiency, and reduce the costs associated with labor 
and management of sprinkler systems.  Fertigation through 
sprinkler irrigation is also being explored worldwide.  Because the 
cost of energy is rising all over the world, there is now a paradigm 
shift to replace high pressure sprinklers with low pressure ones, 
hence efforts are being made to optimize high pressure sprinklers to 
operate under low pressure conditions as well as the use of smart 
controllers is gaining interest from irrigators worldwide. 
2.1  Conversion of high-pressure sprinkler to low-pressure  
Impact and fluidic sprinklers are high pressure sprinklers that 
produce moving streams of water at a large distance of throw.  
Impact sprinklers provide either full or half circle application 
pattern with 12 m head-to-head spacing[15,21].  High-pressure 
sprinklers disperse water in a concerted stream, which create small 
water droplets that are easily drifted by the wind and evaporation 
losses are higher, particularly in arid regions.  Sprinklers which 
have been designed for operating under high pressure conditions 
should not be used under low pressure conditions.  Sprinklers are 
designed to specification, thus to operate within a specific range of 
flows and pressures.  For instance, operating impact sprinklers 
with 70 kPa-100 kPa will result in distortion of the application 
pattern with lower efficiency[25-29].  This make them distribute 
water with excessively large droplets that causes runoff and soil 
sealing.  Inadequate jet break-up from impact sprinklers occur 
when operated under low pressure, resulting in a poor water 
distribution.  Operating impact sprinklers under low-pressure 
conditions leads to uneven water distribution, and waste of 
irrigation water.  For these reasons, it is imperative to 
mechanically break up the jet with a fixed water dispersion device 
to improve water distribution under low pressure conditions.   
There are several ways to improve the water distribution of 
sprinklers under a low pressure.  For example, an orifice nozzle, 
non-circular nozzles, vanes and fluidic devices can be installed on 
these sprinklers[30,31].  Li et al. developed a fluidic sprinkler based 
on the principle of “coanda effect” where water flows from the 
nozzle into a tube installed in the fluidic component to form low 
pressure area[32].  Although this application improved the water 
distribution, but there are still some difficulties in relation to the 
uniformity of rotation of the fluidic sprinkler.  Hence, 
optimization of the fluidic component is necessary to improve its 
stability in rotation and lessen the variations in the water 
distributions.  Both impact and fluidic sprinklers are used in a 
solid set configuration where enough nozzles are fixed to spray 
water in the area irrigated.  They are used on lateral move 
configurations and operated from 12-24 hours of irrigation time.  
Although these systems are expensive to install, however they can 
be automated to reduce the costs associated with labor 
requirements.  
The interest in low pressure sprinkler applications to save 
irrigation water is gaining momentum.  Low pressure sprinklers 
such as the R3000 and R33 saves money, saves time with higher 
performance than the brass impact sprinklers[15,21].  The R33 
sprinkler represent a modern sprinkler with high performance 
which gives a larger sprinkler range, resistant to the wind and 
uniform water distribution.  With the speed control, the sprinkler 
can be operated to rotate slowly or fast.  For low rotation speed, 
the sprinkler gives droplet that are wind resistant with a large 
sprinkler range.  However, the fast rotation speed produces a 
uniform water distribution pattern.  Besides it is easy to clean and 
cost less to maintain.  Without a drive arm, the sprinkler creates 
no riser vibration.  It also has a long wear life because no seals or 
bearings are exposed to water pressure.  R33 sprinkler has the 
advantages of saving money and time compared with other 
sprinklers[15-26].  Low-cost sprinklers maintain the advantages of 
conventional ones by eliminating the limiting factors to their 
adoption by smallholders.  Examples of such factors include 
pressure and cost requirements including the complexity in their 
use and maintenance.  Improvements in the design and 
management of such systems reduces water losses through runoff 
and soil erosion.  But, their usefulness in lessening water losses 
requires that the operator select the right sprinkler together with 
better management practices for crops, soil and weather conditions.

A runoff-potential index was developed to improve the selection of 
pivoted sprinklers[27].  The method was tested for other sprinklers, 
which showed great differences in the runoff potentials.  This 
means that the runoff index gives an effective way for deciding on 
the type of sprinkler to use by deciding from the sprinklers with 
large droplets and ranges.  
Pivoted sprinklers have the potential to improve the water 
distributions in a crop field by managing crop evapotranspiration, 
which is influenced by factors like type of crop, method of 
irrigation, climate, and condition of the soil.  There is an 
integrated sensor to monitor soil and plant contained by a wireless 
communication system that gives inputs for algorithms to control 
and manage the irrigation system.  While the use of site-specific 
irrigation systems is growing, there is less knowledge of how these 
systems should be managed and optimized to save the resources 
needed.  Although there is growing interest in low-pressure 
sprinkler systems with applications within or near the crop canopy 
to potentially save energy and reduce evaporative losses, their 
effectiveness can be greatly affected by their increased runoff 
potential.  A soil-independent, quantitative runoff-potential index 
has been developed by King to facilitate selection of moving 
spray-plate sprinklers for center pivoted and lateral-move sprinkler 
irrigation systems[28].  The methodology was evaluated for several 
commercially available sprinkler packages.  The results indicated 
that substantial differences exist, and several packages can have 
similar runoff potential.  The runoff index provides an effective 
means for comparing sprinkler choices by identifying sprinklers 
with large droplets and relatively small wetted diameters. 
2.2  Smart irrigation controllers 
Smart irrigation technology promotes healthy and attractive 
irrigation by improving watering efficiency with new "Smart" 
technologies such as smart irrigation controllers and rotating 
sprinkler nozzles.  The latest innovation in irrigation is the smart 
sprinkler controller, a device that gives your plants the right 
amount of water for the time of year, climate and weather.  With 
smart controllers installed, it is possible to avoid over-watering and 
excessive run-off by scheduling the amount of irrigation based on 
the type of landscape and current weather conditions.  
(1) Rain sensor: A rain sensor is an irrigation shutoff device that 
prevents an automatic sprinkler system from turning on during and 
after a rain storm.  Rain shut-off sensors are wired to a sprinkler 
timer and override the scheduled irrigation when a sensor on the 
shutoff device detects water[30].  When the collected rainwater has 
evaporated from the sensor, scheduled irrigations resume.  Rain 
shut-off sensors are simple, economical and useful tools for 
preventing irrigation that would be wasteful.  Rain shut-off sensors 
work best for short off periods.  For extended periods, it is more 
accurate to have sprinkler timer in the “off” position.  
(2) Pop-up nozzle: The latest innovation in sprinkler technology 
are nozzles that turn a standard sprinkler head into a precision device 
that can water your landscape more efficiently by using 20% less 
water[31].  These nozzles shoot multi-trajectory, rotating streams 
that apply water more slowly and uniformly than conventional 
sprays and rotors, particularly when adjusted for specific site 
conditions (Figure 1).  In addition to reducing water use, the water 
jetting from these nozzles is more resistant to wind, less likely to 
mist, and significantly reduces run-off on the irrigated field.  
Rotating nozzles compliment that simple principle.   Rotating 
nozzles for pop up spray heads apply water much Not all pop-up 
spray head bodies are compatible with these nozzles.   However, 
the compatibility list is available for check with the nozzle 
manufacturers directly, while the weather decides when the 
sprinklers come on to save water. 
 
 
 
Figure 1  Spray sprinklers with pop-up heads 
 
(3) Soil moisture sensor (SMS): Soil moisture irrigation 
controllers use water content information from the sensor to either 
allow or bypass scheduled irrigation cycles on the irrigation timer.  
The SMS controller has an adjustable threshold setting and, if the 
soil water content exceeds that setting, the event is bypassed[31,33].  
The soil water content threshold is set by the user.  Another type 
of control technique with SMS devices is “on-demand” where the 
controller initiates irrigation at a low threshold and terminates 
irrigation at a high threshold.  Soil moisture control devices can 
reduce water use on an irrigated field by bypassing scheduled 
irrigation events but is important to make sure the irrigation 
schedule is programmed into the irrigation timer correctly.  Before 
setting the irrigation schedule it is important to determine when the 
water will be applied and how much to apply with each irrigation 
event. 
(4) Mobile connectivity: Several smart controller products 
incorporate onboard home network connectivity through either 
wireless networking technology (WiFi) or a local area network 
(LAN) connection[30,34].  The unit can connect to the internet 
through these.  Some models can also create their own WiFi 
network, which can be connected to even if the device is not 
connected to an external WiFi network.  The purpose of the 
internet connection varies by manufacturer and model.  Many 
units receive data that are used to adjust watering times (e.g., 
precipitation) via the internet.  Connectivity can also allow the 
smart controller to be accessed through either a web browser or 
companion smartphone app managed by the manufacturer as shown 
in Figure 2.   
 
 
Figure 2  Internet of things (IoT) connectivity 
 
Some devices also incorporate the ability to initiate watering 
and adjust scheduling through voice commands to an artificial 
intelligence (AI) assistant (i.e., Google’s Assistant® and Amazon’s 
Alexa®).  Internet and home network connectivity can also enable 
a smart controller to be part of the Internet of Things (IoT) with a 
variety of creative ways to manage the controller. 
3  Irrigation scheduling and water management 
Irrigation scheduling calculates the estimated future water  
4   May, 2019                          Int J Agric & Biol Eng      Open Access at https://www.ijabe.org                           Vol. 12 No.3 
needs over a period of time to avoid a situation of over or under 
irrigation.  Climatic data is generally used to estimate future water 
use and to predict the next irrigation time.  Irrigation scheduling is 
important to meet the requirements of deficit irrigation.  The 
method is based on the response of crops to variations in 
temperature, variations in stem growth rates, lengths of internodes, 
and the amount of soil moisture.  It is also determined in terms of 
energy balance and the response of crops to the climatic factors.  
This approach gives a more acceptable yield ratio to water uses, 
due to proper timing of irrigations.  But the difficulty lies in how 
to separate the influence of such method from other good practices 
related to the scheduling.  In automated sprinkler systems, the 
need for field soil water sensors is enhanced, however a major 
difficulty is the specific benefits derived from such scheduling 
practices.  Software inputs vary by crop, but nearly all scenarios 
require root depth, irrigation rate, and soil type.  Similarly, a 
variety of output information is available to better serve the needs 
of irrigators.  
All the weather-based products reviewed operate on the 
principle of scheduling irrigation as a function of weather 
conditions.  Most of the products use real-time or historical 
weather data to schedule irrigation based on ET, which is a 
function of weather conditions and plant type.  ET is defined as 
the quantity of moisture that is both transpired by a plant and 
evaporated from the soil and plant surfaces[35].  The American 
Society of Civil Engineering’s (ASCE) standardized reference 
ETcrop equation parameters are maximum and minimum air 
temperature, net solar radiation, average vapor pressure, and 
average wind speed[23].  Vapor pressure can be calculated from 
humidity, dry and wet bulb, or dew point data; and solar radiation 
can be derived from pyranometer or sunshine recorder data.  The 
standardized reference ET equation is widely recognized as one of 
the best methods for estimating ETcrop.  Other less accurate 
equations also are used that require only temperature and solar 
radiation parameters, and solar radiation is sometimes estimated as 
an average value based on historical data for a given site latitude.   
The problem with using estimated solar radiation values is that 
significant variability due to cloud cover is neglected, and solar 
radiation is obviously an important parameter in ETcrop calculation.  
Some of the products evaluated use these empirical ETcrop 
equations in their scheduling algorithms.  It is significant to 
consider which equation is used about ETcrop estimation accuracy, 
or what parameters are measured if the equation used is not 
referenced.  
Specifically, some weather stations do not measure radiation 
directly but calculate it from other parameters, while some stations 
are not properly located for ETcrop parameter data collection.  
Certain products reviewed use onsite temperature measurements 
combined with historic monthly ETcrop or solar radiation data in the 
daily ETcrop calculation.  The historic data used are a function of 
the site location.  An obvious consideration with this technique is 
the accuracy of the historic data relative to a specific site.  In one 
case, only five sets of data are available for the entire of USA. 
Several of the products reviewed calculate ETcrop using a full set of 
remotely collected data from local weather stations or a network of 
weather sensors.  The weather station data are collected from 
public and/or private weather stations.  The weather station and 
sensor network data are processed by a centralized computer server 
and transmitted to the irrigation sites.  There are ongoing service 
provider costs associated with the operation of the weather stations, 
sensor networks, computers, and information transmission systems 
associated with these products.  These costs either are absorbed by 
water entities or are paid by the users.  In some cases, study 
results were submitted by manufacturers showing accurate ETcrop 
calculation and/or significant water conservation associated with 
their product as discussed under the product descriptions in this 
report.  In addition to the SWAT testing previously discussed, a 
science-based evaluation of four of the weather-based products 
reviewed was conducted by the University of California 
Cooperative Extension in 2003, and the results are reported b[45]. 
A linear relationship exists between crop yield and crop 
evapotranspiration (ETcrop) for crops like maize, sorghum, cassava, 
sugarcane, barley etc[33].  The effect of water stress is commonly 
seen in low water potentials, obstructs photosynthesis, resulting in 
stunted growth in crops.  Studies show that crop yield can be 
maximized and grain quality improved, while significantly 
reducing irrigation water quantity[35].  Crop water demand 
indicates the amount of water required to replace the losses due to 
evapotranspiration, from the time of planting a specific crop to the 
time it is harvested for a specific climatic condition, and suitable 
soil water conditions[35,36].  During its growth, every crop needs a 
specific amount of water according the growth stage, hence it is 
crucial to evaluate crop water demands to know the deficits in 
water needed due to insufficient rainfalls or moisture in the soil.  
In relation to climatic factors and total growth period, a particular 
crop requires a minimum amount of water to meet the maximum 
evapotranspiration[4,39,46].  Figure 3 presents a graph of crop 
coefficient (kc) against number of days after planting.  The kc 
values are specific to each crop and changes according to the 
growth stages.  The crop water demands are low in the early 
vegetative period of 20 d after planting (initial stage), the crop 
water demands are low (–10% of ETmax).  The ETmax values are 
high (50%-60% of ETmax) during the flowering period (crop 
development) when leaf area is maximum.  Thereafter, the water 
requirement from 60-80 days after planting stays fairly constant 
and decline from this point until it reaches 120 d when it is 
harvested (late-season stage).  
 
Figure 3  Relationship between crop water demand and growth 
stages[23] 
 
Sprinkler irrigation systems are designed to meet water deficits 
and to ensure adequate water supply to crops at the critical stages 
of growth.  However, farmers need to be equipped with the 
requisite knowledge of the time and the correct amount of water to 
apply to meet crop water needs.  For example, the unavailability 
of water during the early growth stage produces many tubers, 
which are visible in cylindrical tubers compared with the round 
variety[35,40,41].  Deficits in water during this stage with the 
application of water leads to cracks in tubers.  The amount of dry 
matter also rises during the maturing time when water is 
unavailable, conversely, frequent water applications leads to 
disfigurements in tubers.  Hence, proper timing of water

Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) of a crop is determined 
using Penman-Monteith method and CROPWAT software[37].   
CROPWAT is a computer software that calculates ETo, crop water 
and irrigation amount according to the design and management 
practices of an irrigation system.  It improves irrigation practices 
through proper planning of water applications under variable 
conditions[37,43].  The method incorporate climatic data of 
radiation, temperature of the air, humidity, and speed of the wind in 
the computation.  FAO CROPWAT uses ETo and crop water 
demand data to model crop water uses under different conditions 
such as climate, crop, and soil[40,44,45].  ETo is defined as:

Although modern technologies for scheduling irrigation has 
existed for many years, the long-term and consistent adoption of 
appropriate irrigation scheduling has been dismal[44,45].  To 
facilitate better adoption rates and improved irrigation scheduling 
developed a software application (i.e., smartphone and tablet app) 
to provide real-time irrigation schedules for various crops (avocado, 
citrus, cotton, peanut, strawberry, urban turf, cabbage, squash, 
tomato, and watermelon) in the southeastern US[46].  The 
application can use real-time weather data from both the Florida 
Automated Weather Network and the Georgia Environmental 
Monitoring Network to calculate ETcrop using a water balance 
method for scheduling irrigation.  The software inputs vary by 
crop, but nearly all scenarios require root depth, irrigation rate, and 
soil type.  Similarly, a variety of output information is available to 
better serve the needs of irrigators.  Many areas in the world are 
experiencing water shortages, and irrigators often cannot meet the 
full crop water needs using their current irrigation and cropping 
system scenarios.  As a result, many producers are implementing 
strategies such as deficit irrigation to address water shortages.  
The CERES-Maize crop model was used to examine several 
deficit-irrigation strategies for corn production in southwest 
Kansas[46].  Their modeling combined experimental results from 
field 
studies 
and 
long-term 
weather 
data 
to 
evaluate 
minimum-allowable depletion for corn, the optimum level of crop 
available soil water at planting, and the irrigation season 
termination criteria.  They found that irrigation scheduling based 
on a 50% plant-available soil water threshold maximized net 
returns compared to initiating irrigation at a greater soil water 
content, that it was important to have adequate soil water reserves 
at planting. 
For famers to for farmers to adopt crops and sprinkler 
technologies that are adaptable to the expected water demands, two 
possible options are possible.  First, irrigation managers can 
deliver more water available to each farmer.  Farmers thereafter 
collect the water into fields depending on the quantity needed.  
The method involves less effort from system managers but does not 
lead to efficient water uses.  Second, the managers can pump 
water to each field depending on the amount of water needed by 
farmers.  The approach requires that the managers have 
information on the water demands of farmers with good control of 
water supply, and the flexibility to vary the supply.  With this 
approach, the efficiency to manage and supply water are higher.  
The rising need for water requires managers to save the limited 
water available.  Methods by which managers solicit information 
on farmers' water needs include negotiation with farmer groups 
over seasonal plans in relation to identify the crops to be irrigation 
and when to apply water before each season.  This approach needs 
managers to project farmers’ water needs at fixed times during the 
entire growth period[47-49].  These approaches only estimated 
actual crop water demands.  However, perfect knowledge of crop 
water needs is impossible where the population of farmers are a 
large because of the variations in crop varieties and planting times.  
Where managers have a good knowledge of crop water needs, they 
only respond when the sprinkler system can deliver water as 
required to meet the crop water needs.  Supply-driven irrigation 
system management is being promoted as an alternative.  The goal 
of supply driven management is to provide a reliable water supply 
to farmers.  Once the farmers are certain of the water supply, they 
can cultivate crops and adopt the sprinkler technologies according 
to the water supply.  
4  Water quality in sprinkler irrigation systems 
The suitability of irrigation water for crop production mainly 
depends on the amounts and type of salts present in water.  
Almost all water sources contain some level of dissolved salts and 
trace elements resulting from human activities and weathering of 
soil.  Humans also impact the quality of irrigation water in many 
ways.  For example, metals and chemical waste can be released 
into water sources as by-products of industry and mining activities.  
Many studies show that the yield of many irrigation schemes is low 
due to water logging and salination of the soil[50-52].  Many 
farmers in Ghana for instance, rely heavily on agrochemicals to 
boost crops production[53].  And because the demand for water has 
increased, wastewater and reclaimed wastewater are currently 
being used in irrigation.  The health implication on crop 
production and humans posed by the situation is endless and far 
reaching.  Two types of irrigation water quality issues occur[52,54]; 
(1) total salinity and sodium related salinity.  The effect of salinity 
on crop yield is comprised of two stages[55-57] first, crop yield does 
not decrease until a threshold value is reached, and second, it 
begins with a linear decrease in yield as salinity increases.  
6   May, 2019                          Int J Agric & Biol Eng      Open Access at https://www.ijabe.org                           Vol. 12 No.3 
Salinity limit water and nutrient absorption capacity of crops, 
caused by salty water or soil due to addition of saline water, poor 
drainage, or shallow water table.  Plants in turn absorb the water 
through the process of osmosis, resulting in the movement of salt 
ions from the soil into the root tissue of plants.  But water 
absorption in plant is restricted when the soil salinity is higher than 
the internal salinity of the plant, resulting in smaller plants, and 
yield reduction occur even where plant symptoms are minimal.  In 
situations of higher salinity, plant tissue dies, causing a condition 
known as necrosis at the leaf edges.  Saline water also leads to the 
accumulation of trace minerals of which is toxic to plants when 
their concentration exceeds the permissible levels.  
Sodicity is the concentration of sodium relative to calcium and 
magnesium concentrations, which is widely used to describe the 
salinity of the irrigation water.  Sodium adsorbs onto cation 
exchange in the soil, which causes the soil to breakdown into fine 
particles, resulting to low water permeability.  This occurs in the 
case of soils with high percentage of smectite clay.  The capacity 
for sodium to increase its concentration in relation to calcium and 
magnesium cations is calculated by the equation for sodium 
absorption ratio[33,58,59].

where, SAR is the absorption ratio of sodium; Na+, Ca+2 and Mg+ is 
the concentrations of sodium, calcium and magnesium ions, 
respectively (med/l). 
Forage crops are the most tolerable to salinity, followed by 
field crops, vegetable crops, and fruit crops.  Boron is a main 
problem in many irrigated areas.  Though an important nutrient, 
its high levels leads to plant toxicity, and concentrations should not 
exceed the permissible levels.  It is projected that between 20 to 
30 million ha of irrigated areas are affected by salinity[60,62].  A 
summary of the guidelines is presented in Table 4 below.  Table 5 
show summary of guidelines for the assessment of sodium hazard 
of irrigation water.  Many studies refer to sodicity problems of 
irrigation water as permeability.  At low sodicity, soil flocculation 
and aggregation is lost and permeability decreases.  Low salt 
concentration less than 0.2 dS/m decreases the permeability 
resulting from high SAR.

Scheduling in sprinkler irrigation helps to minimize the 
incidence of excess leaching associated with excessive irrigation.  
A common water management practice to salinity problems is 
periodic leaching with ample irrigation water to leach salt below 
the crop root zone.  Other practices include using well-drained 
soils and properly designed and constructed drainage system to 
dispose salty water from the soil[59,63-69].  As salinity level increase, 
the amount of irrigation water and frequency of application also has 
to increase.  The leaching requirement (LR) is calculated using the 
equation below:   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conductivity of irrigation water
LR
= Conductivity of soil in the crop rootzone
     (6) 
The formula is used to determine the level of salinity when the 
amount of water needed for leaching is constant.  However, 
because of irrigation inefficiencies additional irrigation water has to 
be applied to eliminate the remaining salts in the root zone.  
Chemical amendments is also used to improve sodic soil 
condition[55,64-70].  For example, the use of gypsum contains 
calcium which amends saline soil conditions.  Calcium exchanges 
the adsorbed Sodium which helps to reestablish the infiltration rate 
of the soil.  But it is important to note that the use of chemicals 
does not disregard the leaching requirement.  Hence, the 
application of additional water is necessary to leach out the 
displaced sodium[70-76].  
Irrigation water can be saved by optimizing the efficiency of 
sprinklers.  Sprinkler irrigation is still an accepted practice for 
watering lawns although a study described a relatively low 
efficiency in applying water to the plants[77-79].  However, another 
study shows that salinity in drip irrigation was lower or similar to 
that measured in sprinkler irrigation, which means that drip 
irrigation compared with sprinkler irrigation is not more efficient in 
leaching salt from the soil[80-82].  Poorly spaced laterals and 
sprinklers, including losses by wind and evaporation increases the 
total water uses and reduces the quality in crop produce.  When 
using sprinklers, the outer margin of each circular zone wetted by a 
single sprinkler nozzle receives less water than the center portion.  
Salt dissolved in irrigation water tends to move along with the 
water as the water flows through the soil.  Figure 4 presents the 
pattern of salinity for the two cases indicated above.  Figure 4a 
presents the layout of a line of sprinklers on a field.  In Figure 4b 
of the illustration, the wetted zones corresponding to the various 
sprinklers overlap considerably and the soil is wetted with a high 
uniformity.  Conversely, the illustration shows a situation where 
the sprinkler heads are too far apart and overlap of the wetted zones 
is insufficient, resulting in non-uniform wetting of the soil (Figure 
4a).  To avoid such situation, the layout of lateral lines should be 
in a parallel fashion with sprinklers offset, to obtain good 
overlapping of the wetted zones. 
 
a. Uniform application 
 
b. Non-uniform application 
 
Figure 4  Water application from the lateral lines and layout of 
sprinkler system 
 
Figure 4a is for the situation where sprinklers are close to one 
another that the wetted zones overlap, resulting in uniform 
application in the root zone.  As expected, the salts are distributed 
uniformly in the horizontal direction.  In the vertical dimension, 
however, the shallower portions of the root zone contain less salt 
than the deeper portions, as a result of the leaching fraction.  The 
numbers on the diagram, represent the degree of salt concentration, 
which reveal that it tends to accumulate in the bottom soil depths.  
In Figure 3b, the sprinklers are far apart, resulting in non-uniform 
application in the root zone.  The result is a non-uniform

distribution of salt concentration in the horizontal and vertical 
directions.  Using the non-uniform wetting as an example, the 
vertical distribution of salts in the wetted zone is identical to that 
for the uniformly wetted case except that in regions with 
insufficient sprinkler overlaps, the LR is smaller and, hence, the salt 
concentration is higher. 
The use of reclaimed water for irrigation is gaining 
considerable interest in many parts of the world.  Smart irrigation 
controllers that incorporate soil moisture sensors for feedback 
control can improve performance, but there has been concern about 
using such control devices with reclaimed water, which can affect 
the soil dielectric permittivity and thus affect the values from the 
sensor device.  A study on time-based irrigation control to control 
incorporating one of four different sensors as affected by both 
potable and reclaimed water[83].  Water savings using sensor 
devices averaged 63% and 59% for the potable and reclaimed water 
sources, respectively[81,84].  Hence, it can be concluded that the 
small accuracy reduction in sensors when using reclaimed water 
would be acceptable.   
5  Limitations of sprinkler irrigation 
1) Previous researches concentrated more on determining 
ETcrop using crop water uses under no stress conditions with no 
consideration for annual and perennial crops under different growth 
stages and stress conditions.   
2) For ETcrop controllers to be fully effective, the existing 
sprinkler irrigation system must be operated and maintained 
properly.  How water savings estimates obtained from field trials 
be extrapolated to other areas with very different characteristics 
and/or weather patterns still remains under researched. 
3) Water saved between weather-based and soil-moisture based 
“smart” controller, and how these circumstances favor one over the 
other are currently not known.  Field evaluations report water 
saved in terms of percent reduction per crop without providing any 
sense for how these savings varied by different crop characteristics, 
such as total water use, irrigated area, longevity of saving, and level 
of wasteful irrigation prior to the retrofit.  Without such 
information, however, others cannot extrapolate a study’s results to 
their own service areas.   
4) With sprinkler irrigation the saline water immediately gets 
into contact with the foliage.  The indiscriminate absorption of 
ions by leaves leads to a decrease in photosynthesis or structural 
damage of the foliage.  In addition, inaccurate spacing of sprinkler 
result in concentration of salts in certain areas in the field, which 
reduces crop yields.  Beyond the permissible level, reduction in 
crop yield is relational to the increase in salinity level.  Different 
crops vary in their degree of resistance to salinity and therefore 
have different permissible levels vis a vis reduction in yields. 
6  Conclusions and future perspectives  
The study explored major emerging technologies in sprinkler 
irrigation systems, and their significance in saving water to 
optimize crop production.  To meet the cost of investment, it is 
also necessary to emphasize on continuous irrigation engineering 
and science with emerging technologies building on earlier 
knowledge and progress towards optimize crop production.  The 
following actions are necessary from future perspectives  
There is pressing need for research to determine the actual 
ETcrop for annual and perennial crop stages and stress conditions of 
annual crops in order to properly manage soil water deficits.  
Because of the high costs and difficulty of the relations with other 
factors that also influence ETcrop.  It is important to evaluate the 
ETcrop values bearing in mind increase in soil salinity levels and the 
control of water stresses with attention to crop yields and quality.   
It is important that future field evaluations build a “look 
forward” feature into their study design.  It is not enough to 
estimate what a certain program saved in retrospect.  It is also 
important to provide a way for others to assess that if program 
saved a certain amount of water in a given service area, how much 
is a similar program likely to save in another area with different 
socio-economic and weather characteristics.  Future studies can 
make their findings more broadly applicable, in the bargain also 
improving the ability to dissect and compare an evaluation’s results 
with those of other such evaluations. 
The application technology has been developed for years but 
one of the remaining research areas in sprinkler irrigation is the 
development of optimized method for irrigation scheduling. 
Optimisation of the fixed water dispersion devices for impact 
sprinkler to facilitate jet breakup under low pressure, producing a 
mist of droplets in mid-air, resulting in higher humidity and lower 
temperatures.  The optimum fixed water dispersion device for 
impact sprinkler has the potential to increase the LR for leaching 
salt-based ion from the root zone of crops and meet crop water 
demand at the same time.

ETo can be accurately determined using the internationally accepted FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation. However, this requires numerous observed data, including solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, which in most cases are unavailable, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines. This study developed models based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for the estimation of daily ETo using different input combinations of meteorological data in Region IV-A, Philippines. The performance of machine learning models was compared with the different established alternative empirical models for ETo. The results show that the SVM and ELM models, with at least Tmax, Tmin, and Rs as inputs, provide the best daily ETo estimates. The accuracy of machine learning models was also found to be superior compared to the empirical models given with same input requirements. In general, SVM and ELM models showed similar modeling performance, although the former showed lower run time than the latter. Keywords: reference crop evapotranspiration; machine learning; ELM; SVM 1. Introduction The simultaneous occurrence of, and the difficulty of separately measuring, evaporation and transpirations gives rise to the concept of evapotranspiration [1]. Both evaporation and transpiration are influenced by factors such as weather parameters, crop characteristics, management, and environmental factors. Due to the complexity of the concept, distinctions are made among reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ETc) and crop evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc-adj). The reference crop evapotranspiration, ETo, which is the focus of this study, refers to the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface, defined as a hypothetical grass reference crop with a height of 0.12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s/m, and an albedo of 0.23, which is actively growing, well-watered, and completely shades the ground [1]. The concept of ETo was introduced to study the evaporative demand of the atmosphere independently of crop type, crop development, and management practices. ETo is one of the most important agrometeorological inputs in the estimation of the irrigation water requirements needed for irrigation system planning, design, and operation [2,3,4]. Based on the Philippine Agricultural Engineering Standards [3] on the Determination of Irrigation Water Requirements, the calculation of ETo is a preliminary step in estimating the crop water requirements for the development of climate- and site-specific cropping calendars. Knowledge of ETo is also needed in the development of hydrologic models for streamflow estimation and flood inundation [5,6,7], reservoir design and operation [8,9], climate change studies [10,11,12], and drought severity analyses [13,14]. Hence, the importance of accurate methods for estimating ETo can never be overemphasized. In general, ETo can be directly measured using the simple water balance derived from equipment such as a lysimeter. However, this method is extensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming for practical applications [15]. In most cases, ETo is determined using the internationally accepted FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation [1]. Since FAO-56 PM requires numerous items of measured meteorological data that are mostly unavailable in developing countries such as the Philippines, empirical equations with reduced data requirements are usually utilized [16]. These equations are usually based on individual or combinations of available meteorological data, such as the temperature-based Hargreaves–Samani [17] equation, the temperature–radiation-based Makkink [18] and Priestley–Taylor [19] equations, the temperature–radiation and wind speed-based Matt–Shuttleworth [20] equation, and the temperature–radiation and relative humidity-based Turc [21] equation. Although these empirical models are simple in terms of data inputs and computational procedures, their usage is observed to be site-specific, or variable according to the climatic conditions of the places where they are developed, and in some cases, they provide unsatisfactory results [22,23,24]. Furthermore, these simplified empirical models are mostly suited to estimating ETo on a weekly or monthly basis, but are less suitable for daily ETo estimation [25]. Advances in computation have led to the introduction of machine learning algorithms in accurate daily ETo estimation. The term machine learning was coined and first defined in a study on the International Business Machines (IBM) corporation as a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed [26]. The popularity of machine learning in recent years can be attributed to the incorporation of probability and statistics into the algorithm that deals with traditional fixed rule-based models, which require manual input [27]. Machine learning models, in general, are black boxes in nature, but several studies conducted have shown their consistent reliability and accuracy in ETo estimation applications compared to other established empirical models [15,22,23,28,29,30]. Among these machine learning models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) have generally exhibited better prediction accuracy in ETo estimations in various studies worldwide, such as in India [31], China [32,33], and Spain [34]. The performance of machine learning models relies on the proper estimation of hyperparameters [35], and cross-validations and resampling, along with grid search, are good ways to simultaneously optimize these hyperparameters [36,37]. The application of grid searches in machine learning model development for Eto estimation can be observed in the works of Bellido-Jiménez et al. [34], Seifi and Riahi [24], Patil and Deka [38], and Wen et al. [39]. Data-driven agricultural techniques, known collectively as precision agriculture, offer a potential way to increase global food production because of their more efficient and contextually appropriate agriculture management actions [40,41,42]. The recent expansion of data-driven farming is due to advances in three key areas: (1) data generation from sources such as field sensors and satellites, (2) data processing and predictive analytics using big data stacks, machine learning and deep learning models, and (3) human–computer interactions that create and improve the usability of insights and models [43]. Data-driven agricultural technologies mostly require the monitoring of accurate meteorological variables such as ETo [44]. For the past few decades, there has been an emerging trend of using machine learning models for the estimation of important variables, especially in areas where these data are insufficient, unavailable, or inaccessible [45]. To date, no study exists in the published peer-reviewed literature that explores the application of SVM and ELM models in the estimation of daily ETo under the conditions of the Philippines. The general objective of this study is to estimate daily ETo using SVM and ELM, with different input combinations of meteorological data collected at weather stations in Region IV-A, Philippines. Specifically, this study seeks to compare the accuracy of daily ETo estimation in the region (1) across the studied empirical models, (2) across machine learning models, i.e., across input combinations and between SVM and ELM, and (3) between the empirical models and machine learning models. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area Figure 1 shows the weather stations in Region IV-A, a region in the Philippines considered in this study. Twenty years of observed daily data on precipitation (P, mm), air temperature (Tmax and Tmin, °C), dew point temperature (Tdew, °C), relative humidity (RH, %) and wind speed (Uz, m/s) were acquired from seven DOST-PAGASA weather stations in Region IV-A through the agency’s online data acquisition platform ClimaDatPh. The requested data underwent a series of reliable quality control procedures and subsequent archiving, as described in the paper of Villafuerte et al. [46]. Based on the Modified Corona Climate Classification of the Philippines, the region can be divided into three zones: Type I, with a pronounced dry season from November to April, and wet during the rest of the year, which includes the stations in UPLB, Sangley Point, and Ambulong; Type III, with a relatively dry season from November to April, and wet during the rest of the year, which includes the station in Tanay; and lastly, Type IV is characterized with more or less even rainfall throughout the year, and it includes the stations in Infanta, Tayabas and Alabat. Table 1 shows the mean annual values of meteorological data per station. Figure 1. DOST-PAGASA weather stations considered in this study. Table 1. Temporal coverage of records and annual mean values of meteorological data of seven stations in Region IV-A. Solar climatic variables in the region are scarce. Out of seven DOST-PAGASA stations in the region, only the UPLB station has available ground-based solar radiation data (Rs, MJ/m2/day), with temporal records from 1977 to 2011 (35 years). For this reason, daily Rs data from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) reanalysis datasets that can be accessed through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (NASA POWER) website were used, given their relative consistency with the Rs ground observations in the region [47]. Numerous publications have also proven the consistency of NASA-POWER Rs values with the ground observations in many areas around the world [48,49,50,51]. The datasets of each station were partitioned into two categories: (1) model development set for the development of machine learning models, and (2) model evaluation set for out-sampled validation of the calibrated and developed models. A continuous 15 years daily record (n~5475) was used as the model development set, and a 5 years daily record (n~1825) as the model evaluation set (Table 1). 2.2. Empirical Models for ETo Estimation The daily ETo (mm/day), estimated using FAO-56 PM (Equation (1)), was used as the standard and reference value for the development and evaluation of the studied models. ET o = 0.408   Δ   ( R n − G ) + γ 900 T + 273 U 2 ( e s − e a ) Δ + γ ( 1 + 0.34   U 2 ) (1) in which Rn is the net solar radiation (MJ/m2-day), G is the soil heat flux density (MJ/m2/day), T is the mean air temperature (°C), U2 is the wind speed at 2 m height (m/s) converted from the wind speed measurement at 10 m height (U10) using a logarithmic wind speed profile [1], es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPA), ea is the actual vapor pressure (kPa), ∆ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve (kPa/°C), and γ is the psychometric constant (kPa/°C). The detailed procedures and the theory for calculation are discussed in the FAO 56 paper [1]. Five alternative empirical equations that have respective meteorological data inputs, as shown in Table 2, were also employed to compute ETo per station. Detailed descriptions of each of these empirical models can be found in the paper of Guo et al. [52]. Table 2. Empirical equations for reference evapotranspiration estimation. 2.3. Machine Learning Models for ETo Estimation Figure 2 shows the general methodology of the development of SVM and ELM for the estimation of daily ETo using different available meteorological data as inputs. Figure 2. Methodology framework for developing SVM and ELM models for the estimation of daily ETo. Image Sources: Schematic Diagram of SVM (Rhys, 2020), ELM (van Veen and Leijnen, 2019), and grid search (Pilario et al., 2020). 2.3.1. Support Vector Machine The SVM algorithm developed by Vapnik [53] is a supervised machine learning model for pattern recognition and data analysis, and it has been widely employed for regression and forecasting in the fields of agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and environmental studies. The SVM model estimates the regression based on a series of kernel functions, which can convert the original, lower-dimensional input data to a higher dimensional feature space implicitly [22,23]. SVM works by transforming the input vector into a feature space and maps the relationship with the output vector. In general, the SVM can be expressed mathematically as: Y = w φ ( X ) + b (2) in which Y is the output vector, w is the weight vector, φ is the kernel function, X is the input vector, and b is the bias term. The weight factor w and bias term b are estimated by minimizing the loss function as: 0.5   ∥ w ∥ 2 + C 1 2 ∑ i = 1 n L ϵ ( y p r e d i c t e d , y a c t u a l )   (3) L ϵ ( y p r e d i c t e d , y a c t u a l ) = f ( x ) = { 0 ,     i f   | y p r e d i c t e d − y a c t u a l | < ε | y p r e d i c t e d − y a c t u a l | − ε ,     o t h e r w i s e (4) where the term 0.5   ∥ w ∥ 2 is the regularization term, C is the penalty parameter, L ϵ is the ε -insensitive error function, and ε is the margin of SVM. The transformation of the input vector is dictated by the kernel function, which adds an extra dimension to the SVM algorithm such that a linear hyperplane can separate the classes into new and higher-dimensional space [54]. There are different kernel functions that can be applied for the transformation of data suitable for finding linear decision boundaries for different non-linearly separable data sets. The commonly used Radial Basis Function (RBF) non-linear kernel function was used in this study due to its better performance in ETo and estimations compared with other kernel functions [22,29], which is expressed as: K   ( x n ,   x i ) = e x p   ( − γ   ∥ x n − x i ∥ 2 + C ) (5) where x n   and   x i are the nth and ith terms of the input vector, while γ and C are the hyperparameters in the SVM- RDF model. In this study, the hyperparameters C and γ were optimized simultaneously using a grid search method with C ranging from 0.1 to 100 and ε ranging from 0.001 to 10, while a default value of 0.1 was used for the parameter ε. The grid search eliminates the trial-and-error method in tuning hyperparameters and has been proven to significantly improve the model’s accuracy [36,55]. 2.3.2. Extreme Learning Machine The ELM model proposed by Huang et al. [56] is an extended single hidden layer feedforward (FF) neural network wherein the weights and biases of the hidden layer are randomly generated without the need for tuning iteratively, while the output parameters are analytically calculated. ELM has a more favorable general capability with faster learning speed; it does not require too much human intervention and can run much faster than the conventional algorithms. ELM is an efficient algorithm with numerous advantages such as ease of use, quick learning speed, higher performance, and suitability for many nonlinear activation and kernel functions [29,57,58]. The basic theory of ELM can be given as follows: For M arbitrary distinct inputs (xi, yi) with ∈ ℝ and ∈ ℝ , a standard single layer FF with N hidden nodes and the activation function f can be modeled as the following sum: ∑ i = 1 N β i   f   ( w i x j + b i ) ,     j ∈ { 1 ,   2 ,   3 , … ,   M } (6) where wi is the input weights to the ith neuron in the hidden layer, bi are the biases, and β i is the output weights. In a case wherein a single-layer FF perfectly approximates the data, the relation is ∑ i = 1 N β i   f   ( w i x j + b i ) = y j ,     j ∈ { 1 ,   2 ,   3 , … ,   M } (7) which can more efficiently be written as H β i = Y (8) where H = ( f   ( w 1 x 1 + b 1 ) ⋯ f   ( w n x 1 + b N ) ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ f   ( w 1 x M + b 1 ) ⋯ f   ( w N x M + b N ) ) (9) β = ( β 1 …   β N ) T (10) Y = ( y 1 …   y M ) T (11) The hidden layer output matrix H can be computed using the randomly generated first layer of the ELM and the training inputs, while the output weight β can be solved by finding the least square solution to the linear system defined in the hidden layer output matrix H. This solution is given by β = H f Y , where H f is the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse of the matrix H. The comprehensive derivation and description of the ELM algorithm can be found in the original paper of Huang et al. [56]. The kind of activation function (sigmoid, linear, or tansig) and the number of neurons in the hidden layer (ranging from 5 to 200 with an interval equal to 5) are the hyperparameters that were simultaneously tuned when using the grid search method. 2.3.3. Machine Learning Model Development As shown in Table 3, eight different input combinations were considered to evaluate the effects of different meteorological variables on the estimation of daily ETo using machine learning models. Eight combinations of different input variables were considered for the SVM and ELM models. Model 1 has the same input combinations as the FAO-56 PM, namely, Tmax, Tmin, RH, Rs and Uz. Model 2 has the same input combination as Model 1, except that it uses extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra, MJ/m2-day) instead of Rs. Model 3 does not have any solar radiation variable, and uses only Tmax, Tmin, RH and Uz. The input variables considered in Models 4, 5, and 6 are set to be analogous with the inputs of the TSR-, TSW-, and TS-based empirical equations, respectively. Model 7 only considers Tmax, Tmin, and RH. Finally, Model 8 only handles air temperature data, comparably with the T-based Hargreaves–Samani equation. Table 3. The input combinations of meteorological variables used for the development of the SVM and ELM models for ETo estimation. In developing both SVM and ELM models, the model development set was further divided into a training subset and a validation subset for tuning the hyperparameters using a growing window-forward cross validation (gwFV) scheme. The gwFV is the recommended cross-validation scheme for machine learning models using time series data to preserve the temporal dependencies of the data, and provides almost unbiased estimates of the true error [59,60,61]. Four-folds gwFW were used for cross-validating the ETo model, a fixed window of 3 years (n~1095). Before putting the input and output variables into the machine learning models, raw meteorological data were standardized to avoid convergence problems using the equation: X n = X i − μ σ (12) where Xn is the standardized value, Xi is the measured value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. To reflect the real use of the models, the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) were computed using only the data of the model development set. 2.4. Evaluation of Model Performance 2.4.1. Model’s Accuracy The accuracy and performance of both the empirical and machine learning models for ETo estimation were evaluated and compared using the statistical indicators shown in Table 4. To compare or rank the studied model considering all statistical indicators, the Global Performance Index (GPI) was computed: G P I i = ∑ j = 1 j α j ( y ˜ j − y i j ) (13) where y ˜ j is the median of the scaled values of indicator j, y i j is the scaled value of indicator j for model I, and α j equals −1 for indicators R2, d and NSE, and equals 1 for the other indicator. Table 4. Statistical indicators used for the performance evaluation of machine learning and empirical models. The concept of GPI indicates that if the scaled value of the indicator is far lower than the median of the scaled values, the model is the most accurate compared to other models, while if the scaled value of indicator is far higher than the median, the model is less accurate compared to the other models [62]. A higher value of GPI results in a higher accuracy of the model. 2.4.2. Machine Learning Model’s Run Time The run time or the time used for the computation of the machine learning models across models and between SVM and ELM were also compared in this study using a single sample with 4-fold gwFV cross-validation. 3. Results and Discussions Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10 and Table 11 show the results of statistical indicators for all studied models given by the stations at UPLB, Sangley Point, Infanta, Alabat, Tayabas, Ambulong, and Tanay.

On average, the estimated daily ETo of the Turc equation is only 6.0 to 15.2% divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM daily ETo. This fits with an R2 of 0.93–0.97, an RMSE of 0.28–0.46 mm/day, an RRMSE of 7.5–15.1%, an MAE of 0.22–0.42 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.79–0.94. The Turc equation is best used in places where there are no wind speed data available. It is considered as one of the most accurate empirical models used to estimate ETo under humid conditions [29]. Nevertheless, the T-based Hargreaves equation gives the lowest accuracy across stations, with estimates that are 26.9–48.7% divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM ETo, with an R2 of 0.19–0.35, an RMSE of 1.02–1.25 mm/day, an RRMSE of 25.3–40.0%, an MAE of 0.77–0.098 mm/day, and an NSE of −0.46–0.27. The ranking of the investigated empirical models according to GPI is the same for the UPLB, Infanta, Alabat and Tayabas stations, i.e., Turc > Matt–Shuttleworth > Makkink > Priestley–Taylor > Hargreaves–Samani. The ranking shows that incorporating relative humidity (TSR-based) and wind speed (TSW-based), along with solar radiation and air temperature, could improve the estimates of empirical models. 3.2. Comparison across Machine Learning Models 3.2.1. Comparison of Models across Input Combinations Overall, models with Rs data as the input variable, such as Models 1, 4, 5, and 6, performed best both in SVM and ELM, with excellent results based on their values of RRMSE and NSE. Rs data represent the solar resources in a specific location available to vaporize water, which is considered an important factor, together with air temperature, for the occurrence of ETo [1]. In particular, the estimates of Model 1 perfectly fitted the actual value of FAO-56 PM, with the R2 ranging from 0.95 to 0.99, an RMSE of 0.07 to 0.22 mm/day, an RRMSE of 1.72 to 5.44%, an MAE of 0.04 to 0.13 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.95 to 0.99. On average, the estimates of Model 1 are only 1.4 to 4.0% divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM daily ETo. On the other hand, Model 2, which has the same input combination as Model 1, except that it has Ra instead of Rs, performed satisfactorily, with an R2 of 0.62–0.82, RMSE of 0.45 to 0.77 mm/day, RRMSE of 12.82 to 20.03%, MAE of 0.35 to 0.62 mm/day, and NSE of 0.51 to 0.82. The estimates of Model 2 are 12.61 to 19.83% on average divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM daily ETo. This shows the importance of Rs in the estimation of ETo, which cannot be replaced with extraterrestrial solar radiation Ra, even with the presence of both RH and Uz data. TSR-based Model 4 and TSW-based Model 5 show relatively comparable performances based on the average statistical indicators. On average, the estimated daily ETos of Model 4 and Model 5 are only 2.4 to 8.1% and 3.4 to 7.6% divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM daily ETo, respectively. Model 4 fitted with R2 ranging from 0.89 to 0.99, an RMSE of 0.10 to 0.33 mm/day, an RRMSE of 2.9 to 8.5%, an MAE of 0.07 to 0.22 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.91 to 0.99, while Model 5 fitted with R2 ranges 0.92 to 0.98, an RMSE of 0.12 to 0.29 mm/day, an RRMSE of 3.2 to 6.8%, an MAE of 0.09 to 0.18 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.95 to 0.98. When compared to Model 1, Models 4 and 5 RMSE decreased by 44.4%, or 0.06 mm/day, and MAE decreased by 38.9% or 0.04 mm/day. Nevertheless, considering the GPI ranking, Model 5 performed better than Model 4 at the UPLB, Alabat, and Ambulong stations, while the opposite was observed for the other stations. 3.2.2. Comparison of Models between SVM and ELM Based on the computed statistical indicators, the SVM developed using the RBF kernel and the ELM model generally exhibited identical performances in estimating daily ETo for all stations and all input combinations, during both the model development and evaluation phases, with average differences in RMSE of 0.002 mm/day and in MAE of 0.003 mm/day. In terms of GPI ranking, ELM performed better than SVM for most stations and model inputs, especially in the model evaluation phase. This observation shows that during the model evaluation phase, the ELM model tends to overfit the data, as evidenced by the almost negligible values of ME. Table 13 presents the average run time, or the time used for the computation, of the SVM and ELM models for ETo estimation. The time needed for running the SVM models ranged from 79.21 to 223.62 s, while the ELM models displayed a lower range, from 83.99 to 98.94 s. For the SVM models, it can be observed that the models with higher accuracy, such as Models 1, 4, 5, and 6, have a relatively faster run time compared to the other models. This can be attributed to the lower time spent in the optimization of hyperparameters through grid searching. Overall, running an ELM model for ETo estimation is almost two times faster than running SVM models. Given that SVM and ELM models can achieve identical accuracy in ETo estimation in the region, ELM is preferred when run time is considered. Table 13. Average run time (in seconds) of SVM and ELM under different input combinations in the estimation of daily ETo. 3.3. Comparison between Empirical and Machine Learning Models In general, the accuracy of SVM and ELM models in estimating daily ETo is much better compared to empirical models. This is apparent from the ranking of the computed GPIs of all studied models across stations in Table 12. When comparing models with inputs of only air temperature, we see that Model 8 of the machine learning model achieves better performance than the Hargreaves–Samani equation, with an average increase in R2 of 44.4%, RMSE of 33.5% or 0.37 mm/day, and MAE of 30.7% or 0.26 mm/day. Based on the values of both RRMSE and NSE, the Hargreaves–Samani equation has a poor modeling capability, while Model 8 is concluded to be acceptable. On the average, estimates of Model 8 are 16.4 to 24.5% divergent from the actual values, which is relatively better than the 26.9 to 39.1% of the Hargreaves–Samani equation. Empirical models with Rs as one of the inputs (TSR-, TSW-, and TS-based) proved to have an acceptable to satisfactory modeling capability, based on the computed average RRMSE and NSE across stations. With the same input combinations, machine learning models provided an improved performance with excellent results (RRMSE < 10% and NSE > 0.8). Compared to the best TS-based model, Model 6 of the machine learning models improved the RMSE by 62% or 0.41 mm/day, and MAE by 71.0% or 0.42 mm/day. The estimates of Model 6 deviate by 3.5 to 8.0% on average from the actual values, which is relatively better than the 9.85 to 24.4% of TS-based models. On the other hand, Model 5, when compared to its analogous TSW-based Matt–Shuttleworth equation, achieves an average increase in accuracy of 76.5% or 0.46 mm/day in terms of RRMSE, and 75.2% or 0.39 mm/day in terms of MAE. The estimates of Model 5 are on average deviant from the actual value by 3.4 to 7.6%, which is better than the Matt–Shuttleworth equation, which is off by 7.4 to 23.7%. Lastly, when Model 4 of both SVM and ELM models is compared to the TSR-based Turc equation which is the best performing empirical model for this study, a significant improvement can still be observed, as there is an average increase in RRMSE of 57.5% or 0.2 mm/day, and in MAE of 58.2% or 0.17 mm/day. The estimates of Model 4 are off by only 2.4 to 8.2%, while the Turc estimate is off by 7.1 to 12.5%. The results show the ability of machine learning models to handle complex nonlinear relationships between independent variables and dependent variables when estimating daily ETo [23,32]. 3.4. Comparison of the Average Monthly ETo: The Case of UPLB and Tanay Stations The plots of the monthly average values, computed via the simulated daily ETo for all empirical and machine learning models, are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 for the UPLB and Tanay stations, respectively. Among the studied empirical models, the average monthly daily estimates of the Turc equation excellently resemble the FAO-56 PM for the UPLB station (RMSE of 0.129 MJ/m2/day and NSE of 0.969). In the case of the Tanay station, the Makkink equation performed best (RMSE of 0.216 MJ/m2/day and NSE of 0.869). For both stations, the average monthly daily ETo computed via the Matt–Shuttleworth equation tended to be below the FAO-56 PM ETo, while the Priestley–Taylor equation overshot it. The T-based Hargreaves equation tended to overestimate the FAO-56 PM monthly and daily average ETo for the Tanay station throughout the whole year, but it only did so during the rainy seasons (JJA and SON) at the UPLB stations. Figure 3. Plots of monthly average daily ETo at the UPLB station estimated from (a) empirical equations, and calibrated machine learning models of (b) Support Vector Machine and (c) Extreme Learning Machine. Figure 4. Plots of monthly average daily ETo at the Tanay station, estimated from (a) Empirical equations, and calibrated machine learning models of (b) Support Vector Machine and (c) Extreme Learning Machine. The average monthly ETo based on daily values computed via the SVM and ELM models, with any input combinations, proved to have a relatively high level of accuracy with NSE >0.8, which showed a closely reflected behavior of the monthly values based on FAO56-PM daily ETo. This proves that even with minimum inputs of air temperature data (Model 8), machine learning models can reliably and satisfactorily estimate ETo on a daily, monthly, and seasonal basis. The daily record of ETo is important in irrigation scheduling and hydrologic modeling, while monthly or seasonal estimates are necessary baseline data for irrigation system and reservoir designs, as well as water right determination [3]. 4. Conclusions Reliable data are key to forming good hydrological models and engineering designs. In particular, accurate estimates of ETo are important in irrigation planning and design, irrigation scheduling, reservoir management among other applications. This study developed models based on SVM with an RBF non-linear kernel function, and on ELM, for estimating daily reference crop evapotranspiration in Region IV-A, Philippines, using limited meteorological input data. The machine learning models developed were compared with five other established empirical models in terms of accuracy in daily ETo estimation. The results show that the calibrated SVM and ELM models, with at least Tmax, Tmin and Rs as inputs, provide the best daily ETo estimates. When compared to empirical models with analogous data inputs, the ELM and SVM models achieved higher accuracies, with RMSE values of at least 0.2 mm/day, and MAE values of 0.17 mm/day. Overall, the ELM and SVM models achieved similar modeling performances, although the former exhibited shorter run times than the latter. These machine learning models, with proper simulations and optimization, could achieve excellent performance in terms of accuracy.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem.

Introduction and Motivation According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2 and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however, goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences, as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner, also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries, nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy. The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8 and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter. A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016. According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs, are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity. This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications. These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g. soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information. In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20], [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time, research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms. The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper, we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers. It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates, scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network, supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance, adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE 3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock, or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions, soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions. It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield, or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet. Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS) architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge. This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”. With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming, as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16 system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption, location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information. The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways) are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture. Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops. In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex, dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures, while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G), and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times, than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions. Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors, flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other, and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience. Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor. Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals, and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58] like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command, to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations. It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices, with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively, secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment. In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’ limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area. 1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers, the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors, which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence, data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details. In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64]. 3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup, data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12]. 4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry. Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events. Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem. We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4. We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee) can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example, a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic, project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000. 2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country. Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally, their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3) False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example, injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack, the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically, hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically, most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69] similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms. 5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels. C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74] starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time. It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact. US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders, but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries. These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production. With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore. Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35 terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming. We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities. The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture. This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming. Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering, denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure. Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication. Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability, whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment. Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings. Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems. CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities. Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges, which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification. Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle. They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and 20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain. Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets. Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues. It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming. In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example, Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions. Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions. It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters. Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners. Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity, bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102] discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation? For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain. Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms. IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106] are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially, it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms. How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further, if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109], [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7], [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113]; however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems, which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance, a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue. This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers. Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2) poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129] and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected. Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132] is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless, 5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment. Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced, cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming, if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance, regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64]. Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure, etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc. cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies, agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues, making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments. Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain. Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector.

Introduction Water pumping is tremendously utilized in irrigation systems by many farmers worldwide. Irrigation technologies change rapidly from traditional irrigation activities that mainly depend on farmers to modern farm machinery that utilizes various machines and systems for water pumping and plantation process [1]. The water pump is primarily used for irrigation and livestock watering. Irrigation is a wide field focusing on water supply for growing plants and maintaining landscaping features, including trees, shrubs, grass, and flowers [[2], [3], [4]]. Water pumping is the key player in irrigation systems to supply the required water capacity at a specific area with adequate pressure and flow rate [5]. In conventional irrigation systems, farmers mainly depend on either diesel/fossil fuel-based pumps or electric-based pumps. However, fossil fuel and diesel-based water pumps are not environmental-friendly since they cause air pollution and contribute to climate change which is one of the serious problems in our world [[6], [7], [8]]. This is because the combustion of the diesel and fossil fuel release carbon dioxide which contributes in generating greenhouse effect and global warming and cause a risk toward human [9]. Also, the demand for electricity keeps increasing due to the faster development of agriculture in rural areas [10]. In other words, electricity deficit, fuel cost, air pollution, water wastage, and lack of new technologies utilization in agriculture pose significant concerns in conventional irrigation systems. Therefore, there is a real need for utilizing renewable energy resources to supply agricultural activities with the required energy. Solar energy is among the promising alternatives in irrigation systems that can be applied in agricultural activities to reduce electricity usage and minimize the consumed fossil fuel, especially for farmers in rural areas [11]. It is an affordable choice for future energy compared to other renewable energies because of its availability in abundance, cost-effectiveness, installation cost, and efficiency [12]. Usually, the solar panel is attached to a voltage regulator, inverter, and battery to form a Photovoltaic (PV) System. Hence, the water pump should be equipped with a PV system to build a solar-powered water pump. In addition, in this era of technology, the emerging evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced automation and control systems are being leveraged to realize smart irrigation systems with real-time monitoring and automated control. A solar-powered water pump with the Internet of Things (IoT) support is a promising alternative to overcome constraints in conventional irrigation methods. IoT is a recent paradigm of communication technology, where all objects with communication interfaces, such as sensors, appliances, smartphones, tablets, and laptops, can connect with each other and with the Internet. The main intention of IoT is to form a global and smart world using a global network system; thus, it creates a sense for data collection from a huge number of devices/sensors/nodes worldwide and makes it available over the Internet. IoT applications enhance all areas of our daily lives and become more inspiring and pervasive in many emerging domains, including smart grid, smart city, home automation, environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, healthcare and medical aids, and industrial automation. Consequently, integrating the IoT concept to construct a smart irrigation system will help farmers automate the water pumping operation and improve the farming and plantation process with less effort and cost. Generally, the greater the solar radiation, the greater the evapotranspiration, the greater the need for irrigation, and the greater the solar energy to supply power for water application. Therefore, in this paper, a solar-powered portable water pump is introduced by integrating a PV system with an electric water pump for irrigation purposes. The IoT concept is enabled to form a smart irrigation system that can update the collected information through sensors to the Internet and can be accessed by farmers using a mobile application via smartphones. A solar-powered water pump is a water pump that uses energy generated by a solar panel, so it is cost-effective and environmental-friendly. The solar water pump can run continuously for most of the daytime, directly from solar cells and during nighttime using a battery. Besides, this solar water pump is portable and free of power lines. It is suited for the farmer where the water resources are in remote locations. The system is equipped with nozzles to control the water flow rate and a filter for purifying the irrigation water. The portable nature of the multi-nozzles of the solar-powered water pump is an add-on feature that is required to cover a wider area and different plant kinds using a single pump; thus, provides more convenience to the farmers. An IoT-based control system is attached to the developed solar-powered water pump to form a smart irrigation system for real-time monitoring and remote control. The smart irrigation system includes a NodeMCU microcontroller, moisture and temperature/humidity sensors, and a relay board. The main contribution of this study is to design and fabricate a cost-effective solar-powered water pump with IoT integration for the smart irrigation system. To fulfil these requirements, this study adopts the following objectives and contributions: (i) Design and fabrication of a solar-powered portable water pump (SPWP) to save energy and fuel costs and mitigate air pollution using a renewable energy resource. The portability nature of the SPWP makes it easy to transport and relocate. (ii) Development of an IoT-based smart irrigation system (IoT-SIS) with an integrated algorithm to monitor the condition of the surroundings and remotely control the pump over the Internet using the Blynk IoT platform and mobile application. (iii) Implementation of the developed smart irrigation system with the solar-powered water pump (IoT–SIS–SPWP) in a real environment and conducting practical experiments to validate its performance and functionality. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the literature review and related studies. Section III presents the methods and materials. The system validation and performance testing are explained in Section IV. Finally, the article is concluded in Section V. 2. Literature review There are numerous areas where the rainwater is not adequate to accomplish this aim, and many of these regions face drought for various periods. Irrigation is the precise technology to cope with these issues based on several factors related to soil and crops [13]. Water pumps are widely used in farming and irrigation systems. The normal water pump is powered by a diesel or fossil fuel engine to rotate. Several issues are rising due to the usage of such water pumps, including fuel price, maintenance cost, air pollution, generated noise, efficiency, and lack of remote control and monitoring [14]. Such water pumps need fuel or diesel as a supplement; thus, the farmer needs to spend extra operation costs for buying these supplements and maintaining the continuous operation of pumps that have a short life expectancy. Such add-on costs can be challenging, especially for the farmers who own their farms on a medium and small scale since their profit is not too much, and they cannot afford this high cost. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel and diesel into the atmosphere may also cause acid rain that can corrode the soil, vegetation, and crops [15]. From another perspective, using main grid electricity to feed electric water pumps for farming and irrigation in rural areas is another challenge [16]. The electricity demand is growing rapidly worldwide with the increase in the human population, urbanization, and modernization. About 70% of the population is employed in the agriculture sector, which consumed 18% of the total power generated compared to other sectors [17]. This is required to produce a considerable amount of electricity to support the energy requirements for agriculture field activities to secure irrigation water in all rural areas. Governments have to spend a lot of money and resources to meet the energy demand in agriculture, particularly supplying electrical energy to rural areas, which is not always an easy solution [18]. Recently, more attention is dedicated to current studies on real-time monitoring and advancement in remote control concepts over the Internet for precision irrigation, particularly in rural areas. It is expected that the new IoT paradigm will play a crucial role in the agriculture field to improve the remote control of irrigation systems and attain real-time information about every aspect related to plantation and farming activities. Therefore, smart irrigation systems that utilize various microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and wireless technologies to send agriculture and irrigation-related data to an IoT platform are necessary. Such an IoT-based irrigation system will help farmers to monitor their farms' conditions over the Internet using their smart devices, in addition to switching ON/OFF the water pumps remotely via a mobile application. The solar photovoltaic system converts sunlight into electric energy directly through the photovoltaic effect. This solar photovoltaic system is a valuable and sustainable approach to overcoming the current environmental issue and crisis. The smallest element of a PV system is the solar cell. Each solar cell has two or more specially prepared layers of semiconductor material that produce direct current (DC) electricity when exposed to light. The wiring collects this DC in the panel. It is then supplied either to a DC pump, which pumps water whenever the sun shines or stored in batteries for later use by the pump. This kind of green energy can ensure energy, water, and environmental security. The PV system and water pump combination is a necessity, as the solar water pump is used widely in agricultural production. PV system does not produce any harmful by-products, which cause environmental pollution. Since solar energy is not extracted from the earth's layers, so it will not cause any harmful pollutants to the surroundings. The basic working principle of a PV system is that the photovoltaic cell converts the solar energy from sunlight to electrical energy that can be used to feed loads through the controller, which keeps the battery charging during the daytime. The produced energy during the daytime is stored in a battery to be used in the nighttime. Solar photovoltaic water pumping system is an ideal alternative for electricity, fossil fuel, and diesel-based water pumps. In 1970, a study made to explore the economic feasibility and practicality of solar water pumps brought some effort. The solar water pump is a combination of a solar photovoltaic and pumping system. It involves multidisciplinary areas, including electrical, mechanical, electronics, civil, and computer engineering. In the past few decades, the world still depends on those limited and non-renewable energy sources which take millions of years to replenish. After industrialization, the energy demand increased, and the world is facing many environmental problems like acid rain, global warming, and greenhouse effects. The global surface temperature is 0.6° Celsius higher than the average temperature during 1900–2010 [19]. The main components of a solar water pump consist of a solar panel, pump, electric motor, water distribution nozzles, water filter, and controller. The electric motor used in the water pump is to rotate the pump and manages the AC or DC. Besides, the function of the controller in the water pump is to adjust the motor speed and the output power. The solar water pump is more efficient and economical than the traditional water pump; it is extremely useful for the farmer who works on a small and medium-scale farm. This kind of solar water pump is not only used in the crop; it can also be used in feeding, gardens, and irrigation. The operation concept of the solar water pump is simple, where the solar panel collects the solar energy from the sun and converts it into electrical energy through the silicon wafers embedded in the solar photovoltaic panel. The electric energy is then transferred to a DC-based motor pump system which operates the motor. The motor rotates the shaft, coupled to the mono-block pump, and the pump starts lifting the groundwater. There are two types of water pumps, which are surface water pumps and submersible water pumps. The surface water pump is suitable for lifting and pumping the water from a maximum depth of 20 m, while a submersible water pump can be used in an area of greater depth of 50 m [20]. In [21], the authors proposed a user-friendly, reliable, and automated 3- phase water pump control system based on Wi-Fi to be used by farmers. The system includes monitoring electric supply availability, the water level inside the reservoir, the water flow rate, and water pump short circuit conditions. The NodeMCU ESP8266 is the microcontroller of this system. However, system design is very sensitive and should be handled with utmost care because the microcontroller is a 5 V device. It is employed to control a high-voltage 3-phase irrigation pump. Ref. [22] focused on multiple factors that influence the PV water pump performance. They claimed that the cell's temperature, PV module degradation, incidence angle, surface dust, and efficiency of the motor pump have the most impact on the system performance. In addition, mismatching, self-shading, and shadowing are other involved factors that affect the performance of solar-powered pumps. In Ref. [23], the authors determined the number of PV modules and the pumping power that is required in PV-based water pumps with a battery bank. A comparison study between conventional pumps and solar-powered pumps was carried out regarding the required cost for installation, operation, maintenance, and total life cycle. The results proved that the PV-based water pumps saved a lot of fuel and engine oil costs, which results in reducing CO2, air pollution, and noise. The study considered other geographical characteristics, flowrate and optimum tilt angle. A study in Ref. [24] addressed the simultaneous operation of irrigation areas using standalone solar pumps. Such a system entails the direct application of the pumped water to the different sectors depending on the reservoir; thus, it decreases the total cost and eliminates the evaporation process. The authors developed a model based on linear programming. The model operation is based on the required water volume and the PV power. The result proved that the simultaneous operation of PV-based pumps provided higher efficiency and saved energy compared to the individual operation. In Ref. [25], the authors devoted the study to developing an IoT-based system for solar water pumping, which can be operated and controlled via a vision-based technique using a fuzzy-based algorithm. The system observes the soil moisture, temperature, and humidity and runs the pump accordingly. The system also supports manual and remote control by the user and controls automatically via the Fuzzy-based control mode. Ref. [26] highlighted the design and implementation of a water pumping system based on the health of plants. The system model supports the automatic start/stop of the electric motor based on water threshold values. The study analyzed the sensor data to decide on irrigation time according to plant health status with the plant's threshold value. An emergency notification about plant health will be sent to the farmer via email over the IoT platform when needed. The farmer also can access information regarding to soil and environment parameters including soil pH value and moisture, temperature and flame values through Graphical User Interface (GUI) to decide whether the plants need to be irrigated. In this regard, PV-based water pumping is among the viable alternatives in irrigation systems that have attracted considerable attention and have been deployed in numerous remote regions. Such solar-powered pumps can be used in various applications to supply water in rural areas ranging from irrigation to livestock. PV-based pumps have many features that make them attractive to be a substitute for conventional water pumping systems. It is based on green and clean energy without carbon dioxide emission (no fossil fuel), eco-friendly, reliable, with no noise, and low cost for operation and maintenance. The reported literature proved that solar-powered water pumps are more economical and can compete in low pumping capacities than conventional fuel-based pumps and wind-powered pumps. Some studies focused on the configuration parameters of the water pumping system, and others studied motors and pump types based on applications. Some addressed controlling water pumping systems, while other studies were devoted to analyzing various economic and environmental parameters. Although many solar-powered water pumping systems are already implemented in many countries, it still limited to small and medium scales and need to be promoted at a large scale. Integration of IoT-control concepts is necessary to convince farmers in remote areas to switch their manual/local control pumps with the remote IoT-based PV water pumping system. Such an IoT system is required to persuade farmers that solar-powered pumps with automation capabilities and real-time monitoring are the correct option to reduce production costs, increase irrigation efficiency, improve plantation quality, and keep plants safe and healthy. Such transformation is necessary for developing nations where agriculture is the main activity, and solar irradiance is sufficient throughout the year. Overall, many studies instigated solar-powered water pump applications in irrigation systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, limited studies focused on developing IoT-based smart irrigation using solar-powered water pumping systems. In addition, none of the previous studies focused on using a portable PV-based water pump as a standalone system in farming activities. Most of the proposed systems were not validated in a natural environment, even though they were tested in LABs using simulation models or prototypes. Therefore, we developed a portable solar-powered water pump with an IoT-enabled controller as an innovative irrigation system in this study. The NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller enables users to send commands towards the pump according to the collected readings from the sensors. A mobile application to monitor the pump and control the system has been created, and it can be used from a certain distance with the use of an internet connection. Thus, it can be accessed anywhere and anytime when the Internet connection is available. This will lessen the burden on the user and increase the efficiency of the water pump. For instance, the farmer can start and stop water pumping through the phone without being close to the water pump. A mobile application is used to remotely control the on-and-off operation of the water pump from smartphones and to monitor the surroundings over the Blynk IoT platform. 3. Methods and materials This section defines the methods and research activities adopted in this study, including the methodical organization of various research phases in conjunction with the detailed design and implementation of the proposed solar-powered water pump with the IoT-based smart irrigation system. Moreover, the components selection and their integration are explained in detail to fulfil the design objectives. A portable solar-powered pump for the IoT-based irrigation system was fabricated. The hardware development of the IoT-based system was carried out by utilizing the NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi module as a microcontroller, and sensors were selected to measure the considered parameters. The relay board has been decided to control the switching process of the pump. After that, software was developed by integrating the required sensor libraries using Arduino IDE as the interface between the NodeMCU and the programming device. The arrangement/sequence of the code must be improved according to the thought of the entire water pumping system, whether which sensor runs first and then followed by the next sensor with each action once the sensors are triggered. The Blynk IoT platform was chosen as the IoT cloud to save the collected data updated over Wi-Fi to the Internet. A mobile GUI was designed to display the updated readings from the sensor and enable the remote control of the water pump using smartphones. The detailed research activities are illustrated in the flowchart of Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (775KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flowchart of research activities. 3.1. System modelling The proposed system architecture of IoT–SIS–SPWP is described in Fig. 2. In the developed system, the sun rays are applied on two solar panels (50 W each) to generate the electrical power used to power the high-pressure auto diaphragm water pump with the DC motor set. The extra energy will be stored in the 12 V battery through the solar charger controller. The battery used is a Panasonic lead-acid 12 V, 7.5 Ah battery that copes with the micro diaphragm water pump. The battery capacity can supply electricity to the motor for up to 3 h whenever required during night irrigation activities. The microcontroller collects the data from the utilized sensors and sends it to the Blynk IoT cloud server over the Wi-Fi interface of the NodeMCU and, at the same time, forwards the farmer's switching commands to the SPWP. The NodeMCU connects to the Internet via the nearest Wi-Fi access point. The farmer will be able to remotely monitor the surrounding conditions in the farm (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) using the GUI based on the Blynk mobile application through Internet-connected smartphones. The sensors are connected to the input GPIOs of NodeMCU, and a four-channel relay module is connected to the output GPIOs. The farmer also can receive notifications for abnormal conditions via the same app. when some threshold values are exceeded.

Accordingly, the farmer can switch ON/OFF the solar-powered water pump for irrigation purposes when needed. The DC pump is a water-pressure diaphragm pump of 12 V, 8 A, and 100 W. The maximum output water pressure is 0.8 MPa with a maximum flow rate of 6.5 L per minute. The pump is connected to a hose pipe with multi-nozzles to spry the water during the irrigation process at different pressure and flow rates. Also, the pump is coupled with a water filter to improve the irrigation water quality for keeping plants healthy and in good condition. The mobility support of the system allows its movement and reallocation based on demand. 3.2. System design The IoT–SIS–SPWP system layout has been designed using NX10, as shown in Fig. 3. The parts or components of the SPWP are a polypropylene luggage toolbox (the overall body), two solar panels 50 W, a hose pipe's hook, an extendable holder, and a cover box to store electrical components of the IoT-SIS, metal support, battery, and water pump. It also shows the dimension of the overall parts of the IoT–SIS–SPWP. We aim to build an ergonomic design of a solar water pump to fit the people who use this water pump. Proper ergonomic design is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders. It is relevant in designing such things as safe furniture and easy-to-use interfaces. The solar water pump is more compactable and lightweight. The luggage design makes this water pump portable, and the size is ergonomic and suitable for smallholder irrigation. The design of this portable solar water pump is inspired by wheeled travel luggage. Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. System design dimensions. The designed IoT–SIS–SPWP system will be used in the area alienated from the electricity grid. The implementation of solar power would reduce energy costs such as fuel and electricity. The usage of solar power benefits long-term savings, but it also promotes the usage of renewable energy and reduces pollution. However, the usage of solar energy has a major challenge which is theft. Making the system portable is beneficial as it could be transported anywhere and stored safely in storage. The water pump body is made of polypropylene. Polypropylene is a rugged and highly chemical-resistant material often used as material for toolboxes. It has similar properties to polyethylene but is more challenging and more heat resistant. Durable and lightweight making it suitable for encasing electrical equipment in a work environment with additional resistance to chemicals, making it suitable for usage in the marine environment. It is also heat resistant, which makes it suitable for usage under prolonged sunlight. Polypropylene seems to be destined to increase its importance as raw material for the production of plastics due to its excellent thermal and mechanical properties, low cost, and versatility of uses. For the hose, we use Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) garden hose with polyester fibre reinforcement. This hose has excellent chemical and physical properties, very ideal for conveying water, widely used in construction, agriculture, fishery, project, household, and industrial service. It could handle temperatures ranging from −10 °C to +65 °C. PVC hose also has good abrasion resistance making it suitable for a rugged environment. Since there are many types of hose based on oil-resistant elastomers and many specifications for each type, sometimes with conflicting requirements, it is impossible to generalize regarding current uses or future trends. PVC blends are used in covers when excellent abrasion resistance is required. We use a portable water filter with hollow fibre membranes (HFMs) as filter material for water filtration. HFM was initially developed in the 1960s for reverse osmosis applications; it has become prevalent in water treatment. HFM could ensure that no pathogens can slip through removing substances such as Bacteria, Protozoa, E. Coli, Giardia, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella Typhi, Leptospirosis, and microplastics. The amount of solar energy collected by a solar panel is a function of local solar radiation, ground reflection property, and collecting a panel's tilt and orientation. The orientation and the tilt of a solar panel strongly affect the amount of the collected yield. Therefore, solar panels must be slanted and oriented at optimum angles to collect the maximum solar energy available in a specific region. The best method to optimize the tilt and the orientation of a solar panel is by applying an active sun tracker. Active sun trackers are electromechanical or pure mechanical devices that keep changing the tilt and the orientation of a solar panel/solar array periodically during the day. However, the capital cost of such a system is high, and it consumes energy during tracking. Thus, changing the tilt angle and the orientation monthly, seasonal, or yearly for a photovoltaic (PV) panel, as in our system, maybe more feasible than applying an active sun tracker. 3.3. System fabrication After the design phase, we started the fabrication and installation phase of the portable solar water pump since it is the central part of the proposed system. Besides that, the structural analysis is compulsory to ensure that this design can support all the load weight. Next, the type of material used to build the water pump frame is identified and obtained from the supplier. After that, the inspection was conducted immediately after the material was received to avoid any defects happening. The overall fabrication process sequence is illustrated in Fig. 4. Basic manufacturing processes, including welding, grinding, cutting, and many others, have their safety precautions. Extreme caution should be exercised when using any tool to prevent injury to personnel. While working in a machines room, rules and regulations need to be obeyed for our safety. Safety measures need to be taken into account at our workplace are likes wearing safety boots, jackets, face shields, and gloves when handling tools and machines. The machinist should not wear a watch, jewellery, other accessories, or loose clothes that can cause trouble to them when handling the machine. Every different type of operation on machines must be conducted followed by the correct procedure and tools to avoid accidents happening in the machine room. The floor must always dry to avoid slipperiness, and the table must be cleaned repeatedly. For metal support, firstly, the mild steel bar is cut into four parts. Then, the metal bar edges are ground and polished using a grinder and sander. The metal was then welded together and fitted onto the luggage box using a drill and rivet.

For PV panels, two PV panels are attached using screws and hinges, and a slider is attached on the top and bottom of the solar panel. Then, sheet metal is sheared and bent using a shearing machine and press brakes. The PV Panels, sheet metal, and luggage box are attached using screws, rivets, and L-section. Then, the placements of the filter and pump and the box containing microcontrollers, as shown in Fig. 5. Then, the solar controller and hose hanger are attached to the solar water pump sides, as shown in Fig. 6. For final adjustment, L-section is attached to parts for durability. Latches are added to the solar panel to avoid turning when transporting. Fig. 7 depicts the finished system product of the solar-powered water pump with the implemented IoT-SIS controller.

Components selection Hardware and software components are crucial and essential in the design of IoT systems. NodeMCU ESP8266 is used in our system as it is a single-board microcontroller intended to make the application of interactive objects or environments more accessible. It is a cost-effective and open-source physical computing platform with an extensible software development environment for board programming. It is used to gather data read by the sensors and upload the data to the MQTT server. Besides, it also receives commands given by the user to do specific tasks via the MQTT server. NodeMCU consists of a physical programmable circuit board like any other development board, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This microcontroller can be used to develop interactive objects, taking inputs from various switches or sensors and controlling a variety of relays, lights, motors, and other actuators. We use NodeMCU ESP8266 as the microcontroller to enable farmers to observe sensor readings and pass the command towards the water pump. The NodeMCU is attached with a Wi-Fi interface to be connected to the Internet via a hotspot. NodeMCU has 17 GPIO pins that can be allocated to different functions such as I2C, I2S, UART, PWM, IR remote control, LED light, and button programmatically. Thus, it is a good candidate for IoT applications with a limited number of sensors and actuators like our system. NodeMCU has a ready-to-use structure as it comes in a complete package form, including the 5 V regulator, a burner, an oscillator, a micro-controller, a serial communication interface, LED, and headers for the connections. The programming of the NodeMCU can be done by using Arduino software, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to write the code of instructions and upload it to the microcontroller. For NodeMCU, a beginner would need to learn a new programming method different from Arduino but much easier. This is because the programming environment is easy to use for beginners yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of. The required coding to initiate the connection between NodeMCU, sensors, and actuators can be developed via Arduino IDE and uploaded to the NodeMCU memory. It represents the heart of IoT systems since it acts as a sensing node and a gateway simultaneously. We have used the Wi-Fi module to create a mobile application to remotely control the water pump on and off operation from smartphones. A mobile application to monitor and control the system has been created. It can be used from anywhere and anytime over an internet connection. The real-time monitoring and control will lessen the user's burden and increase the efficiency of the water pump. Soil moisture sensor measures the water content in the soil. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must be calibrated and may vary on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature, or electric conductivity. Reflected microwave radiation is affected by soil moisture and is used for remote sensing in hydrology and agriculture. Farmers or gardeners can use portable probe instruments. Soil moisture sensors typically refer to sensors that estimate volumetric water content. Another class of sensors measures another property of moisture in soils called water potential. The FC-28 soil moisture sensor is mounted at the side of the system to measure the soil moisture at the farm. This module also includes a potentiometer that will fix the threshold value, & the comparator-LM393 can evaluate the value. The LED will turn on/off based on the threshold value. The sensor needs to be placed into the soil, and the measurement of the soil moisture will be exposed and then data uploaded to the Blynk application. DHT11 is a primary, ultra-low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and spits a digital signal on the data pin (no analogue input pins are needed). It is relatively simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is that it can only update new data once every 2 s. The sensor is utilized in our system to measure the surrounding temperature and humidity. DHT11 with its jumpers are mounted at the side of the prototype, upper the toolbox in a drilled hole. Thus, the DHT11 sensor can be exposed to the surrounding temperature and measured to be uploaded to the Blynk application. DHT11 sensor has four pins- VCC, GND, Data Pin, and a not connected pin. A pull-up resistor of 5 k to 10 k ohms is provided for communication between the sensor and the microcontroller. A 4-channel 5 V DC relay module is exploited in this study to perform the switching of the pump and any other actuators if necessary. It can also be used to control various appliances and equipment with a large current. The relay is energized or reenergized based on the received signals from the NodeMCU depending on the farmer's commands. It is equipped with high-current relays that work under AC 250 V 10 A or DC 30 V 10 A. It has a standard interface that can be controlled directly by the microcontroller. The Arduino IDE is a cross-platform application that is written in the C++ programming language. It is used to write and upload programs to Arduino-compatible boards, but also with the help of third-party cores, and other vendor development boards. It connects to the Arduino and Genuino hardware to upload programs and communicate with them. Support for third-party hardware can be added to the hardware directory of the sketchbook directory. Platforms installed may include board definitions (which appear in the board menu), core libraries, bootloaders, and programmer definitions. Coding for this project has included all types of sensors, including DHT11 sensors and soil moisture sensors. The specific library of all these sensors has been applied to ensure all the sensor is working correctly. Next, the ESP8266 NodeMCU's library has been included in the program for the communication feature between the user and the microcontroller system. AT command has been used as the tool to send feedback and receive a command from the user. 3.5. Circuit design and installation As stated earlier, the proposed solar-powered water pump has been fabricated—this phase is devoted to the description of hardware and software development of the proposed IoT-SIS system. The selected electrical/electronic components need to be connected to form the control circuit installed in the controller box of the developed IoT–SIS–SPWP. This control circuit will be used to monitor and control the fabricated solar-powered water pump over the Internet. The control circuit is installed into the controller box after finishing the testing and verification. Before that, all components are connected according to the schematic diagram as shown in Fig. 8, which also illustrates the virtual connection of electrical components using Fritzing software. Download : Download high-res image (287KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Circuit diagram of the system. Then the components are installed on the breadboard to confirm that the circuit works correctly before finalizing the connections and attaching them to the entire system. As shown in Fig. 9, the developed IoT control system of the solar-powered DC water pump motor set is equipped with a 5 V power source, NodeMCU ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module, soil moisture sensor, temperature/humidity sensor, and relays. After successfully testing each component individually, all the components were assembled and connected to the NodeMCU. The required coding has been developed using Arduino IDE. LED was used as the replacement for the actual pump to check sensor functionality. During this phase, many tests have been conducted, and improvements have been suggested when necessary. The errors and problems that we faced during the testing procedure were identified and fixed. This step was repeated until a successful product was obtained. After compiling all the programming codes into the NodeMCU, the actuators (relay module and DC motor) were used for the practical testing by implementing the circuit to the proposed system, as shown in Fig. 10. A GUI based on the Blynk IoT platform has been developed to display the gathered information from sensors and allow the farmer to control the water pump using a smartphone.

Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Installation of all components in the controller box. As an example of the improvement and optimization process, initially, the reading from the sensors was unable to be uploaded to the Blynk application server. The reading can only be viewed on the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE software. The relay module could only switch on/off by the sensors themselves when a certain requirement was triggered. After some reconstruction of the coding, the reading obtained from the sensors could be updated on the IoT server. The problem of uploading and fetching the data was solved, but the relays were acting the opposite way from the user's command. When the user remoted the relay to turn on via mobile apps or pc, the relay was turned off instead. Hence, the coding for receiving the command from the server for turning on/off the relay was remodified. The portable solar water pump was placed in the direction that sunlight incident directly on the solar panel. The solar water pump was connected and controlled by the application on the mobile phone. 3.6. System operational procedure The temperature and humidity sensor and soil moisture sensor send the collected data directly to the microcontroller via the connected wires. The NodeMCU receives and uploads data to the Blynk server using the Wi-Fi module. After the program coding was uploaded in the NodeMCU, the data can be accessed using any device, mainly smartphones with Internet access in this case. In our coding, we have developed an algorithm to gather the information from the sensors and passed to the cloud as in Algorithm 1. The system operates based on the developed coding in the microcontroller. The water pump is set to turn on using Blynk mobile application. The sensor readings would be detected and set up in the coding to measure the surrounding of the farm and the operation hour of the water pump. According to the Blynk application, the readings of moisture, temperature, and humidity will be displayed based on the unit decided by the user. The farmer will observe the sensors' readings in real-time, and according to predefined threshold values, he will be able to decide whether to switch on/off the water pump. The IoT server will receive the command from the Blynk GUI on the farmer's smartphone or the Blynk homepage and send the command to the microcontroller to switch on/off the water pump using the application. It will be sent to the microcontroller to switch on the relays. Thus, the water pump status and the reading of sensors are displayed on the application to check the farm's surroundings or where the testing took place. If the relay is energized, the water pump will be switched on. Then, the water flow starts from the pump to the filter and next to the irrigation system as planned. When the user presses the switch-off button on the GUI, the water pump will be turned off.

Experimental results and validation The SPWP-IoT-SIS system has been designed and fabricated, as stated in the previous section. In this section, the system's functionality and performance will be tested and evaluated. We have conducted practical experiments in two different environments to evaluate multiple criteria, including water quality, flow rate, energy consumption, and IoT system functionality. We have successfully tested the developed system in both offsite and onsite testing in this context. The offsite testing was held at the LAB and workshop, while the onsite testing was held at UMP Pilot Fertigation Farm. Before starting the system development, a site visit was conducted to obtain information regarding the farm. Our system prototype could be deployed at the farm to check its applicability and compatibility in real environments. From the site visit, we get information on the coverage area of the farm, the fertigation way that is used at the farm, the quantity of the plants on the farm, the type of water pumping system used in the farm, and the system operation hour. Since our system composes several main components including a solar panel, DC motor, water pump, water filter, irrigation nozzles, and IoT-system components, several tests were conducted. 4.1. Experimental setup The proposed SPWP-IoT-SIS system was placed at the UMP Pilot Fertigation Farm during the onsite testing phase, as shown in Fig. 11. The University Malaysia Pahang (Gambang area) latitude is 3°43′23 North, and the longitude is 103°7′16 East. The system is powered on and connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi access point. The DC water pump was connected to the solar panel. After attaching the inlet port of the pump with a suction pipe, priming was done. The inlet port of the solar water pump was connected to the water pump in the irrigation system of the Fertigation Farm. Another hose pipe was attached to the end of the outlet of the water pump. After that, the solar water pump was switched on via the Blynk GUI by using the mobile phone. Download : Download high-res image (757KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Onsite system setup. 4.2. Power and water flow rate comparison In the first step, we have devoted our focus to determining and comparing the generated power from the solar panel with respect to irradiance for different water flow rates of the pump. The system has two solar panels with 50 Watts per panel. In the onsite testing and offsite system testing, the proposed solar water pump performance has been observed, measured, and evaluated. The voltage, current, and power consumed by the water pump and the flow rate of the water pump were measured and recorded. The DC water pump is designed on the basic requirement of the agriculture product. The power of the pump is obtained from Eq. (1): (1) P o w e r c o n s u m e d b y p u m p ( W ) , P = V × I where V is the DC voltage, I is the current, and P is the power of the water pump. As stated earlier, our SPWP is attached with multi-nozzles to control the water flow rate and a filter for purifying the irrigation water. Such features enable our system to conveniently cover a wider area and diverse plants using a portable pump. The system can pump the water at different flow rates using six nozzles: cone, quad, fan, flat, soaker, and jet. Each nozzle type has a different water flow rate and required a specific amount of power. Water was discharged, and its volume was measured to determine the water flow rate according to Eq. (2), where 6 L of water are collected, and the time taken to collect the water is estimated. (2) F l o w r a t e , Q = w a t e r d i s c h a r g e d ( l i t r e s ) t i m e t a k e n ( min ) The six types of nozzles' performance are analyzed in terms of flow rate, voltage, and power. The data is collected and tabulated to compare the voltage, power, irradiance, and flow rate of six different types of nozzles, as listed in Table 1. The obtained results for the voltage measurements are between 11.0 V and 11.8 V, while the current is between 6.8 and 7.3 A. The power is roughly between 74.8 W and 86 Watts. The difference between the highest value and the lowest value for the voltage, current, and power readings is typically based on the different irradiance received by the panel during each nozzle type and the impact of the flow rate of each nozzle. From the table, it can be seen that the voltage and the power for the cone nozzle are the highest compared to the other five nozzles. The voltage, current, and power for the cone nozzle are 11.8 V, 7.3 A, and 86.14 W, respectively. This data proves that the solar panel absorbs more sunlight irradiance, thus providing more voltage, current, and power than the other five nozzles. While for the jet nozzle, the electrical parameters have the lowest readings compared to the other nozzles. The voltage, current, and power readings are 11.0 V, 6.8 A, and 74.8 W. This data proves that the solar panel absorbs less sunlight and provides less voltage, current, and power compared to the other five nozzles, as shown clearly in Fig. 12. Table 1. Data for each nozzle. Type of nozzle Irradiance Voltage Current Power Water Discharge Time Flow Rate (W/m2) (V) (A) (Watt) (Liter) (min) (L/min) Cone 929.8 11.8 7.3 86.14 6 1.43 4.20 Quad 926.5 11.8 7.2 84.96 6 1.45 4.14 Fan 916 11.7 7.0 81.90 6 1.50 4.00 Flat 909.6 11.4 7.1 80.94 6 1.55 3.87 Soaker 897.3 11.3 6.8 76.84 6 1.77 3.39 Jet 810.7 11.0 6.8 74.80 6 2.00 3.00 Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Impact of solar irradiance on SPWP electrical parameters. Based on the trend of the growth data of the irradiance reading, as the solar irradiance increases, the power generated by the solar panel will be higher and more power will be supplied to the water pump with different nozzles. Fig. 13 depicts the comparison between the electrical power supplied by the solar panel to the water pump and the water flow rate for different nozzle types. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Power vs. water flow rate for various nozzle types. The experiment is conducted in the afternoon from 13.00 until 17.00, which has more sunlight. The flow rate of the water pump is measured in L/min. The water pump's discharge was measured by a volumetric method by collecting 6 L of water in a container. The subsequent time taken to fill up the container was recorded using a stopwatch. The same was repeated for the other five nozzles, and the average of all the nozzles was considered. As shown in the figure, the maximum flow rate has occurred with the cone nozzle, which is 4.20 L/min due to the highest generated voltage by the panel, 11.8 V. The cone nozzle required 1.43 min to discharge 6-Liter water. This flow rate indicates that the solar panel supplied more power to the cone nozzle causing the cone nozzle to have the highest flow rate. However, the jet nozzle has the minimum flow rate among the six nozzles, due to there being slightly unstable voltage causing less power to be used by the jet nozzle. The jet nozzle required 2.00 min to discharge 6 L of water. Hence, the flow rate for the jet nozzle is 3.00 L/min. From the graph, it can be concluded that the higher the power supplied to each type of nozzle, the lesser time is used to discharge the water, and the higher the flow rate can be achieved. The second highest flow rate occurred with the soaker nozzle, which required 1.45 min to discharge the 6 L of water. Hence the flow rate for the soaker nozzle is 4.14 L/min. The flow rate for the soaker nozzle is very close to the cone nozzle. These values prove that the power supplied to both the cone nozzle and soaker nozzle is almost the same. The supplied power is stable for the cone nozzle and soaker nozzle. 4.3. IoT–SIS–SPWP validation The IoT–SIS–SPWP system allows the user to remotely control the solar-powered water pump for irrigation using an Internet-connected smartphone. The Blynk IoT platform has been integrated into the mobile irrigation application, and a developed dashboard can be used to monitor and control the proposed system. The Blynk application allows the user to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. It also enables the remote control of the SPWP over the Internet at any time from anywhere. Fig. 14 depicts the developed GUI that we initially used to control the water pump over IoT and monitor the surroundings in the farm during the onsite testing. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Blynk GUI dashboard. This GUI has been developed and integrated into the Arduino IDE coding uploaded to the t NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller. Such GUI can be improved and expanded by including more widgets and indicators for any suggested improvements like adding more sensors for monitoring (raindrop and flow rate) or more actuators to control the solenoid valve. The data measured from the soil moisture sensor and temperature & humidity sensor can be obtained in the Blynk application. The application is synchronized and displays readings that are uploaded by the NodeMCU microcontroller in the IoT–SIS–SPWP system. The soil moisture sensor will detect the soil moisture on the farm to notify the user to turn on the water pump according to the soil moisture condition. The same goes for the temperature & humidity sensor to detect the surrounding places for the user to turn on and off the water pump at the farm. The data readings of the sensors are displayed in real-time. The user needs to install the Blynk App. which is compatible with Android and iOS operating systems of smartphones. It can be downloaded from the Apps stores of any mobile phone. The application's name is “Blynk,” which is synchronized with the IoT server Blynk account. During the synchronization process, the targeted server address is required, followed by the host port, the username, and the specified authentication token given by the server. Onetime information regarding the hotspot will be configured in the coding to connect the system to the Internet. As the device is connected to the Internet, the Blynk application is started up. All the readings and buttons of the GUI could be viewed and activated. The water pump switch icons would turn green whenever the system was turned on, while the icon turned black would indicate the water pump was off. From the figure, three displayed blocks could be found with some values. Those blocks were the place where the data from the sensors would be uploaded. The humidity and soil moisture value displayed is in percentage while the temperature is in °C . The system functionality and performance have been validated. After completing the onsite testing of our system, we have done some improvements and optimization based on the recommendation and suggestions by UMP Pilot Fertigation Farm management. We have implemented one more sensor for raindrop detection in our system, and we have modified the coding and Blynk GUI accordingly. Implementing such a sensor is to increase the data reliability of other sensors that are almost related to each other, including moisture, raindrop, temperature, and humidity. Since our system is a part of an ongoing research project, the expansion and improvements based on feedback from the industry and society are considered. The current version of our system is still being improved to be implemented in a Palm Oil Farm in collaboration with the industry. The updated Blynk GUI is shown in Fig. 15. We can monitor more surrounding conditions, and notification functionality has been enabled. Download : Download high-res image (722KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 15.

Conclusion and future work This study designed and fabricated a solar-powered and portable water pump with an IoT-controlled irrigation system, where sensors collect information about moisture, humidity, and temperature together for efficient monitoring and water pumping via a mobile application. We have considered several limitations in the conventional water pump to be solved in the proposed system: cost-effectiveness, saving energy, supporting pump mobility, facilitating remote monitoring and operation, and enabling IoT solutions in agriculture. For the coexistence of different microcontrollers used by various applications, we have selected the NodeMCU due to its low price, small size, low energy consumption, and good performance with Wi-Fi support. In addition, select the open-source Blynk IoT platform with a mobile application to receive the collected data from sensors and store it in the cloud. The developed portable solar water pump can efficiently use a renewable energy resource and be controlled remotely using smartphones. Six types of nozzles have been tested and evaluated regarding the implemented system's consumed energy and flow rate in a real environment. The cone nozzle has the highest power and flow rate among the six nozzles, while the jet nozzle has the lowest power and flow rate. Furthermore, the exploited water filter succeeds in filtering the pumped water for irrigation purposes. Since this paper is a part of an ongoing project, in the future, more functionalities will be enabled, such as pump automation based on the sensor readings. More sensors can be added to monitor more irrigation-related parameters, such as water quality sensors, GPS, flow rate, and light sensors. Furthermore, the developed Blynk-based dashboard can be extended by adding more gadgets and indicators. In this project, there are some limitations found during the testing phase. The circuit system requires a stable network connection. Whenever NodeMCU is disconnected from the network, it will try to reconnect the network. However, if the network is disconnected, the system will not be functioning. Thus, the utilization of long-range communication technology is among the considered improvements in our system in the nearest future. Besides that, the prototype's weight is unfulfilled to the target. The heavyweight could be due to the implemented two solar panels to supply more power to the system during the day activities and store some energy in the battery. However, the system's portability has decreased the weight effects and can be easily moved within the deployment site. Other than that, the system needs to be more automated to switch on/off the pump and the valve based on threshold values rather than remote control by the farmer. For example, we did not set a specific range of optimum temperature and humidity values of the surrounding; thus, we would not receive any notifications via the mobile application to activate the water pumping system. Therefore, a fully automated irrigation system with a minimum of manual requirements will be among our future works.

Abstract: As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture
(SM) inﬂuences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land surface and
atmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of SM is critical for numerous
large-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave remote sensing provides many algorithms to
obtain SM at large scale, such as SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are
almost low resolution and not applicable in small catchment or ﬁeld scale. Estimations of SM from
optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and signiﬁcant progress
has been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive and
systematic review of using optical and thermal remote sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis
and status of the estimation methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important
and latest advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown in this
paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly depends on the relationship
between SM and the surface reﬂectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared remote sensing
methods uses the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface
temperature/vegetation index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many
approximations. Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data can
provide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages and weaknesses
of different approaches are compared and applicable conditions as well as key issues in current soil
moisture estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are
proposed for future research.

1. Introduction
Soil moisture (SM) is an important variable in land surface system research, including studies
of the regional water cycle, agricultural irrigation management, climate change and environmental
monitoring [1–7]. SM links the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere and land surface
and indicates groundwater conditions [8,9]. Additionally, SM is used to indicate drought in vegetated
environments because water content is an essential factor for vegetation growth [10–12]. This means
that SM plays an important role in the terrestrial water cycle [13–16]. When soil moisture evaporates
into the atmosphere, energy exchange occurs between the atmosphere and land surface. On the
other hand, surface water and groundwater are linked with the vertical migration of the SM that
is taken up by vegetation for survival. Because the SM plays two vital roles, it is an indispensable

variable in terrestrial research. SM estimation studies originated in the 1960s because of the limitations
of measurement equipment and theoretical immaturity; however, this research mainly relies on
empirical relationships and point-based experiments [17–19]. In the 1970s and 1980s (corresponding
with theoretical advances), SM was treated as an important parameter in conjunction with other
surface parameters in comprehensive studies [20–26]. Since the 1990s, several studies have been
performed to determine methods for estimating SM [27–32]. In addition, due to the advent of remote
sensing technologies, researchers have gradually shifted their attention to monitoring large areas
by using remotely sensed data. Based on the optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, many
approaches have been developed by establishing relationships between SM and soil reﬂectivity or
surface temperature/vegetation coverage and soil thermal properties. Based on the microwave remote
sensing, various methods have been proposed for the past 35 years [6,33]. For passive microwave
remote sensing, the representative models are GOM [34], POM [34], SPM [34], IEM [35,36], AIEM [37,38],
Q/H [39,40] and Q/P [41] for bare soil area. The representative soil moisture estimation models for
vegetation area are MIMICS model [42], water-cloud model [43], crop model [44] and f-k model [45,46].
Due to the close relationship between backscatter coefﬁcients and SM, researchers developed different
SM modeling efforts from active microwave sensors, such as Empirical models [47,48], Semi-empirical
models [49–51] and Physically-based models [52–54]. At the regional scale, SM has been obtained by
using remote sensing techniques, which represent a new era in soil moisture estimations.

measurements [55–59].
The direct and most accurate method is the gravimetric method [60].
The original soil moisture content can be determined from changes in mass. However, this method is
destructive and cannot be reproduced. Moreover, this method requires a large amount of manpower for
sampling and lab measurements [61]. Time domain reﬂectometry (TDR), neutron probes and gamma
ray scanners are subsequently used to indirectly measure the SM. These methods are point-based and
cannot be used as a proxy for the regional SM.
The development of satellite technology provides a powerful method for monitoring the
spatial-temporal variations of regional SM and provides quantitative estimations. Many experts
have established different methods for retrieving SM based on the relationships between the SM and
satellite-derived land surface parameters. Using the visible infrared band, the SM can be derived from
the relationships between soil reﬂectance and different SMs or vegetation traits that occur under water
stress. These methods can be divided into two categories, (1) the single spectral analysis method; and
(2) the vegetation index method. For thermal infrared wavebands, the parameters related to the soil
thermal properties are mainly used to derive the SM. This method includes two categories, (1) the
thermal inertia method; and (2) the temperature index method. Combining visible and thermal infrared
remotely sensed data can provide more information for estimating soil moisture than the single one.
Spatial and temporal information-based methods have their own advantages and disadvantages.
It is therefore important to determine how to combine these methods reasonably to obtain highly
accurate SM.
In this article, SM estimation methods relying on optical and thermal remote sensing are collated
and summarized. Starting from the main methods currently used, the SM estimation status and major
issues are introduced. Next, the physical principles, advantages and existing problems regarding the
different methods are presented in detail. Finally, several recommendations are made based on current
issues faced when estimating SM. The overall framework of different remote sensing methods used in
soil moisture estimation is summarized in Table 1.

2. SM Estimation from Optical and Thermal Remote Sensing
Although the signal penetration capabilities of optical and thermal methods are worse than those of
thermal infrared and microwave methods, the reflectance domain is the most operational because the
images are easily available over a broad range of ground resolutions [77–82]. Wavelengths of 0.4–2.5 µm
represent the radiation of the sun reﬂected from the Earth’s surface [83,84]. These approaches mainly
use reﬂectance to estimate the SM in visible infrared remote sensing techniques. In this paper, according
to the different characteristics used of many bands in visible infrared remote sensing, they are divided
into the single spectral analysis method and vegetation index method.
2.1. Single Spectral Analysis Method
The inﬂuences of soil moisture on spectral reﬂectance were observed in early studies [85,86].
The reﬂectance of water absorption bands is different from that of non-absorption bands.
The absorption amplitude and presented reﬂectance differences are used to establish relationships
with soil moisture. From the experimental results on many soils with different SMs as early as 1925,
reﬂectance has been observed to decrease as the SM increases [85]. Since then, many scientists have
reproduced this phenomenon and have established empirical relationships between soil reﬂectance and
SM [87,88]. In 1972, Bowers and Smith demonstrated that the absorption amplitude was linearly related
to the SM at the water absorption bands [86]. Based on experimental results, Jackson et al. [89] found
that the albedos of all dry soils were approximately two times greater than those of wet soils, except for
sand. By analyzing the water absorption values measured in the near-infrared band, Dalal et al. [90]
accurately estimated the SMs of a large number of soil samples. However, the above-mentioned
methods are all limited to speciﬁc regions. Because of the different physical compositions, soil textures
and surface roughness in different study areas, empirical equations cannot be applied universally.
Corresponding with the development of monitoring instruments and theoretical advances
for estimating soil moisture, Jaquemoud et al. [91] developed the SOILSPEC transmission model,
which considers soil roughness, viewing angle and the inherent spectral characteristics of soil to obtain
the bidirectional reﬂectance of the soil from 450 nm to 2450 nm. Later, Lobell et al. [92] established
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308

a physical model and indicated that an exponential relationship exists between soil reﬂectance and
SM by analyzing the changes in the reﬂectance of four different soils at various moisture contents.
The model can be expressed simply as
R = f × Rdry + (1 − f ) × Rdry × (−c × s)
(1)
where Rdry is the dry soil reﬂectance, c describes the change rate induced by SM, s is the soil saturation,
and f is the saturation rate.
Liu et al. [93] applied a simple stepwise linear regression method to reduce the band numbers
and found that the soil reﬂectance decreased as the SM increased when the soil moisture was low.
However, after the soil moisture reaches the critical point, the reﬂectivity increases as the SM increases.
This critical point is closely related with the soil hydrodynamic characteristics. Based on previous
studies, Liu et al. [94] evaluated three soil reﬂectance models using 18 soils and the following methods:
the relative reﬂectivity method, the derivative/difference method and the discrete band difference
method. The most applicable method is the derivative/difference method because it can be used to
estimate the SM precisely and is less sensitive to external factors, such as the atmosphere and the large
variation of soil roughness and soil types, etc. Similarly, Whiting et al. [95] obtained better results by
using the Gaussian model to estimate the SM. Using a linear mixed pixel separation algorithm in the
near-infrared—red band space, Gao et al. [96] used soil line equations and empirical formulas to derive
the soil reﬂectance of mixed pixels under vegetation cover. Combined with the TM images for ﬁeld
veriﬁcation, this method is applicable at different spatial-temporal scales and the results are credible.
Based on laboratory measurements of soil spectral information, single spectral analysis approaches
are generally used to determine the relationships between SM and soil reﬂectance that can obtain
reasonable results for speciﬁc soil samples. However, in practice, soil reﬂectance is affected by many
factors, such as vegetation, the atmosphere, etc. The measured satellite signals on the surface will
be inﬂuenced or reduced, affecting the reﬂectance and its operability. In addition, such methods are
statistical and empirical models that lack physical basis to quantitatively determine the SM.
2.2. Vegetation Index Method
Because it is extremely sensitive to water stress, the vegetation index estimated by remote sensing
has been widely used to detect drought conditions, such as the normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [97]. Drought conditions can be reﬂected by vegetation
growth, which can be directly represented by the vegetation index. By comparing the vegetation index
at different times, the impacts of drought can easily be determined. However, the accuracy of using
NDVI-based drought indices is often subject to changes in vegetation types and ecosystem differences.
Additionally, the NDVI-based drought index may be a conservative indicator [32] because droughts
caused by water stress or rainfall anomalies will both have time delays [98]. A detailed overview of
the drought indices for regional monitoring was provided by Richard and Heim [99].
Many classical drought indices based on vegetation indicators were proposed and have been
widely used in drought monitoring. To remove the inﬂuences of weather and geographic location
differences on NDVI, Kogan [100,101] developed the following Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)
based on statistical NDVI time-series data:
VCIij = 100 ∗ (NDVIij − NDVI − MINj)
NDVI − MAXj − NDVI − MINj
(2)
where VCI is a modiﬁed NDVI, vegetation condition index; NDVI is a weekly smoothed composite
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. NDVI-MIN and NDVI-MAX are the maximum and minimum
values of NDVI, respectively, which can be obtained from historical data. i and j denote weeks and
locations. VCI not only describes the surface vegetation cover and spatial-temporal variations but also
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308
5 of 29
quantiﬁes the impacts of weather on vegetation. Furthermore, VCI can be used to evaluate the effects
of weather on different ecosystems.
Considering the error caused by the instantaneous vegetation index and using the multi-year
average NDVI values as criterion, the difference in amplitude was calculated from the NDVI values
obtained over one month or ten days minus the reference value, which are positive or negative
anomalies of the vegetation index. Chen et al. [102] developed an anomaly vegetation index (AVI) to
study annual vegetation dynamics.
The monthly AVI is calculated as follows:
AMTNDVI = (MTNDVI − MTNDVI)
(3)
where AMTNDVI is the anomaly vegetation index, MTNDVI is the average value for the same month
in different years, and MTNDVI is the monthly vegetation index for a speciﬁc year.
Because its sensitivity to water differs, the relationships among different water absorption bands
were applied to derive the SM. Gao et al. [103] presented a normalized difference water index (NDWI)
using the reﬂectance at 1.24 µm rather than 0.66 µm because the former is more sensitive to SM.
More importantly, the NDWI is insensitive to the atmospheric conditions.
NDWI = ρ (0.86 µm) − ρ (1.24 µm)
ρ (0.86 µm) + ρ (1.24 µm)
(4)
where p is the reﬂectance. Based on the NDWI, Wang et al. [104] proposed using the normalized
multi-band drought index (NMDI), which uses the band differences between the sensitivity of 1640 nm
and 2130 nm for soil and vegetation, respectively, with enhanced sensitivity to drought monitoring.
The successful application in detecting forest ﬁres demonstrated that NMDI can provide a quick
response to moisture changes [105,106].
NMDI = R860 nm − (R1640 nm − R2130 nm)
R860 nm + (R1640 nm − R2130 nm)
(5)
where R is the reﬂectance. Considering the effects on the spectral signatures of soil moisture variations,
a new method was developed for drought monitoring [107]. Based on the spectral pattern of SM
changes in the near-infrared–red band space, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) was established
using ETM reﬂectance (Figure 1).

variations but also quantifies the impacts of weather on vegetation. Furthermore, VCI can be used to

of SM changes in the near-infrared–red band space, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) was 
established using ETM reflectance (Figure 1).

For a speciﬁc soil type, the soil line can be regarded as a line that characterizes the spectral behavior
of non-vegetated pixels when the soil moisture content varies noticeably [108]. The PDI describes the
SM distribution in the near-infrared—red space. The points farther away from the coordinate origin
indicate low soil moisture areas. In contrast, the closer points represent wet conditions and the PDI is
expressed as follows:
PDI =
1
√
M2 + 1
(RRed + MRNIR)
(6)
where RNIR and RRed denote the reﬂectance of near-infrared and red band, respectively; M represents
the slope of the soil line. The PDI is suitable for bare soil but has many limitations in vegetated areas,
especially for non-ﬂat regions with different soil types.
Ghulam et al. [108] introduced fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) for the removal of vegetation
information from mixed pixels and proposed the Modiﬁed Perpendicular Drought Index—MPDI. If the
relationship between the reﬂectance of vegetation and bare soil is linear, the MPDI can be expressed
as follows:
MPDI = RRed + MRNIR − fv(Rv,Red + MRv,NIR)
(1 − fv)
√
M2 + 1
(7)
where Rv,Red and Rv,NIR are the vegetation reﬂectances in the red and near-infrared band, respectively,
generally set to 0.05 and 0.5 by ﬁeld measurements [108]. fv is the vegetation cover. By considering
the SM status and vegetation growth, the MPDI can be applied to vegetated regions to obtain
credible results.
The vegetation indicator method can reﬂect the SM conditions from the vegetation index changes.
The advantages and disadvantages of these commonly used drought indices are described in Table 2.
Because the vegetation index cannot immediately reveal information when the vegetation is restricted
by water stress, a long period is required to show the water-limited features after some accumulation;
thus, this method requires a certain time lag to show real-time SM conditions. Second, the inter-annual
changes of land cover types may affect drought monitoring results. Therefore, interpretation of the
monitoring results should require the latest reliable land cover map. Simultaneously, these methods
only consider that water stress leads to reductions in the NDVI and do not account for other factors,
such as changes in temperature and rainfall. In addition, good quality satellite data obtained over
a long period of many years must be obtained, and the obtained results only reﬂect the SM deﬁcit
situation and not the true soil moisture content.

3. SM Estimations from Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing
In many surface temperature studies, the surface temperature variations at the thermal wavebands
or the soil thermal properties were strongly correlated with the SM. Due to the special thermal
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308

properties of the soil in the thermal infrared band and its theoretical maturity, SM estimations are
gradually achieved. The thermal inertia and temperature index methods are two main methods
with their own advantages and disadvantages. The development process and their advantages and
limitations are introduced in the following. Also, some useful references and recommendations
were provided.
3.1. Thermal Inertia Method
As a property of the substance itself, thermal inertia is often used for mineral exploration,
lithological mapping and geological research. Thermal inertia was highly correlated with SM in
numerous laboratory experiments and is deﬁned as the resistance to temperature variations that is
induced by exterior energy and controls the amplitude of the temperature change. The higher the
thermal inertia, the less the temperature varies. The relationship between thermal inertia and SM can
be determined quantitatively from the changes in soil temperature or the diurnal amplitude of the
surface temperature. Generally, thermal inertia includes the soil thermal conductivity and soil heat
capacity. The soil thermal inertia can be expressed as follows:
P =
p
λρC
(8)
where λ is the soil thermal conductivity, ρ is the soil bulk density, and C is the soil heat capacity.
When the SM increases, the thermal inertia increases correspondingly and reduces the diurnal
amplitude variations of the land surface temperature (LST).
3.1.1. The Physical Analytical Model
In geophysical research, soil thermal properties and SM show certain relationships [109,110].
Watson [26] ﬁrst proposed physical analytical equations of thermal inertia that were retrieved from
remotely sensed data. The SM was successfully estimated using several meteorological elements,
the soil moisture proﬁle and remote sensing information. In addition, Kahle [23] conducted many
studies on thermal inertia models, proposed different approaches for solving one-dimensional heat
conduction equations, and attempted to integrate remotely sensed data to estimate thermal inertia
for large regions. In addition, Price [111] simpliﬁed the latent and sensible heat ﬂux expression and
combined the surface one-dimensional heat conduction equation with the energy balance principle by
using Fourier transformation to introduce a comprehensive surface parameter B (B is a function of soil
emissivity, air humidity, temperature and other meteorological factors). Because of the requirements
of a large number of observed ground data in the B solving process, this approach is unavailable for
many regions.
Many thermal inertia models have treated thermal rock and soil characteristics as a simpliﬁed
linear function of temperature [23,26]. However, Engman [112] considered that this relationship is
nonlinear and includes factors such as the effects of night frost. When combined with microwave data
to solve the thermal inertia in vegetated areas and validate in situ measurements, the obtained results
were reasonable [113].
Based on the above-mentioned models, Price [111] proposed using the classical apparent thermal
inertia (ATI) by removing the latent heat of evaporation. The ATI can be expressed as follows:
ATI = 1000π
(1 − α) · C1
T (1 : 30 p.m.) − T (2 : 30 a.m.)
(9)
where 1000π is used to make the ATI range from 0 to 255. C1 is the constant term. T is the land surface
temperature, and α is the surface albedo.
The ATI model is accepted by many scholars, and extensive studies have been conducted in different
areas. Combined with the ATI model and MODIS data, Stephen et al. [114] quantitatively estimated
the SM and sediment availability for a White ShashaQiu field in New Mexico. Verstraeten et al. [115]
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308
8 of 29
used the ATI model to obtain the SM conditions in Xinjiang and the soil moisture content by using
a two-source water balance model at a depth of 1 m. The results were veriﬁed by using TDR
measurements, and the drought distribution and trends were analyzed in Xinjiang. Frank et al. [116]
ﬁt the diurnal temperature variation curve of the in-situ measured surface temperature in combination
with the albedo to obtain the ATI and used AMSR-E soil moisture data for validation. The greatest
advantage of this method is that surface temperature can be obtained from the observation sites,
which is beneﬁcial for the equatorial regions. Chang et al. [117] studied the soil moisture conditions of
different types of land in tropical mountains using the ATI model.
To accurately derive the SM, Chen et al. [118] monitored the spring drought by using the improved
ATI model for the Hebei Plain. Next, 1 km pure pixels were merged with images with 30 m resolution
from the 1st environmental satellite (HJ-1) and the drought was accurately monitored in the vegetated
mixing zone. It was concluded that the traditional ATI model was the most suitable for bare land areas
and that the inversion accuracy of the mixed pixels was poor.
The physical thermal inertia model can provide information regarding hydrothermally relevant
principles and the relationships with SM; however, this model requires detailed atmospheric forcing
data inputs and a complex calculation process. ATI is used as a proxy of thermal inertia, and because
many factors are truncated, accuracy is often not guaranteed. In addition, ATI is not applicable in
vegetated regions. For vegetated areas, FVC should be used to estimate thermal inertia. Moreover, the
ATI can be combined with other soil moisture indexes to calculate the SM [115]. Because ATI is simple
and easy to operate, it is promising for broad applications.
3.1.2. The Model Based on the Amplitude and Phase Information of LST
Xue and Cracknell [119] introduced land surface temperature phase information to simplify the
analytical thermal inertia model, in which only the ground auxiliary data, the time that the maximum
LST occurs, is required and the real thermal inertia can be obtained. This approach greatly simpliﬁes
the sophisticated calculation process. Thus, many scholars have subsequently estimated SM using this
method. Cai et al. [120] used the full thermal inertia model of [119] and a second order approximation
approach to retrieve the thermal inertia surface that was applied to north China to monitor the SM
status and achieve good results.
The main equation of the full model [121] is
P = (1 − A)S0Ct
∆T√ω
A1[cos(ωt2 − δ1) − cos(ωt1 − δ1)]
q
1 + 1
b +
1
2b2
δ1 = ωtmax − 2mπ, m = 0, 1, 2 . . .
(10)
where A is the albedo, S0 is the solar constant. b is a synthesized term. Ct is the atmospheric
transmittance in the visible spectrum (typically 0.75). w is the Earth rotation velocity. δ is the phase
angle. ∆T is the temperature difference. If n = 1, P can reach a maximum value. In addition, t is the
time at which the maximum LST occurs.
The model proposed by Xue and Cracknell requires important auxiliary parameters from the
ground-based observations (the time of the maximum LST occurs) but, in practical applications, the
maximum air temperature observation time is used as an input value. Because the maximum LST and
air temperature occurred differently with time, the model induces uncertainties by using the maximum
air temperature. Because polar-orbiting satellites are limited by the times that they pass over the same
area and cannot obtain constant observations, the method proposed by Sobrino includes a certain
degree of difﬁculty. However, the emergence of geostationary satellites would support this method
and many observations can be obtained for the same study area in one day. In addition, the use of
observation periods in the model has not been speciﬁcally validated.
Based on the model proposed by Xue and Cracknell, Sobrino et al. [122,123] developed the
Four Temperature Algorithm (FTA) to calculate soil thermal inertia by using three surface temperatures
at different times on the same day from all the calibrated remote sensing results, including viewing
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308
9 of 29
geometry and atmospheric correction. The results were reasonable and veriﬁed for the Iberian
Peninsula and Morocco.
The key process of the FTA model is:
δ1 = arctan(ξ) + (2mπ + 1), m = 0, 1, 2 . . .
ξ =
(Tj−Tk)[cos(ωti)−cos(ωtj)]−(Ti−Tj)[cos(ωtj)−cos(ωtk)]
(Ti−Tj)[sin(ωtj)−sin(ωtk)]−(Tj−Tk)[sin(ωti)−sin(ωtj)]
(11)
where the symbols in the above equation is the same as the Equation (10). This method used three
different time phases to solve the equations, and the phase angle information can be written as
a function of LST and satellite overpass time, which eliminates the ground auxiliary data; thus,
the soil thermal inertia can only be obtained from remotely sensed data. Because it is difﬁcult to
obtain more than two high-quality remotely sensed images in one day from remote sensing satellites
(except geostationary satellites) and because of night clouds and atmospheric effects, this method has
encountered many problems in practical applications and is difﬁcult to use universally.
Recently, people actively sought high-accurate methods for solving thermal inertia. Wang [106]
proposed using a simple thermal inertia estimation method based on idealized soil temperature to
obtain an analytical solution for diffusion in the sinusoidal form. Thermal inertia can be expressed as
a scale factor in a linear relationship between the soil heat ﬂux and surface temperature amplitude;
thus, the estimation accuracy was improved. The biggest advantage of this method is that the available
input parameters can be easily obtained from remotely sensed data. Moreover, fewer model input
parameters are needed and the precision is high.
Maltese [124] analyzed the applicable conditions of a thermal inertia model in sparsely vegetated
areas and introduced a correction factor for cloud effects to rectify downward shortwave radiation.
The applicability of the thermal inertia model was evaluated under changeable weather conditions.
Meanwhile, Robock et al. [125] studied the data quality of a thermal inertia model combined
with a two-source model to separate skin temperature for vegetation and bare soil and conducted
a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters, such as solar radiation and meteorological data.
The thermal inertia was obtained by using thermal budget model.
3.1.3. Analysis Method Based on Energy Sources
Verhoef [126] indicated that the direct energy source of thermal inertia is soil heat ﬂux rather than
net radiation and developed a surface temperature difference method between sunset and sunrise for
solving thermal inertia. If the latent heat ﬂux and sensible heat ﬂux are both zero and the net radiation
remains constant on clear windless nights, the following formula can be used:
(Ch
p
Dh)r = 2
Rn
 √
∆t
∆Ts
√π
(12)
where
Rn
 is the average net radiation ﬂux between sunset and sunrise (W·m−2), ∆t is the time
interval (s), and ∆Ts is the decrease in LST between sunset and sunrise (◦C), Ch is the soil heat capacity
(MJ·m−3·K−1), Dh is the thermal diffusivity (m2·s−1).
By comparing different methods to estimate thermal inertia and soil heat ﬂux, Murray and
Verhoef [127–129] conﬁrmed that this approach is relatively simple and reliable. However, because
of the harsh applicable conditions, this method has rarely been used. First, this method requires
a clear and windless night with constant net radiation. These weather conditions are generally difﬁcult
to satisfy. In addition, it is difﬁcult to guarantee image quality at night, which results in incorrect
estimation results.

3.1.4. Remote Sensing Methods Combined with Soil Physical Parameters
A relationship with soil moisture can be established based on the deﬁnition of thermal inertia if
soil characteristics and remotely sensed data are available for estimating thermal inertia. Lu et al. [130]
proposed using a simple model that considers the soil solid composition and other known pivotal soil
characteristics, such as soil composition and density.
The main equations are calculated as follows:
P = Pdry + (Psat − Pdry)Kp
(13)
Kp = exp[γ(1 − Sγ−δ
r
)]
(14)
where Pdry and Psat are the dry and wet soil thermal inertia, respectively, and Kp is the Kersten correction
function. γ and δ were soil texture dependent model parameters and Sr was the degree of saturation.
In addition, Verstraeten et al. [106] used the apparent thermal inertia and soil moisture
saturation index (SMSI) combined with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) data to estimate the
SM. When verifying the analysis by using in-situ data and the microwave moisture content, the results
showed that the values and trends ﬁt well. M. Minacapilli [131,132] normalized the Kp function by
using ATI with remotely sensed data to obtain the actual thermal inertia based on the soil porosity.
Thermal inertia methods focus on soil thermal characteristics and have clear physical meanings
that are relatively easy to understand. Different methods are compared in Table 3. In practical
applications, clear day and night images are difﬁcult to obtain for the same area of interest because of
clouds, and the accuracy for night image is difﬁcult to conﬁrm. Simultaneously, the assumption that
the soil properties at the horizontal and vertical scale are consistent is not readily satisﬁed. Moreover, in
areas with high vegetation cover, vegetation conceals the soil information, which affects the estimation
accuracy. Thus, this method is only applicable to bare and sparsely vegetated areas.

3.2. Temperature Index Method
Land surface temperature is one control parameter for the physical and biological processes that
occur at the land surface. For bare soil area, LST refers to the soil surface temperature; and for densely
vegetated areas, the LST indicates the vegetation canopy temperature under the assumption of energy
balance. An increase in the vegetation canopy temperature is an initial indicator that the vegetation is
subject to water stress. Therefore, the LST can be used to monitor the SM.

3.2.1. Normalized Difference Temperature Index
Considering the seasonal variations of the LST, Mcvicar et al. [133] developed the normalized
difference temperature index (NDTI) to reﬂect the SM conditions. The NDTI is calculated as follows:
NDTI = (LST∞ − LST)/(LST∞ − LST0)
(15)
where LST∞ and LST0 are the simulated LSTs of the inﬁnite and zero surface impedance, respectively,
which are the upper (extremely dry state) and lower (extremely wet state) boundary conditions for the
LST at speciﬁc atmospheric forcing and surface impedance. The surface energy balance principle and
aerodynamic impedance model can be used to obtain the extreme LSTs.
NDTI eliminates the effects of the seasonal variations of LST. The SM is very similar to the
NDTI [134]. Thus, the NDTI can accurately reﬂect the spatial-temporal variations of SM. However, this
model requires solar radiation, wind speed and LAI as input values, which could limit the operability
of the model.
3.2.2. Crop Water Stress Index
Soil water availability is a basic variable for the evapotranspiration process. In addition, the SM
affects the evapotranspiration rate. Evapotranspiration and energy are closely related to the SM.
When the energy is high and the SM is sufﬁcient, strong evapotranspiration occurs and the canopy
temperature is lower. By contrast, evapotranspiration is weak and the canopy temperature increases
when the vegetation is subjected to water stress. For a speciﬁc atmospheric condition, the ratio of
actual and potential evapotranspiration can be used as a proxy for crop water stress. Based on the
surface energy balance model, Jackson et al. [135] proposed using the crop water stress index (CWSI)
to mirror the ratio between vegetation transpiration and maximum potential evaporation. The CWSI
is obtained from the vegetation canopy temperature, ambient air temperature and net solar radiation.
The CWSI formula is shown as follows:
CWSI =
(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)min
(Tc − Ta)max − (Tc − Ta)min
(16)
where Tc is the vegetation canopy temperature, Ta is the air temperature, and (Tc–Ta)max and (Tc–Ta)min
are the difference between the canopy and air temperature without transpiration and potential
evaporation, respectively.
The CWSI uses thermal infrared temperatures and meteorological data to indirectly reﬂect the SM
under crops. This method has clear physical meaning based on the surface energy balance principle.
In addition, this method is highly precise in regions covered by vegetation and the estimation accuracy
is higher than that of the thermal inertia method [136]. However, the CWSI was established based on
the single canopy energy balance model, which is less effective for early crop growth. In addition,
this approach requires meteorological data and the calculation process is complex. Furthermore,
the extrapolation methods used for meteorological data, which are mainly obtained from ground
weather stations, have important impacts on the accuracies of the CWSI determinations.
4. SM Estimations from Visible and Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Data
4.1. The Spatial Information-Based Method
Many studies have demonstrated that LST and VI (vegetation index/vegetation coverage) can
provide vegetation water stress conditions and SM information [137–148]. If the number of pixels in
the study area is sufﬁcient and the clouds and water bodies are removed, the spatial distribution of
LST and VI constitute triangular or trapezoidal feature space. The SM can be obtained from the pixel
distribution in the LST-VI feature space.
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308

Because the surface energy maintains balance in the LST-VI feature space, lower latent heat ﬂux
results in more available energy for the surface sensible heat ﬂux. For transpiration, which is a crucial
parameter, the stomatal resistance is inﬂuenced by the soil moisture availability. In sparsely vegetated
regions, the thermal soil inertia affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into the soil and
the soil heat ﬂux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a function of soil type and soil moisture
variations [151]. In addition, the surface available energy (Rn-G) also inﬂuences the LST. The control
of the surface temperature by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation areas have lower
temperatures. In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil type, soil moisture and vegetation cover.
Furthermore, incident radiation affects transpiration and stomatal resistance, and the net radiation can
be decomposed to sensible and latent heat ﬂux. The transfer of energy as heat from the surface to the
atmosphere is an important component for surface temperature and explains why the temperatures
in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness are lower than those in areas with bare soil, which
inﬂuences the shape of the LST-VI space.
The LST-VI feature space is restricted by the dry and wet edges. The wet edge in the feature
space represents maximum evapotranspiration and adequate soil moisture and the dry edge indicates
that the vegetation is subjected to water stress in which evapotranspiration reaches the minimum and
the SM is 0 (no water can be used). For different vegetation types, the dry edge includes the driest
points and the vegetation evapotranspiration varies depending on the amount of vegetation coverage.
For certain types, the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly equal. Because cooling affects
evaporation, the surface temperature is maximized at the dry edge and minimized at the wet edge.
Different views of the surface temperature in the fully vegetated area resulted in the development of
the triangular and trapezoidal methods. The triangular method assumes that the surface temperatures
of fully vegetated areas are equal to the wettest surface temperature. However, the trapezoidal method
assumes that the surface temperatures of fully vegetated surfaces are much higher than those of the
wettest surface.
4.1.1. The Triangle Method
With the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price [152] ﬁrst proposed the concept of
triangular space. The triangle method is proposed based on surface temperatures and VI scatter plots
obtained using satellites (Figure 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface model,
the simulated feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing the position of the image element
in space to infer the SM.

crucial parameter, the stomatal resistance is influenced by the soil moisture availability. In sparsely 
vegetated regions, the thermal soil inertia affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into 
the soil and the soil heat flux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a function of soil type and 
soil moisture variations [151]. In addition, the surface available energy (Rn-G) also influences the 
LST. The control of the surface temperature by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation 
areas have lower temperatures. In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil type, soil moisture 
and vegetation cover. Furthermore, incident radiation affects transpiration and stomatal resistance, 
and the net radiation can be decomposed to sensible and latent heat flux. The transfer of energy as 
heat from the surface to the atmosphere is an important component for surface temperature and 
explains why the temperatures in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness are lower than 
those in areas with bare soil, which influences the shape of the LST-VI space. 
The LST-VI feature space is restricted by the dry and wet edges. The wet edge in the feature 
space represents maximum evapotranspiration and adequate soil moisture and the dry edge 
indicates that the vegetation is subjected to water stress in which evapotranspiration reaches the 
minimum and the SM is 0 (no water can be used). For different vegetation types, the dry edge 
includes the driest points and the vegetation evapotranspiration varies depending on the amount of 
vegetation coverage. For certain types, the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly equal. 
Because cooling affects evaporation, the surface temperature is maximized at the dry edge and 
minimized at the wet edge. Different views of the surface temperature in the fully vegetated area 
resulted in the development of the triangular and trapezoidal methods. The triangular method 
assumes that the surface temperatures of fully vegetated areas are equal to the wettest surface 
temperature. However, the trapezoidal method assumes that the surface temperatures of fully 
vegetated surfaces are much higher than those of the wettest surface.  
4.1.1. The Triangle Method 
With the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price [152] first proposed the concept of 
triangular space. The triangle method is proposed based on surface temperatures and VI scatter 
plots obtained using satellites (Figure 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface 
model, the simulated feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing the position of the image 
element in space to infer the SM.  
 
Figure 2. The idealized triangle space between Ts and Fv [138]. 
The LST-VI triangular feature space established under the full ranges of SM and vegetation is 
characteristic of a space bounded with an upper decreasing envelope and a lower nearly horizontal 
envelope with increasing vegetation cover and with two envelopes ultimately intersecting at a 
(truncated) point of full vegetation cover [153]. Price [152] presented the LST-VI triangular space 
using satellite remotely sensed AVHRR data and analyzed the impacts of cirrus on soil moisture. 
Nemani [147] studied the scale effects of the LST-VI space and its orographic influences on LST and 
VI and indicated that vegetation type and topography are two decisive factors. Similarly, Clark [142] 
applied multi-spectral data to monitor drought and presented an empirical model. Mallick [154]

Nemani [147] studied the scale effects of the LST-VI space and its orographic inﬂuences on LST and
VI and indicated that vegetation type and topography are two decisive factors. Similarly, Clark [142]
applied multi-spectral data to monitor drought and presented an empirical model. Mallick [154]
retrieved SM using the triangle method at the ﬁeld and landscapes scales by using ASTER and MODIS,
respectively. Both results were reasonable. The inversion accuracy is much lower for high spatial
resolution images because it is more difﬁcult to reﬂect heterogeneity within the pixels.
The main assumptions of the triangle method are that (1) the complete underlying vegetation
cover from the bare soil to full vegetation is know; (2) the variations in the space are not primarily
caused by differences in atmospheric conditions but are caused by variations in the available SM;
and (3) the sensitivity of LST to the canopy and soil is different. Due to the special characteristic of
triangular space, the major advantages of this method include the following: (1) it can estimate the
SM from entirely remotely sensed data without any ground auxiliary data; and (2) it is simple and
easy to operate and can monitor drought conditions over large regions. Meanwhile, the limitations
include the following: (1) the LST-VI space determination requires a certain degree of subjectivity;
(2) the number of pixels is large enough to span a wide range of soil wetness and vegetation cover in
the study area; and (3) many limitations occur in regions that are not ﬂat.
4.1.2. The Trapezoid Method
Using experiments, Jackson [155] explored the relationships between drought and differences in
vegetation leaf and air temperature by using measured data and proposed a drought index—CWSI.
To calculate the pixel values of intermediate vegetation cover and SM for a speciﬁc time, four vertices of
the trapezoid are required that correspond to (1) well-watered, full-cover vegetation; (2) water-stressed,
full-cover vegetation; (3) saturated bare soil; and (4) dry bare soil. These values should be computed
ﬁrst by using the CWSI theory and Penman-Monteith equation. This index can only be used for fully
vegetated areas and is not applicable in sparsely vegetated areas.
Based on the theory of the CWSI, Moran [31] developed the water deﬁcit index (WDI) (Figure 3) to
overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. This index can be used in all areas covered by vegetation
and in areas with sparse vegetation. Relying on the surface energy balance principle, the soil adjusted
vegetation index (SAVI) and the temperature difference form a trapezoidal space, and the index can
be directly calculated from remotely sensed data without requirements for measuring leaf and air
temperature. After the model test and in situ data validation, the WDI was evaluated to overestimate
the water deﬁcit situations in many sparsely vegetated regions.
Compared with the triangular space, the trapezoidal space does not require a large number of
pixels. The advantages of the trapezoidal method are that (1) it has a robust physical basis and that
(2) the space determined from the four vertices is the main limiting condition that is close to the true
conditions of the land surface. In contrast, the disadvantages include that this method (1) requires
more ground-based parameters to calculate the soil moisture index and that (2) the inﬂuences of water
stress on vegetation cover have a time lag that induces uncertainties for SM estimations.

retrieved SM using the triangle method at the field and landscapes scales by using ASTER and 
MODIS, respectively. Both results were reasonable. The inversion accuracy is much lower for high 
spatial resolution images because it is more difficult to reflect heterogeneity within the pixels. 
The main assumptions of the triangle method are that (1) the complete underlying vegetation 
cover from the bare soil to full vegetation is know; (2) the variations in the space are not primarily 
caused by differences in atmospheric conditions but are caused by variations in the available SM; 
and (3) the sensitivity of LST to the canopy and soil is different. Due to the special characteristic of 
triangular space, the major advantages of this method include the following: (1) it can estimate the 
SM from entirely remotely sensed data without any ground auxiliary data; and (2) it is simple and 
easy to operate and can monitor drought conditions over large regions. Meanwhile, the limitations 
include the following: (1) the LST-VI space determination requires a certain degree of subjectivity; 
(2) the number of pixels is large enough to span a wide range of soil wetness and vegetation cover in 
the study area; and (3) many limitations occur in regions that are not flat. 
4.1.2. The Trapezoid Method 
Using experiments, Jackson [155] explored the relationships between drought and differences 
in vegetation leaf and air temperature by using measured data and proposed a drought 
index—CWSI. To calculate the pixel values of intermediate vegetation cover and SM for a specific 
time, four vertices of the trapezoid are required that correspond to (1) well-watered, full-cover 
vegetation; (2) water-stressed, full-cover vegetation; (3) saturated bare soil; and (4) dry bare soil. 
These values should be computed first by using the CWSI theory and Penman-Monteith equation. 
This index can only be used for fully vegetated areas and is not applicable in sparsely vegetated 
areas. 
Based on the theory of the CWSI, Moran [31] developed the water deficit index (WDI) (Figure 3) 
to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. This index can be used in all areas covered by 
vegetation and in areas with sparse vegetation. Relying on the surface energy balance principle, the 
soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the temperature difference form a trapezoidal space, and 
the index can be directly calculated from remotely sensed data without requirements for measuring 
leaf and air temperature. After the model test and in situ data validation, the WDI was evaluated to 
overestimate the water deficit situations in many sparsely vegetated regions. 
Compared with the triangular space, the trapezoidal space does not require a large number of 
pixels. The advantages of the trapezoidal method are that (1) it has a robust physical basis and that 
(2) the space determined from the four vertices is the main limiting condition that is close to the true 
conditions of the land surface. In contrast, the disadvantages include that this method (1) requires 
more ground-based parameters to calculate the soil moisture index and that (2) the influences of 
water stress on vegetation cover have a time lag that induces uncertainties for SM estimations.

4.2. The Temporal Information-Based Method
Polar-orbiting satellites can only provide several remotely sensed data points each day, which does
not satisfy the requirements of long time series data. However, geostationary satellites can provide
more data than the polar-orbiting ones. Based on the advantages of geostationary satellites, net surface
shortwave radiation (NSSR) and LST form an elliptical shape [156,157] (Figure 4). By conducting
a systematic sensitivity study on the inﬂuences of environmental factors and atmospheric parameters
on LST and its temporal variations over bare surfaces, the results indicated that two LST temporal
variables, TN (the increasing rate of LST normalized by the difference in the NSSR 1.5 and 4.5 h after
sunrise in the mid-morning) and td (the time at which the daily maximum temperature occurs) are
highly related to the SM [158]. A simple multi-linear model was used to estimate the SM by using the
TN and td. The equation is expressed as follows:
SWC = b0 + b1 ∗ ln(TN ∗ 20) + b2 ∗ td − 12
DT
(17)
where SM is the surface soil moisture. The parameters td, TN and DT are calculated from the Noah
LSM simulation results, and b0, b1 and b2 are the regression coefﬁcients. The developed model can by
used to estimate SM with a high accuracy for a given day (the RMSE is approximately 0.025 m3/m3).
Based on the study of Zhao, Song and Leng [159] established a physical elliptical model with
5 coefﬁcients and evaluated the effects of model parameters on the developed ellipse model (Figure 5).
A stepwise multi-linear regression was used to ﬁt the SM, and a multi-linear relationship was used to
retrieve the daily average SM as follows:
SWC = n1 ∗ x0 + n2 ∗ y0 + n3 ∗ a + n4 ∗ θ + n0
(18)
where SM is the daily average soil moisture content (m3/m3) and x0, y0, a, and θ are the ellipse
parameters that represent the center horizontal coordinate and center vertical coordinates of the ellipse
and the semi-major axis and rotation angle, respectively. In addition, ni (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) represents
the ﬁtting coefﬁcients. When validated by two AmeriFlux sites, the estimation accuracies can reach
R2 = 0.548 when RMSE = 0.088 m3 /m3 and R2 = 0.445 when RMSE = 0.126 m3 /m3. These results
demonstrated that the developed model can accurately estimate the daily average SM.

Figure 5. The ellipse change with the different soil moisture content. 
The temporal information-based method relies on the temporal changes of NSSR and LST to 
establish a relationship with the SM. The elliptical model parameters were used to determine the 
SM. Accurate estimation results were achieved for specific atmospheric conditions. The main 
advantages of this method include the following: (1) the proposed model is independent on the soil 
types; (2) the quantitative SM is determined by using the method rather than from the empirical 
relationship between SM and the remotely sensed parameters; and (3) the diurnal changes of the 
land surface parameters are used rather than the instantaneous parameters that have many 
uncertainties at some moments. However, the limitations of the proposed model are discussed 
below. (1) The model is suitable for bare soils on cloudless days and the accuracy is greatly reduced 
in the vegetated areas. This reduction in accuracy occurs because the elliptical shape constructed by 
the NSSR and LST appears under bare soil conditions. When the surface is covered by vegetation, 
the surface energy distribution is more complex than that of the bare soil and the elliptical shape is 
affected by the vegetation interference; (2) the coefficients of the proposed model change with 
atmospheric conditions. Thus, it is difficult to fix to the coefficients to establish a universal equation 
for estimating SM. Additionally, how to acquire these model parameters at the regional scale must 
be addressed before applying the proposed SM model to remotely sensed data [156]. Therefore, 
these two problems are important issues that concern the application of the model with remotely 
sensed observations and are promising as a foundation for future work. Moreover, investigating the 
relationships between the model parameters and atmospheric conditions is probably a promising 
avenue for making the SM retrieval model universal.  
5. Current Problems and Discussions 
Despite significant progress made since the 1960s in SM retrieval methods, from empirical 
simplified equations to more complex physically based models using remote sensing technology, 
and to estimate regional SM and resulting in many SM missions (as shown in Table 4), many 
problems have still not been solved. These problems are mainly associated with the input 
parameters of SM models, the estimation accuracy and the physical interpretation of different 
surface variables from satellite data at the temporal and spatial data/model scales, and the validation 
of SM obtained from remotely sensed data at the regional/global scale. These issues will be discussed 
briefly below.

5.1. The Uncertainties of the Input Parameters Used in Soil Moisture Estimation Models
The accuracy of the estimated SM is inﬂuenced by the input variables that must be accurately
obtained from in situ measurements or remote sensing. Inaccurate input parameters can induce many
uncertainties in soil moisture estimations. For example, one advantage of the model proposed by Xue
and Cracknell [182] is to apply the variations in the surface temperature phase to estimate thermal
inertia. However, in the derivation process, the equation requires a priori knowledge of the time
at which the maximum LST occurs. In practical applications, authors always use the maximum air
temperature observed at ground meteorological stations instead, since the maximum air temperature
is easy to obtain. In addition, according to previous studies, the maximum LST is lower than the
maximum air temperature by up to 4–5 ◦C [155]. Thus, accurate maximum air temperature estimation
using the remotely sensed data provides an effective means to obtain precise real thermal inertia.
In addition, based on the model proposed by Xue, Sobrino et al. developed a new remotely sensed
model, the FTA model, to estimate thermal inertia by using the phase differences between the different
overpass times of the NOAA satellite. Current problems include: (1) the polar-orbiting satellite data
cannot satisfy the requirements of high quality images; and (2) the observed surface times are 2:30,
7:30, 14:30 and 19:30, respectively, and the surface difference is obtained at 2:30 and 14:30. The phase
differences are determined at 7:30, 14:30 and 19:30. In addition, with the development of the satellites,
the geostationary meteorological satellite can provide many data in one day, which can compensate for
the limitations of polar-orbiting satellites. Moreover, large errors can be induced by the LSTs twice each
day to simulate the daily LST variations, and more data are required to simulate the diurnal variations
in surface temperature [183].
The accuracy of the input parameters partially determined the robustness of the SM estimation
models. In practical applications, many studies have ignored the limitations of these models or have
selected approximate parameters. Consequently, although the soil moisture estimation can satisfy
a certain degree of accuracy, they are usually not used correctly. Soil moisture estimation models
are obtained using many preconditions and assumptions. Therefore, model selection based on the
underlying conditions and the required input parameters is very important. It is worth noting that
the mismatch in scale between the point-based observations and the remotely sensed data remains
a problem to be solved.

5.2. Soil Moisture under Vegetation
The sensors receive the composite signal from the surface, which includes the soil and vegetation.
In the vegetated regions, removing the vegetation effect to estimate SM becomes a problem. Currently,
one-source models consider the soil and vegetation as a composite leaf that is called the big leaf
model. These models cannot separate the soil from the mixed remotely sensed pixels. Thus, the
SM in the vegetated area is manifested by the vegetation index or temperature vegetation dryness
index. However, the quantitative SM is not easy to be obtained under vegetation cover. To solve the
above-mentioned problems, two-source models (such as ALEXI, N95 et al.) were used to separate
the soil and vegetation information and describe the energy exchange among the soil, vegetation and
atmosphere. The SM may be accurately estimated if pure soil information can be separated from the
composite context.
Additionally, because many soil physical parameters cannot be obtained by using remotely
sensed data, this method only can use empirical equations or in situ measurements to determine these
variables. Soil texture information exhibits considerable heterogeneity and is difﬁcult to obtain for large
regions. In addition, it is difﬁcult to establish a universal relationship for SM across different study
areas. To simplify the physical formula and facilitate calculation, the soil physical variables can be
parameterized to establish a correlation with the obtained variables from remote sensing. This method
may be ultimately a robust method that not only considers the soil physical properties but also can be
realized using remote sensing techniques.
5.3. Uncertain Quantitative Relationships between the Remotely Sensed Indices/Thermal Inertia and SM
No determinate quantitative relationships between the thermal inertia/drought indices and SM
are widely accepted by all the experts. However, many authors have considered this linear relationship
as a simple method for determining SM. Several authors have indicated that these variables are not
linearly related in empirical statistical experiments. Currently, the commonly applied equations are
linear or exponential. However, although the SM estimation methods have matured and the thermal
inertia/drought indices can be determined relatively accurately, determining the SM from thermal
inertia/drought indices remains uncertain. Thus, a universal and quantitative relationship between
the SM and thermal inertia/drought indices must be accurately determined.
5.4. Lack of Surface Data for Validating Remotely Sensed SM
Remotely sensed soil moisture validation is a problem in SM estimation research. The most
commonly used methods are validated by single point-based or multiple point-based measurements.
In addition, many researchers have attempted to use up-scaling or down-scaling methods to validate
SM estimates from remote sensing data [184]. Remotely sensed data have wide spatial coverage of the
underlying surface, such as 30 m, 1 km, or even several kilometers. In addition, the retrieved SM is
the pixel value of the satellite data that indicates the situation of the entire region. However, surface
measurements are always conducted at single points and cannot represent the entire region due to the
spatial and temporal changes of the SM [185]. Remotely sensed SMs are frequently validated by many
measured point values in study areas, which results in many uncertainties. Moreover, the developed
SM indices serve as proxies that indicate drought conditions and are not true SM contents. To obtain
the actual SM, the wilting and saturation points of the soil in the study area must be known, which can
result in errors. Therefore, a surface-to-surface validation method should be developed to solve this
problem. Aerial photography or UAV may provide the actual state of the ground surface, which could
be used to verify the derived SM.
5.5. Uncertainties in the Application of Soil Moisture Estimation Models
As described above, each soil moisture estimation model is developed with preconditions and
assumptions. Many uncertainties are introduced by key processes when applying soil moisture
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308
18 of 29
estimation models. For example, the spatial-information based method includes two important
processes, determining the limiting edge and interpolation between the dry and wet edges.
First, determining the dry and wet edges is important for estimating soil moisture from the LST-VI
space, which directly affects the retrieval accuracy. In practice, most studies use the least squares
method to directly ﬁt scattering at the dry and wet edge. However, due to underlying heterogeneity and
different atmospheric forcing, the extracted wet and dry edges are unstable and introduce uncertainties,
which eventually lead to SM estimation errors. Currently, two main methods are used to derive the
dry and wet edges from scattering in the feature space, the auto-determined edge algorithm and the
theoretical edge determination method. The main advantages of the auto-determined edge method
are that it is simple to operate, highly accurate, and has wide application. However, one limitation is
that the auto-determined edges are changeable with the size of the study area and that the extreme dry
and wet points must all be present in the LST-VI space. Sometimes, true dry or wet edges do not exist
because energy and water balance must be met under extreme conditions. Thus, many experts have
tried to derive theoretical edges based on the surface energy balance principle as a boundary condition.
The auto-determined edge method can be used to estimate soil moisture from remote sensing data
but results in large errors due to its subjectivity and the effects of atmospheric conditions. The surface
energy balance method for solving theoretical edges has a robust physical basis because the requirement
for more underlying surface auxiliary data results in a complicated calculation process. It is difﬁcult
to obtain pure remote sensing data, and many parameters introduce uncertainty. Therefore, a simple
and applicable method for remote sensing to obtain theoretical dry and wet edges is a promising
approach. The two-source models can provide wizards for solving this problem that can separate
the soil and vegetation surface temperatures. This method can be used to obtain a true dry point for
bare soil and full vegetation before deriving theoretically limiting edges by using an energy balance
model. Second, many authors have found that LST and SM are negatively correlated in the LST-VI
space; thus, numerous studies have been based on the assumption that surface temperature and soil
moisture vary linearly with changes in vegetation cover [141]. However, Carlson et al. [186] observed
that this change is not linear according to the SVAT model simulation. In practical applications, most
scholars still assume that the soil moisture varies linearly in the scatter space. The interpolation of the
feature space represents the relationships among SM, LST and FVC. The linear interpolation is simple
and easy to operate but cannot truly reﬂect the SM variations in the feature space [187]. Although the
non-linear interpolation is complex and difﬁcult to operate, it is highly accurate [188]. Thus, how can
we develop a method to interpolate the space based on a physical mechanism and the SM? Thermal
inertia is a physical property of the substance itself. Thus, if thermal inertia is too complicated to use,
the ATI could be used to replace it. The ATI may be helpful for interpolating the feature space in
future research.
In summary, comprehensive analyses of the aforementioned SM estimation methods based on
optical and thermal remote sensing were performed. Although remote multi-monitoring and inversion
methods involve different types of ﬁelds and relatively broad scopes, they have many shortcomings.
In general, despite their susceptibility to clouds, vegetation effects and limited penetration, optical and
thermal remote sensing data have high spatial resolutions with multi-satellite sensors and large spatial
coverage. Moreover, soil moisture and surface temperatures are strongly correlated. Thus, soil moisture
estimations are more promising. Although some models are relatively simple and have clear physical
meaning, some methods, such as thermal inertia and apparent thermal inertia methods, are mainly
suitable for bare soils or for early crop growth conditions. In addition, due to the impacts of soil texture
and type, the relationships between thermal inertia and soil moisture are often nonlinear. However,
the method is derived under certain assumptions, and the effects of these assumptions on the retrieval
results must be further validated. The triangle/trapezoid method mainly uses the spatial distribution
of pixel information when the requirements of study area are large enough and contain a variety of
ground conditions, including different vegetation coverage and soil moisture. In some cases, this
condition is not easily satisﬁed. The temporal information-based methods require observation data for

long time series from remote sensing on cloudy days. Additionally, the simulated model accuracy and
subjective cognitive and empirical descriptions for the study area affect the inversion results. Due to
existing problems, some recommendations or solutions may provide references for SM estimations,
as described below.
6. Conclusions and Perspective
With the problems pointed out above, this paper proposes our recommendation and potential
solution in SM estimations.
6.1. Combining Optical and Microwave Remote Sensing to Estimate SM
Visible and thermal infrared remote sensing has ﬁne spatial resolutions and broad coverage.
The primary differences between these methods are the use of the electromagnetic spectrum and
the source of the electromagnetic energy [84]. Visible infrared remote sensing uses characteristic
changes in the soil reﬂectance or vegetation physiology to estimate SM. By contrast, thermal infrared
remote sensing uses the responses of soil thermal properties to soil moisture to determine SM.
Using integration, the SM may be estimated from soil thermal properties (soil temperature, thermal
inertia, etc.) and soil spectrum differences (absorption amplitude, spectrum combination, etc.).
In addition, microwave remote sensing is less disturbed by the bad weather or rain. However,
it can be easily perturbed by vegetation, and optical and thermal remote sensing can be helpful for
removing vegetation disturbances. Therefore, the combination of optical and thermal and microwave
remote sensing may have broad application prospects. Additionally, microwave remote sensing can
obtain data all-time and all-weather, which can provide great help for soil moisture products over long
time series, especially in humid tropical regions.
Moreover, the combination of the thermal inertia method and the LST-NDVI space method may
provide a robust method for estimating the SM. Thermal inertia is a soil physical property with
soil moisture, and the LST-NDVI method can restrict changes in soil moisture in a speciﬁc space.
This combination has a strong physical basis, is easy to operate, and may be promising.
6.2. The Development of Comparable Soil Moisture Indices
Currently, many drought indices are based on instantaneous remotely sensed data that cannot be
compared with other data because of the inﬂuences of different atmospheric conditions. For visible
infrared remote sensing, long time-series remote sensing data are difﬁcult to obtain and the reference
standards are not properly determined. For thermal infrared remote sensing, the derived indices
can represent the drought conditions of the study area for a speciﬁc time but cannot be compared
with each other day by day. The driest and wettest points may not exist in the study area. Thus,
determining the dry and wet edge is somewhat subjective and results in errors in the soil moisture
estimations. For this problem, the normalization method can be used to normalize the indices to
a uniform reference or statistical data can be used to standardize the indices. Only the drought indices
from a uniform reference can be physically compared with each other and accurately reﬂect the true
soil moisture conditions.
6.3. The Measured Surface Data for True Validation
True validation is the process of assessing the uncertainty of the data products derived
independently from the system outputs for the same scale, time and location. Without validation,
any methods, models, algorithms, and parameters derived from remotely sensed data cannot be
used with conﬁdence [189,190]. True validation must be conducted because validation can help
understand the uncertainties of the remotely sensed data, the errors in soil moisture inversion models
and uncertainty in the retrieved land surface variables.
Currently, the estimated soil moisture is mostly validated by point-based measurements.
The surface SWC data derived from remote sensing are only validated by one or several points’
Sensors 2016, 16, 1308
20 of 29
data measured using techniques. The scale differences can induce large errors in soil moisture retrieval
outputs and methods. So, a surface to surface or pixel to pixel validation method should be developed
to deal with this problem.
6.4. Improvements to the Soil Moisture Estimation Theory
The physical principles of many SM estimation methods include energy balance equations that
serve as boundary conditions. According to previous studies, the energy balance is not always closed.
Thus, it is relatively easy to induce uncertainties. Moreover, the SM is an important link in the water
cycle and the water balance for a speciﬁc region should be considered. In addition, the laws and
theories regarding soil hydrothermal characteristic can be combined with remotely sensed parameters
to reveal the interaction mechanisms of soil moisture. To accurately estimate the SM, the energy and
water balance should be considered as well as the soil hydrothermal properties.
Therefore, several limitations exist in the current use of optical and thermal remote sensing SM
estimation methods. These methods are based on polar-orbiting earth observation satellite advances,
and polar-orbiting satellites usually obtain three or four ground observations each day. Lacking data
sources limits the development of soil moisture retrieval methods. Fortunately, the geostationary
meteorological satellites can achieve high frequency and continuous ground observations and high
temporal resolution data that polar-orbiting satellites cannot do. Geostationary meteorological satellites
can provide favorable conditions and opportunities for estimating surface soil moisture [191–203].

Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world's population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities.

A global food security problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

Due to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation, food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%, and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages, namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage), and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting, etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption, optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming, or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs, farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides, and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8].

Research motivation and contribution The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture 4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type, the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction, the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture; after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section 8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly, cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title, abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies” mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1) is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate, and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3. Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature, such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques used, system's maturity level, and farm type? RQ3: What are the primary roadblocks in implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for smart farming? Study selection criteria Inclusion criteria: • Peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. • Studies published during the period between 2011 and 2021. • Studies should provide answers to the research questions. • The article must include the title, year, source, abstract, and DOI. • Literature focussing on application of Industry 4.0 technologies in crop plantation and harvesting activities particularly in-field processes. Exclusion criteria: • Summaries of events and seminars, book review, and editorial. • Literature focusing on application of Industry 4.0 technologies in livestock farming; pre-field processes such as genetic development, seed development and seed supplying; post-field stages such as crop distribution, food processing and consumption; and agri-food supply chain. • Studies published before 2011. • The publication is not available in full text. • The publication is not in English. Literature search Sources: Scopus, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore for academic literature, citations in identified literature Search equation: (("agriculture*") AND ("Industry 4.0" OR “Digital Farming” OR “Intelligent Farming” OR “Smart Agriculture” OR “Agriculture 4.0” OR “Smart Farming” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT” OR “Cloud Computing” OR “Edge Computing” OR “Wireless Sensor Networks*” OR “Artificial Intelligence*” OR “Big Data*” OR “Data Analytics*” OR “Data Science*” OR “Cyber Physical System*” OR “Robotics*” OR “Computer Vision*” OR “Machine Learning*” OR “Deep Learning*” OR “Data Integration*”)) 2.2. Evaluation process The evaluation of the literature search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165 records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to 2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed, and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another 11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected in the final stage for further analysis.

Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed. However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011 to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15].

The breakdown of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section 1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance, the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types. Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn. For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise, services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/ spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight, green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll) and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature, humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis, energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation); vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection); vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop quality management (3%).

Service-wise distribution of selected research studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined using European Union's TRL scale that partitions system's maturity level into three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype, which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9 (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8.

Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies This section provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication), middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight, etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee, LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23]. Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22]. RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies, on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters. In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity.

The integration of IoT in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring, and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural systems.

Wireless sensor networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing, transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure, and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications, TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore, the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’ applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention, such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure, platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability compliance with standards of food safety and quality.

Self-leveling scale, control box, LCD display, and RFID tags Open-air Conceptual [74] The cloud-based agricultural systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover, because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed. Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based agricultural systems.

Autonomous robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling, and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However, when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of UGVs designed for performing agricultural tasks.

Open-air Prototype [95] Most of the agricultural robotic systems presented above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras. Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure) and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras, etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area, and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations.

Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces, and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6. Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119]. The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture, which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors, aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content), marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management. A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture. A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques. Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing, and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Five dimensions of “Big Data”. Table 8.

Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML) techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type, moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table 9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques are employed. Considering the digital transformation's cyber-security and data privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures, and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases, pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images, and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled) are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming, most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL and computer vision approaches.

Agricultural decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven. The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig. 14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental components, each having its specific purpose.

Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature. From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge, which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user's needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems.

Agricultural cyber-physical systems As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS) refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms, with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted significant research interest because of their promising applications across different domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical systems.

Digital twins in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object's lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13.

Trees planted on orchard IoT sensors, network, and computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence, implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector. After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability: data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications, and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results, data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness. The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging. This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity, strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically, the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because, in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210]. The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution, but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices, as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage, adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication. For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence, there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas, cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy: the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks, or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size, and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables, resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices, machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces: complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry. Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers. • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating, and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones, WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited. To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs. To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications. The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies, how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16]. Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption. Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring, tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture 4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems. Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems, the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies. Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature, humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale. But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise the farm's productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility: digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218]. 4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section 5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships, the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture 4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture 5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0 focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture 5.0 settings, farm's production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise, digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed, detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions. The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture 4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct), and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover, studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included.

Abstract: Advances in the understanding of physical, chemical, and biological processes influencing water quality, cou-
pled with improvements in the collection and analysis of hydrologic data, provide opportunities for significant innovations 
in the manner and level with which watershed-scale processes may be explored and modeled. This paper provides a re-
view of current trends in watershed modeling, including use of stochastic-based methods, distributed versus lumped pa-
rameter techniques, influence of data resolution and scalar issues, and the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) as part 
of a data-driven approach to assist in watershed modeling efforts. Important findings and observed trends from this work 
include (i) use of AI techniques artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and genetic algorithms (GA) to im-
prove upon or replace traditional physically-based techniques which tend to be computationally expensive; (ii) limitations 
in scale-up of hydrological processes for watershed modeling; and (iii) the impacts of data resolution on watershed model-
ing capabilities. In addition, detailed discussions of individual watershed models and modeling systems with their fea-
tures, limitations, and example applications are presented to demonstrate the wide variety of systems currently available 
for watershed management at multiple scales. A summary of these discussions is presented in tabular format for use by 
water resource managers and decision makers as a screening tool for selecting a watershed model for a specific purpose.

INTRODUCTION 
Global advances in economies and standards of living 
have resulted in a growing dependency on water resources. 
Many societies have experienced water scarcity as a result of 
current patterns with societal advances; these are associated 
with factors such as population growth, increased urbaniza-
tion and industrialization, increased energy use, increased 
irrigation associated with advances in agriculture productiv-
ity, desertification, global warming, and poor water quality 
[1-4]. Improved understanding of how each of these factors 
influences water supply, demand, and quality require im-
proved abilities to understand underlying processes and their 
impact on water availability and use. This entails employing 
a holistic approach which integrates hydrologic processes at 
the watershed scale to determine an overall watershed re-
sponse to both user demands and changing climates [1]. Cen-
tral to this effort, watershed modeling is being utilized as a 
tool to better understand surface and subsurface water 
movement and the interactions between these water bodies. 
More importantly, they offer tools to guide decision making 
on water resources, water quality, and related hazard issues 
[2]. 
This paper begins with a brief overview of the regulatory 
context for the use of a watershed-based approach. An ex-
amination of various watershed modeling methods, key 
processes involved, and new modeling techniques are then

the-art watershed-scale models and modeling systems. Items 
of interest include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for 
processing of information to improve modeling speed and 
accuracy and the impact of data resolution and watershed 
scale on the modeling process. Finally, a sampling of cur-

AP-
PROACH 
Understanding and managing water resource problems 
involve complex processes and interactions at the surface, 
subsurface, and their interface. In an effort to account for 
many of these interactions and the impacts on drinking water 
sources, water quality regulations are focusing on more ho-
listic approaches for analysis and maintenance of water re-
sources. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
2006 – 2011 Strategic Planmaintains the five goals that were 
described in the 2003 - 2008 Strategic Plan: (i) clean air and 
global climate change; (ii) clean and safe water; (iii) land 
preservation and restoration; (iv) healthy communities and 
ecosystems; 
and 
(v) 
compliance 
and 
environmental 
stewardship [3]. The Strategic Plan calls for improved stan-
dards, protection of source waters, security of water infra-
structure, and improved quality of rivers, lakes, and streams. 
The new plan provides increased focus on achieving more 
measurable, environmentally-relevant results, including use 
of a watershed-based perspective. Sub-Objective 2.2.1: 
Improve Water Quality on a Watershed Basis, outlines 
USEPA’s plan to “work with states, interstate agencies,

tribes, local governments, and others in three key areas: 
maintaining strong core programs that emphasize watershed 
protection...” [3]. In addition, at both federal and state levels, 
increased regulations of Total Maximum Daily Loads 
(TMDLs) of the watershed-wide pollutant influx to a water 
body, typically referenced as non-point source pollution, has 
created strong demand for new assessment tools that take 
into consideration multiple sources of flow (e.g., overland 
flow) [4]. Several watershed-scale models have been devel-
oped that provide assistance in predicting non-point source 
pollution. Borah and Bera [5] provide a detailed summary of 
many of these including the Agricultural Non-Point Source 
Pollution Model (AGNPS), Areal Non-Point Source Water-
shed Environment Simulation (ANSWERS), Kinematic 
Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS), Hydrological 
Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF), MIKE SHE, Soil 
and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and others; therefore, 
they are only briefly considered in this review.  
WATERSHED MODELING  
A watershed model simulates hydrologic processes in a 
more holistic approach compared to many other models 
which primarily focus on individual processes or multiple 
processes at relatively small-or field-scale without full incor-
poration of a watershed area [6]. Watershed-scale modeling 
has emerged as an important scientific research and man-
agement tool, particularly in efforts to understand and con-
trol water pollution [7-11]. In the subsequent section, differ-
ent types of watershed models are discussed along with sug-
gested applications. In addition, the role of artificial intelli-
gence in assisting in watershed modeling is discussed in 
some detail. Genetic algorithms (GAs), artificial neural net-
works (ANN), and fuzzy logic (FL) are currently being em-
ployed to assist in processing data, develop improved rela-
tionships between hydrologic processes, and in some cases, 
assist in filling voids in measured data. While much work 
has been done to model individual hydrological processes, 
combining these processes at a much larger, watershed-scale 
requires additional expertise and data resources. A short dis-
cussion on the difficulties encountered and some solutions 
used in scaling-up to the watershed level is provided, includ-
ing discussions on data resolution, over parameterization, 
and the impacts of digital elevation model (DEM) mesh size 
on model accuracy.  
Model Types 
Watershed models can be grouped into various categories 
based upon the modelling approaches used. Melone et al. [7] 
note the primary features for distinguishing watershed-scale 
modelling approaches include the nature of the employed 
algorithms (empirical, conceptual, or physically-based), 
whether a stochastic or deterministic approach is used for 
model input or parameter specification, and whether the spa-
tial representation is lumped or distributed. Each of these 
features is briefly outlined below in order to provide context 
to subsequent watershed-scale modelling approaches. 
Empirical models consist of functions used to approxi-
mate or fit available data. Such models span arange of com-
plexity, from simple regression models [8-10] to hydroin-
formatics-based models which utilize Artificial Neural Net-
works (ANNs), Fuzzy Logic, Genetic, and other algorithms 
[11-19]. Additional discussion on use of artificial intelli-
gence in empirical watershed modelling is provided in sub-
sequent sections of this work. 
Watershed models can be categorized as deterministic or 
stochastic depending on the techniques involved in the mod-
elling process. Deterministic models are mathematical mod-
els in which outcomes are obtained through known relation-
ships among states and events. Stochastic models will have 
most, if not all, of their inputs or parameters represented by 
statistical distributions which determine a range of outputs 
[7]. Even though most models are deterministic in nature, 
stochastic models provide two important advantages. First, 
their conceptually simple framework makes it possible to 
describe heterogeneity when there are limited spatial or tem-
poral details. Second, they provide decision makers with the 
ability to determine uncertainty associated with predictions 
[7, 20-26].  
Watershed-scale models can further be categorized on a 
spatial basis as lumped, semi-distributed, or distributed mod-
els. The lumped modeling approach considers a watershed as 
a single unit for computations where the watershed parame-
ters and variables are averaged over this unit. Compared to 
lumped models, semi-distributed and distributed models ac-
count for the spatial variability of hydrologic processes, in-
put, boundary conditions, and watershed characteristics [4, 
27]. For semi-distributed models, the aforementioned quanti-
ties are partially allowed to vary in space by dividing the 
basin into a number of smaller sub-basins which in turn are 
treated as a single unit [7, 28, 29]. Spatial heterogeneity in 
distributed models is represented with a resolution typically 
defined by the modeller [7]. Physically-based models are 
based on the understanding of the physics associated with the 
hydrological processes which control catchment response 
and utilize physically based equations to describe these proc-
esses [30]. Examples of widely accepted physically based 
models on the market include GSSHA [31, 32], HSPF, 
KINEROS2 [33], MIKE SHE [34], and SWAT [35, 36]. 
Discussion on the impacts of spatial data resolution and scal-
ing issues in watershed modelling is provided later in this 
document. 
Watershed-scale models can be further subdivided into 
event-based or continuous-process models. Event-based 
models simulate individual precipitation-runoff events with a 
focus on infiltration and surface runoff, while continuous-
process models explicitly account for all runoff components 
while considering soil moisture redistribution between storm 
events [7]. Further discussions of the aforementioned classi-
fication and watershed modeling approaches are presented in 
Borah and Bera [5], Kalin and Hantush [37], Refsgaard [27], 
Singh and Frevert [38], and Singh and Woolhiser [39]. 
Advances inPhysically-based Models 
In physically-based models, mass transfer, momentum, 
and energy are simulated using partial differential equations 
which are solved by various numerical methods such as the 
St. Venant equations [40] for surface flow, Richards [41] 
equation for unsaturated zone flow, Penman-Monteith [42] 
equation for evapotranspiration and Boussinesq equation for 
ground water flow. Typically, the data and computation re-
quirements for these equations are enormous and demanding. 
For example, the traditional inversion methods using re-
peated model runs are computationally intensive and are not 
28    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 
Daniel et al. 
appropriate for operational application for regional and 
global data [43]. Significant effort has gone into addressing 
these data and computational issues.  
In a review of current projects in the United States, Re-
strepo and Schaake [44] note that emphasis is being placed 
on models with parameters that can be derived from physical 
watershed characteristics. However, it was also noted that 
purely physically-based models may be unattainable or im-
practical, and, therefore, models resulting from a combina-
tion of physically and conceptually approached processes 
may be required. Restrepo and Schaake [44] further suggest 
that the future needs and directions of research for hydro-
logic modeling include: 
(1) Reliable modeling of the different sources of uncer-
tainty; 
(2) A more expeditious and cost-effective approach by 
reducing the effort required in model calibration;  
(3) Improvements in forecast lead-time and accuracy;  
(4) An approach for rapid adjustment of model parame-
ters to account for changes in the watershed, both 
rapid as the result from forest fires or levee 
breaches, and slow, as the result of watershed refor-
estation, reforestation or urban development; and  
(5) An expanded suite of products, including soil mois-
ture and temperature forecasts, and water quality 
constituents. 
Restrepo and Schaake [44] also emphasize the develop-
ment of improved precipitation estimation techniques such as 
statistical merging of remote-sensor observations and fore-
casts from high-resolution numerical prediction models. 
Beckers et al. [45] reviewed many of the widely used hydro-
logic models and suggest one key area for computational 
improvement is the need to better quantify climate change 
which include possible future shifts in temperature and pre-
cipitation, the occurrence of extreme events, and the changes 
in glacier mass balances. Central to this research is under-
standing how best to link hydrologic models to climate 
change predictions which present downscaling issues which 
are well documented by Wood et al., [46], Merritt et al., [47] 
and Stahl et al., [48]. Climate change projections are gener-
ated from global-scale, general circulation models which are 
too coarse for hydrologic models and some level of statistical 
downscaling will be required [49]. Four recent statistical 
downscaling techniques that have been applied with some 
success in western North America include the delta method 
[50], ClimateBC [51], Bias-correction statistical downscaling 
[52-54] and the Tree-GEN method [48].  
An essential component of each physically-based model 
is the availability of sufficient data to represent each of the 
modeled processes. Significant advances to improve data 
generation, preparation, and management are being realized 
through the utilization of geospatial technologies such as 
geographic information system (GIS), global positioning 
systems (GPS), and remote sensing. Typical model prepara-
tion tasks include the use of remotely sensed images for ex-
traction of the terrain canopy data or the use of a digital ter-
rain model (DTM), or digital elevation model (DEM) data 
for extraction of hydrologic catchment properties, such as 
elevation matrix, flow direction matrix, ranked elevation 
matrix, and flow accumulation matrix. Notable GIS-based 
extraction tools include MapWindowsTauDEM (Terrain 
Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models) [55], GIS Weasel 
(An Interface for the Development of Spatial Parameters for 
Physical Process Modeling) [56], and ArcHydro [57]. Recent 
work by Prodanovi et al. [58] utilized DEM-based GIS al-
gorithms to improve DEM data accuracy and usability. 
When digital data is employed for hydrological modeling, 
they offer the following data evaluation procedures to im-
prove accuracy and usability: (i) check the fraction of the 
area that has the slope of 0%; (ii) use of the surface flow 
routing tool (can be found in most GIS packages) in order to 
check whether water will flow across the whole study area if 
arbitrary source point is selected; (iii) check of the orienta-
tion and interconnection of the stream network; and (iv) use 
of streams as “cut-outs” across the DEM and check whether 
the slope of a longitudinal section toward the lowest, exit 
node, is continuous. 
In many instances, limited or no data is available for 
studied watersheds. GIS automated tools based on geostatis-
tics interpolation techniques (e.g., inverse distance weight-
ing, splines, and kriging) offer improved options for generat-
ing new DEMs datasets from point and contour datasets. 
Recent studies (e.g., Flipo et al., [59]; Frei, et al., [60], San-
tini, et al., [61]) continue to improve these techniques. Flipo 
et al., [59] demonstrated kriging provides a satisfactory rep-
resentation of aquifer nitrate contamination from local ob-
servations to set initial conditions for the physically-based 
model. It was further noted that the use of geostatistics and 
physically-based modeling allows assessment of nitrate con-
centrations in aquifer systems. Frei et al., [60] also utilized 
the same method in a parallel physically-based surface–
subsurface model to investigate the spatial patterns and tem-
poral dynamics of river–aquifer exchange in a heterogeneous 
alluvial river–aquifer system with deep water table. Tague 
and Pohl-Costello [62] also examined how flow data from a 
similar watershed can serve to compensate for this data limi-
tation in the context of understanding impacts on hydrologic 
behavior. 
Model Parameter Estimation and Calibration 
Parameter estimation and calibration of hydrologic mod-
els inherently possess significant challenges associated with 
the nature of most hydrologic models; namely (i) nonlinear-
ity; (ii) data errors; (iii) data insufficiency; (iv) correlation 
among parameters; (v) irregular response surfaces that may 
be insensitive to select model parameters; and (vi) single or 
multi-objective nature of the models [63]. Parameter estima-
tion techniques often further attempt to quantify uncertainty 
of these estimates and may be divided into two primary ap-
proaches: (i) Bayesian; and (ii) frequentist [64]. Bayesian 
methods treat model parameters as random variables that 
possesses probability distributions that are iteratively refined 
by comparing measured data with model outputs based on 
selection of different model parameters derived from an ini-
tial, best estimate, distribution [64]. In contrast, frequentist 
approaches model parameters as fixed entities that are then 
adjusted through comparison with a calibration data set 
through various means [64], including (i) a priori estima-
tions; (ii) curve fitting (including trial and error calibration, 
method of moments, least squares, maximum likelihood, and 
linear and nonlinear regression); and (iii) combination meth-
Watershed Modeling and its Applications 
The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    29 
ods [63, 65]. Numerous earlier and more recent reviews out-
line parameter estimation, calibration, and uncertainty analy-
sis as applied to hydrologic models (e.g., [65-87]). As noted 
by McDonnell et al. [88], improved predictions for ungauged 
basins is critical for overall advancement in watershed hy-
drologic modeling. So here we focus briefly on select recent 
advances employed where data is especially sparse, such as 
in ungauged basins.  
Model parameter estimation and calibration processes are 
especially challenging for ungauged basins, where sparse or 
poor data quality often favor the use of empirical versus 
physically-based models [89]. Recent advances include use 
of a hydrological distributed model, linking GIS with system 
dynamics, employing linear, nonlinear, and Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) uncertainly analyses, and use of areal 
evapotranspiration in lieu of stream flow. Velez et al. [90] 
employed the conceptual, distributed runoff model, TETIS, 
with a parameter estimation methodology, generating a cor-
rection function that compared model parameter values at 
individual model section scale to overall watershed charac-
teristics derived from available data, taking into account spa-
tial and temporal scale effects enabling reduction in the 
number of parameters requiring calibration. Aragon et al. 
[91] explored the modeling of ungauged tributaries through 
use of GIS to model hydrological response units and a sys-
tem dynamics model to represent physical processes. Here, 
GIS was used to convert time series outputs from the process 
models to spatial representations, which then formed the 
basis for estimating parameter inputs to subsequent model 
runs. Although the system reflected reasonable behaviors, 
the model was not calibrated [91]. Gallagher and Doherty 
[64] examined the performance of three separate parameter 
estimation and uncertainly analysis methods employed in a 
lumped parameter surface flow model Hydrological Simula-
tion Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) [64]. Both linear and non-
linear uncertainly methods provided relative parameter un-
certainty assessment and understanding degree of correlation 
between model parameters, but both were limited in predic-
tive uncertainty. MCMC proved especially useful in provid-
ing qualitative information on parameter probability distribu-
tions, but required significantly greater number of model 
runs to generate the probability distributions [64]. Employ-
ing a much different approach, Nandagiri [89] compared 
calibration of a regional surface runoff model in India using 
streamflow records to areal evapotranspiration estimations 
derived from meteorological data and evapotranspiration 
model. Results suggest that areal evapotranspiration may 
successfully be used to calibrate hydrological models in un-
gauged basins [89]. 
Use of Artificial Intelligence in Watershed Modeling 
The watershed models discussed earlier adopt the physi-
cally-based approach to modeling complex watershed proc-
esses on different spatial and temporal scales. Typically, this 
requires describing the watershed system’s inputs, the physi-
cal laws which govern its behavior, and boundary and initial 
conditions [19]. However, the traditional techniques adopted 
in this approach tend be computationally intensive, requiring 
significant data and calibration. To address some of these 
issues, researchers [e.g., 19, 92-96] have pursued a more 
data-driven approach which utilize soft computing or artifi-
cial intelligence (AI), namely, artificial neural network 
(ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). 
Over the past decade the literature has recorded numerous 
examples where researchers have successfully demonstrated 
how AI can be utilized for watershed hydrology applications 
such as real time flood forecasting, rainfall–runoff modeling, 
and water quality prediction models. The following 
discussion highlights selected past and more recent water-
shed hydrology applications using ANN, FL, and GA. 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
ANNs are considered computer programs capable of 
learning from examples through iteration without requiring 
prior knowledge of the relationships between process pa-
rameters [97, 98]. ANNs were inspired from biological nerv-
ous systems and are an attempt to emulate the human brain 
[98, 99]. Fig. (1) illustrates the general ANN structure which 
is developed based on:  
(1) Many single elements called nodes (also known as 
units, cells, or neurons), shown as oval shapes and or-
ganized as layers. Each node typically applies a non-
linear transformation called an activation function to 
its net input signal to determine its output signal. 
These functions enable ANN to map nonlinear proc-
esses.  
(2) Signals pass between nodes through connection links. 
Each connection link has an associated weight that 
represents its connection strength. 
(3) Most ANN possess a transparent first or input layer 
(X) that receives input variables or quantities that can 
influence the output or last layer (Y) which consists 
of values needed to be predicted as part of a problem 
or system. These networks also often possess middle 
or hidden layers which are usually determined by a 
trial-and-error procedure [100]. 
The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Task 
Committee [100] notes that in order for ANN to generate an 
output, a training process, also called learning (similar to the 
concept of calibration in traditional physically-based mod-
els), is employed to iteratively adjust and optimize connec-
tion weights and threshold values for each node. The primary 
goal of training is to minimize the error function by search-
ing for a set of connection strengths and threshold values that 
cause ANN to produce outputs that are equal or close to tar-
gets. After completing the training process, the next step is to 
utilize ANN to predict results based on new inputs. See 
ASCE-Task-Committee [100] for further details on ANN 
features and functionality. 
Noted strengths of ANNs which make their use attractive 
for water resources and hydrology applications include the 
ability to (i) recognize the relation between the input and 
output variables without explicit physical consideration; (ii) 
work well even when the training sets contain noise and 
measurement errors; (iii) adapt to solutions over time to 
compensate for changing circumstances; and (iv) possess 
other inherent information-processing characteristics and 
once trained are easy to use [100]. ANN hydrologic applica-
tions range from the predictions of peak discharge or time to 
peak for a single rainfall event, to the forecast of hourly or 
daily river stages or discharges. The complexities in physical 
processes and nonlinear relationships of processes such as 
30    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 
Daniel et al. 
rainfall-runoff and evapotransporation were found to lend 
themselves to ANN modeling [11, 101-103]. These ANN-
based models have been considered an alternate to physically 
based models due to their simplicity relative to minimizing 
the need for collecting detailed watershed data [102]. The 
major advantage of ANN over conventional methods is the 
ability to model physical processes without the need for de-
tailed information [104]. 
In the 1990s and early 2000s, several research efforts 
[e.g., 11, 103, 105-108] have shown ANN can be applied 
effectively across different aspects of water resources and 
hydrology. Hjelmfelt and Wang [105, 106] were among the 
first researchers to demonstrate the utility of ANNs in mod-
eling these water resources processes. Here, they were able 
to use rainfall and runoff data from 24 large storm events 
chosen from the Goodwater Creek watershed (12.2 km2) in 
central Missouri to trainand test the ANNs. Results revealed 
that ANNs were able to generate a unit hydrograph better 
than those obtained through a standard gamma function rep-
resentation. Smith and Eli [107] were able to incorporate the 
spatial and temporal distribution information of rainfall into 
a ANN model that predicted peak discharge and time to peak 
over a hypothetical watershed which was represented as a 
grid of cells. Using this method, they found the prediction of 
the entire hydrograph to be very accurate for multiple storm 
events. Riad et al. [109] showed that ANN-based models 
were better than classical regression models for simulating 
rainfall-runoff relations for a semiarid climate catchment 
area in Morocco. Recent work by Wang et al. [110] con-
cluded that ANN models not only out performed other 
evapotransporation approximations developed in the semi-
arid region of Burikan Faso, but they can also be utilized in 
developing countries with adverse climatic conditions [110]. 
Other studies [104, 111, 112] found that ANN models can 
predict evapotranspiration and perform better than the Pen-
man-Monteith technique and other conventional methods. 
Despite the demonstrated benefits of ANN, there are two 
key challenges that should be mentioned. First, ANN are 
usually implemented with a trial and error approach which 
tend to be extremely time consuming [113]. May and Siva-
kumar [114, 115] highlighted this issue while investigating 
the application of ANN and multi-linear regression models 
for predicting urban stormwater quality at unmonitored 
catchments. They concluded that both models generated 
similar prediction results but the regression model appeared 
to represent a more applicable approach since it was (i) faster 
to construct and apply; (ii) more transparent; and (iii) less 
likely to fit the limited data. The second limitation of ANNs 
identified by Moghaddamnia et al. [112] referenced the 
complicated input selection process. They gained some suc-
cess by using a gamma test to address this problem, explor-
ing different combinations of input data to assess their influ-
ence on evaporation estimation modeling, showing that the 
gamma test greatly reduced model development require-
ments, enabling provision of input data guidance prior to 
model development. Despite these promising results, they 
suggest that further evaluation is needed, especially with 
respect to its ability to assess validated data.  
Genetic Algorithms (GA) 
Genetic Algorithms (GA) are nonlinear optimization 
search techniques that imitate biological evolution processes 
of natural selection and survival of the fittest [116, 117]. The 
major difference between GAs and the other classical opti-
mization techniques is that GAs work with a population of 
possible solution while classical optimization techniques 
work with a single solution [118]. Soman et al. [119] sum-
marize the process of creating GAs in the following steps:  
(1) Generate a random number of solution samples, 
collectively called the population, within the feasi-
ble search space. Each of these samples, called a 
chromosome, is defined by a sequence of decision 
variables known as genes (can be in binary strings 
of ones and zeros of user specifiedlength, or real 
value numbers or integers). 
(2) Each chromosome is assigned a measure of fit-
ness, based on the objective function value. These 
chromosomesare referred to as species of the first 
generation. For a maximization problem, the higher 
the fitness values, the higher the chance for sur-
vival.  
(3) Create the next generation of chromosomes. 
This is accomplished by ranking the first genera-
tion chromosomes in ascending order of their fit-

ness value for a minimization problem, and in de-
scending order of their fitness for a maximization 
problem. Chromosomes with the highest fitness 
value will be given a higher probability to obtain a 
mate, so as to produce offspring that may better fit 
the environment. This process of selecting mates is 
called selection. Once mates are selected, genes of 
corresponding mates, or parents, are systematically 
exchanged with the conception that the resulting 
solutions or offsprings will have higher fitness val-
ues. The process of creating new individuals by 
systematically assigning genes of chosen mates to 
the new individuals is known as crossover. The 
new chromosomes replace the old chromosomes, 
which have low fitness values. 
The process of selection and crossover is repeated for 
many generations with the objective of reaching the global 
optimal solution after a sufficient number of generations. 
Other general forms of the GA include Genetic Program-
ming (GP) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which 
are explained in more detail by Koza [120] and Ferreira 
[121].  
Several early research efforts demonstrated the useful-
ness of GA in water resources applications. Ritzel et al. 
[118] adopted GA to solve groundwater pollution problems. 
Wang and Zheng [95] and Wu et al. [96] used GA-based 
functions to solve a groundwater management model. Other 
researchers [e.g., 122-128] made additional achievements in 
developing or improving rainfall-runoff models using GA. 
Wang [127] was successful in using GA with a local search 
method to calibrate the Xinanjiang rainfall-runoff model. 
Drecourt [126] investigated the GP approach for flow predic-
tion on the Kirkton catchment in Scotland (United Kingdom) 
and found that the results compared favorably with two op-
timally calibrated conceptual models. Whigham and Crapper 
[128] compared a GP-based rainfall-runoff model with a 
deterministic lumped parameter model, based on the unit 
hydrograph and found the results to be favorable as well. 
Efforts by Liong et al. [124] were instrumental in demon-
strating GP as a new paradigm in rainfall-runoff modeling. 
They showed GP-based rainfall runoff relationships can 
serve as alternatives to conventional (physically based and 
conceptual) rainfall runoff models. In Singapore, Muttil and 
Liong [125] were able to apply GA programming to generate 
empirically the underlying equations which connect input to 
output for the Upper Bukit Timah watershed. 
More recent research efforts [e.g., 19, 129-132] continue 
to demonstrate the utility of GA in support of water re-
sources applications. Guven et al. [131] developed a new 
GP-based model for estimating reference evapotranspiration 
in northern California by using five daily atmospheric vari-
ables (daily solar radiation, daily mean temperature, average 
daily relative humidity and wind speed). They concluded that 
the new model results were in good agreement with conven-
tional evapotranspiration models (here, the Penman-
Monteith equation, Hargreaves-Samani equation, solar radia-
tion-based ET equation, Jensen-Haise equation, Jones-
Ritchie equation, and Turc method) and can be used as an 
alternative approach. It was also concluded that the GP-
based model offered a fast and practical method for accu-
rately estimating evapotransporation [131].  
Yao and Yang [132] note that the complexity of parame-
ter optimization for a distributed watershed model goes far 
beyond the capability of traditional optimization methods. 
To address this problem, a new GA-based optimization 
method was developed and tested using the Distributed-
Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation model (DHSVM). Results of this 
effort demonstrate the feasibility of GA in optimizing pa-
rameters of the DHSVM model. Hejaziet al. [129] and Preis 
and Ostfeld [19] demonstrated that GA can be coupled with 
other flow or water quality models to develop and augment 
calibration schemes.  
Guven [130] investigated the use of linear genetic pro-
gramming (a variant of GP) for predicting time-series of 
daily flow rates the Schuylkill River at Berne, PA, USA and 
found that the results showed good agreement with observed 
data. Results also showed that the GP-based model out per-
formed an ANN-based model. These findings demonstrate 
GP’s promise for predicting the nonlinear and dynamic river 
flow parameters [130]. 
Although GAs have proven to be an effective and power-
ful problem-solving strategy, they possess several limita-
tions. The common thread in many of the difficulties with 
GAs has to do with their significant dependence on control 
parameters such as population size, crossover probability, 
and choice of crossover operator [133]. Jackson and Norgard 
[133] summarize these issues as follows: 
(1) A GA may not know when it is done or lack 
proof of convergence. One possible way to deal 
with this problem is to examine a series of consecu-
tive generations for solution improvement.  
(2) GAs need to maintain a large population of solu-
tions which provides the genetic diversity needed to 
adequately explore the solution space. Too small a 
population will result in premature convergence on 
a local minimum. While large populations enable 
superior performance, they also require more mem-
ory and more execution time. 
(3) Excessive reliance on crossover to introduce 
new genetic material can also result in premature 
convergence. The dominance of crossover as the 
principal stochastic process may cause the popula-
tion to become more homogeneous, and thus stag-
nating the evolutionary process.  
(4) GAs are also known to have poor performance 
in climbing local hills in the solution space which 
results in reducing accuracy for many real-valued 
problems. This difficulty is a byproduct of the sole 
dependence of the algorithm on stochastic processes 
to improve solutions rather than on an analytical 
approach. 
Jackson and Norgard [133] suggest that these limitations 
of GAs can be addressed effectively by combining GAs with 
other algorithms and techniques. 
Fuzzy Logic (FL) 
The FL approach to modeling is based on the theory of 
fuzzy sets [134], where relationships are defined verbally 
32    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 
Daniel et al. 
instead of using known governing physical relationships. 
Classic set theory assigns an item as a member of a set (1) or 
a non-member of a set (0), while a fuzzy set allows for gra-
dations between full membership and full non-membership. 
The main idea is to define the fuzzy membership functions 
which define relationships between input variables and out-
puts of a system [135]. Mahabir et al. [135] identify the main 
steps for creating a FL-based modeling system as follows:  
(1) A membership function must be defined for each 
variable (input and output). The membership function de-
fines the degree to which the value of a variable belongs to 
the group and is usually a linguistic term, such as high, me-
dium, or low. 
(2) The membership functions are related by statements 
or rules, typically a series of IF–THEN statements. For ex-
ample, one rule would be: IF the rainfall is low (linguistic 
term represented by a membership function) THEN the run-
off (output) is low (linguistic term represented by a member-
ship function). 
(3) Each rule is evaluated through a process called impli-
cation, and the results of all of the rules are combined in a 
process called aggregation. 
(4) The resulting function is evaluated for a resulting 
value or score for the output variable (e.g., runoff) through a 
process called defuzzification. 
The two main FL-based modeling systems included are: 
(i) fuzzy inference systems, which work on already con-
structed rule-base mainly on the basis of expert knowledge, 
and (ii) fuzzy adaptive systems, which can also build and 
adjust rule-base automatically based on sample or training 
data. Two significant advantages of FL–based models are 
their ability to be error tolerant and integrate expert knowl-
edge from water resource specialists [94]. Guertin et al. 
[136] also point out that the FL approach is well suited to 
watersheds studies as many environmental factors are best 
expressed as gradients.  
Like ANN and GA, the FL technique does have its limi-
tations. Three key disadvantages were identified in the litera-
ture and presented here. Casper et al. [94] note that the larg-
est disadvantage of the fuzzy adaptive systems is its inability 
to extrapolate without detailed expert knowledge about the 
watershed system or process being simulated. The second 
disadvantage of fuzzy inference and fuzzy adaptive (aug-
mented with expert knowledge) systems is their strong reli-
ance on subjective inputs from experts which might provide 
more opportunity for their abuse [137]. Ferson and Tucker 
[138] also note that FL-based systems may also fail to cap-
ture the value range of complex data sets and the correlations 
among parameters. Further details on FL theory and applica-
tions are provided in Zimmermann [139] and Dubois and 
Prade [140].  
According to Yu and Yang [76], FL can be applied to 
hydrologic modeling where a hydrologist defines the accept-
able degree of a simulation in the form of linguistic expres-
sions such as ‘bad’ and ‘good’ based on their knowledge or 
expert judgment. Researchers have been successful in their 
early attempts at applying FL for solving water resource 
problems or modeling hydrologic processes including infil-
tration [141], contaminant fate and transport [142], recon-
struction of missing precipitation events [143] river level and 
flood forecasting [144, 145], rainfall-runoff modeling [76, 
146, 147], daily future water demand modeling [148], 
drought classification [149], and regional drought prediction 
[150]. 
More recent research trends in the utilization of the FL 
modeling approach highlight additional efforts targeted at 
combining other AI methods in hybrid systems. Chang et al. 
[151] developed a FL based method that was applied to pre-
cipitation interpolation and utilized GA to determine parame-
ters for the FL functions which represent locations without 
rainfall records and their surrounding rainfall gauges. Cheng 
et al. [80] combined FL-GA methods to develop a rainfall-
run model while Chidthong et al. [152] and Chen et al. [93] 
utilized similar methods to forecast flooding. Combining FL 
and ANN also offer options for improving modeling tech-
niques and managing water resource problems. For example, 
Tayfur and Singh [153] demonstrated that FL-ANN based 
models can be useful in simulating event based rainfall run-
off on a watershed scale and are much easier to construct 
than the models based on the well-know kinematic wave 
approximation method. Chang and Chang [154] utilized an 
adaptive neuro-fuzzy (FL and ANN) inference system for 
predicting water levels in reservoirs. Firat and Gungor [155] 
also investigated the use of similar systems for estimating 
river flows. Chidthong et al. [152] were successful in devel-
oping a hybrid system using FL, ANN, and GA for predict-
ing peak flooding.  
Spatial Considerations in Watershed Modeling 
As previously mentioned, watershed modeling involves a 
holistic approach that involves not only examining surface 
hydrology, groundwater hydrology, or their interface as 
whole systems, but attempting to imitate the three regions as 
one system. Scale-up of each of these regions from the water 
body (lake, river, stream, etc.) or aquifer to an entire catch-
ment or watershed presents obvious problems. One limita-
tion is the availability of precipitation, flow, land cover, etc. 
data for the entire region. Another consideration is the lim-
ited understanding of the interactions between smaller hydro-
logic entities. Several studies have examined the effects of 
scaling in watershed modeling [156-161]. Furthermore, the 
scale or resolution of data used can impact the accuracy of 
the model results [161-163]. The following sections high-
light the more prominent issues relating to scale and data 
resolution in watershed modeling.  
Scale-up from Hydrologic Models to Watershed Models 
Much work has been done to conceptualize watershed in-
teractions at the hillslope (sub-catchment) level resulting in 
highly complex relationships from field experimentation. 
Some suggest that watershed models should maintain this 
complexity and efforts should be made to ensure that the 
smaller scale relationships are somehow incorporated into 
the mesoscale watershed models [164]. Unfortunately, data 
limitations, computational complexity, and financial con-
straints limit the amount of information that may be gathered 
from the field to represent entire watersheds. Bloschl and 
Sivapalan [158] published a review of scale issues in hydro-
logical modelling at the catchment level in 1995. In this, 
discussions on simplification versus aggregation of hydro-
Watershed Modeling and its Applications 
The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    33 
logic parameters, scale up versus scale down, and the linkage 
across various modelling scales are presented.  
Problems associated with scale-up of hydrologic proc-
esses to the watershed-scale include generalization and over 
parameterization. Through generalization or simplification, 
processes and variables that are applicable to a small portion 
of the watershed may be applied to the entire region. In this, 
the true representation of processes taking place may be lost. 
Over parameterization occurs when the watershed is repre-
sented by multiple (possibly many) parameters/variables to 
the point that a holistic representation of the region is no 
longer present [158]. While Jakeman and Hornberger [165] 
suggest only a few parameters are identifiable/necessary for 
hydrologic models, van Werkhoven et al. [166] argue that 
the number of parameters necessary for watershed modeling 
is dependent on the focus of the model and experimental 
design. They suggest use of sensitivity analysis and thorough 
investigation on the model behaviour to determine the ap-
propriate level of parameters involved to represent the water-
shed. 
Sivapalan [164] suggests that identification of common 
patterns, or features found at the hillslope scale within a 
watershed can be applied to larger regions to assist in scale-
up to the watershed level. In addition, Wong [167] 
recommends use of physically-based models to replace 
empirical models noting that during scale-up from empirical 
hydrologic models to watershed-scale models physically-
based relationships can be used to bridge the gaps. Kalin et 
al. [168] state that the spatial scale of the catchment is 
directly proportional to the complexity involved in modelling 
hydrologic processes of rainfall-runoff and surface erosion. 
Whether a lumped or semi-distributed model is used is 
dependent on the level of detail desired in the output and 
data available for representing the watershed.  
Impacts of Data Resolution 
Modeling the hydrologic responses over a watershed re-
quires use of soil maps and/or soil surveys to provide infor-
mation on the distribution of soil types and thus soil hydro-
logic properties. Previously, soil maps produced from sur-
veys of the region were the only source of this information. 
Now, remote sensing (RS) and digital terrain analysis can be 
utilized through geographic information system (GIS) tech-
niques [169] which are more accurate with higher resolution 
data than previous methods. In addition, the availability of 
precipitation data may be sparse and limiting. Gathering 
measurements over a large area may not be economically 
feasible, so modelers use genetic algorithms or other tech-
niques discussed previously to fill gaps and provide better 
representation of data over the entire watershed area. 
Often, digital elevation models (DEMs) are used to iden-
tify stream networks/rivers and the land slopes that contrib-
ute flow to these waterbodies. DEMs can be publicly ob-
tained at various resolutions (e.g., 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m), 
which can impact the accuracy of hydrograph generation and 
identification of tributaries/river networks [163]. DEMs are 
digital surfaces representing the area of interest with a grid 
of given resolution placed over the surface and elevation data 
assigned to each cell. Each DEM grid cell drains a specific 
direction based upon its slope and the slope of the cells 
around it. Streams or channel networks are identified by us-
ing the slope information of DEM grid cells and assigning a 
threshold area (the minimum area that would drain to a point 
for a stream channel to form). The stream network is com-
prised of a set of points that have summed areas of cells 
above the threshold value draining toward them. The resolu-
tion of the DEM can impact the slope of grid cells due to the 
area covered and averaging of elevations, and thus, the iden-
tification of stream networks [168, 170]. DEM resolution 
also impacts the delineation of the watersheds. Ridge lines 
are commonly used to define watersheds because these rep-
resent the divide for which portion of precipitation flows in 
which direction.  
In a study by Zhu and Mackay [169], the impacts of us-
ing traditional soil maps versus soil information derived 
from both fuzzy logic and digital elevation models (DEMs) 
were evaluated for the Lubrecht area in Montana. Using the 
newer technology, they found that peak runoff was reduced 
thus producing more realistic hydrographs. Yang et al. [163], 
evaluated the effects of DEM resolution on geomorphic 
properties (i.e., identification of river networks and hydro-
logical response). In their study, fifteen catchments in Japan 
were analyzed using differing DEM resolutions. An increase 
in DEM mesh size (less resolution) led to loss in the amount 
of tributaries identified, flatter topography due to averaging 
of elevations for individual DEM grid cells and less accurate 
representation of the hydrological response of the catchment 
[163].  
The required resolution of data used in the modeling ef-
fort may be dependent on the output desired. Kalin et al. 
[168] evaluated the resolution required for different outputs 
for two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimen-
tal watersheds. When the peak runoff is the primary concern, 
the highest resolution is optimal. Meanwhile, if modelers are 
only interested in sediment load at the outlet, lower resolu-
tion of model input data may be used.  
Hydrologic and Hydrodynamic Models for Watershed 
Modeling 
This section provides a review of current state-of-the-art 
of watershed-scale models, including discussion of their 
strengths and weaknesses when applied to various watershed 
and related problems. Recent reviews by Singh and Wool-
hiser [39], Borah and Bera [171], Kalin and Hantush [37], 
Singh and Frevert [172], and Oogathoo [6] identify the more 
commonly used watershed-scale models: AGNPS (Agricul-

Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution Model (AGN-
PS/AnnAGNPS) 
The current version of AGNPS is the AnnAGNPS model 
[173, 174] which was developed to simulate, on a daily time 
step, the sediment and nutrient transport from an agricultural 
watershed, ranging in size from a few hectares up to 300,000 
hectares (3x109 m2). AnnAGNPS is a semi-empirical, dis-
tributed, continuous simulation watershed-scale model with 
output options for an event, monthly, or annual basis [173, 
174]. The AnnAGNPS model can assist with the manage-
ment of runoff, erosion, and nutrient movement by perform-
ing cost-benefit analysis. The model can simulate several 
best management practices (BMPs) including ponds, vegeta-
tive filters strips, riparian buffers, and others [37]. Borah and 
Bera [5] also note that the model is useful for analyzing 
long-term effects of hydrological changes and watershed 
management practices, especially agricultural practices. The 
model has been utilized in several studies with mixed results 
[175-178]. In Australia, Baginska et al. [179] showed the 
event flow predictions to be satisfactory, Das et al. [180] 
were able to produce runoff results for the Canagagigue 
Creek watershed of southwestern Ontario with acceptable 
accuracy, while Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al. [175] 
highlighted that the model can produce adequate results for 
predicting long-term monthly and annual runoff.  
Key limitations of the AnnAGNPS model include: (i) an 
inability to simulate base flow or frozen soil conditions; (ii) 
the mass balance calculation for water inflow and outflow is 
not provided as the model does not account for spatially 
varying rainfall over the watershed; and (iii) the runoff simu-
lation is not entirely based on physical laws [6]. Model re-
sults from Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al. [175] show that 
the overland flow inadequately represented the riparian ar-
eas, and predictions on nutrients and sediment loads are 
overestimated. Proper cell discretization was suggested as an 
option for improving runoff estimates. In Nepal, Shrestha et 
al. [181] showed that model event-based peak flow results 
were over predicted. AnnAGNPS is also not adequately for-
mulated to simulate intense single-event storms [171]. Borah 
et al. [182] concluded that the AGNPS model is not suitable 
for analyzing a storm when the flow and constituent concen-
trations and loads drastically vary. They also noted that the 
use of AGNPS in studying impacts of BMPs is qualitative 
since AGNPS does consider subsurface and groundwater 
processes [183]. 
Both AGNPS and AnnAGNPS use the Curve Number 
(CN) method, which does not reproduce measured runoff 
from specific storm rainfall events because the time distribu-
tion is not considered [183-187]. Additional limitations in-
clude: (i) no explicit account of the effect of the antecedent 
moisture conditions in runoff computation; (ii) difficulties in 
separating storm runoff from the total discharge hydrograph; 
and (iii) runoff processes not considered by the empirical 
formula [183, 186, 187]. Croley and He [188] suggest that 
these limitations will result in CN estimates of runoff and 
infiltration which are not reflective of actual values. In addi-
tion, they note that sediment, nutrient, and pesticide load-
ings, which are directly related to infiltration and runoff, may 
generate inaccurate estimates for non-point source pollution 
rates.

Areal Non-PointSource Watershed Environment Simula-
tion (ANSWERS) 
ANSWERS is comprised of two major response compo-
nents: hydrology [189] and upland erosion [190]. The water-
shed area is divided into grids (less than 10,000 m) where all 
properties (e.g., soil properties, land use, slopes, crops, nutri-
ents, and management practices) are considered homoge-
nous. ANSWERS-2000, an expanded version of ANSWERS 
[191], utilizes breakpoint rainfall data and performs simula-
tion on 30-second time steps for runoff events and a daily 
time step between runoff events. Simulation is limited to 
medium-size watersheds (5x106 to 3x107 m) where surface 
hydrologic processes dominate. In addition, the model also 
has the capability of simulating transformations and interac-
tions between four nitrogen pools including stable organic N, 
active organic N, nitrate, and ammonium. A surface runoff 
hydrograph is provided at both the watershed outlet and any 
other user-selected point within the watershed [192]. 
ANSWERS and ANSWERS-2000 models were designed 
for ungauged watersheds, as well as for evaluating the effec-
tiveness of agricultural and urban watershed best manage-
ment practices (BMPs) in decreasing sediment and nutrient 
transport to streams during surface runoff events [37, 193]. 
Available literature [6, 171, 193-195] provides some of the 
achievements and issues related to the application of these 
models. For example, Connolly et al. [194] showed that 
ANSWERS could be used to predict runoff at a catchment 
outlet and generate fairly accurate simulations for different 
surface cover conditions; however, runoff predictions were 
less accurate at low rainfall intensity events when compared 
to higher intensity events. They also pointed out that com-
plex watersheds could be modeled without calibration; al-
though promoting confidence in the model, one would be ill-
advised to follow such advice. 
Dillaha et al. [193] evaluated ANSWERS-2000 on two 
watersheds in Watkinsville, Georgia; it performed well in 
predicting runoff, sediment, nitrate, dissolved ammonium, 
sediment-bound total Kjeldahlnitrogen (TKN), and dissolved 
phosphorus losses from both watersheds. They also tested 
the model on the 1,153 hectare (1.15x107 m2) Owl Run wa-
tershed in Virginia, where it also performed well for the 
largest storms, and cumulative predictions of runoff volume, 
sediment yield, nitrate, ammonium, sediment-bound TKN, 
and orthophosphorus were within 40 percent of the measured 
values. Other research by Bai et al. [195] showed that the 
model adequately simulated runoff during non-snow seasons.  
Oogathoo [6] notes that a key weakness of ANSWERS is 
its inability to simulate interflow and groundwater contribu-
tions to base flow, snow pack, and snowmelt. This suggests 
the model is less suitable for locations where base flow con-
tribution, winter snow accumulation, and snow melt are high. 
Borah and Bera [5] also noted ANSWERS is not adequately 
formulated to simulate intense single-event storms and has 
potential numerical problems inherent in its solutions. They 
also mentioned that ANSWERS-2000 does not have channel 
erosion and sediment transport routines; therefore, the sedi-
ment and chemical components are not applicable to water-
sheds. Like AGNPS and AnnAGNPS, ANSWERS and AN-
SWERS-2000 utilize the CN method and face the same limi-
tations identified earlier by Beven [186], Croley and He 
[188], and Garen and Moore [187].

Hydrologic 
Analysis 
(GSSHA)/CASC2D 
CASC2D [196] is a physically-based model that was de-
veloped to predict surface runoff in arid to semi-arid basins. 
Water and sediment are simulated in two-dimensional over-
land grids and one-dimensional channels. Both single-event 
and long-term continuous simulations are possible. The wa-
tershed is divided into cells, and water and sediment are 
routed from one to another. GSSHA [31, 32], an enhance-
ment of CASC2D, adds the ability to simulate saturated and 
unsaturated groundwater, allowing use of the model in a va-
riety of climates and watersheds. While increasing the capa-
bility of the CASC2D model, all functionality of the 
CASC2D model has been retained, with significant im-
provements in model stability and efficiency.  
GSSHA, a component within the U.S. Department of De-
fense’s (DOD) Watershed Modeling System (WMS) [197], 
was developed to provide hydrologic predictions in the wid-
est variety of places and conditions including the complex 
spatial organization in an urban environment. This may have 
important implications for the development of techniques for

runoff modeling, flood prediction, and planning in urbanized 
areas [31]. GSSHA has new or improved CASC2D features 
such as the ability to simulate major hydrologic storage units 
(e.g., lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs) and an improvement in 
the predictions of in-stream sediment transport, especially 
during large rainfall events [31]. Both models were tested on 
the Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed in Mississippi 
where it was shown that the accuracy of sediment discharge 
for selected storms was superior when using GSSHA [31, 
198]. Despite these results, other studies [e.g., 37] indicate 
that the model may have major limitations such as the poten-
tial to generate very poor sediment results. Kalin and Han-
tush [37] suggest erosion in channels is not transport limited, 
which means the model generates sediment that has a vol-
ume greater than what the flow can carry. Another limitation 
for the model is its numerical schemes, which are computa-
tionally intensive and demand large amounts of data [171]. 
According to Ogden and Julien [199], simulation times can 
become prohibitive when the number of model grid cells 
exceeds 100,000; therefore, the model may become prohibi-
tive for medium to large-sized watersheds [171]. 
HEC-1/HEC-HMS  
HEC-1, developed to simulate hydrologic processes (pre-
cipitation, losses, baseflow, runoff transformation, and rout-
ing) on watersheds ranging in size from 1 km2 to 100,000 
km2, produces runoff hydrographs at single or multiple loca-
tions on complex watershed networks for gauged and hypo-
thetical rainfall events [200]. HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engi-
neering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System) [201, 202] is 
the “next generation" and state-of-the-art Windows-based 
model for precipitation-runoff simulation that will supersede 
the HEC-1 model. HEC-HMS provides a variety of options 
for simulating precipitation-runoff and routing processes, 
and is comprised of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) [203], 
integrated hydrologic analysis components, data storage and 
management capabilities, and graphics and reporting facili-
ties [201, 202]. Both HEC-1 [200] and HEC-HMS [201] 
have been widely used for modeling floods and impacts on 
land use changes [6]. Duru and Hjelmfelt [204], using the 
model's kinematic wave method, found that even with lim-
ited calibration, runoff prediction for ungauged catchments 
was good and impacts of land use on the hydrologic cycle 
could be evaluated accurately. Additionally, a study con-
ducted in northern Ontario, Canada showed that HEC-1 
model could be used for runoff simulation in an ungauged 
watershed [205].  
Even though HEC-1/HEC-HMS has been widely used, 
Oogathoo [6] notes that it excludes certain important fea-
tures. The model is constrained to a constant time step, 
which may not be suitable for components requiring detailed 
analysis. Since it is semi-distributed, the model assumes hy-
drologic processes to occur uniformly within each sub-basin. 
Also, as the primary purpose of the model is to determine 
flood hydrographs, a simple method is used for the baseflow 
simulation; therefore, the loss component of the model is not 
tracked down in absence of precipitation, that is, the soil 
does not dry out and recover its loss potential. Other limita-
tions identified by Scharffenberg [201] include uncoupled 
models for evapotranspiration-infiltration and infiltration-
base flow processes, no aquifer interactions, the allowance, 
but limited capability, of flow splits within the dendritic 
stream systems, and the lack of downstream flow influence 
or reversal which makes backwater possible but only if con-
tained within a reach.  
Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) 
HSPF [206, 207] is a semi-distributed, continuous model 
that simulates hydrologic and associated water quality proc-
esses on pervious and impervious land surfaces, in streams, 
and in well-mixed impoundments where water movement is 
simulated as overland flow, interflow, and groundwater flow. 
Also simulated are snowpack depth and water content, 
snowmelt, evapotranspiration, ground-water recharge, dis-
solved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, temperature, 
pesticides, conservatives, fecal coliforms, sediment detach-
ment and transport, sediment routing by particle, size, chan-
nel routing, reservoir routing, constituent routing, pH, am-
monia, nitrate-nitrite, organic nitrogen, orthophosphate, or-
ganic phosphorous, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. The 
model utilizes hydrological response units (HRUs) based on 
uniform climate and storage capacity factors. Periods from a 
few minutes to hundreds of years can be simulated. 
Simulation results include a time history of the runoff flow 
rate, 
sediment 
load, 
and 
nutrient 
and 
pesticide 
concentrations, along with a time history of water quantity 
and quality at any point in a watershed. HSPF simulates 
three sediment types (sand, silt, and clay) in addition to a 
single organic chemical and transformation products of that 
chemical [206, 207]. 
Generally used to assess the effects of land use change, 
reservoir operations, point or non-point source treatment 
alternatives, and flow diversions [37], HSPF is also suitable 
for mixed agricultural and urban watersheds [171]. Some of 
the key strengths of the model identified by Aqua Terra 
[208] include: (i) a comprehensive representation of water-
shed land, stream processes, and watershed pollutant 
sources, including non-point (by multiple land uses), point, 
and atmospheric sources; (ii) flexibility and adaptability to a 
wide range of watershed conditions; and (iii) well-designed 
code modularity and structure. Oogathoo [6] and AquaTerra 
[208] note that HSPF’s key limitations derive from it not 
being fully distributed or physically-based. As a result, wa-
tershed characteristics and climatic parameters are lumped 
into several units, and both empirical and physical equations 
are used to simulate the water flow [6]. In addition, due to its 
conceptualization of the overland (sub-basin) areas as lev-
eled detention storage and use of the storage-based or non-
linear flow equations in routings, HSPF is not adequate for 
simulating intense single-event storms, especially for large 
sub-basins and long channels [6, 171]. The model requires 
extensive data requirements (e.g., hourly rainfall) and avail-
able documentation provides no comprehensive parameter 
estimation guidance. As a result, user training is normally 
required [208]. In their effort to evaluate the model, Saleh 
and Du [209] highlighted these issues as they found the cali-
bration process tends to be strenuous and long. 
Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS2) 
Represented by a cascade of planes and channels, 
KINEROS2 may be used to determine the effects of various 
artificial features such as urban developments, small deten-
tion reservoirs, or lined channels on flood hydrographs and 
sediment yield [33]. The model is also adopted as part of the

Tool 
(AGWA) software system [210, 211]. Limited to Hortonian

and 
not 
designed 
for 
long-term 
simulations, 
KINEROS2 lacks an evapotranspiration component impor-
tant for the mass balance of the water cycle [37]; however, 
with its complete set of hydrology and sediment components, 
the model serves as a useful tool for studying single severe 
or design storms and evaluating watershed management 
practices, especially structural practices [171]. Using a small 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimental wa-
tershed located near Treynor, Iowa, Kalin and Hantush[37] 
tested the model and showed that it was also extremely ro-
bust in simulating erosion and sediment transport. The model 
was designed for arid and semi-arid areas [212]; however, 
several studies [210, 213-215] highlight the ability of the 
model to successfully simulate erosion, sediment transport, 
and characterize the runoff response of the watershed due to 
changes of land cover in arid and semi-arid watersheds. La-
jili-Ghezal [215] conducted similar assessments on the 
M'Richet El Anze watershed in a Tunisian semi-arid area 
and concluded that the model was adequate for predicting 
runoff from ungauged watersheds and for evaluating future 
land use master-plans for Tunisian semi-arid high lands. 
Miller et al. [210] also used KINEROS2 within the AGWA 
framework to successfully assess increased event runoff vol-
umes and flashier flood response in watersheds that contrib-
ute runoff to the upper San Pedro River in Sonora, Mexico 
and southeast Arizona. 
Unlike most of the studies mentioned, Al-Qurashiet al. 
[212] were less successful when assessing the model using 
data from a large arid catchment in Oman. Despite relatively 
extensive and high resolution rainfall-runoff data, and their 
efforts to optimize performance using automatic calibration 
and by adding a rainfall parameter, the model validation per-
formance was poor, and in general, no better than achieved 
using a ‘default’ parameter set [212]. Borah and Bera [5] 
note that the model does a relatively good job of simulating 
runoff and sediment yield at watershed scales of up to ap-
proximately 1,000 hectares (1x107 m2); however, such poor 
results may arise since applications of the model are limited 
to small watersheds and specific combinations of space and 
time increments for maintaining stability of the numerical 
solutions. Overall, a key weakness of the model is the ab-
sence of chemical/nutrient components [171] which limit its 
capabilities to simulate for BMPs [37]. 
MIKE SHE  
MIKE SHE is a fully integrated, distributed, and physi-
cally-based watershed model that simulates the major proc-
esses in the hydrologic cycle and includes process models for 
evapotranspiration, overland flow, unsaturated flow, ground 
flow, channel flow, and their interactions [34]. It is used 
mostly at the watershed scale and from a single soil profile to 
several sub-watersheds with different soil types [216, 217]. 
The model's distributed nature allows a spatial distribution of 
watershed parameters, climate variables, and hydrological 
response through an orthogonal grid network and column of 
horizontal layers at each grid square in the horizontal and 
vertical, respectively [218]. The model can be used for storm 
or long-term events with a variable time step. Being physi-
cally-based, the topography, along with watershed character-
istics such as vegetation and soil properties, is included in 
the model. With a modular structure, MIKE SHE is capable 
of exchanging data between components as well as adding 
new process model components. The flexible operating 
structure of MIKE SHE allows the use of as many or as few 
components of the model, based on availability of data [219].  
MIKE SHE is considered the most comprehensive water-
shed model with virtually all of the in-surface and surface 
phases of the hydrologic cycle [37]. It also has many of the 
options to simulate wetlands, and nutrient and pesticide 
management. The model is being used for a wide variety of 
applications in different countries, including England [220], 
Australia [221], Canada [6], and the United States [222]. 
Some of the notable application areas include river basin 
management and modeling [223], integrated ground/surface 
water modeling [221, 222], irrigation [224-226], land use 
changes, and anthropogenic effects [27].  
Thompson et al. [220] used the model simulated in a wet-
land in England and found that the simulation results consis-
tently matched the observed data and reproduced the sea-
sonal dynamics of groundwater and ditch water levels. Sahoo 
et al. [84] used the model in a mountainous region of Hawaii 
to study watershed response to storm events and found the 
results were comparable to the observed data. In addition, 
Demetriou and Punthakey [221] concluded that the model 
was accurate in predicting water movement from aquifers, 
drainage and supply systems, and land surfaces across an 
Australian watershed with a complex hydro-geological re-
gime. Overall, Singh et al. [227] showed that the model can 
be utilized for irrigation planning and management of water 
resources for agricultural purposes.  
Many of the MIKE SHE applications also involve cou-
pling with other models; the model can interface with Model 
of Urban Sewers (MOUSE) to simulate the effect of urban 
drainage and sewer systems on the surface/subsurface hy-
drology [34, 228, 229] and is also frequently coupled with 
(DAISY), a detailed soil-plant-atmosphere model for agricul-
ture related studies [34, 230, 231]. Like the GSSHA model, 
MIKE SHE faces the problem of being computationally in-
tensive and may be prohibitive for medium to large-sized 
watersheds [171]. Borah and Bera [5] further point out that 
the physically based flow-governing equations use approxi-
mate numerical solutions, which are subject to computational 
instability problems, and limited on space and time incre-
ments and watershed sizes. 
Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)/Modular 
Modeling System (MMS) 
PRMS [232] is a modular-design, deterministic, distrib-
uted model that simulates precipitation- and snowmelt-
driven movement of water through the watershed via over-
land flow, interflow, and baseflow. Watershed response can 
be simulated at a daily time step or more frequently over the 
course of a storm. The watershed is divided into sub-units 
based on basin characteristics such as slope, aspect, eleva-
tion, vegetation type, soil type, land use, and precipitation 
distribution. Two levels of partitioning are available for 
PRMS. The first divides the basin into HRUs based on the 
basin characteristics where water and energy balances are 
computed daily for each HRU; the sum of the responses of 
all HRU's, weighted on a unit-area basis, produces the daily 
system response and streamflow for a basin. A second level 
Watershed Modeling and its Applications 
The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    39 
of partitioning is available for storm hydrograph simulation 
where the watershed is conceptualized as a series of inter-
connected flow planes and channel segments. Surface runoff 
is routed over the flow planes into the channel segments and 
channel flow is routed through the watershed channel sys-
tem. A HRU can be considered the equivalent of a flow 
plane or it can be delineated into a number of flow planes 
[232, 233]. PRMS was redesigned and now forms the basis 
of the US Geological Society (USGS) Modular Modeling 
System (MMS) [232].  
PRMS [233] has been applied in different regions around 
the world. Applications range from the investigation of se-
lected process components to streamflow simulation and the 
integration of MMS with other models [234]. One of the 
major benefits of MMS is its support for the integration of 
models and tools at a variety of levels [232]. Design levels 
include individual process models, tightly coupled models, 
loosely coupled models, and fully integrated decision sup-
port systems [234]. Several studies [235-237] have focused 
on this aspect of the model with some success. Steuer and 
Hunt [236] and Hunt and Steuer [235] used the model to 
study the effects of urbanization and land use changes on 
ground water recharge, and explicitly fed the results into the 
U.S. Geologic Survey groundwater model, Modular Three-
Dimensional 
Finite-Difference 
Ground-Water 
Flow 
Model(MODFLOW), for other studies in Dane County, Wis-
consin. Hobson [237] coupled the model with a stochastic 
weather generator as a framework to simulate weather vari-
ables and streamflows in the Upper Truckee River Basin on 
the California and Nevada border. The model can also be 
effectively used to evaluate the effects of climate variability, 
change on water resources, water management [234], and 
simulate floods including the representing flood wave propa-
gation from single rainfall events [5]. Valeo and Xiang [238] 
demonstrated this capability by analyzing climate change 
impacts on flooding from the Elbow River watershed in the 
foothills of the Rocky Mountains. In addition, Yates et al. 
[239] utilized the model with historical radar rainfall and 
forecast data to simulate flash flooding on a watershed that 
was partially burned during a forest fire. Other examples of 
these studies were conducted in several regions of the world, 
including the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley [240], river basins 
in the Sierra Nevada of California [241], and the Arno River 
in Italy [242]. 
Borah and Bera [5] identified the following key weak-
nesses of PRMS/MMS: (i) like KINEROS2, the model was 
designed for single rainfall events using one-dimensional 
flow equations and has potential numerical problems inher-
ent to the numerical solutions; (ii) in the Storm Mode, the 
model has hydrology and overland sediment, but no chemi-
cal component, sediment simulation in stream channels, and 
subsurface flow simulations; and (iii) the physically based 
flow-governing equations use approximate numerical solu-
tions which are subject to computational instability prob-
lems, and limited on space and time increments and water-
shed sizes. 
Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) 
SWAT [35, 36] is a physically-based, continuous-time 
watershed model that operates on a daily time step and is 
designed to predict the impact of management on water, 
sediment, and agricultural chemical yields in ungauged wa-
tersheds. The watershed is divided into multiple subwater-
sheds, which are then further subdivided into HRUs that 
consist of homogeneous land use, management, and soil 
characteristics. The HRUs represent percentages of the sub-
watershed area and are not identified spatially within a 
SWAT simulation. Alternatively, a watershed can only be 
subdivided into subwatersheds that are characterized by 
dominant land use, soil type, and management. Output for 
the model includes evapotranspiration, soil water storage, 
and water yield (surface runoff plus subsurface flow) [35, 
36]. The model has been adopted as part of the USEPA’s 
Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint 
Sources (BASINS) system [243] and AGWA [210, 211] 
software systems because it is a widely accepted continuous 
model suitable for agricultural and forest land uses [5, 168]. 
Based on these core strengths, Gassman et al. [36] found that 
the primary applications of SWAT are calibration and/or 
sensitivity analysis, climate change impacts, GIS interface 
descriptions, hydrologic assessments, variation in configura-
tion or data input effects, comparisons with other models or 
techniques, interfaces with other models, and pollutant as-
sessments. The foundation strength of SWAT in many of 
these applications is the combination of simplified upland 
and channel processes that are incorporated into the model 
noted by Gassman et al. [36]. The incorporation of the CN 
method and non-spatial HRUs supports model adaptation to 
virtually any watershed with a wide variety of hydrologic 
conditions [36].  
SWAT has produced favorable model results when 
evaluated on watersheds with a range of conditions in the 
U.S. and many other countries such as Korea [244], Canada 
[245], China [246], Finland [247], India [248-250], Tunisia 
[251], and Greece [252]; across many of these watersheds, 
SWAT has shown flexibility in simulating surface runoff. 
For example, Du et al. [253] demonstrated that a modified 
version of the SWAT model was able to generate reasonable 
simulation results for surface and subsurface flows, water 
table dynamics, tile flow, potholes, surface tile inlets, and 
aeration stress on plants for large flat landscapes. Gebremes-
kel et al. [245] stated that the SWAT model performed very 
well for stream flow prediction in the Canagagigue Creek 
watershed of southwestern Ontario, Canada. Several studies 
have also demonstrated the utility of SWAT as a tool for 
evaluating how stream flow can be affected by climate 
change [254-256]. 
With a flexible framework, SWAT facilitates the calcula-
tion of TMDLs and simulation of a wide variety of conserva-
tion practices and other BMPs (e.g., fertilizer and manure 
application rate and timing, irrigation management, and 
flood prevention structures) [36]. Several studies illustrate 
the success of SWAT in conducting these types of simula-
tions as part of an overall BMP assessment. For example, 
Santhi et al. [257] were able to use SWAT to determine the 
impacts of manure and nutrient related BMPs, forage harvest 
management, and other BMPs on water quality in the West 
Fork watershed in Texas. Chaplot et al.’s [258] efforts with 
SWAT showed that the adoption of no tillage, changes in 
nitrogen application rates, and land use changes had the po-
tential to significantly affect nitrogen losses on the Walnut 
Creek watershed in Iowa, and Kang et al. [244] were suc-

gen, total phosphorus, and suspended solid for a small water-
shed containing rice paddies.  
SWAT possesses components that make it a robust tool 
for simulating in-stream water quality dynamics, bacteria 
fate and transport, and sediment transport [36]. A study con-
ducted by Migliaccio et al. [259] compared SWAT’s in-
stream water quality component with QUAL2E, USEPA’s 
well-known and state-of-the-art in-stream water quality 
model. Both options were used to simulate the movement of 
total phosphorous (P) and nitrate/nitrite (N) movement on 
War Eagle Creek watershed in Arkansas. The study revealed 
that there was no statistical difference between both in-
stream water quality modeling options. Saleh and Du [209] 
and Stewart et al. [260] also show that SWAT predicted rea-
sonable results for P and N loss on the Bosque River water-
shed in Texas. Chu et al. [261] evaluated SWAT on the 
Warner Creek watershed in Maryland and generated simula-
tion results for sediment loads which agreed strongly with 
yearly measured values. Other studies [248, 250, 262-265] 
on SWAT simulation of sediment loading on different water-
sheds also generated comparable results. In Missouri, for 
example, Benham et al. [266] used SWAT to determine the 
bacteria sources and assess which BMPs can reduce the bac-
teria on a watershed in Missouri. Similar results [267, 268] 
from other studies also highlight the usefulness of SWAT in 
bacteria fate and transport.  
The examples presented here have highlighted the flexi-
bility and robustness of SWAT. Despite these strengths, 
SWAT possesses a number of weaknesses, notably the use of 
non-spatial aspects of HRUs [6, 36]. As a result, Gassman et 
al. [36] note that this does not allow SWAT to provide an 
explicit spatial representation of riparian buffer zones, wet-
lands, and other BMPs. In addition, there is limited ability to 
account for targeted placement of grassland or other land use 
and ignore flow and pollutant routing within a given subwa-
tershed. Like ANPS and AnnANPS, SWAT also utilizes the 
curve number (CN) method and faces the same limitations 
identified earlier by Beven [186-188]. Borah and Bera [171] 
also report that SWAT does not simulate single-event storms 
adequately.  
Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) 
WEPP [269] is a process-based, distributed, continuous, 
erosion prediction model. It is applicable to hillslope erosion 
processes (sheet and rill erosion), as well as simulation of the 
hydrologic and erosion processes on small watersheds. The 
primary intention of the model is to evaluate the effects of 
farming and land use on soil erosion and sediment delivery 
for small, agricultural field-sized watersheds (up to 2.59x106 
m2). WEPP has been used in a wide range of applications, 
including runoff mapping [270], sediment analysis [271], 
and modeling the transport of pathogenic microorganisms 
[272]. Another example of the WEPP application was fo-
cused on the connection between soil sediment and microbial 
transport [272]. It was determined that areas with clay soils 
contribute more to contamination of water supplies by mi-
croorganisms than those with sandy soils. It was also sug-
gested that the leading factors are hydraulic conductivity, 
rainfall intensity, and topographic slope. Similar efforts 
could be performed on organic chemicals that may adhere to 
differing soil types and be transported through the watershed. 
A computer interface (Erosion Database Interface, EDI) 
was created by van Lier et al. [273] to process the surface 
hydrology output from WEPP into a georeferenced estima-
tion of runoff. This tool allowed for improved management 
of agriculture and can be used to assess crop management 
techniques [270]. WEPP was used, along with the Universal 
Soil Loss Equation, sediment rating curves, and other model-
ing techniques to develop a sediment budget for the Murder-
CreekBasin in Georgia. From the study, researchers found 
that unstable streambanks, mobile streambeds, and turbidity 
currently observed in the area were the result of poor farm-
ing practices from the early 1900s [271].  
WATERSHED MODELING SYSTEMS 
There are numerous watershed-scale hydrologic model-
ing systems available that utilize some of the models men-
tioned previously within one packaged system for watershed 
management. This section briefly describes some of the sys-
tems more commonly used today. A summary of the water-
shed model systems considered and their properties is pro-
vided in Table 2. 
Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment Tool 
(AGWA) 
AGWA is a GIS-based tool for watershed modeling cre-
ated through a joint project between the USDA-ARS South-
west Watershed Research Center and the U.S. EPA Office of 
Research and Development [274]. Embedded in AGWA are 
the KINEROS and SWAT models. Digital elevation models 
(DEMs) are used to delineate and discretize the watersheds. 
Then, soil, land cover, and precipitation data layers are used 
to derive model input parameters. Subsurface hydrologic 
data from Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed were used 
to calibrate and validate AGWA.  
AGWA is used by scientists and natural resource manag-
ers to investigate the impacts of land cover change on runoff, 
erosion, and water quality. Most applications of AGWA in-
volve analysis of future sediment loading and runoff to assist 
in decision support. Hernandez et al. [214] demonstrated this 
application by using AGWA with ATtILA, a landscape as-
sessment tool, to analyze the spatial effects of human-
induced landscape changes on runoff volume and soil ero-
sion in the San Pedro River Basin, a semi-arid area. Within 
AGWA, SWAT was used for modeling of runoff and erosion 
simulations. The basin was divided into sub catchments for 
analysis, which were further divided into hydrological re-
sponse units (HRUs) to develop relationships between land 
cover and sediment yield. Agricultural areas were found to 
have the greatest contribution to sediment yield. Subcatch-
ments and HRUs were ranked in order of sediment loading 
with those contributing the most sediment considered “sensi-
tive areas.” This application provides resource managers 
with capability to identify problem areas by applying a spa-
tial approach to sediment and runoff modeling [214]. An-
other example of AGWA’s use for management decision 
support was performed by Kepner et al. [275]. Three scenar-
ios for future urbanization of the Upper San Pedro River 
Basin were evaluated for surface runoff, sediment yield, 
channel discharge, and percolation using SWAT within 
AGWA. While all three scenarios yielded negative impacts 
on the basin, the Open Scenario, which consists of a popula-
tion increase greater than currently forecasted and highly

unrestricted land development, resulted in a worst case out-
come [275]. Similar applications can be employed to assist 
stakeholders and management in decision support for land 
development planning. 
Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Non-
point Sources (BASINS) 
First released in 1996 by the USEPA, the Better Assess-
ment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BA-
SINS) software system was intended to serve as a multipur-
pose environmental analysis system focused on evaluating 
both point and nonpoint sources of pollutant loading in wa-
tersheds [211]. A specific intended use of BASINS is fo-
cused on evaluation and development of Total Maximum 
Daily Loads (TMDLs). It is capable of performing watershed 
and water quality-based studies on regional, state, and local 
levels. The system includes utilities for data management 
and extraction, watershed delineation, watershed assessment 
tools, and a group of watershed models including WinHSPF, 
Pollutant Load Application (PLOAD), Aquatic Ecostystem 
and Toxicity Model (AQUATOX), and AGWA which in-
cludes KINEROS and SWAT. The current version, BASINS 
4.0, includes an open-source, free GIS software architecture, 
MapWindow [276].  
BASINS has been used for pollutant loading of the Sea-
mangeum watershed in Korea, specifically focused on BOD, 
total nitrogen, and total phosphorous. Jeon et al. [277], in 
testing the applicability of WinHSPF within BASINS, found 
that values obtained from BASINS were a bit higher than 
field observations, but were considered within an acceptable 
range to accept the model as a good choice for Korean appli-
cations. In another study for the New York Department of 
Environment and Conservation (NYDEC), BASINS was 
considered for use in development of the sediment portion of 
the state’s TMDL plan. They found that SWAT was easier to 
use than HSPF, but recommend that Monte Carlo simula-
tions be conducted to provide more accurate values [278]. 
Both studies indicated that results were less than perfect, but 
within acceptable boundaries.  
MODFLOW-Watershed 
Hydrology 
and 
Transport 
(MODFLOW-WHaT) 
MODFLOW-WHaT is a recent addition to the watershed 
modeling portfolio. The system is the result of a Master’s 
Thesis research of Brad Thoms [256], where the Center for 
Groundwater Research at Oregon Health and Science Uni-
versity currently sponsors/maintains MODLFLOW-WHAT. 
The package provides fully coupled, 3D simulation of sur-
face-subsurface interactions through use of Richard’s Equa-
tion, 2D kinematic flow approximations for overland flow, 
and an adaptive time-stepping algorithm. Open-channel flow 
calculations are performed using Diffusion Analogy Surface-
Water Flow Model (DAFLOW) with water quality modeled 
using RT3D and Branched Lagrangian Transport Model 
(BLTM) [279].  
Little is known about the benefits of using the system be-
yond the comparison made by Thoms [280] to work done by 
Johnson and colleagues [281]. Johnson’s work involved us-
ing MODFLOW-SURFACT to evaluate the impacts of daily 
precipitation and location within a watershed on the occur-
rence of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) in groundwaters of 
semi-arid regions [281]. In the between the two MODFLOW 
packages, it was found that MODFLOW-WHaT more accu-
rately represented the watershed’s responses to precipitation 
events by taking into consideration infiltration and subsur-
face flow that are not well represented in MODFLOW-
SURFACT [280]. The authors are unaware of a GIS compo-
nent to this modeling system or other applications. 
Watershed Information System (WISE) 
Developed by Watershed Concepts, WISE is a GIS-based 
system to manage and analyze large amounts of water re-
sources data. The system is primarily used for its open data 
storage management and formatting abilities instead of actu-
ally processing information [282]. It is compatible with 
HEC-1, HEC-2, HEC-RAS, FLO-2D, Coastal Hydroscience 
Analysis, Modeling & Predictive Simulation (CHAMPS), 
Wave Height Analysis for Flood Insurance Studies 
(WHAFIS), Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), 
and Windows Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran 
(WinHSPF) through NonPoint Source Model (NPSM). The 
system includes several modules discussed below [283]. 
• Scoping module: This allows users to collect spatial 
data and assists in mapping for flood hazard studies.  
• Terrain module: Terrain datasets can be imported and 
prioritized based on user needs primarily for use in 
drainage studies. 
• Closed system inventory module: This calculates pipe 
capacities, lengths, slopes, and has capabilities for use 
with catch basins, manholes, and piping systems.  
• Open system inventory module: Used for large scale 
hydrologic and hydraulic studies, this module allows 
input of Total Station survey data and provides easy 
export to the HEC-RAS model.  
• Hydrology module: This module assists in catchment 
delineation and calculates Time of Concentration, 
stage/storage curves and SCS curve numbers. It also 
can function as a pre-processor for HEC-1 and TR-20 
models.  
• Hydraulics module: Spatial data can be integrated to 
build hydraulic model input data and is used for flood 
map generation. 
• Water 
quality 
module: 
Travel 
time 
of 
spills/contamination events is computed using dis-
tance or time interval measures and impacted stream 
segments are color coded. 
• Planning tools module: Aerial photos can be used to 
identify impervious surfaces which are then used to 
estimate impact based upon parcel ownership. 
• Wastewater planning module: Users can plan and pre-
dict costs associated with modifying or repairing ex-
isting wastewater systems or model new systems tak-
ing into consideration costs and population projections 
[283]. 
WISE has been used primarily as a flood hazard mapping 
tool. USGS New Hapmshire/Vermont Water Science Center 
performed such a study for Carroll County, New Hampshire 
[284], where WISE was primarily used for data collection 
and storage. The primary problems faced by those involved 
42    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 
Daniel et al. 
in the project included lack of or low quality spatial data for 
mapping the floodplains [284].  
Watershed Modeling System (WMS) 
Watershed Modeling System (WMS), developed by En-
vironmental Modeling Systems, Inc. at Brigham Young Uni-
versity, is a comprehensive graphical modeling environment 
for all phases of watershed hydrology and hydraulics [197]. 
WMS includes powerful tools to automate modeling proc-
esses such as automated basin delineation, geometric pa-
rameter calculations, GIS overlay computations including 
curve numbers (CN), rainfall depth, roughness coefficients, 
etc., and cross-section extraction from terrain data. WMS 
provides an interface for a variety of hydrologic and hydrau-
lic models within a GIS-based processing framework. Mod-
els packaged within the system include HEC-1, TR-20, TR-
55, National Flood Frequency Model (NFF), Modified Ra-
tional Method Model (MODRAT), OC Rational, and HSPF 
as hydrologic modeling components. HEC-RAS, Simplified 
Dam-Break Model (SMPDBK), and CE QUAL W2 provide 
hydraulic modeling capabilities. Gridded Surface Subsurface 
Hydraulic Analysis (GSSHA), a runoff and infiltration 
model from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) 
Engineering and Research Development Center (ERDC), is 
also included for 2-D integrated hydrology modeling with 
groundwater interactions. Additional calculations include use 
of the rational method to compute peak flows primarily for 
small rural watersheds [197]. 
Typical applications involve use of the sub-models 
within WMS with the overarching system used for pre- and 
post-processing of information. An example of this is the 
work done by Omer et al. [214] on evaluating the impact of 
data resolution on hydraulic modeling and floodplain de-
lineation for Leith Creek in North Carolina. Light detection 
and ranging (LIDAR) data is a highly dense but a highly 
informational aerial surveying technique now being em-
ployed in GIS and hydrology applications for actions such as 
delineating catchments and floodplains. Redundancy in the 
data and the massive amounts of data obtained can be trou-
blesome. WMS possesses capabilities to not only utilize this 
data in applications, but also to filter the data to remove un-
necessary points. The researchers filtered the LIDAR data at 
different levels and then compared HEC-RAS results using 
each of the filtered data sets. WMS provided a platform for 
performing the analysis. It was found that filtering of the 
data improved processing time without compromising results 
with the optimal filter level of at degrees [285].  
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN WATERSHED MOD-
ELING 
Watershed modeling involves a comprehensive examina-
tion of contaminant transport across different features found 
on the surface and in the subsurface, including the interfaces 
between. Specific research and advances are focused on sub-
components of watershed modeling. Other areas for future 
consideration include development of guidelines for discern-
ing minimum data resolution requirements, improved under-
standing of scale-up issues and relationships, and develop-
ment of threshold area guidelines for stream network devel-
opment. Horn et al. [286] also suggest that future advance-
ments should include additional capabilities to evaluate river 
water quality such as biological interactions (beyond that 
currently done for TMDLs]. Research is currently underway 
to address several of these needs in watershed modeling. A 
few notable examples are illustrated below.  
The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers (USACE) have conducted several re-
search projects on improving watershed and related model-
ing including improvements in the capabilities of existing 
models. For example, the USACE Great Lakes Tributary 
Modeling Program is developing sediment transport models 
for Great Lakes tributaries [287]. USACE has committed to 
developing more of these sediment transport models for 
other Great Lakes tributaries [287]. USACE also intends to 
develop web-based tools that can continue to support water-
shed planning at smaller tributaries and sub-basins. This di-
rection can potentially lead to the application of sub models 
in a more flexible format such as integration with Internet 
GIS tools. Research at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL) is also developing 
improved sub-models. For example, parameter estimation 
methodologies are being used to enhance existing HEC-
HMS automated parameter estimation capabilities [288]. 
Additional research is also being done to investigate the use 
of artificial neural networks for forecasting streamflows and 
rainfall-runoff on watersheds [12, 16, 289, 290]. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The ability to deliver reliable water resources to a grow-
ing population and effectively forecast flooding, drought, 
and surface/groundwater water contamination represent in-
creasingly difficult and interrelated challenges to water re-
source managers, engineers, and researchers. Such chal-
lenges necessitate the employment of a more holistic ap-
proach that is capable of examining individual processes and 
systems and the interface between them. This paper identi-
fied and reviewed current technologies and issues involved 
with performing hydrologic modeling at the watershed scale. 
The topics presented include an observed shift to a more 
holistic, watershed-based focus of the regulatory community, 
various types of watershed-scale models and watershed 
modeling systems available today, use of artificial intelli-
gence in modeling processes, and issues faced through scale-
up of hydrologic processes and data resolution. The benefits 
of using these techniques include the ability to assist water 
resource and watershed managers with a variety of applica-
tions such as evaluating and developing TMDLs. Tables 1 
and 2 provide a summary of watershed-scale models and 
modeling systems reviewed in this paper. Water resource 
managers and decision makers can employ this summary to 
compare models and also use as a screening tool for select-
ing a watershed model for a specific purpose.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

Abstract Cyberinformatics tools have supported decision makings in agriculture through cutting-edge big data, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), and high-performance computing technologies. An open and easy-to-use agricultural cyberinformatics tool based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) data principle is essential for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information. This paper introduces iCrop, a new cyberinformatics tool to enable in-season crop type monitoring for the Conterminous United States (CONUS). As a web-based geographic information system (GIS), iCrop not only delivers three sets of new ML-based field-level crop-specific land cover geospatial data, including pre-season crop cover maps, in-season crop cover maps, and Refined Cropland Data Layer (R-CDL), but also provides a suite of mapping and geoprocessing functionalities through the FAIR geospatial data standards, such as Web Map Service (WMS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Web Processing Service (WPS). Meanwhile, we outline several use cases to highlight iCrop's applications under various agricultural operation scenarios, its functionality for land use change analysis, and its interoperability with generic web-based and desktop GIS software (e.g., GeoPlatform and QGIS). Our experimental results show that the new cyberinformatics tool can provide timely and unique crop-specific land cover information through the geoprocessing functionalities to facilitate U.S. agricultural information management and decision support. Moreover, this paper can be used as a systematic guidance for the design and implementation of the cyberinformatics tool to disseminate agro-geoinformation based on the FAIR data principle. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords CyberinformaticsGISFAIR data principleAgro-geoinformationLand use land coverCrop monitoring 1. Introduction Cyberinformatics is a critical component in modern computer software and geographic information systems (GIS), which leverages the capabilities of cyberinfrastructure, big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate the collection, management, analysis, visualization, and dissemination of geoinformation data over the high-speed network. Within the agricultural sector, cyberinformatics tools have demonstrated great potential to facilitate the process and analysis of agro-geoinformation, thereby supporting the management of spatio-temporal variability in crop production (Di et al., 2021, White et al., 2021). In recent years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) has continuously invested in Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) to investigate the food and agriculture cyberinformatics tools (Nifa, 2021, USDA NIFA, 2020). The results and findings from these research initiatives, spanning various agricultural applications like evapotranspiration estimation (Armstrong et al., 2022), droplet detection for agricultural spraying systems (Acharya et al., 2022), food environment assessment (Mulrooney et al., 2021), soil carbon management (Sanderman et al., 2021), real-time decision making in plant phenotyping (Singh et al., 2021), crop yield forecast (Medina et al., 2021), have indicated that cyberinformatics can efficiently aid agricultural information management and decision support. As the pioneer of applying cyberinformatics tools as the primary GIS software to serve agricultural research, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has been at the forefront of this effort, consistently using web-based geospatial data service systems to access, manage, process, analyze, and disseminate agro-geoinformation based on the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principle (Wilkinson et al., 2016, Barton et al., 2022, Top et al., 2022, Hu et al., 2023, Wolfert et al., 2023). For example, CropScape is a well-known agricultural geospatial data service system to serve Cropland Land Data (CDL) data products through web geoprocessing services (Han et al., 2012). VegScape is a similar web-based data service system to disseminate a variety of near-real-time vegetation index (VI) data products derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (Zhang et al., 2022b). Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA) is a new tool to monitor and analyze U.S. soil moisture conditions using remotely sensed soil moisture data derived from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission (Yang et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2022c). In 2021, USDA NASS announced CroplandCROS as an alternative web application to host CDL data with a new user interface (USDA NASS, 2021). These cyberinformatics tools have helped users worldwide to better understand U.S. agriculture and significantly facilitated decision makings by providing diverse geoinformation through the easy-to-use web interface. Among the existing geospatial data in agro-geoinformation, USDA NASS's CDL is by far the most downloaded crop-specific land cover data product. As of Dec 2022, the CDL and its derivative data products (e.g., crop frequency layers, crop mask layer) have been distributed to over 330,000 users worldwide through CropScape. However, the current-year CDL data is usually released to the public until early next year (e.g., the 2022 CDL was released in February 2023), which means CropScape cannot be applied to provide timely agricultural land cover information within the growing season. To tackle this issue and offset the lag of CDL, many AI/ML approaches and algorithms for early- and in-season crop type classification are implemented (Hao et al., 2015, Yaramasu et al., 2020, Johnson and Mueller, 2021, Zhang et al., 2021, Abernethy et al., 2023). Therefore, developing a CropScape-like cyberinformatics tool that provides user-experience-centric sharing and analysis of these in-season crop-specific land cover classification results based on the FAIR data principle is critical for the timely agricultural decision support and distribution of agro-geoinformation. In this paper, we introduce a new cyberinformatics tool, iCrop, for monitoring crop-specific land cover in support of the U.S agriculture. The main objective of the proposed software are: (1) being the first cyberinformatics tool to provide pre-, and in-season crop-specific land cover data for the Conterminous United States (CONUS); (2) offering a suite of easy-to-use functionalities, such as zonal statistics and land use land cover (LULC) change detection, to deliver timely and abundant field-level crop type information before and within the growing season; and (3) implementing the latest open geospatial standards and facilitating the agricultural decision making with the unique geoprocessing capabilities and national-scale field-level products based on the FAIR data principle. Furthermore, this paper serves not only as an introduction to the design and implementation of the new cyberinformatics tool, but also as a user guide for the iCrop application and its associated web services. In the rest of the paper, Section 2 presents the general context, system design, data production methods, and the implementation of map and geoprocessing services of the proposed tool. Section 3 gives a group of use cases to demonstrate iCrop’s geoprocessing capability, LULC analysis functionality, and interoperability with other generic GIS software. Section 4 discusses the contribution of this study, the advantages of the system architecture, the limitations of the current implementation, potential improvements, and future research recommendations. The conclusions are summarized in Section 5. 2. Methods 2.1. General context The cyberinformatics tool is a core component in an Earth observation system, which serves as a crucial link between the collection and analysis of geoinformation data and the users who need this information to make informed decisions (Lin et al., 2019, Bayat et al., 2021, Graf et al., 2022, Tan et al., 2022). In the context of crop monitoring system as illustrated in Fig. 1, it is essential for users to have the ability to process, manage, and deliver geospatial data in a timely manner to provide valuable agro-geoinformation. An efficient cyberinformatics tool is therefore critical to unlocking the full potential of agro-geoinformation data acquired by various sensors and enhancing decision-making processes in agriculture. To make the cycle more effective and enables timely access to early- and in-season crop-specific land cover information, the cyberinformatics tool must be capable of serving up-to-date geospatial data to users and providing geoprocessing functionalities using GIS over high-speed internet.

The cycle of collection, processing, management, and dissemination of agro-geoinformation from Earth observation data in the crop monitoring system. The implementation of a cyberinformatics tool for pre- and in-season crop-specific land cover data sharing and analysis requires tackling three essential questions: (1) how to leverage AI/ML techniques to facilitate national-scale pre- and in-season crop mapping; (2) how to facilitate timely decision makings in agriculture through web geoprocessing; and (3) how to make the new geospatial data products FAIR? This study will investigate the above questions by demonstrating the system design (Section 2.2), data production (Section 2.3), and implementation (2.4 Implementation of geospatial web services, 2.5 Graphical user interface of web client) of the new cyberinformatics tool. 2.2. System design The new cyberinformatics tool introduced in this paper is called iCrop web-based data service system (hereafter called “iCrop” or “iCrop system” for simplicity). It inherits the service-oriented architecture of CropScape and comes with three significant improvements. First, we develop, validate, and mature the ML algorithms to derive a collection of new crop cover data products for the Conterminous United States (CONUS) automatically. Second, the new data products are implemented and distributed through standardized web-based geoprocessing and map services. Third, the entire system is migrated to a cloud environment to enhance user experience and support. As shown in Fig. 2, the iCrop system architecture comprises four main components: a data production module, a web service system module, front-end clients, and the cloud infrastructure. The data production module handles the generation of all ML-based crop-specific land cover geospatial data in the system. In this system, each data product is produced on the geospatial cloud computing platforms and GIS software, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ArcGIS. The web service system module is the core of the iCrop system, where all geospatial data are processed into interoperable maps and disseminated through standardized OGC web geoprocessing and map service interfaces. These web services are fully interoperable with the iCrop web application as well as other OGC-compliant GIS software/libraries and third-party applications. Meanwhile, the entire iCrop system, including all data, web services, and the web client, is hosted as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) on the GeoBrain Cloud (https://cloud.csiss.gmu.edu/) to guarantee the scalability and timeliness of each geoprocessing request. The details of the implementation of the data production module, web service system, and the iCrop client will be described in the following sections.

Data production Table 1 summarizes the spatial and temporal information of the new crop-specific land cover data available on the iCrop system. Consistent with the official CDL, the three new geospatial data products, including pre-season crop cover, in-season crop cover, and Refined Cropland Data Layer (R-CDL), cover the entire CONUS at 30 m resolution. Each data product is produced using the specific ML model and released at the different crop growth stages. Table 1. Summary of land cover data available on the iCrop system. Data Temporal Coverage Spatial Coverage Spatial Resolution Release Date ML Model Pre-season crop cover 2022 – Current year (single annual map) CONUS 30 m Before growing season starts * Artificial neural network (Zhang et al., 2019) In-season crop cover 2022 – Current year (annual maps by May, June, and July) CONUS 30 m Within growing season (updated monthly between June and August) Random forest (Zhang et al., 2022a) R-CDL 2017 – Previous year (single annual map) CONUS 30 m After growing season ends * Decision tree (Lin et al., 2022) * Usually available in February after the new CDL data is released The pre-season crop cover map is the prediction of U.S. crop cover using an ML-based crop sequence prediction model proposed by Zhang et al. (2019). The model uses the artificial neural network to automatically learn crop rotation patterns from the 10-year CDL time series. Then the spatial distribution of pre-season crop cover will be predicted based on the historical crop sequence in CDL with the trained ML model. The pre-season data will be released before the growing season starts. For example, the production of the 2023 pre-season crop cover map is based on the 2013–2022 CDL, which began after the release of the 2022 CDL on February 1st and finished in late February 2023. The in-season crop cover map is a remote-sensing-based crop-specific land cover data product derived from CDL and satellite images. The production of in-season crop mapping adopts a novel mapping-without-ground-truth workflow developed by Zhang et al. (2022a). The main advantage of this method is using the trusted pixels, the high-confidence pixels that are predicted from CDL time series using regular crop rotation patterns (e.g., monocropping, alternate cropping), to replace ground truth and label training samples in satellite images for crop type classification, which can significantly reduce the ground-truthing process and save substantial resource needs and labor costs. Implemented on the GEE platform, the mapping-without-ground-truth workflow employs the random forest classifier, which is widely used in remote-sensing-based crop mapping (Wang et al., 2019, Hao et al., 2020, Pierre Pott et al., 2022, Rufin et al., 2022, Soltanikazemi et al., 2022). As an in-season data product, the crop cover map by May/June/July will be updated monthly within the growing season. For example, the 2023 in-season crop cover map by May will be released in early June of 2023. With the progress of the growing season, the classification accuracy will be improved because of more abundant spectral features captured in the satellite images. The R-CDL, on the other hand, is the refinement data product of CDL. The official CDL contains a certain number of misclassified pixels, mixed pixels, and noisy pixels. These errors may lead to biased results in the following studies and analyses. To further refine the CDL data, Lin et al. (2022) proposed a decision tree method to find and validate anomalous pixels. This method first uses a decision tree to identify the potentially misclassified pixels in the single crop cover map, then adjust these pixels using spatial–temporal information from the long-term CDL time series. Same as the official CDL, the R-CDL is an annual data product. The R-CDL is produced using ArcGIS and currently available from 2017 to 2022. Once the new CDL is released, the corresponding R-CDL will be immediately generated. 2.4. Implementation of geospatial web services Similar to many cyberinformatics tools based on the FAIR data principle (Zhang et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2021, Erazo Ramirez et al., 2022, Redhead et al., 2022, Menegon et al., 2023), iCrop's geospatial data is disseminated through OGC web service standard interfaces. When implementing the service layer of iCrop, we used MapServer (McKenna and MapServer PSC, 2021) as the back-end server to power the web mapping capabilities via standardized OGC specifications, such as WMS (OGC, 2006) and WCS (OGC, 2012). We also used ArcGIS as an alternative back-end WMS/WCS server to host the new geospatial data products described in this study through ArcGIS REST APIs. These standard interfaces facilitated interoperability with the front-end client as well as other WMS/WCS-compliant GIS software and applications. Specifically, WMS standardized the operations for requesting the dynamic map of a geospatial image via the HTTP protocol. Table 2 summarizes the operations and request examples of iCrop WMS. The GetCapabilities operation enables users to request the metadata of all crop cover map layers available on iCrop. The DescribeLayer operation allows users to request the description of a specific map layer. The GetMap operation request image of a specific map layer based on mapping parameters such as projection, bounding box, image format, and width/height of the map. In addition, the legend graphics of a specific map layer can be requested via the GetLegendGraphic operation. Table 2. WMS operations and request examples of the iCrop system. Operation Description Request Example GetCapabilities Get metadata of all available map layers Metadata of iCrop WMS: https://cloud.csiss.gmu.edu/icrop-service/wms_icrop.cgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetCapabilities DescribeLayer Describe information about the requested map layer Description of in-season crop cover map for July 2023: https://cloud.csiss.gmu.edu/icrop-service/wms_icrop.cgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=DescribeLayer&LAYERS=cdl_2023_inseason_july GetMap Get image for a map layer of a geospatial data layer with specific parameters (e.g., layer name, projection, bounding box, and width/height of map) Image of in-season crop cover map for July 2023: https://cloud.csiss.gmu.edu/icrop-service/wms_icrop.cgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=cdl_2023_inseason_july&TRANSPARENT=true&SRS=EPSG:5070&BBOX=-2354935.721,311822.402,2256319.225,3165592.366&FORMAT=image/png&WIDTH=600&HEIGHT=400 GetLegendGraphic Get legend graphics image of a specific map layer Legend image of in-season crop cover map: https://cloud.csiss.gmu.edu/icrop-service/wms_icrop.cgi?VERSION=1.1.1&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=getlegendgraphic&LAYER=cdl_2023_inseason_july&FORMAT=image/png Compared to the map image provided by WMS, WCS returns coverage data files with metadata and supports a wider range of formats that are typically required for further modeling and analysis. Table 3 summarizes the WCS operations and provides examples of requests used in iCrop. The functions and usage of WCS operations are similar to those of WMS. The GetCapabilities operation requests metadata for all available coverage layers on iCrop. The DescribeCoverage operation requests a description of a specific coverage layer. The GetCoverage operation requests the raster source of a specific crop cover layer based on coverage parameters, such as projection, bounding box, scale, and output data format. Table 3.

Fig. 3 shows the diagram of the geoprocessing workflow with the iCrop system. For instance, users can initiate an on-demand data download process by selecting the target data layer by year and the area of interest (AOI) by region, state, Agricultural Statistics Districts (ASD), county, or user-defined area. Besides, the iCrop system integrates a variety of common geoprocessing capabilities, such as zonal statistics, map generation, and change analysis. The zonal statistics function calculates the pixel value distribution over a specific region. The map production processes create the map of specific data products with legend and boundary information in PDF format.

The “alt” fragments represent the alternative scenarios of the geoprocessing workflow. 2.5. Graphical user interface of web client We implemented a web-based application, In-season Crop Mapping Explorer, as the front-end client for the iCrop system. Fig. 4 shows the graphical user interface (GUI) of the web client. The layout of this client inherits the well-known CropScape and VegScape application, which consists of a main interactive map explorer along with a menu bar and a sidebar. The main interactive map explorer displays geospatial data layers and provides basic map visualization functionalities. The main menu contains a toolbox bar with all available geoprocessing functions and links for user guides and documentation. The sidebar has a layers tab, a legend tab, and an overview mini-map. The layers tab lists all types of geospatial data, including all crop cover data products, background layer, crop mask layer, crop frequency layer, and auxiliary layers (i.e., boundaries, water, road). The legend tab shows the color table for crop type categories in the map. The overview mini-map displays the current extent of the explorer over the CONUS.

Geoprocessing capabilities The iCrop system presented in this study was initially developed to offer early-season decision support and applications through a suite of user-experience-centric geoprocessing functionalities. CropScape is being widely applied to produce maps and statistics data in white papers, business plans, technical reports, and other documents for multiple operational uses, which has successfully demonstrated the efficiency of cyberinformatics tools in agriculture. With the addition of three new field-level crop cover data products covering the CONUS, iCrop has extended the geoprocessing capabilities of CropScape, enabling more time-sensitive agricultural applications, and enhancing decision-making processes. Fig. 5 showcases a group of examples of how common iCrop geoprocessing capabilities can be applied for operational uses. As demonstrated in this example, an AOI needs to be defined by region, state, ASD, and county before any processes. This example illustrates the file download, zonal statistics, and PDF map generation capabilities based on the 2022 in-season crop cover data for Pemiscot County, Missouri, of which corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and winter wheat are the dominant crop types. The file download function will create a direct download link for the data layer of the selected years in GeoTIFF or KML format. The zonal statistics function counts the pixel and calculates the acreage for each crop type or land cover category within the AOI. Then the statistics results can be displayed as pie/column charts in the web application, or downloaded the raw data in CSV format. The PDF map function generates a print-ready map in PDF format with customizable titles, paper sizes, boundary layers, and land cover categories.

LULC change analysis This use case demonstrates the change analysis capability of iCrop for crop rotation detection. The change analysis function of iCrop compares the LULC change between two years and generates the map for the changing area of the specific crop rotation pattern. Fig. 6 shows an example of detecting corn-soybeans rotation for Kossuth County of Iowa between 2022 and 2021 using the change analysis function of iCrop. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Example of corn-soybeans rotation for Kossuth County of Iowa in 2022 using the change analysis function of iCrop. The yellow and green pixels represent corn and soybeans. The red pixels in the crop rotation maps represent the changing area. Located in the central U.S. Corn Belt, corn and soybeans are two dominant crop types in Kossuth County as shown in Fig. 6 (a). In 2021, Kossuth County led all Iowa counties in total soybean production with 13.4 million bushels and corn for grain production with 57.7 million bushels produced (Nass, 2022a, USDA NASS, 2022b). It is well-known that crop rotation is a common practice in U.S. agriculture. The spatial distribution of corn-soybeans and soybeans-corn rotation over the study area is illustrated in Fig. 6 (b). From the change detection results between 2021 and 2022, we can observe that 195,396.6 of total 280,996.5 acres of corn cropland followed soybeans-corn rotation, as well as 197,184.7 of total 219,710.8 acres of soybeans cropland followed corn-soybeans rotation. 3.3. Interoperability with GIS software The map and coverage services of iCrop are fully interoperable with third-party WMS/WCS-compliant clients and applications. Thus, iCrop can be coupled to generic GIS software with OGC standards support, such as QGIS and ArcGIS. Fig. 7 demonstrates how a WMS layer of the 2023 in-season crop cover was stacked with the 2022 crop mask layer, county boundaries, and ASD boundaries in QGIS. In this example, the crop cover map is requested through the map layer “cdl_2023_inseason_july” of iCrop WMS. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Exploring crop cover via the iCrop WMS using QGIS. This example shows the 2023 in-season crop cover map with the 2022 crop mask layer and county/ASD boundaries. We also tested the interoperability of iCrop on the GeoPlatform (https://www.geoplatform.gov/). Developed by Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), the GeoPlatform program provides a portfolio of FAIR geospatial data, services, and applications under open licenses. It is mainly oriented to federal agencies, governments, private sectors, academia, and the general public. For example, the FAIR capabilities of the GeoPlatform have supported many application scenarios in the OGC Disaster Pilot programs, such as typhoon monitoring (Hu et al., 2022), flood detection (Lin et al., 2021), and climate services (Lieberman et al., 2022). Therefore, we choose GeoPlatform as another WMS/WCS-compliant platform to test the interoperability of the iCrop web services. Fig. 8 shows an example of integrating the iCrop WMS into GeoPlatform. The online prototype can be accessed via the GeoPlatform ArcGIS Online at https://geoplatform.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=84a5aedb51e944ee924348f529a49cb5.

Cyberinformatics tool based on FAIR data principle The iCrop system significantly contributes to the advancement of cyberinformatics in U.S. agriculture through its provision of a specialized tool that combines FAIR data capabilities, flexible GIS interoperability, and user-friendly functionalities. As the first geospatial data service system offering pre- and in-season crop-specific land cover data for the CONUS, iCrop provides a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use functionalities, including zonal statistics and LULC change detection. These features enable the timely and abundant availability of field-level crop type information before and during the growing season. In the realm of geospatial analysis, the rapid development of geospatial cloud computing platforms like GEE and Microsoft's Planetary Computer has substantially enhanced the capabilities and flexibility of geospatial analysis. However, the iCrop system distinguishes itself by emphasizing FAIR data principles. It focuses on the distribution of crop-specific land cover data through open geospatial data interfaces (e.g., WMS, WCS, WPS), which have been widely adopted by web-based GIS software and applications in agriculture (Nash et al., 2009). In contrast, commercial cloud platforms like GEE, while offering extensive functionalities and rich datasets, often lacks inherent adherence to FAIR data principles and restricts data usage to their own platform. By enabling easy interoperability with widely used GIS software like ArcGIS and QGIS, iCrop's data and geoprocessing services offer a more inclusive approach. Our data and geoprocessing services, on the other hand, can be easily interoperable with common GIS software, such as ArcGIS and QGIS. It is important to note that the iCrop system is not designed to compete with geospatial cloud computing platforms. Instead, it serves as a complementing tool that addresses a distinct set of needs. While geospatial cloud computing platforms excel in their functionalities, iCrop focuses on providing specialized FAIR data capabilities and interoperability with common GIS software. This ensures that the iCrop system can be seamlessly integrated into existing geospatial workflows and extends its usability to a broader user base. Another pivotal advantage of iCrop lies in its user-friendliness. While geospatial cloud computing platforms such as GEE may require coding skills and entail a steep learning curve, iCrop strives to offer a comprehensive suite of on-demand geoprocessing functions, such as zonal statistics and LULC change analysis, through a user-friendly interface. This approach empowers not only software engineers but also end-users and stakeholders like farmers and government agencies, who may possess limited technical or programming skills, to derive maximum benefits from the system. With its ability to deliver timely crop-specific land cover data and functionalities to diverse user groups, iCrop demonstrates great potential to enhance U.S. agricultural information management and decision support. 4.2. Advantages of new crop-specific land cover data This study has demonstrated how ML-based crop cover data can be easily shared and analyzed through a cyberinformatics tool that adheres to the FAIR data principles. When compared to CDL data, the ML-based crop cover data products on iCrop offer several advantages. First, the artificial neural network can automatically and reliably recognize crop sequence patterns from the historical CDL time series. With the pre-season crop mapping, the field-level spatial distribution and acreage of crop cover can be estimated before the growing season. Second, the remote-sensing-based crop cover map for CONUS is significantly accelerated using the new mapping-without-ground-truth approach. By combining spectral information in satellite images with spatiotemporal information from historical CDL, the CDL-like in-season crop cover data for CONUS is available on iCrop as early as May. This is as much as eight months ahead of the official release of CDL data. In contrast, the R-CDL method utilizes a decision tree approach to refine CDL data using spatial and temporal crop information. Validation results reveal enhanced classification accuracy, and a strong correlation between R-CDL and NASS crop acreage estimations at both county and state levels. This indirect validation highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of AI/ML techniques in further improving the accuracy of CDL data. 4.3. Potential improvements on the current tool While the ML model effectively generates pre-season crop cover maps by learning crop sequence features in the historical CDL time series, predicting crop types for croplands that deviate from established patterns remains a challenge due to dynamic and uncertain factors. To address this, we plan to incorporate additional features, such as agricultural commodity prices and weather information, into the prediction model's training. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of combining multisource geoinformation data and model to enhance crop and LULC modeling (Abunnasr and Mhawej, 2022, Baum et al., 2023, Leo et al., 2023, Massigoge et al., 2023, Meki et al., 2023). To further enhance the accuracy of the current crop mapping results, the impact of other agro-geoinformation data and geospatial land cover data products, such as National Land Cover Database (NLCD) (Dewitz, 2021) and Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) (Pengra et al., 2021), will be investigated and integrated into the ML models of the data production module. Additionally, more geoprocessing services, such as advanced raster calculation, time series analysis, and confidence layer comparison, will be integrated with the iCrop system in the next phase of development. 4.4. Future research recommendation The subsequent developments could be conducted based on the new cyberinformatics tool proposed in this study. For example, Yue et al. (2022) recently proposed a FAIR training data model specifically serving Earth observation AI/ML tasks. It is a promising GIS application to incorporate the training data model into iCrop’s geoprocessing services via the FAIR interface, which can potentially automate the crop-specific training sample selection and labeling process for the follow-up AI/ML model development in Earth observation research. Tekinerdogan and Verdouw (2020) and Verdouw et al. (2021) depict the conceptual frameworks for designing and implementing digital twins in agriculture. The iCrop’s data and web services have great potential to be integrated into such digital twin frameworks to advance smart agriculture. The another potential future research recommendation is to explore the possibility of integrating the in-season land cover data of iCrop with the geoscience model workflow through OGC standard interfaces to enable the capabilities of crop damage assessment. Many research topics in geoinformation science can be significantly facilitated using the new geospatial data of iCrop. Due to the insufficiency of ground truth data during the early growing season, iCrop’s national-scale crop cover data products can be used as reference data sets in various agro-geoinformation studies. For example, the national-scale crop yield can be progressively estimated using the pre- and in-season data within the growing season. The detailed crop loss due to natural disasters, such as floods, drought, and hurricanes, can be dynamically assessed using the monthly in-season crop cover maps. Moreover, we will optimize the crop type classification algorithm and test more AI/ML strategies to improve the mapping results. The zonal statistics function estimates the crop acreage by counting pixels in crop cover maps. This result could be biased because of the known data issues discussed above. Therefore, we will explore the feasibility of integrating the advanced crop yield estimation models and frameworks (Jeffries et al., 2020, Lin et al., 2020, Li et al., 2021, Andrade et al., 2022, Eamen et al., 2022, Nóia Júnior, 2022) into the system to optimize the statistics results. 5. Conclusion This paper introduced the design, implementation, and application of iCrop for the exploration of crop-specific land cover data in support of U.S. agriculture. Three types of new ML-based crop cover data products, pre-season crop cover, in-season crop cover, and R-CDL, were disseminated through this new cyberinformatics tool based on FAIR data principles. Improved from the service-oriented architecture of well-known CropScape, iCrop enabled interoperable mapping and geoprocessing capability of timely observation of crop-specific land cover through the easy-to-use web application and OGC standards-compliant GIS software. We demonstrated several common geoprocessing functionalities, including on-demand file download, zonal statistics, and PDF map production, using the iCrop web client. Specifically, the change analysis function was applied to analyze the LULC change for the Kossuth County of Iowa between 2021 and 2022. Also, we tested the interoperability of the iCrop web service using generic GIS software, such as QGIS, and web-based GIS platforms, such as FGDC’s GeoPlatform based on ArcGIS Online. The result suggested that the proposed cyberinformatics tool can efficiently and effectively provide timely agricultural LULC information to facilitate U.S. agricultural information management and decision support.

Unfortunately, this approach is not applicable for IM under asymmetric information (ASI), i.e., when “private” information regarding sectoral/regional models is not available, or it cannot be shared by modeling teams (sectoral agencies). The lack of common information about LP submodels makes LP methods inapplicable for integrated LP modeling. The aim of this paper is to develop a new approach to link and optimize distributed sectoral/regional optimization models, providing a means of decentralized cross-sectoral coordination in the situation of ASI. Thus, the linkage methodology enables the investigation of policies in interdependent systems in a “decentralized” fashion. For linkage, the sectoral/regional models do not need recoding or reprogramming. They also do not require additional data harmonization tasks. Instead, they solve their LP submodels independently and in parallel by a specific iterative subgradient algorithm for nonsmooth optimization. The submodels continue to be the same separate LP models. A social planner (regulatory agency) only needs to adjust the joint resource constraints to simple subgradient changes calculated by the algorithm. The approach enables more stable and resilient systems’ performance and resource allocation as compared to the independent policies designed by separate models without accounting for interdependencies. The paper illustrates the application of the methodology to link detailed energy and agricultural production planning models under joint constraints on water and land use.

Introduction The increasing interdependencies among food-energy-water-environmental (FEWE) sectors require integrated coherent planning and coordinated policies for sustainable development and security nexus. The sectors become more interconnected because they utilize common, often rather limited, resources, both natural (e.g., land, water, air quality) and socio-economic (e.g., investments, labor force). For example, land and water are needed not only for agricultural production but also for hydropower generation, coal mining and processing, power plants cooling, renewable energy, and hydrogen production. The energy sector is one of the largest and fast-growing water consumers. The more water is used by the energy sector, the more vulnerable energy production and production in other water-dependent sectors, becomes [1]. Climate change concerns and rapid energy sector transition towards renewable energy sources tighten the links between energy and agricultural markets. Agricultural commodities have become an important energy resource because of biofuels mandates. Vulnerability of crop yields, increasing grain demand, and price volatility directly and indirectly influence the market for fuel transportation and transportation costs [2]. At the same time, crude oil, gas, and electricity markets and prices have an effect on agricultural production costs and prices [2,3,4]. Additional linkages and interactions in FEWE systems emerge due to the introduction of new technologies, e.g., intermittent renewables, advanced irrigation, hydrogen production, water desalination, etc. The interdependencies can trigger systemic failures if sectoral policies ignore cross-sectoral interconnectedness [5]. The FEWE security nexus management requires an integrated approach to understand and deal with the numerous interactions between the FEWE systems [6]. This approach, compared to independent analysis, contributes immensely to sustainable development within and across sectors and scales. Comprehensive sectoral models are being developed for planning and policy assessment in respective sectors. These models account for multiple details of sectoral production planning and resource utilization, including the analysis of factors and drivers determining demand, supply, and commodity price relationships [7,8]. For example, energy sector models investigate the interactions between renewables and fossil fuels, address energy market volatilities, and analyze the effects of new technologies and policy interventions to develop energy scenarios [7,8,9,10,11,12]. Land use and agricultural models support decision making regarding agricultural policies, analyze land potentials for the production of sufficient agricultural commodities to fulfill food security and biofuels mandates [13,14,15], and assess the effects of policy responses, including export bans and high export taxes, to cope with production shortfalls and offset increasing prices [2]. As a rule, these models consider and optimize sectoral goals accounting for respective production, demand, resource availability, and environmental quality constraints. Goals, production targets, resource demand, and quality in other sectors are hardly, if at all, accounted for. Thus, the limitation of the detailed sectoral models for FEWE security nexus lies in their restricted ability to consider dependencies and interactions beyond the defined sectoral system [2,3,12], e.g., cross-sectoral resource competition and joint production and demand relationships. Sectoral models cannot properly account for the objectives of a larger system. The feedbacks and interactions among FEWE systems are often analyzed through CGE (Computational General Equilibrium) and/or IAMs (Integrated Assessment models) [6]. These models, unfortunately, suffer from the lack of necessary details of sectoral models. They involve considerable simplifications and aggregations and, therefore, may not be sufficiently fit to provide insightful conclusions [16,17,18,19]. In this situation, the analysis of systemic regulations for FEWE security nexus can rely on distributed models’ optimization and linkage methods enabling the establishment of relationships and dialogues between separate models of FEWE systems for the analysis of coordinated solutions without requiring to share or reveal systems-specific information. In this paper, we consider the problem of linking sectoral and/or regional linear programming (LP) models into a cross-sectoral integrated model (IM) in the presence of joint constraints when “private” information regarding sectoral/regional models’ is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams (sectoral agencies), i.e., under asymmetric information (ASI). Such linkage is necessary for producing truly integrative management scenarios, especially when sectors utilize and compete for common resources or act under joint regulatory constraints or environmental mandates. The approach provides a means of decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and enables the investigation of policies in interdependent systems in a “decentralized” fashion. This facilitates more stable and resilient systems’ performance and resource allocation as compared to the independent policies designed by separate models without accounting for interdependencies. Cross-sectoral policy analysis in the presence of joint constraints can be addressed, e.g., with the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) approach [20]. Böhringer and Rutherford (2009) [21] consider linking energy system mathematical programming models into a general equilibrium (GE) model of the overall economy. Ermoliev and von Winterfeldt (2012) [22] discuss the game-theoretic approaches, e.g., the Stackelberg leadership model, and their complexity due to the assumptions that each player (sector/region) has information about other players’ goals and constraints. Traditional integrated deterministic optimization modeling also assumes full knowledge about the systems. It incorporates goals, individual and joint constraints, and data of all systems into a single code (hard integration), which can be considered as a multi-criteria optimization problem [23]. Our approach for linking separate optimization models under ASI is based on the parallel solving of equivalent nonsmooth optimization models by a simple iterative stochastic quasigradient (SQG) procedure [24,25] based on subgradients or generalised gradients [25,26,27] converging to an optimal welfare-maximizing linkage solution, i.e., to the solution of a “hard-integrated” model. This approach does not require sharing details about models’ specifications. We can assume there is a network of distributed computers connecting computer models of a “social planner” (decision-makers or regulatory agencies), who attempt to achieve the best result for all sectors/regions (parties) involved. The linkage procedure can be interpreted as a kind of a “decentralized market system” [28]. According to this procedure, sectors/regions independently and in parallel optimize their goal functions under individual constraints without considering joint constraints. In general, joint constraints impose restrictions on total production, resource use, and emissions by all sectors/regions. The constraints can establish supply–demand relationships between the systems enabling the estimation of optimal production, resource use, and emission quotas for each system. The balance between the total energy (including biofuels) production and demand defines energy security; agricultural production and consumption reflect food security; total emissions and pollution constraints correspond to environmental security. The joint FEWE constraints satisfaction establishes the FEWE security nexus [29]. After independent optimization using initial approximations of various (e.g., production, resource use, emission) quotas, the sectors/regions provide the social planner with the information on their actual production, resource use, and respective shadow prices. The planner checks if the joint constraints are fulfilled. If not, i.e., there is “excess demand” or “excess supply” (i.e., total resource use, production, emissions by all systems are higher/lower than required), the planner revises the individual systems’ quotas via shifting their current approximation in the direction defined by the corresponding dual variables. Thus, shadow prices signal systems to adjust their activities accordingly. Formally, the procedure is described in Section 2.3 and Appendix A. In this way, the linkage allows us to avoid the “hard linking” of models in a single code, which is not possible because the systems do not want to share the information or because the individual models are too detailed and complex to be “hard-linked”. The approach saves reprogramming efforts and allows parallel distributed (decentralized) computations of sectoral models instead of a large-scale integrated (centralized) model. This also preserves the original models in their initial state for other linkages. The use of detailed sectoral and regional models instead of their aggregated simplified versions also enables us to account for critically important local details. Similar computerized decentralized “negotiation” processes between distributed models (agents) have been developed for the design of robust carbon trading markets (e.g., [30] and references therein) and for the allocation of water quotas (e.g., [31]). The linkage procedure can be considered as a new machine learning algorithm, namely, as a general endogenous reinforced learning problem of how software agents (models) take decisions in order to maximize the cumulative reward (total welfare) [32]. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the problem of models’ linkage under joint constraints. Section 2.1 presents a short overview and the main shortfalls of several existing approaches, Section 2.2. formulates the problem of distributed LP models’ linkage in the presence of joint resource constraints and ASI, and Section 2.3 outlines the linkage solution procedure based on the parallel solving of equivalent nonsmooth optimization model following a simple iterative subgradient algorithm. The details and main properties of the algorithms are presented in the Appendix A. Section 3 illustrates the application of the methodology to link detailed energy and agricultural production planning models under joint constraints on water and land use. In addition, the joint constraints can impose restrictions on total energy production by the energy sector (electricity, gas, diesel, etc.) and land use sector (biodiesel, methanol); total energy use by energy and agricultural sectors; total agricultural production by distributed farmers/regions, etc. Section 4 concludes and outlines potential further extensions of the approach, for example, to include more details of energy and natural resources dynamics in general. 2. Linking Distributed Optimization Models under Joint Resource Constraints 2.1. Social Equilibrium Game Approach In the absence of coordination between systems (sectors, regions), they can act selfishly and aim at maximizing their own objective function. They attempt to secure as high resource quotas as possible. Such a situation can be modeled using the non-cooperative game-theoretic framework. For example, social equilibrium games [20] have been formulated to include joint constraints. The generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution, if it exists, allocates production and resources among systems (sectors/regions), fulfilling the joint constraint. However, the decisions are made independently, and collective efforts for managing common resources are ignored. Importantly, the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE, as well as a realistic large-scale implementation of this concept, cannot be guaranteed, as emphasized by Harker (1991) [20]. Moreover, in [20], it is highlighted that the GNE solutions set are rarely connected. Hence, a complete analysis of equilibriums, in this case, is a complex task, requiring additional assumptions. The analysis can become even more complex if the joint constraints are based on the equilibrium (optimality) conditions arising from the problem formulated in the form of a principal-agent game or a leader-follower Stackelberg game [22]. For example, in the case of nonsmooth goal functions required for linking systems under ASI (distributed models’ optimization), the use of optimality conditions would require implicit sets of generalized gradients. Due to the computational complexity, heuristic methods are often used; however, they lack rigorous convergence proof. Linking bottom-up mathematical programming models of the energy system into a top-down general equilibrium model of the overall economy is discussed by Böhringer and Rutherford in [21]. The paper shows that the formulation of market equilibrium conditions using complementarity equations permit the integration of models, but the convergence of the iterative procedure integrating the models cannot be guaranteed. In specific cases, models of general equilibrium are reduced to optimization problems [33]. Ermoliev and von Winterfeldt (2012) [3] demonstrate that the complexity of the game-theoretic approaches is due to quite unrealistic assumptions that each player (sector/region) is in possession of the knowledge on exact and unique responses of other players. Therefore, even in the simplest linear cases, this assumption leads to extremely complex discontinuous problems. More realistic assumptions of uncertain response functions in combination with a concept of robust decisions results in stable large-scale solutions. There exists a vast literature on important problems and methods for distributed systems’ optimization under joint constraints, e.g., optimal control and economic dispatch in smart grids [34], agricultural production planning for the multi-farmer systems [35], network optimization [36,37,38], and optimal transportation problems [39,40,41]. Yet, these approaches consider the optimization of a total objective function representing a sum of individual objective functions of the involved systems. Thus, the problems assume full information regarding the systems is available to a social planner. They are formulated similarly to traditional integrated “centralized” optimization modeling, combining goals, constraints, and data of all models into a single code. Our problem is more complex as it deals with the coordination of decentralized systems’ models in the presence of joint constraints and ASI. In this case, the approach is based on a specific iterative nonsmooth optimization procedure (see Section 2.2 and Section 2.3 and Appendix A). As we noted, the integrated solution of separate LP models under ASI cannot be accomplished by LP methods. In Section 2.2, we formulate the problem of distributed systems optimization in the presence of joint resource constraints under ASI, and in Section 2.3, we present the models’ linkage algorithm. 2.2. LP Models under Joint Constraints Let us formulate the basic problem of separate sectoral or regional LP models optimization under joint resource constraints. Consider separate models of 𝐾 systems in the following LP form: 〈 𝑐 (𝑘) , 𝑥 (𝑘) 〉→𝑚𝑎𝑥 (1) 𝑥 (𝑘) ≥0 (2) 𝐴 (𝑘) 𝑥 (𝑘) ≤ 𝑏 (𝑘) (3) where components of vector 𝑥 (𝑘) are variables to be determined, vector 𝑏 (𝑘) defines system-specific demand or resource constraints, and vector 𝑐 (𝑘) corresponds to net unit profits, 𝑘=1,2,…,𝐾 . The dependence of system 𝑘 on common resources are defined by constraint (4) 𝐵 (𝑘) 𝑥 (𝑘) ≤ 𝑦 (𝑘) (4) where 𝑦 (𝑘) defines resource quota allocated to system 𝑘 . Therefore, Formula (3) represents system-specific constraints and Formula (4) establishes systemic relations among systems by allocating quotas 𝑦 (𝑘) . The quotas 𝑦 (𝑘) fulfil the joint resource constraint on the use of common resources ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝐷 (𝑘) 𝑦 (𝑘) ≤𝑑, (5) where matrix 𝐷 (𝑘) defines the marginal resource use by system 𝑘 and 𝑑 is the total available resource, 𝑑≥0 . Thus, each system 𝑘 maximizes its objective function (1) by choosing 𝑥 (𝑘) and 𝑦 (𝑘) from the feasible set defined by (2) and (3), so that (4) and (5) are also fulfilled. In the presence of full information regarding a system, the problem of models’ linkage can be formulated and solved by a central planner (regulator) as a total net profit maximization ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 〈 𝑐 (𝑘) , 𝑥 (𝑘) 〉→𝑚𝑎𝑥 (6) s.t. to constraints (2)–(5), 𝑘=1,2,…,𝐾 . In this model, the net profits are defined as the amount of money left after subtracting production costs from the total profit. In a more general case, the net profits can account for taxes, interest, and other expenses. However, when the information on 𝑏 (𝑘) , 𝑐 (𝑘) , 𝐴 (𝑘) , 𝐵 (𝑘) , 𝑥 (𝑘) of system 𝑘 is not available to the planner, the integrated LP model (2)–(6) under ASI cannot be solved by LP method due to the lack of common information about submodels. We propose the consistent approach for linking distributed optimization models under ASI based on the parallel solving of equivalent nonsmooth optimization models following a simple iterative subgradient algorithm. The convergence and other properties of the algorithm are presented in Appendix A. The proposed linkage approach does not require full, common information regarding the models’ specification, and it can be seen as an endogenous reinforced learning algorithm describing how distributed agents (models) can make decisions to maximize the “cumulative reward”. Section 2.3. outlines the algorithm. 2.3. Nonsmooth Model and Linking Algorithm The basic nonsmooth optimization model under ASI can be solved by a specific iterative subgradient linkage algorithm. For a given vector 𝑦=( 𝑦 (1) ,…, 𝑦 (𝐾) ) let us denote by 𝐹(𝑦) the optimal value of function (6) under constraints (2)–(4). Therefore, 𝐹(𝑦)= ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑦) , where 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑦)=( 𝑐 (𝑘) ,( 𝑥 (𝑘) (𝑦)) are concave nonsmooth functions. In this function 𝑥 (𝑘) (𝑦) are optimal solutions of (1)–(4). The required linkage algorithm is defined as a subgradient procedure maximizing function 𝐹(𝑦) s.t. the joint constraints (5). These constraints identify the feasible set of the algorithm, which can be denoted as 𝑌 . Therefore, an optimal solution maximizing 𝐹(𝑦) , 𝑦∈𝑌 , also defines an optimal linkage or a solution of the integrated LP model under ASI. In the following, we assume the existence of solutions 𝑥 (𝑘) (𝑦) , 𝑦∈𝑌 , for all 𝑘 . The linkage algorithm can be summarized as follows. Imagine there is a network of distributed computers connecting submodels, say sectors, with a computer of a social planner. At the initial step, sectors 𝑘 , 𝑘=1,…,𝐾 , use arbitrary chosen vectors 𝑦 0(𝑘) of resource quotas. They submit the information on 𝑦 0(𝑘) to the central computer. The computer updates quotas 𝑦 0 =( 𝑦 0(1) ,…, 𝑦 0(𝐾) ) by projecting them onto set 𝑌, defining a first feasible approximation 𝑦 1 =( 𝑦 1(1) ,…, 𝑦 1(𝐾) ). All sectors independently solve models (1)–(4) with resource quotas 𝑦 1 , calculate shadow prices 𝑣 1(𝑘) of common resources (constraint (4)), and submit them to the central computer. The central computer calculates 𝑦 1 + 𝜌 1 𝑣 1 with a step-size 𝜌 1 such that the product 𝜌 1 𝑣 1 corresponds to the scale of 𝑦 1 . Vector 𝑦 1 + 𝜌 1 𝑣 1 is projected onto 𝑌 to derive quotas 𝑦 2 . At the iteration 𝑠+1, the algorithm derives the next approximation of quotas 𝑦 𝑠+1 =( 𝑦 𝑠+1(1) ,…, 𝑦 𝑠+1(𝐾) ) by shifting 𝑦 𝑠 in the direction of vector 𝑣 𝑠 =( 𝑣 𝑠(1) ,…, 𝑣 𝑠(𝐾) ) , according to the following procedure. 𝑦 𝑠+1 = 𝜋 𝑌 ( 𝑦 𝑠 + 𝜌 𝑠 𝑣 𝑠 ), 𝑠=1,2,…, (7) where 𝜌 𝑠 is a step-dependent multiplier, which is a method’s parameter, 𝜋 𝑌 (⋅) is the orthogonal projection operator onto set 𝑌 defined by (5). Vector 𝑣 𝑠 is a generalized gradient or a subgradient of function 𝐹(𝑦) at 𝑦= 𝑦 𝑠 . The step-size 𝜌 𝑠 is chosen from rather general and natural requirements: 𝜌 𝑠 ≥0 , 𝜌 𝑠 →0 , ∑ ∞ 𝑠=1 𝜌 𝑠 =∞ , (e.g., 𝜌 𝑠 =1/𝑠) , because subgradients (generalized gradients) are not, in general, the increasing directions of functions. At each iteration, all sectors independently calculate stopping criteria 𝜀 𝑘 (𝑠)=( 𝑏 (𝑘) , 𝑢 𝑠(𝑘) ( 𝑦 𝑠 ))+( 𝑦 𝑠(𝑘) , 𝑣 𝑠(𝑘) ( 𝑦 𝑠 ))− 𝑤 𝑘 ( 𝑐 (𝑘) , 𝑥 𝑠(𝑘) ( 𝑦 𝑠 )) and submit values 𝜀 𝑘 (𝑠) to the central computer. If ∑ 𝑘 𝜀 𝑘 (𝑠)≤𝜀≥0 , where 𝜀 is an admissible accuracy, then the algorithm stops. Otherwise, it continues further. The convergence theorem shows that the parallel independent optimization (linkage) of sectoral/regional models according to this algorithm without revealing sectoral/regional information is possible due to the additional requirement ∑ 𝑠 𝜌 2 𝑠 <∞ . This allows us to prove the convergence of solutions (linkages) 𝑦 𝑠 rather than the convergence of objective function 𝐹( 𝑦 𝑠 ) . The convergence of the proposed linkage algorithm under ASI is based on the theory of (continuously) non-differentiable optimization. The details of convergence theorem, stopping criterion, subgradients, and computing projections can be found in Appendix A. 3. Linking Energy and Agricultural Models for Food-Energy-Water Nexus The proposed iterative algorithm has been applied for linking energy and agricultural sectoral models under joint constraints on water and land use. Both models can be used for optimal energy and agricultural production and allocation planning. In the following, we only briefly outline the models. Further details can be found, for example, in [9,10,11,13,14,15]. The models are spatially explicit, which allows us to link the models across locations and thus control local drivers having significant implications on the overall results of models’ integration. The energy model incorporates the main stages of energy flows from resources to demands: energy extraction from energy resources, primary energy conversion into secondary energy forms, transport and distribution of energy to the point of end, and conversion into products for end-users to fulfill specific demands. The structure of the model is such that it can incorporate various energy resources, e.g., coal, gas, crude oil, renewables. Primary energy sources include coal, crude oil, gas, solar, wind, etc.; secondary energy sources are fuel oil, methanol, hydrogen, electricity, ammonia, etc.; final energy products are coal, fuel oil, gas, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, electricity, etc. Demands for useful energy products come from main sectors of the economy: industrial, residential, transport, agricultural, water, and energy. Each technology is characterized by uniting costs, efficiency, lifetime, emissions, etc. Additional sectoral (and cross-sectoral joint) constraints are imposed to capture the requirements and the limitations on natural resource use and availability and investments. The model can include existing technologies, as well as new zero-carbon green technologies, at the beginning of implementation or even in the research stage, e.g., various renewable and carbon-capturing technologies. The agricultural model includes main crops and livestock production and management systems, characterized by systems-specific production costs, water and fertilizer requirements, emission factors, and other parameters. The supply of crops and livestock products need to cover food, feed, and biofuel demands and fulfill security constraints. The food security constraint requires that the energy and nutrients consumption from grain and livestock products is not less than the required kilocalories and nutrients needed to satisfy dietary requirements in cereals, vegetables, and animal products (meat and dairy products). Livestock feeds fulfill livestock dietary requirements in energy intake measured in megacalories. Biofuel production from crops (and agricultural residues) must fulfill biofuel mandates. In the model, land uses comprise agricultural (crop and pasture) land, grassland, and natural land. Land use changes can be regulated by setting regulatory constraints on land expansion and conversion. Security constraints introduce competition for limited natural resources (land and water) among different land uses. Energy and agricultural sectors compete for common land and water resources. Assume that regional planners, decision makers, and sectoral authorities pursue a goal to minimize costs and maximize profits from energy and agricultural production under various joint balance (supply-demand) and resource constraints to fulfill the energy and agricultural demands. Namely, the goal is to choose a portfolio of energy technologies to be installed and operated to produce, convert, and transfer energy products among locations; and a portfolio of agricultural technologies and management systems to produce and transfer among locations agricultural commodities fulfilling constraints on natural resources, environmental pollution, and end-product demands. The models include relevant risk-related systems’ performance criteria. These performance measures enable a better understanding of how systems (individually and jointly) might perform in the uncertain environment, in the presence of climate change, weather variability, market uncertainties, etc. A better understanding of how interdependent energy-water-agricultural systems may operate and how dangerous impacts of inappropriate decisions may be can motivate regional and sectoral planners, experts, and involved stakeholders in making cross-sectoral coherent and risk-adjusted robust decisions [9,10,11,14,15,22,29]. 3.1. Energy, Water, and Agricultural Security Nexus in Shanxi Province, China In the case study in Shanxi province, China [15], the energy model includes coal-based industries and processes, i.e., mining, washing, chemical production, and power generation. Most of the electricity in China comes from coal, which accounted for approximately 65% of the electricity generation mix in 2019. The coal-based technologies consume a vast amount of water, for example, for coal mining and washing, coal power plants cooling and steam production. About 51% of China’s coal reserves lie in areas of high or extreme water scarcity, and about 30% are in water-stressed regions. Shanxi province is one of them. The integrated energy-agricultural-water model is formulated as follows. A regional planner decides on the amount of coal 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑚𝑡 and type 𝑖, 𝑖=1,…,𝐼 , to be extracted in location 𝑗, 𝑗=1,…,𝐽 , transported to location 𝑚 , 𝑚=1,…,𝑀 , and converted by technology 𝑡, 𝑡=1,…,𝑇 . In addition, decisions 𝑧 𝑘𝑗𝑚 are made concerning the amount of agricultural commodities k, 𝑘=1,…,𝐾, to be produced in location j and exported to location 𝑚 . The overall goal of the planner is to minimize the total costs related to energy (coal) and agricultural production, transportation, and conversion. Individual sectoral goal functions are formulated as follows ∑ 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘,𝑚,𝑡 [ 𝑐 𝐶𝑃 𝑖𝑗 + 𝑐 𝐶𝑇 𝑖𝑗𝑚 + 𝑐 𝐶𝐶 𝑖𝑗𝑡 ] 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 → 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (8) and ∑ 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘,𝑚,𝑡 [ 𝑐 𝐴𝑃 𝑘𝑗 + 𝑐 𝐴𝑇 𝑘𝑗 ] 𝑧 𝑘𝑗𝑚 → 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (9) for energy (8) and agricultural (9) sectors. Production costs 𝑐 𝐶𝑃 𝑖𝑗 define all components of coal production costs, including extraction and washing, of a unit (tonne) coal of type 𝑖 in location 𝑗 , transportation costs 𝑐 𝐶𝑇 𝑖𝑗𝑚 represent all costs associated with transporting unit coal 𝑖 from location 𝑗 to location 𝑚 , 𝑐 𝐶𝐶 𝑖𝑗𝑡 define conversion costs of a unit coal 𝑖 by technology 𝑡 in location 𝑗 , 𝑐 𝐴𝑃 𝑘𝑗 denote agricultural production cost per unit (tonne) agricultural commodity 𝑘 in location 𝑗 , and 𝑐 𝐴𝑇 𝑘𝑗𝑚 stands for the transportation costs of a unit agricultural commodity 𝑘 from 𝑗 to 𝑚 , 𝑖=1,…,𝐼;  𝑗=1,…,𝐽;𝑚=1,…,𝑀; 𝑡=1,…,𝑇; 𝑘=1,…,𝐾. The energy model includes energy security constraints ensuring consumers demands for end products from coal, for example, electricity, heat, coke, gas, and oil: ∑ 𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝛼 𝑑 𝑖𝑚𝑡 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 ≥ 𝐷 𝑑 𝑚 (10) where 𝛼 𝑑 𝑖𝑗𝑡 denotes the conversion efficiency of coal 𝑖 in location 𝑗 by technology 𝑡 , the end product 𝑑 , and 𝐷 𝑑 𝑗 stands for the end product 𝑑 demand. Agricultural production is required to fulfil food security constraints defined by the sufficient kilocalories and nutrients provided to the population from agricultural commodities k in location 𝑚 : ∑ 𝑗 𝑧 𝑘𝑗𝑚 ≥ 𝐷 𝐴 𝑘𝑚 (11) where 𝐷 𝐴 𝑘𝑚 is the required production of agricultural commodity 𝑘 in location m to meet food security requirements, which can be calculated according to daily nutrients and calories requirements per capita approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Sectoral land use constraints ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 (1− 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 )Δ 𝑙 𝑗 𝑆 𝑖𝑗 +𝑔 ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 ≤ 𝐿 𝐶 𝑗 (12) and ∑ 𝑘,𝑚 𝑙 𝑘𝑗 𝑧 𝑘𝑗𝑚 ≤ 𝐿 𝐴 𝑗 (13) incorporate land demand by coal (12) and crop (13) production activities, where 𝐿 𝐶 𝑗 and 𝐿 𝐴 𝑗 are land use constraints for coal and agricultural sectors in location 𝑗 , respectively. In Equation (12), parameter 𝑆 𝑖𝑗 defines the area that can deteriorate (e.g., subside) as a result of coal mining of unit coal 𝑖 in location 𝑗 , Δ 𝑙 𝑗 is a portion of agricultural land overlapping with a coal field in location 𝑗 , land reclamation rate (or efficiency rate) is defined by parameter 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 for coal 𝑖 in location 𝑗 , and 𝑔 𝑖𝑗 is a coal fraction that allows us to calculate the land under reject material. In Equation (13), parameter 𝑙 𝑘𝑗 defines the area required for a unit crop 𝑘 production in location 𝑗 . Equation (14) introduces the restriction on the total land use in location 𝑗 by energy and agricultural sectors ∑ 𝑘,𝑚 𝑙 𝑘𝑗 𝑦 𝑘𝑗𝑚 + ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 (1− 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 )Δ 𝑙 𝑗 𝑙 𝑖𝑗 + 𝑔 𝑖𝑗 ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 ≤ 𝐿 𝑗 (14) Total available water 𝑊 𝑗 for both sectors and sectoral water quotas ( 𝑊 𝐸 𝑗 and 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗 ) significantly affect the choice of coal and crop (energy) production technologies through water utilization constraints: ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 [ 𝑤 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 + 𝑤 𝑑 𝑖𝑗 ] 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 ≤ 𝑊 𝐸 𝑗 (15) and ∑ 𝑘,𝑚 𝑤 𝑐 𝑘𝑗 𝑧 𝑘𝑚𝑗 ≤ 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗 (16) where 𝑊 𝐸 𝑗 and 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗 are quotas on water use by coal and agricultural activities in location 𝑗 , 𝑤 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 defines water requirement for a unit coal 𝑖 production in location 𝑗 , 𝑤 𝑑 𝑖𝑗 is water required for a unit coal 𝑖 conversion in location 𝑗 , and 𝑤 𝑐 𝑘𝑚 is water required for a unit crop k production in location j. Water use 𝑊 𝐸 𝑗 for coal and 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗 for agricultural production are constrained by the total water 𝑊 𝑗 available in 𝑗 : 𝑊 𝐸 𝑗 + 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗  ≤ 𝑊 𝑗 (17) The models can be extended by including various other constraints, for example, water and air quality, SO2 and CO2 emissions targets, biofuel production mandates, etc. In the condition of ASI, the planner does not have full information regarding separate LP energy ((8), (10), (12) and (15)) and agricultural ((9), (11), (13) and (14)) submodels. To link the models under joint constraints (14) and (17) we implement procedure (7). Thus, at the initial step s = 0, individual sectoral models are solved using initial sectoral land and water quotas 𝐿 𝐶 𝑗 (0) , 𝐿 𝐴 𝑗 (0) and 𝑊 𝐶 𝑗 (0) , 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗 (0) . Resource quotas 𝑦 𝑠 =( 𝐿 𝐶 𝑗 (s) , 𝐿 𝐴 𝑗 (s),  𝑊 𝐶 𝑗 (s) , 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗 (s)) at step 𝑠 are adjusted according to (7) using shadow prices (dual variables) of energy and agricultural sectors land and water resource constraints ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 (1− 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 )Δ 𝑙 𝑗 𝑆 𝑖𝑗 +𝑔 ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 ≤ 𝐿 𝐶 𝑗 (𝑠−1) (18) ∑ 𝑘,𝑚 𝑙 𝑘𝑗 𝑦 𝑘𝑗𝑚 ≤ 𝐿 𝐴 𝑗 (𝑠−1) (19) ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑤 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 𝑥 𝑖𝑚𝑙𝑡 + ∑ 𝑖,𝑚,𝑡 𝑤 𝑑 𝑖𝑗 𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 ≤ 𝑊 𝐶 𝑗 (𝑠−1) (20) ∑ 𝑘,𝑚 𝑤 𝑐 𝑘𝑗 𝑦 𝑘𝑚𝑗 ≤ 𝑊 𝐴 𝑗 (𝑠−1) (21) and constraints (14) and (17). 3.2. Selected Results Results are compared for three cases: 1. Separately optimized energy and agricultural models; 2. The hard-linked integrated model (one-code model); 3. Separate models integrated via the linkage procedure (7). In case 1, the sectors are not restricted by joint resource constraints, and therefore the net profits can be higher than in cases 2 and 3; however, this is a misleading conclusion. In cases 2 and 3, results show that the iterative linkage process converges rather quickly. In 10 iterations, the optimal value of the integrated linked model (case 3) is almost equal to the optimal value of the integrated “hard-linked” model (case 2). In case 3, the proposed linkage algorithm allows to link models installed on remote computers through an iterative dialogue establishing optimal redistribution of water and land quotas among the sectors and locations. Figure 1 illustrate the non-monotonic convergence of the linkage algorithm for three different scenarios of initial 𝑦 0 quotas allocated to energy and agricultural sectors. The choice of the step-size 𝜌 𝑠 in (7) affects the convergence rate, the value of the product 𝜌 𝑠 𝜈 𝑠 must correspond to the value of solutions 𝑦 𝑠 . Figure 1. Convergence of the iterative linking procedure in terms of the goal function values 𝐹( 𝑦 𝑠 ) . Vertical axis displays net profits; the iteration step is marked on the horizontal axis. The three curves (Scen1, Scen2, Scen3) correspond to three different initial land and water quota scenarios at s = 0. 4. Conclusions In the paper, we consider the problem of linking separate distributed sectoral and/or regional optimization models into an inter-sectoral integrated model. The approach for linking models is based on an iterative algorithm that does not require models to exchange full information regarding their specifications. The resource quotas for each system and each resource are recalculated by systems independently and in parallel via shifting their current approximation in the direction defined by the corresponding dual variables from the primal sectoral optimization problem. In this way, the approach allows to avoid hard linking of the models in a single code that saves programming time and enables parallel distributed computations of sectoral models instead of a large-scale integrated model, i.e., addressing the well-known “curse of dimensionality” and large-scale data harmonization (management). This also preserves the original models in their initial state for other possible linkages. The proposed computational algorithm is based on an iterative stochastic quasigradient (SQG) procedure of, in general, nonsmooth nondifferentiable optimization converging to a socially optimal solution maximizing an implicit nested non-differentiable social welfare function. The convergence of the algorithm relies on the duality theory and non-differentiable optimization [20]. The iterative solution procedure can be used for robust estimation and machine learning problems. In particular, it can be viewed as an endogenous reinforced learning problem [32]. The iterative SQG-based methods and their stochastic versions are intended for the robust optimization of deterministic and stochastic systems with a large number of decision variables and scenarios of uncertainties due to the ability of these methods to link scenario-simulation and optimization procedures [42,43]. Therefore, the proposed method will be developed further for linking stochastic models enabling integrated management of global systemic risks, which are not detectable under traditional independent sectorial management ignoring cross-sectoral risk exposures. Fundamentally important to the possible extension of the presented method is the case of stochastic sectoral/regional models with interdependent systemic uncertainties and risks shaped by decisions of various agents. This includes the mitigation of floods by new land use decisions, for example, affecting flood scenarios. As a rule, this makes it impossible to separate scenario-generation and optimization processes calling for linking both simulation and optimization procedures in a way similar to algorithm (7), thus combining simulations of scenarios, new optimization steps, new simulation of scenarios, and so on. In this case, we can determine new types of machine learning processes. In the paper, we referred to linking regional and/or sectoral models. More generally, the problem can address the linkage of models at different spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g., local-global, considering more details of energy and natural resources dynamics in general). Therefore, the linkage problem can be formulated much more generally in terms of sub-models and integrated models, and the approach presented in this paper can still be applicable. The linkage of models is, in a sense, opposite to decomposition methods. While in the decomposition (e.g., [44,45]), we split an existing integrated optimization model into a number of smaller sub-models, in the linkage, we obtain an integrated model of the system by linking existing explicitly unknown sub-models. The proposed linkage procedure provides flexibility, enabling the simultaneous use of linkage and decomposition procedures, in other words, endogenously disaggregating models to make their further integration (linkage) more efficient.

Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest. Appendix A Appendix A.1. Convergence Proposition (stopping criterion, subgradients): Assume there exist solutions 𝑥 (𝑘) (𝑦) of all 𝐾 sectoral/regional models for feasible 𝑦 satisfying constraints (5). Then: (a) Functions 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑦)=( 𝑐 (𝑘) , 𝑥 (𝑘) (𝑦)) , 𝐹(𝑦)= ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑓 (𝑘) ( 𝑥 (𝑘) ) are continuously concave non-differentiable functions for all 𝑘 . (b) The dual problem to (1)–(3) has a solution ( 𝑢 (𝑘) (𝑦), 𝑣 (𝑘) (𝑦)) for all 𝑘 , and these solutions satisfy the stopping criterion of the linkage algorithm: 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑦)=( 𝑐 (𝑘) , 𝑥 (𝑦))=( 𝑏 (𝑘) , 𝑢 (𝑦))+(𝑦, 𝑣 (𝑦)). From this proposition follows the following important fact ([8,10,25]), which is fundamental for solving the linkage problem through maximizing non-differentiable function 𝐹(𝑦) using algorithm (7): (c) For any feasible solution 𝑧 and 𝑦 , 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑦)− 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑧)≥( 𝑣 (𝑘) (𝑦),𝑦−𝑧) , that is, 𝑣 (𝑘) (𝑦) is a subgradient of the concave non-differentiable function 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑦). Vector 𝑣(𝑦)=( 𝑣 (1) (𝑦),…, 𝑣 (𝐾) (𝑦)) is a subgradient of function 𝐹(𝑦)= ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑓 (𝑘) (𝑦) , 𝐹 𝑦 (𝑦)=𝑣(𝑦) , that is, 𝐹(𝑦)−𝐹(𝑧)≥(𝑣(𝑦),𝑦−𝑧) . Therefore, procedure (7) is a specific subgradient algorithm for maximizing the (continuously) non-differentiable concave function 𝐹(𝑦) . The following proposition shows that 𝑦 𝑠 converges to an optimal linking vector 𝑦 ∗ , maximizing 𝐹(𝑦) subject to joint constraints (5). Let us denote this feasible set by 𝑌 . Appendix A.2. Convergence Theorem (Non-Monotonic Convergence) Assume that (1) The feasible set 𝑌 is bounded; (2) Step size 𝜌 𝑠 satisfies the conditions: 𝜌 𝑠 ≥0 , ∑ ∞ 𝑠=1 𝜌 𝑠 =∞ , ∑ ∞ 𝑠=1 𝜌 2 𝑠 <∞ , say 𝑝 𝑠 =1/𝑠 . Then 𝑙𝑖𝑚  𝑦 𝑠 ∈ 𝑌 ∗ for 𝑠→∞ . The following sequence of 𝜌 𝑠 satisfies the conditions of the theorem: 𝜌 𝑠 = 𝛾 𝑠 /𝑠 , 0≤ 𝛾      ≤ 𝛾 𝑠 ≤ 𝛾      <∞ for some positive constants 𝛾      and 𝛾      . Appendix A.3. Computing the Projection The orthogonal projection 𝑦 𝑠+1 of vector 𝑦 ¯ 𝑠 = 𝑦 𝑠 + 𝜌 𝑠 𝑣 𝑠 onto 𝑌 is calculated by minimizing the quadratic function ∥ 𝑦 𝑠 + 𝜌 𝑠 𝑣 𝑠 − 𝑦∥ 2 subject to joint constraints (5). This minimization is very fast due to 𝜌 𝑠 𝜈 𝑠 →0 , as vectors 𝑣 𝑠 are bounded optimal dual solutions, and if 𝑦 𝑠 is used as an initial approximation for 𝑦 𝑠+1 . Appendix A.4. Mixed Constraints Joint constraints (5) may have the following form: ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝑀 (𝑘) 𝑥 (𝑘) + ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝐷 (𝑘) 𝑦 (𝑘) ≤𝛿 (A1) with some matrices 𝑀 (𝑘) . Yet, problem (1)–(4) s.t. (A1) can be reformulated similar to problem (1)–(5). Let us define vectors 𝑦 (𝐾+𝑘) such that 𝑀 (𝑘) 𝑥 (𝑘) = 𝑦 (𝐾+𝑘) , 𝑘=1,…,𝐾. Now it is possible to rewrite (A1) as ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝐷 (𝑘) 𝑦 (𝑘) ≤𝛿− ∑ 2𝐾 𝑘=𝑘+1 𝑦 (𝑘) and after some renotation, derive the problem in the form (1)–(5). References Carter, N.

The IoT is a network of heterogeneous digital devices embedded with sensors and software for various automation and monitoring purposes. A Blockchain Network is a broadcast network of computing nodes provisioned for validating digital transactions and recording the “well-formed” transactions in a unique data storage called a blockchain ledger. The power of a blockchain network is that (ideally) every node maintains its own copy of the ledger and takes part in validating the transactions. Integrating IoT and BCNs brings promising applications in many areas, including education, health, finance, agriculture, industry, and the environment. However, the complex, dynamic and heterogeneous computing and communication needs of IoT technologies, optionally integrated by blockchain technologies (if mandated), draw several challenges on scaling, interoperability, and security goals. In recent years, numerous models integrating IoT with blockchain networks have been proposed, tested, and deployed for businesses. Numerous studies are underway to uncover the applications of IoT and Blockchain technology. However, a close look reveals that very few applications successfully cater to the security needs of an enterprise. Needless to say, it makes less sense to integrate blockchain technology with an existing IoT that can serve the security need of an enterprise. In this article, we investigate several frameworks for IoT operations, the applicability of integrating them with blockchain technology, and due security considerations that the security personnel must make during the deployment and operations of IoT and BCN. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying security concerns and recommendations for blockchain-integrated IoT networks.

Introduction With the advent of the world wide web (WWW) by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, the Internet morphed into an integral part of most life affairs, including education, communication, and business worldwide. Technologies such as a webcam—a small device to capture pictures—connected to the Internet have been evolving. The expansion of the Internet also gave way to new computing paradigms, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. These two technologies have revolutionized the personal computing that began in the late 1970s (https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer (accessed on 14 June 2022)). The Trojan Room coffee pot–the first webcam connected to the Internet – can be considered an earlier instance of the IoT. Today, smartwatches and hearing aids, among others, are popular IoT technologies. Similar technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID), and embedded electronic measuring devices such as thermostats, pressure gauges, glucose sensors, electrocardiography (EKG), electroencephalography (EEG), and sonar sensors, among others, saw their compelling applications when connected to the Internet. The actual term “internet of Things”, however, was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashthon during his work at Procter & Gamble (https://bit.ly/2K5hUgH (accessed on 25 July 2022)). The term eventually captured widespread attention in the following decades. IoT gained momentum in real-time sensing, effective information exchange, reduced cost and energy, and improved work efficiency/productivity. In 2008, the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) introduced the concept of a “Smart Planet”. It intends to employ massive IoTs to harvest IoT’s benefits [1]. A similar concept of “smart city” is about the use of IoT to automate operations (for example, sensing, automating, and monitoring) around public facilities such as buildings, public transit systems (including buses, subways, light rail, commuter rail, trolleys, and ferries), streets installations (lamps, traffic lights, notice boards, billboards), hospitals, schools, public offices, among others inside the city premises [2]. An integral part of a “smart city” is the “smart home”, which is about controlling and monitoring home appliances for audio, video, lighting, cooking, cooling, heating, surveillance, freezing, and power, among others [1] through the Internet applications. The idea of integrating IoT has been expanding to the areas of self-driving technologies (SDTs). Google, for instance, ventured into developing self-driving technology (SDT) at the Google X lab in 2009. In 2020, Alibaba-funded start-up—AutoX—launched fully driverless RoboTaxi in Shanghai, China (https://bbc.in/3iVFCmc (accessed on 14 June 2022)). Researchers are striving to enhance the safety and effectiveness of driverless technologies to operate in complex, dynamic environments. During the recent decade, IoT has been increasingly adopted in personal and public health [2,3], home [4], agriculture and forestry [5,6,7], climate and meteorological studies [8], among others. In Section 3, we will briefly discuss IoT applications grouped into seven different categories of IoT systems. In the following section, let us briefly discuss the motivation and contribution of this article. Motivation and Contribution According to IoT Analytics (https://bit.ly/3XPS99p (accessed on 30 December 2022)), the number of IoT devices grew by 9% to reach 12.3 B globally in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed IoT adoption in the workplace, education, and public services. It also reported that the predicted number of connected IoT devices will reach 27B by 2025. By 2025, IoT will produce (estimated) 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) (~79 × 10 12 GB) of data. By the same year, the economic impact of IoT will reach (estimated) 11 trillion dollars (https://bit.ly/3iXjRCy (accessed on 14 June 2022)). In the meantime, 58% of cyberattacks occurred over IoT devices. Those attacks mainly were DDoS attacks and pilfering of confidential data. More than 1.5 B security breaches occurred over IoT in 2021 alone. While 64% global organizations use one or more IoT solutions, 43% do not protect them adequately (https://bit.ly/3D4vQoP (accessed on 14 May 2022)). The extent of growth and adoption of IoT is astounding. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime expected costs to grow by 15 percent per year over the next five years, reaching USD 10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015 (https://bit.ly/3iT3sPz (accessed on 14 June 2022)). According to IBM data breach report 2021 (https://ibm.co/3XMOrxv (accessed on 15 June 2022)), the average total cost of a data breach increased by nearly 10% ($3.86 M in 2020, $4.24 M in 2021) year over year, the most significant single-year cost increase in the last seven years. However, due to a deficiency of security knowledge applicable during deploying the IoT, harvesting data from IoT, and consuming the IoT data or services, the fate of the life and properties are at higher stake than ever [9]. On the other hand, blockchain technology [10,11,12], yet another popular technology that operates on top of the Internet, has been adopted as a revolutionary technology for “trustless“ transaction verification and process automation. Popular blockchain frameworks such as Bitcoin [13] and Ethereum [14] have been increasingly utilized for payment for online transactions and transferring money between user accounts without the need for participating banks or credit card companies. It also tracks food, prescription drugs, and airline engine parts. As per Gartner (https://bit.ly/3HlZacF (accessed on 25 July 2022)), the value of blockchain would be 3.1 trillion in business by 2030. In light of evolving technologies such as IoT and blockchain, this paper draws together the notion of IoT ecosystems and their existing and potential integration with blockchain technologies. This paper will discuss the overall desired security assurances in explaining the security challenges of two emerging technologies. Specifically, this paper: precisely defines and exemplifies IoT, blockchain technology-related, and relevant security terminologies. examines the importance of IoT and Blockchain security as evolving technologies. explains the challenges of IoT and Blockchain integration. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the general architecture of an IoT network. Section 3 discusses the major applications of IoT. Section 4 exemplifies the types and applications of blockchain networks. Section 5 outlines the research methodologies. Section 6 explains the security assurances applicable to the IoT. The same section discusses the security threats of IoT. In Section 7, we explore the integration of IoT and blockchain technology. Section 8 discusses the significant challenges of IoT and blockchain integration. Section 9 discusses the ways we can address the challenges of IoT and blockchain integration. We conclude the paper with a conclusion and an outlook in Section 10. 2. Architecture of IoT Several previous works discuss the architecture of IoT systems. Bayılmış et al. [15] discuss a six-layer IoT protocol stack. An article by Lao et al. [16] explains three- and five-layered architecture. Ray [17] examines IoT architectures for domains such as health care, smart society, and security. There are other efforts from commercial and standardization bodies to define and describe IoT architectures. For instance, the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) was jointly proposed by AT&T, Cisco, General Electric, IBM, and Intel [9]. The IoT-A FP7 project produced the Internet of Things Architecture(IoT-A) proposed the Reference Architecture (IIRA) (2017). The International Standardization Organization (ISO) proposed the ISO Internet of Things Reference Architecture (IoT RA—ISO/IEC WD 30141) in 2018. The IEEE P2413 WG proposed the IEEE Standard for an Architectural Framework for the Internet of Things [18]. This work, however, outlines simple four-layered IoT network architecture as depicted in Figure 1 (Left). Figure 1. (Left) The general architecture of an IoT system consists of four major layers. The user commands and data from sensors become exchanged through the gateway layer. (Right) Popular instances of devices, protocols, or services in each layer of an IoT network. Discussion of the protocols and services is out of the scope of this article. 2.1. Sensor Layer The sensor layer is composed of sensors and/or actuators. Sensors (or actuators) are low-powered, resource-constrained sensing and acting devices. Figure 2 shows the internal components of a sensor. Each sensor is uniquely identified by its ID or IEEE/MAC addresses. They may be connected with high-powered devices known as a relay or coordinate devices. A network of sensor devices forms a sensor network that may utilize low-power sensor network protocols such as radio-frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), ZigBee, 802.14, ANT, Bluetooth, among others [16,17]. Figure 2. Major internal components of a sensor or an actuator. The component ADC stands for analog-to-digital converter, which converts an analog signal to a digital signal and vice-versa. TxRx stands for transceiver, which transmits and receives data from processor storage. Sensor layers may contain one or more special devices called routers in the gateway layer. Routers help extend network coverage, avoid network obstacles, and provide routes in case of network congestion or device failure. They may be connected to the network coordinator and other routers. However, in a distributed sensor network, there may be more than one network coordinator responsible for adding child nodes and authenticating them. The topology of a sensor network in sensor layers may be (i) star, (ii) mesh, and (iii) hybrid network [19]. 2.2. Gateway Layer In a typical IoT ecosystem, the gateway layer consists of the particular devices responsible for registering sensor nodes, authenticating nodes, broadcasting commands, and receiving, and aggregating data from the sensors [20,21]. These devices may relay data to cloud storage engines. In a Zigbee protocol [18], for example, specific nodes known as ZigBee coordinators function in the gateway layer. Because the devices in this layer operate to bridge the external sink layer with the sensor layer, this layer is also called the bridge layer. In this layer, the devices such as embedded operating systems (OS) and real-time OS, among others, operate using diverse communication standards such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM/2G), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS/3G), RF, LoRA, ANT, ISM, WiMAX, WiFi, Sigfox, Ethernet, among others [17]. The gateway devices may connect to the Internet using network-layer protocols such as IPV4 or IPV6. 2.3. IoT Sink Layer The sink layer provides services such as storing data, encryption, decryption, data format standardization, data processing, and service management to various applications (clients) specific to the business and industry [18]. The storage devices/services may be located locally close to the gateway layer or in the cloud containing cloud storage engines (https://bit.ly/3D5eqbC (accessed on 30 December 2022)) (for example, Amazon AWS, Google, Dropbox, Alibaba, Tencent, etc.) and data exchange services. Some popular onsite storage engines for IoT data are InfluxDB, CreateDB, Riak TS, MongoDB, RethinkDB, and Cassandra, among other (https://www.intuz.com/guide-on-top-iot-databases (accessed on 11 July 2022)). 2.4. IoT Application, Visualization, Command, and Control Layer This layer of an IoT is an abstraction of services required for monitoring IoT devices, visualization, and analysis of IoT data, as well as command and control of IoT devices in the Sensor layer, among others. It may provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to retrieve IoT data and send commands to IoT devices for business operations. IoT application layer protocols (https://bit.ly/3J5zGSh (accessed on 10 July 2022)) depend on several factors, such as data latency, reliability, and bandwidth, among others. Some of the popular application layer protocols specific to IoT systems are Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Extensible Message and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational State Transfer (REST), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Simple or Streaming Text Oriented Message Protocol (STOMP), Simple Media Control Protocol (SMCP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), among others [15,18]. 3. Applications and Categories of IoTs IoT has been utilized in various areas, from home to health, education, and agriculture industries. As an introduction, we highlighted the coarse evolutionary events of IoTs and different use cases. However, in this section, we instantiate major applications of IoTs under seven categories. (1) Climate and Environmental (Aquatic/Terrestrial) IoT: Environmental IoTs are composed of sensors employed for different purposes, such as detecting pathogens, chemicals, gas, temperature, and(or) other variables in an environment, such as land or water bodies [21]. For instance, regulatory bodies such as Environment Protection Agency (EPA) often employ IoT to monitor the risk factors that affect human and environmental health. Similarly, industries based on land and water resources have benefited from the IoTs for various business needs. For instance, climate and environmental IoTs have been used for real-time monitoring and forecasting of weather, and climatic conditions in an area [8]. (2) Forest and Agricultural IoT: Applying IoTs has proved profitable in forestry, and crop/animal farming [5,22,23]. Chiefly, IoT systems have been used for managing and monitoring several aspects of farming, such as irrigation, pest control, weed control, and crop density monitoring, among others. (3) Industrial IoT: The use of IoTs has been profitable in industries of varying kinds, such as hospitals [2], manufacturing industries, and retail and whole-shale markets, among others. Everyday use cases of an industrial IoT include remote condition monitoring, digital work instructions, predictive mainteisce, and disaster management. Using industrial IoTs brings several benefits, such as maximizing revenue, reducing time to market, and lowering operational costs. (4) Smart Home IoT An IoT find(s) is one of its most popular applications inside a home setting. Automating lighting, sound, and kitchen work such as cooking and washing are automated by using different connected devices. Controlling and maintaining home climate can also be performed effectively using sensors such as thermostats [1,4,21]. (5) Wearable IoT: Wearable IoT comprises wearable technologies such as Fitbit, Holter monitor, personal alarm devices, smartwatches, etc. The sensing devices have become so small that they have been integrated into normal clothing items such as bras or vests, caps, shoes, and travel/school backpacks [21,24,25]. Wearable IoT has helped monitor personal health and supports remote health services [3]. (6) Smart City IoT: Smart city IoTs are an extended version of the smart home IoT [1]. It comprises many sensor technologies to sense an urban environment, streets, highways, traffic, and vehicle mobility. Smart retail shopping, intelligent health services, and smart parking are also an integral part of a smart city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city (accessed on 22 July 2022)) [4]. (7) Vehicular IoT: Vehicular IoT can be considered one of the components of a smart city IoT. Sensors that collect data from terrestrial and aerial vehicular devices constitute vehicular IoT. The data may be helpful to route the vehicular devices efficiently or may be helpful to collect environmental data such as temperature and humidity. For instance, United Parcel Service (UPS), a shipping company, deploys sensors in its transport vehicles to collect data such as mileage, speed, fuel cost, etc., for big data analysis [26,27]. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) also use different sensor data to optimize their route and operations to support “collaborative autonomous driving, and advanced transportation [28]”. 4. Blockchain Technology It is imperative to comprehend the components of the technology to understand the value that blockchain technology brings to the realm of IoT ecosystems. The major components of blockchain technology are (i) blockchain, (ii) blockchain networks, and (iii) distributed consensus mechanism [16]. In this section, we explain the working principle of blockchain technology and the types and features of blockchain networks. 4.1. Overview of Blockchain Network As the name suggests, a blockchain network (BCN) [29] is a broad-cast network of computing nodes that maintain a copy of a synchronized storage known as a blockchain ledger. The nodes in a blockchain network operate to persistently maintain data consistency through resistance to retrospective alteration, operation transparency through network consensus, and user privacy through anonymity, among others [16]. In previous works such as [20,30,31], a blockchain is described as an “immutable” ledger”–a series of data/record blocks. Every new block in a blockchain contains a cryptographic reference to the previous block, and so on. Figure 3 shows a simple structure of a block, blockchain, and a blockchain network [30]. In a blockchain network, every new node in the network is a computing platform with storage. Generally, each node in a BCN should maintain its copy of such a ledger. A new block, however, is appended to an existing ledger only after executing a “well-formed” transaction(s). A transaction (TXN) is a data structure representing an atomic operation that involves input values and, upon execution, produces an output and changes the state of a system. The term “transaction” is frequently misused in the literature on a blockchain network. Technically, a transaction is an atomic operation whose successful execution changes the system’s state. For example, consider a transaction statement: “Transfer of monetary value x from Alice’s wallet 𝑊 𝐴 to Bob’s wallet 𝑊 𝐵 ”. Before the transaction is executed, the system state is 𝑆 0 :[ 𝑊 𝐴 = 𝑣 1 , 𝑊 𝐵 = 𝑣 2 ] . After the transaction is verified (that is, 𝐵𝐴𝐿𝐴𝑁𝐶𝐸( 𝑊 𝐴 )−𝑥>=0 is true), then the state of the system changes to 𝑆 1 :[ 𝑊 𝐴 = 𝑣 1 −𝑥, 𝑊 𝐵 = 𝑣 2 +𝑥] , on the other hand, a query such as “Balance( 𝑊 𝐴 )” returns the balance in Alice’s wallet is just similar to seeking information from storage. Usually, a query by itself does not change the system’s state.and reaches an agreement on the transaction output among the network nodes. The mechanism that allows network nodes to reach an agreement on a transaction output is a consensus algorithm. Popular blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum use the proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism [13,14,32]. There are several other consensus mechanisms, such as Byzantine fault tolerance, proof of stake (PoS), proof of capacity (PoC), proof of authority, and proof of importance, among others. However, the PoW mechanism is more energy intensive and costly than other energy-efficient mechanisms such as PoS and PoC [30]. Figure 3. (Left) Structure of a blockchain (ledger) as a sequence of data blocks Block 0, Block 1, and so forth. Each block is linked to the previous block through a reference known as block hash, which is an output of a cryptographic function of the content of the previous block. (Right) A simple blockchain network with three nodes 𝑁 1 , 𝑁 2 , and 𝑁 3 , each keeping a copy of a blockchain. As a transaction ( 𝑇 𝑗 ) is received by a node ( 𝑁 2 ), it is broadcast to other nodes for execution. Contrary to Wang et al. [20], blockchain data storage does not prevent forging and tampering with the data; it serves as a deterrence against such activity. However, when implementing blockchain in a decentralized network environment, one can achieve a higher level of data recovery services. 4.2. Types of Blockchain Networks Depending upon who can join a network, blockchain networks are of mainly four categories [30]: (i) public, (ii) private, (iii) consortium, and (iv) hybrid BCN. In public, open, or global blockchain network, any node can join, leave, and perform tasks independently following the network protocol. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are popular public blockchain networks. However, in private BCN, also called permissioned BCN, only the permitted nodes can join the network. The network manager or owner performs the node authentication and access control operations. The identity of permitted nodes is also managed as part of the network operation. Consortium BCN is a particular type of private BCN where every participant in the network is a member of the same company or organization or a group of collaborating companies or organizations. A hybrid BCN combines the feature of both public and private BCN. They provide data privacy by allowing only permitted nodes to join the network while using the public node’s consensus to validate transactions that do not contain private data. Hybrid BCN is suitable for IoT systems such as supply chain management for data protection and access control [16]. In general, a blockchain network consists of two types of computing nodes, viz., verifier and normal nodes. Verifier nodes keep a copy of the complete blockchain structure and validates the transactions. These nodes are also known as full nodes. They have higher computing and storage power. They contribute to data integrity, execute smart contracts, maintain network security, and participate in network consensus mechanisms. They communicate transactions and messages using various communication protocols such as Gossip and Kademlia [16]. Normal nodes are lighter nodes that do not require high storage and computing power. They do not store a copy of the blockchain ledger; however, they obtain partial information about the blockchain status from the full nodes. Table 1 summarizes key features of blockchain networks. Table 1. Capabilities of a Blockchain Network. Hybrid BCN is excluded from this table as it has features from both public and private BCN. 4.3. Applications of Blockchain Technology Blockchain technology encompasses distributed ledger and a network of computing nodes. The application of the technology goes far beyond digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. In this section, we discuss the chief applications of the technology. Financial Transactions and Trusted Digital Payment:In conventional digital payments, intermediaries such as banks, finances, and credit card companies act as a trusted party between a payee and a payer for any digital transactions [33]. It involves several tasks, such as bank balance verification of the payee, transaction validation, and payment verification. However, the network automates verification and validation with blockchain-based payment systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As its main advantage, it reduces intermediaries’ fees and transaction completion time [30]. Process Automation: Blockchain networks may also support “smart contracts”. Smart contracts are similar to regular business contracts except for the contract rules, terms (agreements), and transactions are encoded as a computer program and are executed automatically, in real-time, on blockchain network nodes [10]. The blockchain miners validate the outputs of the execution. Smart contracts save business operation time and cost and guarantee contract compliance. They have a higher potential for automating financial payments, financial audits, online transactions, document signature and approval, supply-chain operations, and so on [10]. E-governance: E-governance is the practice of using information communication technology to provide government services, including issuing citizenship certificates, collecting taxes, delivering social securities, conducting elections, and crowd-sourcing [34,35]. Blockchain technology adds advantages to e-governance by automating most of the administrative services. Countries, including Estonia and China, have invested in research on the use of blockchain in e-governance to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of public services [36,37]. Data Redundancy: One of the chief features of a blockchain network is distributed data storage [16]. Both private and public blockchain networks enforce that the computing nodes securely keep a copy of application-related data. Any alteration of data in a store can be easily detected and recovered by importing from the network peers. For instance, DokChain (https://bit.ly/3QYRws1 (accessed on 13 July 2022)) project uses blockchain as a distributed data storage to store and process financial and clinical data. Such application enhances data integrity, auditability, and efficiency for healthcare and other related transactions and processes. 5. Materials and Methods This paper is a culmination of a detailed literature review from research articles and online resources relevant to the “Internet of Things”, “blockchain network”, “blockchain, and IoT integration”. Other research articles related to the security requirements of both technologies were referred to. This section includes the research questions, study sources, search criteria, and quality evaluation adopted for this study. 5.1. Research Questions The proposed study began by identifying the research questions (RQs) as listed in Table 2. Table 2. Research questions and their objectives. 5.2. Data Sources A wide range of study resources is required for a comprehensive study such as this. For study materials, we considered peer-reviewed journal databases such as IEEEXplore, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital library, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, University Library thesis, and dissertation repositories. we also considered technical reports, conference proceedings, textbooks, patents, online blogs, and news to accumulate updated facts and figures on IoT, Blockchain, and their integration. 5.3.

While specific date ranges were not considered during the search, materials published after 2015 were highly prioritized. To execute the searches, researchers applied manual search procedures. Table 3. Database search terminologies. 5.4. Quality Evaluation We employed two significant questions to filter the search outputs to match the research objectives best.

Q3: Does this resource’s title, abstract, or any portion of body refer to an {application, combination, merging, issues, challenges} of {Internet of Things, IoT} and/or {blockchain network, blockchain}? Only the affirmative answers to any of the above questions from involved researchers would result in considering the resource for the study purpose. 6. Security Assurances and IoT Threat Model A simple IoT network consists of sensor devices, a gateway device, a data storage engine, and application services. Essential security requirements of an IoT network are anonymity, integrity, privacy, authentication, authorization, availability, and audit services [20]. This section defines and exemplifies the key security terms relevant to IoT and blockchain technology. 6.1. Definitions of Security Assurances 6.1.1. Confidentiality Confidentiality (or, privacy) [38] of data (or a message) in a storage device (such as hard disk, RAM) or a transmission channel (such as Ethernet cable, fiber optics, radio signal) ensures that the data [is not exposed/readable]/[remains secret] to illegitimate (unauthorized) parties but the authorized owner or a valid recipient of the message. For example, if any user, say, Alice, sends a message m targeted only to another user, say, Bob, on the other side through a public channel (medium), the confidentiality of the message ensures that any intermediate party, such as Eve, cannot read the message. For instance, as mandated by law [39], an individual may wish to keep his/her personal, professional, or academic matters secret; two people exchanging electronic mails (or any digital or analog messages) wish to keep their communication secret to both of them. Data privacy [40] has been a crucial requirement in demand since the medieval period up until today’s interconnected world. Several encryption algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standards (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), Blowfish, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) are utilized to encrypt the data (message) to achieve data or communication confidentiality [41,42]. Figure 4 depicts the simple flow of encryption and decryption schemes. Encryption is scrambling messages (data) so that illegitimate parties cannot read the message. Two major encryption schemes are (i) symmetric encryption scheme and (ii) asymmetric encryption scheme. Under symmetric encryption schemes, both encryption and decryption operations are performed by a shared secret key. Some of the algorithms that follow symmetric encryption schemes are Advanced Encryption Standards (AES), Data Encryption Standards (DES), and Blowfish, among others [41,42]. Under asymmetric encryption schemes, two different keys are used for encryption and decryption. Each entity generates a pair of mathematically related public keys and private keys. The sender encrypts a message using the recipient’s public key. The recipient with the private key for the public key used for encryption can decrypt the message using the private key. This scheme is also called public key cryptography. Examples of algorithms based on asymmetric encryption schemes are RSA, and ECDSA, among others [41,42]. Figure 4. (a) A symmetric encryption scheme uses a single key, K for the encryption of a message, m and decryption of the encrypted message (cipher), c. (b) An asymmetric encryption scheme uses two different keys, 𝐾 𝑈 and 𝐾 𝑅 , for encryption and decryption. 6.1.2. Authentication and Authorization Authentication is identifying legitimate human or non-human users of a system or communicating party [41,42]. It is a method that allows Bob to verify that he is communicating with Alice and not Eve. The method eventually enables Bob to verify that a message originates from Alice, not Eve. Authorization is a mechanism by which a subject is provided with defined rights or privileges over different system resources such as files, processes, devices, etc. For example, system users such as Alice and Bob may have access rights such as read, write and execute over a file, while all other users, including Eve, may be restricted from all such operations [41]. 6.1.3. Integrity The property of message (or data) integrity [38] ensures that a message has not been tampered with or altered on its storage site or in the transfer’s transit. The requirement of message integrity is essential to a wide array of digital communications, such as emails, and instant messaging, among others. For example, if Alice sends a message m to Bob, the message integrity ensures that Bob receives a message 𝑚 ′ such that 𝑚= 𝑚 ′ . In the context of IoT, data integrity ensures that the data exchanged between any two devices in an IoT network do not suffer unintentional modifications. Alteration of position, navigation, and timing of IoT sensors can severely hamper the effectiveness and trustworthiness of IoT systems. 6.1.4. Availability The property of availability [38] guarantees that services (e.g., web server, email server, data server, telephone, power, network bandwidth, and so on) and resources (e.g., data, storage engine, computational engine) are fully available when needed or requested by their consumers such as human users, computing nodes, processes or other entities. In the context of IoT, the availability property ensures that the components of IoT networks, such as sensor nodes, gateway servers, and data servers, among others, are available to each other and their users or owners. For instance, in an industrial IoT, temperature sensors must be available for measuring temperature throughout the operational time. In an agricultural IoT, losing equipment such as humidity and pesticide level measuring sensors, among others, can highly disrupt the production and supply chain [43]. Another issue affecting IoT data availability may arise due to the proprietary lock-in effect, where manufacturers or suppliers are forced to use outdated IoT products and services and sometimes be denied to export IoT data (https://bit.ly/3WsFfgA (accessed on 29 December 2022)). 6.1.5. Physical Security It is related to the security assurance of availability. Physical security [18] maintains the physical integrity of computing devices, networking devices, and communication channels such as cable, twisted pair cable, fiber optics, satellite, and radio (frequency) spectrum, among others. Activities such as theft of devices and relocation of the device hamper the physical security of the device. Physical security covers hardware and software security. In the context of IoT, physical security should protect every node in each of the components of the IoT ecosystem. 6.1.6. Anonymity Anonymizing is a task of removing explicit identifications, such as name, geo-location, address, date of birth, marital status, ethnicity, ZIP (zone improvement plan (ZIP) is a number that specifies an individual destination post office or mail delivery area.) code, SSNs (Social Security Numbers (SSN) are used to identify unique citizens in the USA. This number is used for obtaining credit, opening a bank account, claiming government benefits, and private insurance, purchase a home or a car, among others.), phone number, email address, IP address, timestamp, or any relevant attributes from the data. In the context of digital communication, the property of anonymity [44] refers to hiding users’ names or relevant attributes such as date of birth, phone numbers, and emails, among others. The property of anonymity is related to an individual’s privacy; however, anonymity may be achieved by removing the personally identifiable information in a data or a message. Privacy can be better preserved by anonymizing the data in transit or storage. For example, the message m may be anonymized by removing explicit information about the sender, Alice. Data without the details are of very little use to target specific user(s) and/or devices. This property prevents unstoppable surveillance of the users or computing nodes, and other analyses relevant to the person, things, or places. 6.1.7. Trustworthiness The security of a system rests on the level of confidence one puts in security implementations and their execution. In other words, a system is secure as long as one trusts [45] its operations and outputs. For instance, we trust the secrecy of encrypted data because we have high confidence that the secret key is not exposed and the algorithm is not broken, given that it is publicly available for everyone to break. However, the “trust” in a system can be amplified by enforcing different strategies. For instance, compare the level of “trust” between an airplane with a single turbo engine and the other with two turbo engines. Given identical engines, the probability that an airplane with a single engine crashes is greater than the probability of double engines. In other words, we are improving dependability due to redundant engines. Similar is the case with the recently advancing blockchain technology, which is discussed in the following section. It is used as an infrastructure to raise trust in an output of a process being executed. Such trust stem from the fact that the process outputs are verifiable (in terms of correctness and completeness) by all of the participating computing nodes [29,45]. The output is stored in storage whose integrity can be globally verified and backed up because multiple clones exist in physically separated locations. The other property that blockchain technology brings is fault tolerance, data security, and disaster recovery. 6.2. IoT Threat Model With a threat modeling of an IoT ecosystem, we identify the sensitive assets, threats to those assets, and vulnerabilities that make the threats a necessary concern. Other aims are to outline security requirements, recognize security threats and vulnerabilities, quantify threat and vulnerability levels, prioritize threats and apply mitigation measures to protect the IoT-relevant assets [46]. We have several threat models [46], such as STRIDE, PASTA (https://threat-modeling.com/pasta-threat-modeling/ (accessed on 31 December 2022)), CVSS (https://www.first.org/cvss/ (accessed on 31 December 2022)), attack tree, and security cards. Each of these methodologies provides different ways to access the threats faced by underlying information systems. However, because IoT technologies are evolving, the IoT may involve devices with weak device manufacturing standards, and an attack surface could be huge because of the vast network size. In this section, we discuss a loosely coupled four-tier threat model for an IoT ecosystem as depicted in Figure 5, where an external adversary may attack devices or services on four different layers. For example, threats may occur to objects in the sensor layer. Such threats may be the theft of the sensor objects, spoofing the sensor data, and jamming the link between two sensor nodes, among others (https://bit.ly/3yYXm44 (accessed on 14 June 2022)). Figure 5. The threat model shows the components of the general IoT architecture and their interactions. Overall, the components and channels in an IoT form an attack surface. Three types of potential threat actors, viz., (i) external adversary, (ii) internal compromised (malicious) gateway device 𝑔 𝑛 in the gateway layer, and (iii) regular malicious (internal) user. 6.2.1. Threat and Attacks on Confidentiality Sensitive data, including encryption keys, decision support data, and users’ private information stored in an IoT node, may be stolen. For instance, in June 2019, Bitdefender (Ring Video Doorbell Pro Under the Scope, URL:https://bit.ly/3XuikD2 (accessed on 21 June 2022)) discovered a vulnerability in Amazon’s Ring Video Doorbell Pro IoT camera device that permitted an attacker to physically near the device to intercept the owner’s WiFi network credentials and possibly mount a more powerful attack against the home network. Fox (https://bit.ly/3B5bWK6 (accessed on 22 June 2022)) reported that a person’s smart home thermostat was hacked over WiFi to compromise the reading of the thermostat and played disturbing music from the video system. An adversary may obtain confidential sensor data causing attacks such as phishing attacks. Malicious scripts, malicious viruses/worms, Trojan horses, and malware can be exploited to steal information from IoT devices (https://bit.ly/3zpyBzq (accessed on 21 June 2022)) [27]. Attackers can utilize smart lamps, smart coffee machines, and smart speakers, among others, to steal personal information [47]. Over-the-air communication spoofing may result in the exposure of critical information shared between the nodes (https://bit.ly/3iOhwde (accessed on 1 June 2022)) [43]. Apart from directed malware attacks, the decision support applications could be implemented to steal sensitive data [43]. In industrial IoT and precision agriculture, the leak of confidential information from within an organization could cause massive damage to the supply and trust of the industries. External entities such as malicious actors, unethical domestic competitors, and foreign state and non-state adversaries could access confidential and valuable business-related, real-time IoT data. Such access could adversely impact production, business negotiations, and trade competency, among others [43]. An example of such an attack is `The Night Dragon’ [23], where an attacker targeted and harvested a large amount of sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information from multiple oil and petrochemical companies in 2011. 6.2.2. Threat and Attacks on Availability Several factors adversely affect the availability of an IoT network and relevant services. Loss or theft of nodes such as sensors and repeaters; jamming or interference or blocking or loss of the radio signals; disruption of the supply chain of network equipment; DDoS on the gateway devices or application servers; among others, could limit the effectiveness of an IoT network [43]. In 2015, a false data injection (FDI) cyber attack on a power grid in Ukraine resulted in the loss of service for over 22,500 customers [48]. The Mirai botnet [49] (2016) is an instance of a DoS attack where a malware named “Mirai” enslaved IoT devices such as cameras, routers, and digital video recorders to cause large-scale attacks to shut down websites and networks. Other variants of Mirai malware, such as Okiru, the Satori, the Masuta, and the PureMasuta, still live on the internet to exploit IoT devices to cause further cyber-attacks as anonymous agents (https://bit.ly/3GVt1HH (accessed on 21 June 2022)). An infected IoT device that can launch further attacks is called a bot. An IoT network of bots, also called a botnet of things, could deliver many HTTPS requests per unit of time, which can throttle a web server [23]. Attacks such as node capture attacks, malicious code injection, false data injection, replay (freshness) attacks, cryptanalysis, and side-channel attacks, sleep deprivation attacks, spoofing attacks, sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and interference could adversely affect the availability of an IoT network [27]. 6.2.3. Threat and Attacks on Integrity Events such as theft of a node, unauthorized control of a node, MIM attack, insertion of a rouge sensor node, unapproved modification of input and output data, etc., may alter the integrity of data and operation of nodes in an IoT. A vital node on the sensor layer be physically stolen from the current network and may be accessed and controlled on a different network. Unauthorized node control may result from the theft of a node or an attack such as man-in-the-middle (MIM) that causes the communication between nodes to replay [12,40]. Due to an insecure channel, a MIM attack can mimic the communication and ultimately compromise the integrity of the message being exchanged between two nodes. Inserting a rouge sensor in an IoT can produce faulty data values that can negatively impact decision-making in different domains utilizing IoT [43]. Unapproved input and output data modification relevant to precision agriculture IoT, smart home, and industrial IoT, among others, can cause massive economic, environmental, and trade disruptions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have been adopted for the advanced operation of agriculture, industry, and home systems. These techniques feed on the massive data collected by an IoT. However, there is a higher risk of using insufficiently modeled algorithms, and biased predictive models for decision supports [50]. The compromised models can produce unintended and adverse effects in the current and future operations of the IoT systems [43,51]. 6.2.4. Threat and Attacks on Authentication and Authorization Password cracking is a typical attack that compromises authentic access to a network or a device such as IoT sensors. Software packages such as aircrack-ng (a suite of packet monitoring and injection tools available in Kali Linux oS) could be utilized to monitor and capture WiFi-protected access (WPA) handshake packets to cause dictionary attack further to crack a WiFi password. WiFi attack occurs when a malicious user tries to take control of the network by intercepting the data packets over WiFi or ZigBee channels [12]. It is a type of MIM attack that compromises the integrity of the network. An example of such an attack is SkyJet [12]. Sontowski et al. [23] explain that other common attacks that compromise a WiFi network are evil twin access points, key reinstallation attacks, Address Resoulution Protocl (ARP) spoofing attacks, and DNS spoofing. An untrusted sensor node in a network may request sensitive data from the coordinator, and vice versa. Network nodes may enforce access control lists to manage the access of resources by participating nodes in a network. 7. IoT and Blockchain Integration The IoT has proven to automate domestic, industrial, and business monitoring and functioning. Nevertheless, it relies on centralized cloud computing for data storage, processing, and network command and control. With the centralized model, the integrity of the data and the process output of cloud computing are always in question because IoT owners have to rely on a third party (such as cloud vendors) for the integrity of the data and the process outputs [30]. On the other hand, the basic features of a blockchain network include transparency, verifiability, data redundancy, and trustworthy [52]. These principal features can fill the gaps in providing the security-related guarantees required by an IoT network and related applications. Thus integration of an IoT and a blockchain network can serve a primary need for colossal storage, business/industry automation, fault-tolerance, and data/process integrity. Devices in an IoT network can be designed to play different roles in a blockchain network. Edge devices such as routers, routing switches, integrated access devices, multiplexers, and gateways can be designed to store the blockchain and perform transaction validations. Intermediate devices such as relay routers can be designed to execute services for issuing transactions to a BCN on behalf of the connected resource constraint devices such as sensors. Several integration models have been discussed in previous studies [30,53]. Nevertheless, we summarize them into four major IoT and BCN integration models. Sensor devices as Transaction Issuer (SaTi): In this integration model(see the interaction (a) between sensor node s and BCN in Figure 6), IoT devices such as sensors take part in issuing transactions to the external BCN. Such IoT devices should be designed to accommodate computational power and bandwidth requirements. However, the typical IoT devices do not have the storage capacity to store a complete blockchain. In many use cases, such as industrial IOTs, this model may be too costly and ineffective for sensors to communicate with an external BCN. In that case, edge devices such as IoT gateways may be employed to issue transactions on behalf of all the low-power, resource constraint IoT devices. Edge devices as Transaction Issuer (EaTi): In this integration model (see the interaction (b) between edge device g and BCN in Figure 6), specially designed IoT edge devices such as gateway routers may be actively issuing transactions to an external BCN, without actually storing a copy of the blockchain ledger. This integration model is efficient, given that it requires a limited number of edge devices for interacting with the BCN. Edge devices as Transaction Verifier (EaTv): This integration model extends the EaTi model, where specially designed IoT edge devices issue transactions to the BCN and maintain an entire blockchain ledger for active block validations. In many cases, edge devices could handle both issues and validate transactions being an active node for a BCN. However, unless business interests require it, an industry may not use edge devices for transaction validations, which are computationally intensive and require higher storage and bandwidth. In the figure, interaction (c) is part of this integration model. Hybrid: In a hybrid integration model, IoT and blockchain interact through edge devices and specially designed IoT sensor devices. It depends on the applications whose interactions go through edge and IoT devices. In the figure, interactions (a), (b), and (c) are part of the hybrid integration model. In other words, sensor devices issue transactions, and edge devices issue, and validate transactions for a BCN. Nonetheless, this model imposes redundancy in issuing transactions for a BCN, which is costly in terms of bandwidth. Figure 6. IoT and blockchain network integration models. Having discussed the models of IoT and blockchain network integration, the following section discusses some compelling applications born out of IoT and blockchain integration. 7.1. Application Areas of IoT and BCN Integration There are different challenges concerning evolving IoT. They include the problems of IoT data storage and exchange, IoT devices and user identity management, device/user authentication, and access control. With blockchain technology, well integrated with IoT, many application areas are realized for an IoT. In this section, we distinctively discuss three chief application areas of IoT-blockchain integration. 7.1.1. IoT Devices and IoT Applications’ Security Enforcement Trust Platform: As discussed in the previous section, a blockchain network is a platform that supports transaction and process verification and public audit of the data stored in the temper-detectable blockchain ledger. Thus, the blockchain network has the potential to be used as a trusted platform for several IoT-related applications. Dedeoglu et al. [54] presented a blockchain-based trust architecture for building end-to-end trust for various IoT-based applications. Tang et al. [55] proposed a decentralized trust framework called IoT Passport for cross-platform collaborations using blockchain to enforce trusted interactions between IoT devices across platforms. Authentication and Access Control: Access control is a mechanism of mapping computational resources with users with appropriate access, including reading, writing, and executing. Because the blockchain network guarantees the integrity of stored data, access control mechanisms for IoT devices and applications are built and encoded on the blockchain ledger. Ji et al. [56] used an identify-based data access control model, BDAC, to provide fine-grained data access control for IoT systems. Muzammal et al. [57] proposed an enhanced authentication and access control method for IoT devices to add features, such as decentralization, secured authentication, authorization, and scalability. Zhang et al. [58] proposed an attribute-based collaborative access control scheme on top of a blockchain for IoT devices. Recently, Pal et al. [59] proposed blockchain-based IoT access control mechanisms that are claimed to provide critical features, including resource management, access rights transfer, permission enforcement, attribute management, and scalability. Košťál et al. [60] proposed using the blockchain network to manage and monitor IoT devices. Previous works from [61,62,63] were heavily focused on using Blockchain for IoT access control management. Privacy and Integrity of IoT data: Privacy and integrity are the essential properties of the IoT ecosystem. Tan et al. [64] proposed Shamir’s threshold cryptography for protecting the privacy of the IoT data stored in the cloud. In this model, the end-users request decryption keys from the blockchain network to decrypt the encrypted data in the cloud. Negka et al. [65] proposed using hardware-derived functions known as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to detect counterfeit IoT devices. Wu et al. [66] simulated a system of assuring and detecting IoT data integrity using a distributed blockchain system. Naresh et al. discussed a blockchain-based method to monitor the topographic integrity of an IoT network. 7.1.2. Industrial IoT Devices and Identity Management One of the challenges of IoT is the huge number of connected devices. Blockchain network has promising features such as decentralization and tamper-proofing of data, which could solve the issue of managing user and device identities. Nuss et al. [67] demonstrated that identity and access management could be better managed on a private blockchain for enterprise IoT devices. Vallois et al. [68] proposed distributed identity and access management for a group of industries sharing many IoT devices. They used an architecture that utilizes a blockchain network as a communication layer. Lee [69] utilized blockchain technology for identity and authentication management for mobile users and telecommunication companies. Several business startups such as ShoCard (https://www.shocard.com/en.html (accessed on 3 August 2022)), UniquID (https://uniquid.com/ (accessed on 3 August 2022)), Chronicled (htts://chronicled.com (accessed on 3 August 2022)), Riddle and Code (https://www.riddleandcode.com/ (accessed on 3 August 2022)), among others are developing blockchain-based identity verification and management platforms based on blockchain for IoT devices and users. 7.1.3. Industrial IoT Data Management and Resource Sharing/Trading IoT produces a vast amount of highly valuable and sensitive data pertinent to industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, and supply chain management. Both the size and importance of the data demand robust ways to promote the privacy and integrity of the data. Blockchain provides vital features such as integrity and decentralization of data, thus attracting many IoT-based industries to adopt the platform for secure data management. Sigwart et al. [70] provided an IoT data provenance framework for ensuring trust in the IoT data collection, which could be used in supply chain management and health care management. El Kafhali et al. [71] presented an architecture to manage IoT data on top of blockchain and fog computing, coupled with software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). Qing Fan et al. [72] demonstrated a comparably efficient, secure, authenticated data-sharing model for the IoT based on blockchain. Similarly, Chi et al. [73] proposed a data-sharing framework based on identity authentication and Hyberledger Fabric to ensure data-sharing security. They also proposed a community detection algorithm to segregate the data-sharing clients into different communities based on the similarity of the data label. Mohammed et al. [74] elaborate on the use of the blockchain and e-commerce based on IoT. Jain et al. [75] discuss a decentralized distribution of solar energy between networks using IoT and blockchain networks. Khorasany et al. [76] proposed a peer-to-peer energy trading framework on blockchain to fully secure energy transactions between a pool of smart IoT devices serving energy suppliers and customers. Similarly, Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular platforms that permit payment for purchasing goods and services [13,14]. 8. Challenges of IoT, Blockchain and the Integration As an evolving technology, there are several challenges to overcome to harvest the utility of blockchain-integrated IoT fully. This section discusses significant challenges, including security, scalability, performance, and standardization of IoT and blockchain technology. 8.1. Network and Communication Security As explained in Section 6.1, it is vital to address the security issues such as privacy, data integrity, reliability (error handling), and availability, among others. These issues are the most critical requirements for an IoT system. For example, IoT devices installed without adequate security concerns are highly prone to attacks. Such attacks can cause a high loss of farm yield in the smart farming infrastructure not built with adequate security concerns, and end-users neglect to perform the security hardening settings [22]. Concerning blockchain, relying on blockchain to protect data privacy is far from efficient. It is because the data in a public blockchain are not generally encrypted to permit public validations [14]. Incorporating private data in a public chain makes it harder to securely share data between IoT nodes and relevant users’ private data. However, if the user’s anonymity is only the security goal of an organization employing an IoT, the anonymized user’s data (for example, transactional data from a smart electric meter) can be provided to the public, blockchain network nodes for transaction validation. In that case, the user’s unique account identity is sufficient for executing transactions [77]. 8.2. Scalability Scalability is another significant challenge to IoT as well as the blockchain network. IoT devices are easier to operate in small numbers in a local setting. However, the real-world requirements may demand the use of thousands of sensors (or actuators), which demands high-level experts to deploy and address the scalability concerns. Sensors collect very granular data values related to the environment of their deployments. It is crucial to consider the expansibility of computing power, data storage, and bandwidth, among others [78]. Concerning blockchain, regular (miner) nodes in the network require higher bandwidth, storage, and computational power. Specifically, computational power becomes more important if the blockchain network employs PoW as a consensus mechanism. Since IoT devices have minimal computational and storage capability, such nodes do not help use a blockchain network regular nodes [16]. Efforts are in progress to develop blockchain and IoT network protocols for efficient transaction validations [77]. Techniques such as off-chain transaction processing and network (or transaction or state) sharding (Sharding is the practice of segmenting an extensive network into subnets or large databases into smaller databases.) [79] techniques have been proposed and are under testing to improve the throughput of a blockchain network. 8.3. Interoperability, Standardization, Regulation, and Governance Interoperability is a question of enabling seamless communication among heterogeneous devices. Due to device and communication varieties related to IoT, there is a lack of IoT design and communication standards. Due to the explosion of the IoT business, privacy controls, user agreements, third-party applications, and system update procedures are not uniform and consistent across platforms and applications [43]. Multitudes of standards such as IEEE, IETF, W3C, ITU-T, ONeM2M, OMG, and ETSi have been proposed for different products, services, and systems [80]. A unifying standard for cross-domain IoT communications is still far from adoption. For example, contemporary, popular blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to be adopted as stable, efficient, and dependable technologies for financial transactions and health care management, among others [77]. Similarly, these technologies struggle to operate along with existing regulatory and governing bodies (https://bit.ly/3QYnLYd (accessed on 15 July 2022)). 8.4. Deployment and Detection Due to the miniature nature of IoT devices, unscrupulous deployment has affected people’s privacy. For instance, VTech, a Hong Kong-based company that produces smart and connected toys, was hacked to expose critical user information such as names, mailing addresses, and email addresses (https://bit.ly/3QYfQKH (accessed on 6 August 2022)). As another instance, a Wi-Fi-enabled Barbie doll (https://bit.ly/3zuTmbS (accessed on 6 September 2022)) could be easily hacked to use as a surveillance tool for spying on children to listen to their conversation without their knowledge. Poachers may exploit IoT to monitor wild lives for ultimate hunting (https://bit.ly/3StPkJx (accessed on 6 August 20222)) (https://bit.ly/3BJ5h8N (accessed on 6 August 2022)). Laws prohibiting the use of IoT without transparency should be enacted to discourage the potential exploitation of IoT. Increased literacy on IoT could help encourage the ethical use of the IoT. 8.5. Performance and Resource Constraints IoT devices are resource constraint devices [81]. They possess small memory and computational power. Additionally, they run on low power. These limitations hinder executing processes that are intensive but are required for security operations. On the other hand, a blockchain network requires validating nodes to be higher computational and storage power. For instance, according to YCharts.Com, Ethereum (https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_chain_full_sync_data_size (accessed on 22 July 2022)) chain full sync data size is at a current level of 814.32 GB (22 June 2022) down from 879.18 GB one year ago, which is −7.38% from one year ago. Similarly, Bitcoin (https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size (accessed on 22 July 2022)) blockchain size is at a current level of 417.59 GB (22 June 2022), up from 355.57 GB one year ago, which is 17.45% from one year ago. It means there is limited opportunity for the general purpose machines to take part in transaction validations in a blockchain network [36]. 8.6. Maintenance and Patching Depending on the organizational or industrial need, IoT devices may be deployed in challenging environments such as the bottom of the sea, near the furnace, and in the forest, among others. Since IoT device firmware is not patchable, it requires reloading new images or replacing the device. Concerning the blockchain, there exists a problem with forking. A blockchain forking [79] refers to the formation of two or more versions of the blockchain due to different events such as a major protocol update, existing bug fixture, or an attack on the main blockchain protocol (https://bit.ly/3knXLJG (accessed on 15 July 2022)). All or the majority of the network should agree to the outcome of such an event. In case some wish to retain the original protocol, there occurs a fork in a blockchain. For instance, the early version of the Ethereum blockchain went through a hard fork that resulted in Ethereum Classic (ETC) in July 2016 (https://bit.ly/3Hob8mq (accessed on 21 July 2022)). 9. Meeting the IoT-BCN Challenges: Tools, Techniques and Strategies In Section 6.1, we discussed major security assurances for an IoT network. This section discusses the tools and techniques utilized to realize the security assurances for an IoT system, a blockchain network, and their integration. 9.1. Physical Security of IoT Devices Sensor nodes in an IoT system are often deployed in an open environment. For instance, in several IoT, such as those used for smart agriculture and forestry, smart cities, and Climate IoT, sensor nodes are installed in a public environment with no or little physical security, such as walls and boundaries. They are susceptible to physical security challenges such as theft, displacement, and physical damage. In case of displacement of the IoT nodes, the usability of the data may be negatively affected. While it may not always be feasible to create a physical boundary around IoT nodes, measures should be adopted to ensure the continuous availability of the IoT nodes. For instance, redundant IoT devices may be deployed to enhance the protections, and measures to detect physical damage, and out-of-service IoT devices should be implemented. 9.2. Confidentiality through Encryption Encryption is a method of hiding data [38]. For enhanced confidentiality, a robust encryption algorithm such as AES that employs a 128-bit encryption key is mandated [82] for data encryption. Data in the cloud can be encrypted with the credentials of the data owners. Fine-grained data encryption in the cloud can be performed using attribute-based encryption (ABE) as proposed by Goyal et al. [83]. It has been used on different occasions to secure data on the cloud. Studies such as [84,85,86] leverage a homomorphic crypto-system to encrypt locations and distance measurements harvested by such IoT. With statistical or machine learning based on IoT data, different privacy-preserving methods such as highlighted in [86,87,88] can be employed on IoT data. To generate machine learning models, federated machine learning models as specified by Yang et al. [89] can be employed to avoid data transfer from end devices to the remote machines. Over-the-air communication is encrypted using a secret key exchanged between the nodes. 9.3. Authentication An essential step in securing IoT connections and data, and avoiding attacks such as spoofing and eavesdropping, is to use a secure protocol such as TLS/SSL. TLS/SSL is a cryptographic protocol for secure communication, where end devices are authenticated before initiating data exchange. Ibrahim et al. [4] applied SSL/TLS to secure intelligent home IoT while preserving the speed and agility of device and data access. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) was used for key management, and homomorphic encryption was used for data aggregation. Network authentication policies, the distribution, and the storage of encryption keys should be commissioned securely. 9.4. Anonymizing the IoT Data IoT devices collect sensitive data such as geolocation, name, and identity of the IoT devices, among others. For example, in smart home IoT, owners of a specific home may be tied with their access to IoT devices. In forest and agricultural IoT, farmers may track the fields and the yield. Additionally, conservationists and zoological science researchers may be tracking wild-life activities (https://bit.ly/3byymJd (accessed on 8 June 2022)). What could be the repercussions if the data go into the hand of poachers? Thus, it demands highly secure and protected data harvesting and storage by such IoT. Freely available networks for anonymous connections are unreliable for two main reasons: (i) such networks are not publicly verifiable, and (ii) the Internet service providers (ISPs) may exploit their power to monitor the packets’ origination and other information in insecure connections (https://bit.ly/3olJufm (accessed on 22 July 2022)). Stirapongsasuti et al. [90] demonstrated the application of k-anonymity method to tune the privacy of home IoT data (activities, logins, etc.) while sinking (uploading) to the remote storage. k-anonymity method, as proposed by Samarati et al. [44], employs the method of information (data) generalization and suppression before releasing person-specific data to safeguard the anonymity of the individuals. Other de-identification techniques include scrambling and swapping values and adding noises while retaining the result’s overall statistical property [44]. 9.5. Authorization Proper authorization of IoT devices provides proper access to their users. For example, in an industry setting, mission-critical devices need to be accessible to higher privileged users such as administrators. Goyal et al. [84] demonstrated access control policies to limit the operations performed by different users on IoT devices in domestic settings. There are various types of access control mechanisms [91], such as discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), role-based access control (RBAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC), among others. Specially designed languages such as web ontology language (OWL) [48] have been used in formulating complex relationships between users and resources and the security policies for cloud storage and smart farming operations. 9.6. Availability Chao et al. [26] proposed a BCN-based information exchange network for UAVs to ensure data transmission security and resilience against blocking line-of-sight. Applications can use a quieter channel and agile frequency to overcome the problem of blocking of line-of-sight of network receivers [82]. Zigbee, for instance, uses frame counters to defend against MIM. Additionally, to protect from unauthorized control, network keys should be regularly changed [82]. It is recommended to use an intrusion detection system (IDS) for possible attacks on the system [92]. Availability can be promoted by using redundant nodes deployed for the critical IoT nodes, which operate in case the original nodes are out of service for various reasons [46]. Modern security techniques exploit artificial intelligence and machine learning to defend an IoT network, such as smart farming, smart home, and smart health, among others [23,93,94]. A system’s security lies in detecting any tampering or ongoing attack on a system. Efficient intrusion detection is a framework to continuously monitor any malicious activity on an IoT network. Monshizadeh et al. [92] discussed a software-defined network with detection as a service that enables early detection of network anomalies. 9.7. Trustworthiness As mentioned in Section 6.1.7, trustworthiness is an ultimate requirement of an information system. It can only be confirmed if other security requirements, such as privacy, integrity, and availability, are guaranteed. For instance, as IEEE Standards for Blockchain-based IoT Data Management [45] outlines, a framework of blockchain-based IoT for data management must contain a batch of trusted sensing, storage, communication, and networking to monitor any malicious activity on an IoT network continuously information system can be significantly promoted by augmenting it with a blockchain-based solution. 9.8. IoT Security Controls and Policies As explained in Section 6, the attack surface of an IoT network is as large as the Internet. Applying the tools and techniques to provide the desired security assurances for an IoT system is insufficient. Additionally, it is crucial to establish and apply standard security controls to effectively mitigate the threats to an IoT system and thwart foreseeable attacks on the system. In this section, we adapt the CIS Controls (The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is an “independent, nonprofit organization with a mission to create confidence in the connected world” (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls (accessed 22 June 2022); Alternative to CIS’s controls are the framework from National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS among others [95].)) to strengthen the protection and defend an IoT system. Implement IoT devices and firmware version inventory management: This control encourages network owners to create an effective inventory of authorized network and sensor devices. This inventory assists in establishing authorized network devices and detecting unauthorized devices. Implement IoT application services and version management: This control provides a mechanism to create an inventory of software or firmware packages used by IoT devices. Such inventory is valuable during firmware/software vulnerability fixing and patch management. Implement IoT network or device access control management: Access control mechanism is one of the crucial techniques to provide operational and other permissions over IoT devices. It also assists in monitoring IoT device access by different users. Proper authentication mechanisms should also be implemented to avoid leaking or reusing user credentials such as usernames and passwords. Implement IoT network and application isolation: It is crucial to establish a distinction between an IoT network and an application (or analysis) layer. While an IoT network is a network of devices contributing to harvesting sensor data, the application layer consists of services used by end users to support organization decisions. A stringent isolating boundary should be created to mitigate risks of vulnerabilities affecting each other. Implement IoT network and access Log management: This control encourages network owners to collect, alert, review and retain events logs that could assist in detecting, comprehending, and recovering from any attack on an IoT system. Data protection and recovery management: Critical asset produced by an IoT is the vast set of application-specific data. Implementing adequate data backup procedures is crucial to avoid data loss during an attack or a disaster. User access and data encryption should also be properly managed to prevent information leaks. 10. Discussion and Conclusions This paper presented several topics, including the evolution of IoT things, its architecture and major application areas, security assurances of an IoT, and its relevance to blockchain technology. Blockchain technology can offer unique features such as decentralization, transparency, and data integrity to the areas of IoT to give rise to robust, compelling applications that span from home to industry to agriculture and farming. However, from our study, we concluded that the actual use case of the blockchain-integrated IoT lies in the reliable infrastructure supporting blockchain network operations. On the other hand, international standardization of the operation of devices and communication protocols is highly desirable for burgeoning use cases of the IoT. As discussed previously, there are several ways IoT and blockchain can be integrated to harvest riveting application services. At the same time, there are myriads of threats to IoT that could not be resolved by BCN integration. For instance, BCN cannot solve common threats for an IoT, are physical tampering with the deployed IoT devices and malware injection, DDoS attacks, and battery drainage attacks, among others [96]. The seamless interactions between IoT devices and the BCN depend on several factors, including computational power and bandwidth. An issue affecting IoT data availability may arise due to the proprietary lock-in effect, where manufacturers or suppliers are forced to use potentially incompetent IoT products and services and sometimes be denied to export data (https://bit.ly/3J5hY1p (accessed on 29 December 2022)). With respect to blockchain technology, we still lack a reliable, scalable, efficient, affordable, well-governed, general-purpose blockchain platform to execute IoT-specific services. Much work is required to enhance the financial, operational reliability, and governance of popular open-source blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

As a safeguard, the tools used to assess water quality are crucial. However, the world is rapidly evolving, and the compounds finding their way into water systems are changing. Therefore, continuously adapting modern measurement and data analysis techniques has become desirable and imperative to keep pace. The dominant approaches are targeted screening methods, i.e., target analysis and suspect screening, that have been instrumental in detecting known contaminants [1, 2]. However, their restrictive scope limits their efficacy, potentially allowing unknown or unexpected pollutants to go unnoticed. Non-target screening (NTS), powered by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), extended those tools, offering a dynamic solution unconstrained by the need to search for specific, pre-identified contaminants [3]. While NTS has ushered in new possibilities for pollutant detection, it has its challenges [4]. Firstly, the sheer volume of data generated by HRMS instruments such as Orbitrap or time-of-flight systems coupled with gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) can be daunting, demanding sophisticated data management and processing tools. Analyzing and interpreting the vast spectra of chemical signatures also requires much expertise and refined methodologies [5]. Additionally, distinguishing between signal noise, naturally occurring compounds, and emerging pollutants poses another intricate trilemma [6]. The double-edged sword of comprehensive chemical databases is evident in non-target screening. On the one hand, a more extensive database offers more opportunities for compound identification. Conversely, the enormous volume of information can make pinpointing a specific compound akin to finding a needle in a vast haystack. To address this challenge, adopting approaches like PubChemLite can be beneficial, which refines the vastness of the database by focusing on the most relevant and commonly encountered compounds, thus combining the power of comprehensive data with the ease of targeted searches [7]. Beyond these technical hurdles, practical challenges arise regarding standardization across laboratories and regulatory adaptation. As the field of NTS continues to evolve, addressing these hurdles is crucial to harnessing its full potential. In light of the challenges inherent to NTS, the field has witnessed a surge of innovations and methodologies, underscoring the ever-evolving landscape of water quality assessment [3]. These trends promise to refine our understanding and detection capabilities and foster a proactive stance toward potential threats. From advancements in instrument technology, data processing, and method performance assessment to collaborative efforts for database expansion and standardization, these trends represent a renewed commitment to preserving the sanctity of water ecosystems. This Trend article highlights advances in data evaluation approaches, the importance of quality assurance/quality control guidelines and validation protocols for NTS study outputs, and quantitative NTS strategies by focusing on works conducted within the past five years. In this way, different challenges, opportunities, and related concepts to NTS will be explored. In the conclusion section, an outlook for the future trajectory of non-target screening in aquatic ecosystems will be presented based on emerging and expected needs. Current data evaluation trends in NTS The evaluation of HRMS data in NTS consists of two aspects: (1) initial raw spectra processing, aiming to condense via multi-step approaches relevant chemical information from individual measurement data, i.e., feature extraction, and (2) data analysis, putting the chemical information obtained into a meaningful context, e.g., comparing samples for monitoring trend analysis in time series experiments. The outer structure of NTS processing workflows, namely centroiding, peak detection, etc., looks almost harmonized and familiar with target or suspect screenings. However, in detail, the explicit algorithms of the individual steps can differ significantly, making result comparability challenging. In data analysis, advanced multivariate chemometrics methods and machine learning (ML) have become indispensable tools for discovering hidden patterns and identifying correlations where conventional methods are limited. Moreover, high-throughput annotations of unknown features are being performed using open-source molecular discovery workflows that utilize spectral libraries, ML, and cheminformatic tools [8]. Full scan HRMS/MS data storage allows retrospective analysis without re-run sample analyses. This potential has been proposed as an early warning system worldwide to detect emerging pollution threats [9]. In 2019, the NORMAN Digital Sample Freezing Platform (DSFP) was launched to enable digital sample archiving and retrospective suspect screening [10]. However, challenges exist due to the sheer size and complex nature of NTS data, particularly in archiving HRMS data, meta-data, and processing capabilities [11]. As outlined in the following sections, data processing workflows in the NTS generally consist of several steps, from feature extraction to structural elucidation. Data processing: feature extraction Hyphenated HRMS instruments generally produce complex and diverse datasets requiring specific processing and robust processing tools and procedures. Briefly, the main aim of the processing step is to provide a compact “component table” from the original raw data. Processing parameters are crucial to further screening success. The significant points here are extracting highly qualified features, proper feature alignment, redundant feature filtering, and reliable componentization of features to the same unique molecular structure. Recently, different NTS data processing algorithms and methods have been extensively reviewed [6]. Nowadays, in addition to vendor software, open-source tools such as XCMS [12], MZmine [13], SIRIUS [14], MS-DIAL [15], enviMass [16], have been used for HRMS data handling of environmental samples. However, since most of these packages were developed for -omics data, the workflow and parameters are not necessarily appropriate for environmental studies regarding issues like frequent appearances of low-intensity peaks, more highlighted matrix effects, and long-term exposure monitoring. The impact of data preprocessing on the production of different outputs and quality would be another noticeable concern at this stage [68]. This insight requires more thorough research and collaboration to ensure reliable and robust NTS tools and procedures. The open-source platform PatRoon [17] enables comprehensive environmental NTS data processing, from HRMS pre-treatment to compound annotation. With PatRoon, comparison between algorithms is possible, and feature coverage can be increased by utilizing both common and distinctive features among algorithms. InSpectra, an open-source and modular web-based NTS and suspect screening workflow, was released in 2023 [18]. LC-HRMS data can be archived, shared, and curated through parallel computing with InSpectra. Moreover, InSpectra can identify, track, and prioritize pollution threats in a reproducible and transparent manner. According to [19], while not limited to water samples, it has been found that vendor software like Thermo Compound Discoverer or Agilent MassHunter is frequently used for LC or GC-HRMS NTS data processing. However, commercial software often presents proprietary constraints, such as limited customization options and exclusive data formats, making transitions or data sharing cumbersome. The closed nature of these tools obscures the understanding of data processing, posing challenges for rigorous scientific evaluations. Furthermore, such software may face interoperability issues due to restrictions on available platforms and variations in tools used by collaborators, hampering seamless teamwork and comprehensive system compatibility. Thus, due to the main disadvantage of commercial software, developing and validating open software that leverages NTS for both GC- and LC-HRMS data while deconvoluting MS2 data for more coverage of chemical exposure in water environments is highly required. An alternative to these “feature profile” (FP) packages is to exploit multi-way chemometric methods for direct “component profile” (CP) production. For example, a set of LC-HRMS measurements can be efficiently modeled by a multi-way algorithm after initial data compression [20]. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) and parallel factor analysis 2 (PARAFAC2) are the most efficient methods. However, other tensor factorization algorithms can also be implemented after extra preprocessing steps. Upon modeling on each data array, three matrices of CPs are generated: resolved “pure” LC profiles, their mass spectral counterpart, and the area under resolved LC profiles as quantification scores. Therefore, data dimensionality can be reduced, decreasing the risk of incomplete componentization and missing compounds that cannot be detected by feature-based peak detection [21]. Data processing protocols based on multiple samples align well with real-world aquatic NTS advancements and perspectives, such as monitoring pollution pathways in river water, wastewater samples undergoing chemical or biological treatment, or water samples measured under a variety of extraction/instrumental conditions [20, 22, 23]. Nevertheless, multi-way methods have prerequisites to consider when applied in GC/LC-MS data processing [24]. As the most flexible algorithm, MCR-ALS provides additional benefits in NTS of water samples with complex GC- or LC-HRMS data structures (e.g., substantial RT shifts and co-elution issues) designed in response to environmental conditions. However, MCR workflows are mainly semi-automated, and solutions may have some ambiguities, though their extent can be mitigated by incorporating sensible ALS optimization constraints. A comparison of FP packages and CP approaches in different water NTS categories would help us understand how they differ qualitatively and quantitatively when extracting a holistic or prioritized subset of chemical spaces. An overall emphasis should be placed on expanding and optimizing fully automated multi-way-based workflows designed to process NTS raw GC- and LC-HRMS data and produce CPs with high completeness and minimal user input. Data analysis: pattern recognition With the “component table” in place, various chemometrics/ML algorithms and visualization tools could be employed for downstream tasks such as uncovering chemical trends and pollution events, monitoring the occurrence and fate of pollutants, assessing of water treatment process, and developing intelligent prioritization criteria to select environmentally relevant features. Hence, it is also crucial to consider data transformations, intensity normalization, and scaling for removing unwanted variations before further analysis. Data processing challenges with NTS include the high dimensionality of HRMS records and the possibility of redundant information, the lack of adequate sample size, and the number of replicates required for statistical testing. An effective data reduction strategy and exploration are therefore required in the first place. In unsupervised NTS, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and co-occurrence analysis using Venn diagrams are the most popular methods to evaluate similarities, co-variations, and differences between various NTS cases [5]. While these methods benefit data exploration, one must know their potential and limitations about high dimensional HRMS data [25, 26]. Fig. 1 Representation of ASCA(+) loading plot (Factor “sampling location”) to display the final subsets of highly prioritized chemicals (ESI+) strongly associated with different stream water sources by the joint implementation of univariate (volcano test) and multivariate statistical methods (PLS-DA-VIP and ASCA+) [28]. Note: ASCA(+): extension of ASCA (ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis) for unbalanced experimental design; PLS-DA-VIP: Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis-Variable Importance in Projection Full size image The recently used supervised classification and multivariate statistical tools in NTS of water samples are partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), its orthogonal directed model (OPLS-DA), support vector machines with linear kernels (SVM), PLS-path modeling, and multivariate ANOVA models [22, 23, 27, 28]. Due to their multivariate advantage, these methods complement univariate statistics (e.g., volcano plots, Mann–Whitney U test, ANOVA) because they consider all features simultaneously and can consider pollutant compound interrelations associated with the outcome (Fig. 1). Multiple validation criteria must be applied to evaluate the performance and generalizability of predictive models following model training, suggesting that procedures for assessing the effectiveness of NTS methods may need to be improved and standardized [6, 29]. However, the previous reports show that NTS data classification can be non-linear in more complex scenarios, such as heterogeneous or highly dynamic behavior of pollution sources or when there is a substantial overlap in the chemical composition of water sources [25, 28]. Therefore, more flexible and robust non-parametric learners such as SVM models with non-linear kernels, artificial neural networks (ANNs), deep learning (DL) algorithms, and ensemble classifiers such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting algorithms (such as XGBoost and CatBoost) can be exploited in cases where linear classification methods are not robust tools. Moreover, ML tools have a high potential for use in many other fields within NTS research, including retention time (RT) prediction [30] and collision cross section (CCS) prediction in ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) coupled with HRMS as well [31]. Furthermore, constructing several robust classification models on the same sample set may be necessary to avoid interpretation biases and false discoveries. The final explanatory and predictive outputs would be highly beneficial for future comparison of aquatic ecosystems and uncovering the exposure of relevant pollutants and proper chemical fingerprints in various situations. Such benefits align with what has been emphasized in the literature, which is that NTS data sharing and the development of data repository platforms are essential to facilitate collaborative trials, QA/QC, method developments and comparisons, unify protocols, and contribute to policy and regulatory development. Quality assurance/quality control efforts in NTS The complex nature of NTS requires stringent quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures to ascertain the reliability and validity of results [32, 33]. Many of these QA/QC protocols are general and originate from conventional target analyses, with scarce specific developments for NTS [34]. Therefore, exploring and discussing these measures within the NTS framework and evolving a perspective view on future developments and trends within this field is crucial. In the meaning of QA/QC, there are three layers in the analytical process where quality has to be ensured: Samples, Measurement System, and Data Processing. NTS measurements are organized in long-running batch series, so ensuring stability should be prioritized [33]. It is necessary to ensure sample stability, signifying that samples and their components remain intact and unchanged throughout the analysis. In this situation, one suggestion is to include internal standards (ISs) multiple times within the batch analysis, as Caballero-Casero et al. (2021) put forth [33]. The stability can then be assessed by evaluating the consistency of these internal standards and pooled sample results over time. Next to sample stability, monitoring measurement system stability using quality control charts and batch effect correction is integral for NTS [33, 35]. Including and considering blank samples can be used to identify memory effects at an early stage and prevent cross-contamination. Moreover, these blank measurements can be considered for later background corrections [34]. Assessing matrix effects is integral to preserving the NTS process’s reliability [33]. Matrix compounds can cause significant shifts in retention time and m/z, with the latter primarily originating from data processing and being associated with increased data dispersion and overlapping effects in the extracted ion traces [6]. QC samples fortified with ISs are vital in assessing matrix effects by comparing QC samples in the absence and presence of respective matrices [33]. Moreover, QC samples provide information about potential interferences, recovery efficiency, error rates for identifications, and precision throughout the analytical process [32, 33, 35]. The number of ISs depends on the complexity of the sample matrices, with each IS requiring successful identification by the workflow’s conclusion [34]. These standards help to normalize data, minimize variability, and augment reliability [36]. Additionally, QC samples are a reference point to validate the outcomes derived from the NTS process [36]. Ensuring that the sample used in the laboratory accurately reflects the real environmental matrix is crucial. It can be done by comparing the standard deviations of sample replicates with those from pooled samples [33, 35]. Pooled samples should also be used for method development to assess and optimize various parameters during sample extraction, data acquisition, and data processing, which is common in metabolomics and can easily be transferred to NTS in water analysis [34, 37]. In the context of QA/QC, quantifying substances identified in NTS accurately presents challenges due to complexities tied to sample matrices, concentrations, and compound characteristics. Although methods like predicted ionization efficiency can be employed to calibrate concentrations against known standards — which will be discussed further in the subsequent section — it should be noted that existing predictive quantification methods in NTS do not meet the same standards as conventional quantification techniques [36, 38]. Predictive quantification in non-target screening involves estimating the quantity of substances based on signal normalization. Due to inherent variations and uncertainties, an acceptable signal enhancement is often set between 30 and 150% of the original signal, depending on the specific context of the analysis. Deviations outside these limits may indicate potential errors or biases in the NTS process [33]. The advancement and adoption of open-access data processing tools are pivotal for transparent and reproducible NTS results [34]. Reporting data processing and data analysis details is crucial as various algorithms provide significantly different findings, which is still one of the biggest challenges in NTS data processing [6, 20]. However, encouraging interlaboratory comparability investigations can enhance the consistency and comparability of results across different laboratories [33]. Regarding data evaluation, the human element remains a significant unknown. Consequently, it is essential to utilize objective calculation methods, such as those for data similarity considerations, like isotope matching. These methods provide an unbiased evaluation for identification and should be given precedence over subjective approaches such as visual assessments [6, 39]. Clear and detailed guidelines are required for reporting the identification of unknown features and assessing the confidence level [34, 35, 40]. The proposed Identification Points (IP) scoring system by Alygizakis et al. (2023) is based on the already well-established scoring system by Schymanski et al. (2014) [39, 40]. It aims to establish objective standards for non-target screening results, thus improving consistency and quality in data interpretation [39]. In certain instances, penalties can be applied to the IP score, such as when recorded data-dependent scans are lacking or poor fragmentation is observed [39]. An overview in Fig. 2 summarizes the essential elements of QA/QC for NTS. Fig. 2 Overview of the essential elements of QA/QC for NTS in water analysis Full size image Selected NTS approaches in water analysis studies NTS has been rapidly advancing in recent years since it provides a more holistic view of chemical exposure patterns in different environmental samples by combining HRMS with LC or GC. However, GC-HRMS is still insufficiently utilized compared with LC-HRMS despite the large spectral databases available (e.g., NIST20 and Wiley 11) [5, 19]. Moreover, combined methods have only been used in very few cases [41, 42]. Undoubtedly, further progress would be in developing GC-/LC-HRMS-based NTS workflows for the same aqueous environment. As a result, chemical space coverage can be efficiently increased in various NTS applications, depending on the study design and research questions. The same holds for multidimensional chromatographic systems, HILIC-to-reverse phase chromatography, and combined workflows using different ionization technologies. NTS workflows have been advancing by adopting passive sampling devices (PSDs) to sample streams and multi-watersheds, which have advantages such as time integrity, cost-effectiveness, fewer disruptions, and greater sensitivity, all of which are beneficial for determining pollution status in streams and determining pollution level [5, 11, 28, 43]. Thus, PSD-based strategies can be exploited to capture both “aggregate” and “cumulative” exposure information about environmental pollution. In summary, using combined strategies in sampling, sample preparation, instrumental measurements, and data acquisition modes, namely data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) in NTS workflows leading to higher chemical coverage in the aquatic environment, is highly recommended. However, experimental and operational limitations, availability, and complexity of recorded data should be considered [11, 44]. These considerations also apply to the combined target, suspect, and non-target strategies in different NTS scenarios [5, 45]. However, exhaustive elucidations remain challenging and laborious since they need to be confirmed with reference standards and manually verified. Thus, peak prioritization, or specifying the most reliable subset of chemicals based on the research question, is a fundamental part of many NTS studies. Such prioritization ensures that elucidation efforts are focused on the most relevant chemicals and mitigate the risk of overlooking potentially hazardous pollutants. As a result, environmental risk assessment and management efforts could be facilitated using such an approach. There has been a growing number of strategies for prioritizing, whether by effect-directed analysis (EDA), exposure-driven approaches, or their combination [11, 36]. The most recent examples of exposure-driven prioritization strategies are time series LC-HRMS prioritization based on deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) [46] and group-wise PCA (GPCA) [26], spatiotemporal-based prioritization using PLS-DA-VIP, ASCA(+) [28], binary comparisons using sparse ASCA (GASCA) [22], highly polar pollutant prioritization [47], removal rate ranking in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) [48] and source (urban and agricultural) related prioritization [49]. NTS chemical fingerprinting and quantitative source tracking have also been improved in recent years from a method development perspective [50] and in real-world applications, suggesting that a reliable diagnostic subset of features or “smart tracers” can predict pollution sources in watersheds, their relative locations, and quantify processes that are beyond the capabilities of conventional ecosystem sensors through the advancement of ML-based workflows [25]. Alternatively, recent studies suggest that hazard-driven prioritization based on MLinvitroTOX [51], a classifier based on both structural and MS2 data, and online prioritization [52] based on an intelligent MS2 acquisition method could be helpful to focus identification efforts on features with the most significant potential to harm the environment, rather than those that are most abundant. The use of NTS in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is on the rise. It offers several advantages, including the identification of unknown transformation products (TPs), understanding how the water matrix influences the formation of new TPs, determining treatment efficiency on a global scale, detecting abnormalities early, optimizing processes, and making decisions [5, 53]. Furthermore, it was found that AOP treatment evaluation can be improved by adding supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)-HRMS to the LC-HRMS-based workflow for identifying unknown persistent and mobile organic compounds (PMOCs) found in groundwater samples to achieve greater detection coverage of highly polar compounds [54]. NTS workflows face significant challenges in identifying a prioritized chemical based solely on its accurate mass and MS/MS fragmentation patterns. In particular, for LC-HRMS and with available databases for GC-EI, the assignment of tentative structures in an expert and validated way is still a great challenge and is tedious and time-consuming. Searching in large compound databases (e.g., Massbank, mzCloud, ChemSpider, and PubChem) for possible structures of an elemental formula typically results in numerous hits that need to be ranked and considered further by available MS/MS recorded data, retention time (RT) plausibility, provided meta-data, and limited comparability among instruments, as well. Moreover, developing different in silico tools (Metfrag and CSI: FingerID integrated with SIRIUS) for predicting MS fragmentation patterns and RT predictions using QSPR models are additional validation criteria in NTS workflows and reducing false positive findings. Smaller databases such as STOFF-IDENT [55] and CompTox [56] could facilitate the identification of prioritized unknown chemicals. PubChemLite, a subset of PubChem, was introduced by Schymanski et al. in 2020 for more efficient identification efforts in exposomics and environmental research [7]. Recent progress has been made regarding improving chemical identifications through integrating experimental spectra (ENTACT) into MassBank and developing automated workflows to support non-targeted exposomics and NTS surveys on aquatic samples [57, 58]. A further improvement may be achieved by adding spectral data measured over different types of HRMS systems under varying conditions. Quantification in NTS Quantitative non-target screening (qNTS) is one of the newest analytical fields with substantial challenges, such as the absence of analytical standards, variable ionization efficiency across laboratories and instruments, and the complexity of samples that range from effluents to drinking water [38, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. However, recent advancements have brought promising solutions to the forefront. Methods like ionization efficiency-based quantification and machine learning models have improved accuracy [38, 59, 60, 62]. These models, predominantly based on the Random Forest approach, provide reliable predictions and allow for applying different prediction strategies depending on the confidence level of the analytical signal. Additionally, they enable comparability across different laboratories, instruments, and analysis methods [64]. Nevertheless, these advancements have their limitations. Discrepancies in complex matrices, significant errors in modeling approaches, and variability between different instruments and matrices pose challenges [59, 60, 64]. Notably, the need for reference standards for the vast diversity of chemicals can limit quantification accuracy, hindering the progress of non-targeted screening [3]. Looking ahead, the field of NTS is ripe for evolution. The development and improvement of models, especially those utilizing machine learning, are vital future directions. Increasing the range of detectable chemicals and optimizing prediction accuracy could revolutionize the NTS era. Moreover, there is a pressing need to continue monitoring and managing identified substances. This need will require authorities to control the release of prioritized substances and new chemical candidates, an effort that will undoubtedly shape the future landscape of NTS in aquatic environments. Recent advancements in qNTS emphasize its adaptability and the scientific community’s dedication to refining its methods for more accurate results. From grappling with quantification accuracy to harnessing the power of machine learning, qNTS continues to evolve in response to the challenges it faces. As we look to the future, the field stands ready to embrace new techniques and strategies, all in pursuit of more effective detection, identification, and quantification of unknown chemicals.

Note: PPCPs: Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products; TPs: Transformation Products; PFAS: Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalky Substances; DBP: Disinfection Byproducts; eDNA: environmental DNA Full size image Conclusion and outlook Recent advances in NTS of aquatic environments include improved QA/QC guidelines, advanced data processing tools, more comprehensive coverage of “chemical space,” novel prioritization strategies, and increased quantitative approaches. The number of environmental chemicals, suspects, and HRMS spectral databases is growing, and workflows are becoming increasingly automated for chemical identification and structural analysis. Future research needs and challenges related to NTS workflow performance assessment include establishing guidelines for all steps of NTS workflows, improving QA/QC measures, and refining result reporting. In this context, a first step has already been made by esteemed research networks, such as the NORMAN Network, BP4NTA, and the German Water Chemistry Society, who provided guidelines and QA/QC service tools for reporting [3, 4, 66]. Additionally, the initiation of the official norm process for ISO standards marks a significant stride toward standardizing QA/QC in NTS, and its establishment will undoubtedly shape and enhance the practice of QA/QC in NTS in the foreseeable future [67]. The IP scoring system can be further enhanced and adjusted as technological advancements increase data availability. A transition from primarily qualitative to quantitative approaches in NTS could improve the overall quality and accuracy of NTS [36]. QA/QC in NTS data processing must become a focal point for future developments. Currently, valid uncertainty estimation of NTS results is seldom achievable as individual intermediate results are not collected or considered during the complex multi-step NTS data processing [6]. The role of the evaluating analyst in making critical decisions, such as setting input parameters for data processing and analysis, has yet to be studied. Future developments should strive for uniform evaluation criteria, standardized protocols, and the inclusion of statistical methods to describe qualities and uncertainties. From a QA/QC perspective, developing and openly providing reference datasets is crucial, enabling result verification and characterizing strengths, weaknesses, and application ranges of data processing methods. Different open-source software platforms and statistical packages have been developed and are available for HRMS data preprocessing/processing water samples. Significant progress has been made in integrating multivariate chemometrics methods and AI/ML tools into feature engineering, data formatting, peak annotations, and downstream data analysis, which has led to several opportunities for NTS discoveries in the future. These trends can be expanded to accommodate a variety of statistical approaches, comprehensive LC- and GC-HRMS measurements, and different MS2 acquisition modes. Moreover, incorporating the multi-way methods in NTS workflows as an alternative or complementary to the current packages can provide benefits such as providing “pure” qualitative and quantitative information on individual pollutants globally and robustly. Combination protocols and complementary tools have shown promise in different NTS areas. In this regard, the future expects researchers to conduct multiple robust ML and multivariate/univariate-based prioritizing strategies for selecting the most reliable subset of emerging pollutants based on significant ecological/health risks, environmental exposure/persistence/co-occurrence, or both in several real-world NTS scenarios. Furthermore, retrospective analysis and usage of archived HRMS data will increase due to the increasing trend of sharing data in FAIR repositories. Additionally, an emerging trend will be the integration of chemical NTS data with other data sources in water ecosystems, including Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods (e.g., for microbial communities), -omics-based approaches, ecological and hydrological parameters, and other environmental gradients, using advanced multiblock and statistical analysis tools (Fig. 3). Using integrative approaches allows us to better understand the environment and anthropogenic contaminants’ effect on ecosystem health and ultimately facilitate efforts to protect ecosystems.

The approach related to Precision Beekeeping is based on methodologies to mitigate the stress associated with human intervention in the colonies and the waste of resources. These goals are achieved by supporting the intervention and managing the beekeeper's timely and appropriate action at the colony's level. In recent years, the growth of IoT (Internet-of-Things) in Precision Agriculture has spurred several proposals to contribute to the paradigm of Precision Beekeeping, built on different technical concepts and with different production costs. This work proposes and describes an information systems architecture concept named BHiveSense, based on IoT and microservices, and different artefacts to demonstrate its concept: (1) a low-cost COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) hive sensing prototype, (2) a REST backend API, (3) a Web application, and (4) a Mobile application. This project delivers a solution for a more integrated and sustainable beekeeping activity. Our approach stresses that by adopting microservices and a REST architecture, it is possible to deal with long-standing problems concerning interoperability, scalability, agility, and maintenance issues, delivering an efficient beehive monitoring system.

Introduction The current digital transition is a remarkable and transformative phenomenon reshaping societies and revolutionising businesses worldwide. With rapid advancements in technology and connectivity, the world is witnessing a remarkable shift towards a digital-centric era. This transition is marked by the widespread adoption of digital technologies and the increasing reliance on digital platforms and services for various aspects of life (Guandalini, 2022). Agriculture, a vital economic activity for human survival as a species, has evolved throughout time, adapting - through the constant incorporation of innovation, to new challenges and realities where environmental balance and sustainability are keys (de Boon et al., 2022, Wu and Li, 2023). According to ISPA - International Society of Precision Agriculture, \"Precision Agriculture is a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyses temporal, spatial and individual data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production\" (ISPA, 2021). Precision Beekeeping is a branch of Precision Agriculture which extends these concepts to the specific area of apiculture in a systematic approach of beekeeping practices supported by the consistent integration of all the information necessary for beekeeper's decision-making, efficient use of resources and sustainably maximising production (Hadjur et al., 2022). The world has been slowly but relentlessly witnessing the degradation of honeybee colonies. The role of these insects in the balance of ecosystems, environmental health and preservation of life is crucial. Further than the production of honey, beeswax, royal jelly and propolis, bees' pollination activity is essential to the proliferation of a wide variety of plant species (Kasiotis et al., 2021, Ullah et al., 2021). This phenomenon of decreased activity in apiaries, known as CCD (Colony Collapse Disorder), is characterised by a drastic and sudden reduction in the bee population. The causes of this problem are not yet fully identified, but scientists tend to converge towards multiple factors that can act alone or in combination, contributing to the decline of bee populations (e.g., mites and viruses, malnutrition, pesticides, beekeeping practices, genetically modified crops, etc.) (Cecchi et al., 2020, Hong et al., 2020). The introduction of systems that allow monitoring of apiary production and environmental conditions, inside and outside the hives, has been proposed through several solutions aiming to mitigate this phenomenon. These devices generate data to understand better which factors most affect productivity, honeybee activity, and hives' health. Besides data collecting and scientific analyses to better understand and mitigate CCD, these systems are also focused on directly supporting beekeepers in their activity by signalling situations that require human intervention in apiaries, either by triggering alarms and sending notifications or signalling events on monitoring panels. These features lead to fast and focused intervention while diminishing negative impacts in apiaries, fitting these systems within the paradigm of Precision Agriculture and Precision Beekeeping. The expansion of IoT systems in recent years has been paralleled by generalised access to low-cost COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) components. Within these conditions, some remote monitoring systems have been proposed to reduce apiary maintenance costs and increase colony production and data collecting for scientific and investigation purposes. These contribute to CCD mitigation and a better understanding of the factors affecting beekeeping activity. Our proposed solution aligns to contribute to more sustainable apiary management, both in terms of productivity maximisation, colony health and well-being, by conceptualising an architecture for precision beekeeping based on microservices, focused on flexibility, modularity, scalability, replicability and adaptability, granting interoperability, a significant low-cost production, and low-complexity maintenance. To demonstrate and evaluate the adequacy of the proposed conceptual artefact, a remote sensing hardware prototype, a Web App, and a Mobile App, both served by a REST-based (Representational State Transfer) backend API were developed, and these will be described later in this article. Hence, in summary, our research highlights are as follows: • There is a clear need to establish innovative, scalable and agile beehive and apiary monitoring solutions based on IoT to not only provide beekeepers with an additional layer of support for his decision-making process but also to ensure he is alerted when the beehives need in-loco attention; • Monitoring solutions based on microservices architectures tend to be more agile, scalable, maintainable and performant when compared to solutions based on other types of architectures; • A novel IoT-based beehive monitoring solution supported by a microservices architecture that can easily encompass additional sensing nodes and functional modules is proposed; • The proposed monitoring solution has been tested using a controlled case study, and it was possible to establish that it not only delivered valid and accurate results, but also presented adequate performance and stability. This paper is organised as follows: in Section 2, we present the related work, while in Section 3, the selected methodology and the process model approach are described in detail. Section 4 describes the conceptual architecture, and the validation artefacts are presented and evaluated. In Section 5 and 6, we offer the conclusions and suggest topics for future work. 2. Related work 2.1. Remote monitoring One of the main challenges associated with Agriculture 4.0 is the development of remote monitoring systems and solutions that can aid farmers in improving the control they have on their farms and continuously fostering production efficiency and sustainability (Dayioglu and Turker, 2021). As established by Abbasi et al. (2022), when applied to the agriculture sector, the remote sensing field of the study refers to the development and deployment of sensor networks – composed of multiparameter sensing nodes – that can ensure connectivity between all the elements of the network and a central connectivity node, system, service or API. Furthermore, drawing on Khujamatov and Toshtemirov (2020), despite the referred sensing network's potential impact towards the development of the agri-food sector, they are somewhat dependent on the degree of complexity and ability to accurately monitor - and report the collected data - the set of predefined parameters of each of the sensing nodes. Remote monitoring systems for hives integrated into apiaries is an area of research where a relevant effort has been made and with a significant set of literature, mainly focused on hardware, its complexity, and how data generated by these devices contribute to Precision Beekeeping. This branch of Precision Agriculture is defined as a strategy for apiary management based on monitoring individual colonies (hives) with the goal of not only minimising resource consumption and maximising production sustainably but also optimising beekeeping activity and CCD mitigation (Zacepins et al., 2015). Precision beekeeping's focus is to supply beekeepers with access to intelligent and automated tools that reduce their workload, maintain long colony life cycles, and increase productivity. Alongside this, it is also important to establish this technological scope and focus on protecting the colonies and their continuous sustainability (Uthoff et al., 2023). Also, the use of remote monitoring systems and solutions will aid beekeepers as – due to the wireless technologies inherent to the sensor networks and nodes, data on apiaries can be accessed at any moment, in near real-time, on any devices (e.g., mobile devices), thus avoiding unnecessary travel and expenses (Hong et al., 2020). In summary, remote sensing solutions are one of the most promising technological solutions for precision beekeeping (J. Navarro et al., 2022). 2.2. IoT-based remote monitoring Drawing on authors such as Symeonaki et al. (2022), IoT is increasingly assuming a central role as a trigger for the development of innovative and disruptive (remote) monitoring systems based on sensing nodes that are continuously interconnected, that are both scalable and agile in the incorporating of updates when facing new needs, and that are globally interoperable. Furthermore, existing literature also holds multiple examples of IoT-based applications, frameworks, ontologies and methodologies (Chukkapalli et al., 2020, Farooq et al., 2020, Symeonaki et al., 2022). IoT-based remote monitoring in Agriculture 4.0 refers to using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor and manage agricultural operations remotely (Abbasi et al., 2022). It involves the integration of sensors, devices, and connectivity solutions to collect and transmit data from various agricultural assets, such as crops, livestock, soil, and equipment. From a more practical perspective, when applied to the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm, IoT-based remote monitoring is perceived as an enabler of real-time data acquisition and analysis, offering farmers, livestock breeders, poultry farmers, pig farmers, goat farmers, beekeepers, and many other industry players valuable insights for decision-making, optimising resource usage, and improving overall efficiency. The key components of this system include IoT sensors, network connectivity, data processing, and visualisation tools (Araújo et al., 2021, Maffezzoli et al., 2022). IoT sensors are deployed in agricultural environments to capture and collect data (Roy and De, 2022). These sensors can measure various parameters, including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH levels, nutrient content, rainfall, air quality, and livestock behaviour. They can be placed in fields, greenhouses, animal housing, and machinery to monitor critical factors affecting agricultural productivity continuously (Swain et al., 2021). The collected data from IoT sensors is transmitted via wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi, cellular networks, or Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN), to a centralised platform or cloud infrastructure for storage and analysis (Miranda et al., 2019). The data obtained from IoT-based remote monitoring systems can be analysed using advanced analytics techniques and algorithms. Machine learning and data modelling approaches can be employed to detect patterns, identify anomalies, and derive actionable insights (Pyingkodi et al., 2022). For example, predictive analytics can help anticipate weather conditions, disease outbreaks, or crop growth stages, facilitating proactive interventions and resource planning (Xu et al., 2022). Visualisation tools, such as dashboards and data visualisations, enable users to understand the collected data intuitively. These tools can present real-time information, historical trends, and alerts in a user-friendly format, allowing farmers to monitor the status of their agricultural operations at a glance and respond promptly to emerging challenges or opportunities. Thus, IoT-based monitoring can trigger the arise of decision support systems that, drawing on real-time data collection, analysis, and visualisation, can aid farmers in their daily decision-making tasks and their strategic planning (Zhai et al., 2020). The benefits of IoT-based remote monitoring in Agriculture 4.0 include improved resource management, enhanced productivity, reduced costs, and increased sustainability. Farmers can optimise irrigation, fertilisation, and pest control practices by continuously monitoring key parameters, leading to better resource allocation and minimising environmental impact. Additionally, early detection of anomalies or deviations in crop health or livestock behaviour can help prevent losses and improve overall yield and animal welfare (Maffezzoli et al., 2022). Hence, drawing on the arguments above, IoT-based remote monitoring in Agriculture 4.0 leverages sensor technology, connectivity, data analysis, and visualisation to enable real-time monitoring and decision-making in agricultural operations. This approach empowers farmers to manage their assets more efficiently, respond to changing conditions promptly, and adopt precision agriculture practices for sustainable and productive farming. 2.3. Beehive monitoring using IoT-based solution Bees are vital in pollination, supporting global food production and maintaining ecosystem biodiversity. However, in recent years, bee populations have faced significant challenges due to climate change, habitat loss, and pests (Panziera et al., 2022, Patel et al., 2021). To address these concerns and ensure the well-being of bee colonies, beekeepers and researchers are turning to IoT-based solutions for beehive monitoring (Hong et al., 2020). To this point, multiple authors aimed to deliver IoT-based solutions to monitor beehives and, consequently, foster bee sustainability. As easily perceived by analysing existing literature, the majority of proposed solutions have a similar backbone structure that is composed of multiple sensors connected to a microcontroller and to a communication hub, all of these powered by a battery system that serves the purpose of relaying the collected data with the remote servers (Andrijević et al., 2022, Aydin and Nafiz Aydin, 2022, Cecchi et al., 2020, Hong et al., 2020, Imoize et al., 2020, Kontogiannis, 2019, Tashakkori et al., 2021, Zacepins et al., 2020). Hence, we can extrapolate that, from a conceptual perspective, the main modules of a beehive monitoring solution are as follows: • A MCU - Microcontroller Unit (also known as the brain of the entire solution) that collects data from the sensors and communicates these readings to a remote server at regular intervals; • A set of sensors physically connected to the microcontroller or communicating with it via wireless protocols; • A source of electrical energy consisting of a battery connected or not to a photovoltaic solar panel through a charge regulator (i.e., a solution mainly adopted for remote installations). The sensing module, i.e., the set of sensors used to collect data, is typically located inside the hive, although there are cases of sensors placed on the outside of that hive or in its proximity. Concerning the MCU, these are generally placed outside, on the roof of the beehive (Khairul Anuar et al., 2019), in COTS dedicated boxes or 3D printed solutions similar to the one proposed by Tashakkori et al. (2021). The isolation of the MCU allows protection against the defensive and natural behaviour of the honeybees. The design of a remotely monitored hive must also be carefully planned, trying to anticipate the obstacles that may arise in its development and assembly (Ntawuzumunsi et al., 2021). Based on Bellino et al. (2022) and Voudiotis et al. (2021) arguments, the main module of an apiary remote monitoring system is the microcontroller unit. This element is responsible for iteratively executing a firmware that updates all sensor readings, prepares the data in a specific data format, and sends it to a Web server. Several COTS microcontroller units have been tested and integrated into remote monitoring systems. Despite the relevant amount of cases using the \"NODE ESP32\" model as the MCU (Andrijević et al., 2022), \"NODE ESP8266\" model is more widely used (Imoize et al., 2020, Jegan et al., 2021, Zacepins et al., 2020) as the results of its higher performance, easier connections to external components and easier programming. This last MCU also has an onboard Wi-Fi module – an added value to those developing the monitoring solutions - and is considered low-cost. In some more recent research, \"Arduino\" family units are also used. Examples of this are both the Catania and Vallone (2020) and Ntawuzumunsi et al. (2021) works, where the authors used an \"Arduino ATmega2560\", and also Kontogiannis (2019) used an \"Arduino ATmega328\" as the MCU of the proposed monitoring solution. Other platforms, such as \"Raspberry Pi\", have also been used by researchers when offering their remote monitoring solutions (Cecchi et al., 2020, Tashakkori et al., 2021). 2.4. Beehive monitoring parameters In recent years, bee populations have faced significant declines due to various environmental factors and the threat of colony collapse disorder. To address this issue and support beekeepers in their efforts to protect these essential pollinators, beehive monitoring has emerged as a promising solution (Anwar et al., 2023). Beehive monitoring involves using advanced technology to gather real-time data and insights from beehives. By deploying various sensors within the hive, beekeepers can monitor critical parameters such as temperature, humidity, weight, and sound. These sensors provide valuable information on the overall health and well-being of the colony, allowing beekeepers to make informed decisions and intervene promptly if necessary (Abdollahi et al., 2022, Bellino et al., 2022). One of the primary benefits of beehive monitoring is the early detection of potential issues. For example, sudden changes in temperature or humidity levels may indicate that the hive is under stress, and swift action can be taken to identify and address the underlying problem, such as disease or pests (Zaman and Dorin, 2023). Tracking the hive's weight can offer insights into honey production and help beekeepers determine the optimal time for honey harvesting, ensuring maximum yield while leaving enough honey for the bees' sustenance (Robustillo et al., 2022). As established by authors such as Ntawuzumunsi et al. (2021) and Szczurek et al. (2023), ensuring efficient and effective multiparameter monitoring of a given beehive is essential to assess its overall health and production (perspectives). The related literature also unveils a set of indicators that are commonly used for both beehives and apiaries monitoring systems that serve the purpose of delivering insights on the occurrence of essential changes that can potentially indicate the need for human intervention to preserve the colony: • Weight: monitoring the weight allows beekeepers to have necessary inputs concerning the state of a hive (Meikle et al., 2016). Providing this data in almost real-time lets for the arise of valid perceptions of the state of the hive. The decrease in the hive's weight tends to represent the occurrence of events for which it is critical to unravel the origin and totality of the impact generated. Examples of these events are the increase or decrease of the colony population size, the existence of adverse environmental conditions that might have triggered the need to supply food, the occurrence of swarming, or the honey harvesting itself (Cecchi et al., 2020, Fitzgerald et al., 2015, Hong et al., 2020). Thus, monitoring weight allows beekeepers to have precise data to analyse the condition of the hives and indicates the need for harvesting or human intervention, all without disturbing the colony. • Temperature: honeybee reproduction demands that the air temperature inside the hive remains stable and floats, at the very worst, between + 15 and + 35ºC. To ensure the referred temperature stability, bees generate metabolic heat by grouping themselves in a cluster in case of lower temperature values or taking water to the hive's interior in case of higher temperature values, thus increasing humidity. Temperature stability is an important indicator of the colony's health status (Edwards-Murphy et al., 2016). According to Zacepins et al. (2016), the increase in temperature is also an important indicator of swarming, a natural phenomenon which, if not controlled by beekeepers, can result in crucial negative profitability impacts. • Humidity: monitoring the relative humidity inside the hives is a relevant variable for determining the state of the colonies and has a direct impact on productivity (Mohamed and Mansor, 2023). As established by existing literature, temperature and humidity vary according to the bee's subspecies (Gil-Lebrero et al., 2020). For instance, according to Hong et al. (2020), the relative humidity inside the hive must be between 90% and 95% to enhance the hatching of the eggs. On the other hand, authors such as Andrijević et al. (2022) pose that when maintaining a temperature of 35ºC and a humidity percentage of around 75%, beehives have better chances to ensure sustainable growth throughout. Hence, drawing on the above, it is very relevant to provide long-term monitoring of relative humidity inside the hive as it also contributes, alongside temperature, to prompt the beekeeper for immediate intervention. • Sound: The sound produced by bees can indicate the hive's overall health and vitality. A strong and healthy hive will produce distinctive sounds, typically associated with the worker bees' labour. In contrast, weak or stressed colonies might exhibit different sound patterns, reflecting potential issues that require attention, such as diseases, foraging activities, swarming or other colony events (Abdollahi et al., 2022). Hence, monitoring the sound of a hive will thus allow the collection of data that the beekeeper can use to, in parallel with the definition of alarm mechanisms, be able to react in anticipation of the occurrence of events or situations that put the health and sustainability of the hive at risk (Kulyukin et al., 2018, Murphy et al., 2015). • Population Size: Several works also refer to the population size as an indicator of the hive health and production level. Honeybee colonies can be likened to intricate systems, where their survival hinges on individual bees' quality, ability to adapt, and resilience to various pressures. Multiple stress factors interacting with one another are likely responsible for the mortality of colonies (Requier, 2019). Thus by ensuring efficient monitoring of the population size, beekeepers can actively anticipate serious issues that might endanger the beehive. The existing literature poses multiple proposals to count/estimate the number of bees that exist in a given beehive at a given time from an array of photoelectric or infrared sensors on both sides of the individual holes in the entrance of the hive that, by detect the sequence of the interruption of the radiation beams, can give information about the movement of the bees (i.e., leaving or entering the hive) that is finally used to estimate the population size (Struye et al., 1994), to systems that use RFID tags attached to the back of the bees to allow detection at the entrance of the hive (Schneider et al., 2012), and to real-time imaging systems that by a series of analysis to a set of collected images can detect each individual inside the hive (Ngo et al., 2019). 2.5. Power systems Despite representing a groundbreaking paradigm and playing a decisive role in remote monitoring and operational control for a multitude of contexts, as established by Ramson et al. (2020), one of its most critical aspects is the continuous assurance of power supply. If this is true for all situations where IoT-based remote monitoring is used, when focusing on this issue from the agriculture sector perspective this is even critical as the referred solutions must be deployed in remote areas where most of the times there isn't a technical supply grid that supplies power, energy or both (Liu et al., 2022). According to Sari et al. (2020), the choice for the optimal location for deployment of an apiary is made be considering a set of parameters that are intrinsically related to the beehive sustainability and production maximisation and not on the availability of internet connection or even local energy supply. Hence, and drawing on authors such as Zaceptins et al. (2015), we can easily establish that these are not the ideal condition to implement a precision beekeeping approach or solution. Remote apiary monitoring systems demand the existence of a stable and permanent electric power source, allowing a long-term and low-maintenance system operation (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). The typical location of apiaries, away from public power grids, represents a contingency that can be overridden by using autonomous power systems (Gil-Lebrero et al., 2016). In order to address the abovementioned issues, authors such as Andrijević et al. (2022), Fitzgerald et al. (2015), He et al. (2020), Kontogiannis (2019), and Murphy et al. (2015), have proposed a self-sustained power system using solar photovoltaic cells and batteries to compensate the intermittency of the solar energy availability, associated with low-power components. 2.6. Proposed architectures Proposing architectures that support scalable Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring solutions is of paramount importance in today's rapidly advancing technological landscape. As the number of connected devices and sensors continues to grow exponentially, scalable architectures are crucial for efficiently managing and processing the massive volume of data generated by these interconnected devices (Calvo et al., 2022). Scalability ensures that IoT monitoring systems can accommodate the increasing number of devices and users without compromising performance or reliability (Sharma et al., 2017). According to existing literature, using microservices is a key criterion for adopting a contemporary software architecture approach, where features such as scalability and flexibility, decentralised governance and data management and use, reusability, resiliency, technology stack, replaceability, and maintainability (Atitallah et al., 2022, Butzin et al., 2016, Cebeci̇ and Korçak, 2020, Lyu et al., 2020, Siddiqui et al., 2023). Several benefits are associated with the usage of microservices. Having a single responsibility, each microservice provides modularity for quick and easy deployment (Gan and Delimitrou, 2018) and enables agility and fast development (Marquez et al., 2021). A microservices architecture also delivers technology heterogeneity. Not only in software (coding language, frameworks, or database management systems) but also in hardware (Gan and Delimitrou, 2018). For communications between the sensing devices and the data and storage subsystems, the IoT-based remote sensing concept typically uses the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technology. In these conditions, having an access point is necessary and depends on the availability of: (i) a local Wi-Fi network using cable connections (ethernet); (ii) a local Wi-Fi connection based on mobile data networks. In the related work applied to beehive monitoring systems, Wi-Fi modules are the most frequent devices for data transfer (Andrijević et al., 2022, Ntawuzumunsi et al., 2021, Tashakkori et al., 2021). In several studies, it is also possible to determine the options for data storage. Several authors use MySQL (Hong et al., 2020, Zabasta et al., 2019) while others use NoSQL databases – MongoDB – (Komasilovs et al., 2019). From the analysis of previous research it is possible to identify authors who proposed concepts of simple, yet disruptive, solutions for beehive monitoring that are based on the abovementioned microservices architecture (Alifieris et al., 2023). Despite this, and as stated by the referred authors, at this point in time there is still a gap in what refers to the practical development and deployment of those conceptual proposal. 3. Methodology 3.1. Design science research We follow a Design Science Research (DSR) approach in this project. DSR is a proven methodology oriented towards problem-solving. DSR aims to improve human knowledge by creating innovative artefacts through disruptive solutions for real-world problems (Hevner et al., 2004). According to these authors, it is possible to identify a set of principles to apply DSR in information systems design, to produce artefacts whose utility, quality and efficiency must be rigorously verified, and the solution efficiently disclosed to the relevant stakeholders. This project is based on the Design Science Research Model (DSRM) proposed by Peffers et al. (2007) for information systems research. This model encloses a set of six nominal sequential activities (Fig. 1). However, the authors say that not always researchers would proceed in this sequential order. In practice, it is possible to start at almost any point and move in both directions. Download : Download high-res image (249KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. DSRM process model adapted from Peffers et al. (2007). The six sequential activities proposed by Peffers et al. (2007) are the following: Activity 1: Identify problem and motivation – In this activity, the specific research problem should be defined to atomise the problem conceptually so that the solution can capture its complexity. By justifying the value of a solution, researchers and the general stakeholders will be motivated to research, find the solution and accept the results. It also helps to understand the rationale linked to the researcher's understanding of the problem. For this activity, it is important to have knowledge of the state of the problem and the impacts of its solution. Activity 2: Deﬁne the objectives for a solution – conclude about the objectives of a solution starting from the problem definition and awareness of what is possible and practical. The objectives can be quantitative or qualitative and should be derived from rationality from the problem specifications. For this activity, knowledge about the state of problems and current solutions, if any, and their efficacy is required. Activity 3: Design and development – at this point, it is expected to create the artefact. Such prototypes are potential models, methods, or instantiations. Artefacts can also be new properties of technical, social, and/or informational resources. Conceptually, an artefact delivered in the context of a design research methodology can be any designed object in which a research contribution is embedded in the design. This activity includes also setting the artefact's desired functionality, its architecture and then developing the actual artefact itself. Resources required for going from objectives to design and development include knowledge of theory that can be brought to deliver a solution. Activity 4: Demonstration – this activity aims to demonstrate the use of the artefact to solve one or more instances of the identified problem. It can involve the use of the artefact in experimentation, simulation, case study, proof, or other activities. To demonstrate the artefact, an effective knowledge of how to use the artefact to solve the problem is needed. Activity 5: Evaluation – aims to observe and measure how the artefact supports the solution to the problem. The evaluation aims to compare the results from the demonstration of the artefact to those defined in the proposed solution. This activity demands mastery of metric and analytical tools and, depending on the nature of the artefact, can take many forms. Evaluation could include items such as a comparison of the artefact's functionality with the solution goals from Activity 2, objective quantitative performance measures such as budgets or items produced, the results of satisfaction surveys, client feedback, or simulations. It could include quantiﬁable measures of system performance, such as response time or availability. Conceptually, could include any relevant empirical evidence or logical proof. At the end of this activity, the researchers can decide whether to iterate back to Activity 3 to try to improve the effectiveness of the artefact or to continue to communicate and leave future improvements to subsequent projects. Activity 6: Communication – in this activity the problem, its relevance, the artefact, the degree of innovation and functionality, the rigour of the design and its efficacy must be communicated to other researchers and other audiences. Researchers may use the process model to structure their papers. Considering the context of this project in the field of Precision Beekeeping, its goals and its focus on the process model proposed by Peffers et al. (2007), we have structured the work along a six-step iterative process detailed in Fig. 2. Each step is directly related to the project development.

Proposed architecture In this chapter, the proposed architecture is described in detail. First, we identified, contextualised, and defined the problem, based on our goals and the related work. Then, we propose a solution based on the previously identified problem and the goal of implementing the necessary features. After this step, we designed and developed the artefact corresponding to the proposed architecture, and created four pilot artefacts for demonstration proposes. In the evaluation step, several tests were performed using these pilot artefacts. Finally, in the communication step, we present the knowledge disclosure, results, and future strategies. 4.1. Problem identification and motivation The problem identification and motivation start by analysing the main research question: what are the functional, technological, and architectural visions necessary for the deployment of a low-cost, COTS-based monitoring system, for apiary remote monitoring based on IoT? The answer to this question can be divided into four sub-questions: (1) What is the technical and functional framework for an apiary monitoring system?; (2) Which low-cost components should be selected and applied to produce an artefact allowing remote self-sustained apiary monitoring?; (3) Which technological architecture will best support the execution of an IoT-based system to apiary remote monitoring?; and, (4) What contextual limitations will have a bigger impact in the success of an apiary remote monitoring system? Despite the significant amount of work already proposed in this area of Precision Beekeeping, the literature review helped to identify a lack of focus on the global information system architectural concept for the delivered systems. It is clear that previous studies are well-oriented to describe prototypes that supply huge amounts of data to validate hypotheses concerning, e.g., the identification of the environmental variables that can provide important information about the state of the honeybee's colonies and their health, relating these variables with hive production and bee colony evolution. However, proposing a high-level conceptual architecture, and solid demonstration artefacts, based on more recent architectural and technological paradigms can contribute significantly to the field of Precision Beekeeping, also in the scope of the emerging paradigm of Artificial Intelligence, more specifically the subfields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, well known to be intensively data dependent. The problem characterisation was an iterative process which considered the extant literature and the current state-of-the-art of remote monitoring systems for Precision Beekeeping. This characterisation identified the main problem that motivates this project: the lack of an integrated solution describing an information system architecture for remote apiary monitoring, in terms of hardware, communications, data processing and storage, end-user application features, and data specifications. 4.2. Artefact features definition Considering the problem definition and the related context (Precision Beekeeping), the main artefact features were listed. As stated in the literature review, the main goal of Precision Beekeeping is to allow having almost real-time data collected from the bee colonies (hives). This data can provide the necessary information to assess the state of the colony in terms of health, the presence of predators or growing diseases, and natural events like swarming. For this project, to generate real and contextualised data, the choice was to monitor temperature, humidity (inside and outside the hive), the weight of the hive, and sound inside the hive, since these are the variables most mentioned as the most important to assess the state of the honeybee colonies. An additional mechanical sensor to detect if the hive lid is opened, by an animal attack, for example, was also included. By monitoring these variables, several important events can be detected generating alarms and notifications to the beekeeper. After being collected and processed by a physical device (sensing device), the data must be sent to a data processing unit (Web server) using a specific data format. The data is then processed before being stored for future analytics. During this process, several instant analyses can be performed to assess the actual state of the hive. This intermediate step will trigger and register events that will automatically generate notifications to the beekeeper using different approaches (e.g., push notifications, update monitoring dashboards, or sending e-mails). These notification events are triggered based on high levels of temperature or humidity inside the hive, swarming based on the sound level inside the hive and the evolution of the weight, and simple harvesting information by using a setpoint defined by the beekeeper. Also, in the scope of this work, management of the apiaries is an important feature. So, the system must also manage the scheduling of interventions (e.g., regular maintenance or cleaning), associated with apiaries, notifying the beekeeper when those calendar interventions are approaching, in a single and integrated interface. Several other features were also considered, like organisational aspects of the apiaries, registration of devices (hives), commissioning and decommissioning of devices in apiaries, analytical aspects like monitoring honey production (hive and apiary level), and event logs, among others. 4.3. Design and development of the architecture artefact The IoT can be defined as a worldwide network of unique interconnected devices, with sensing abilities, using communication protocols, leveraging computational capacities, and delivering services/capacity to provide data analytics (Gupta and Quamara, 2020). The most common architecture in IoT is the three-layer and four-layer (Ramachandran et al., 2022). The three-layer architecture, the most common, includes (i) a physical or perception layer, consisting of sensors and actuators that capture data or control acting devices, (ii) a network layer responsible for connecting the physical layer to, for example, servers, and (iii) an application layer that delivers applications to the users. The four-layer architecture is based on the three-layer approach, adding a new layer called the service layer. This layer acts as a middleware between the application layer and the network layer, managing access to different services and APIs. In this project, a proposal for a beehive remote monitoring system has been developed, based on a multilayer microservice-based architecture represented in Fig. 3. This architecture consists of six different layers: the physical layer, the user layer, the applications layer, the data layer, the microservices layer, and the data storage layer. Layers are interconnected with each other depending on the flow of data between them. Data flows from the physical layer to the microservices layer and then to the user layer thru the applications layer. Other services can be provided to the users (beekeepers) by several microservices. These services can or not depend on the data sent by the physical layer. Download : Download high-res image (543KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. BhiveSense high-level system architecture. Physical layer: the physical layer corresponds to the hive sensing nodes network (each node defined by a set of subsystems including sensors, communications, processing, and power) and an Internet gateway. Several different types of sensors can be placed inside and outside the hive, depending on the variables to monitor. As for the Internet gateway, a mobile data router is proposed for TCP/IP communications with the web server via HTTP requests (network layer). Yet, there is no dependency on the chosen technology since the same data specification format is used. User layer: the user layer is mainly composed by the beekeepers as the main stakeholders of the system. These stakeholders are the final users of the system in terms of the Precision Beekeeping context. In this work, and concerning the context of the proposal, the main stakeholders are the beekeepers. However, others could be identified, such as the system administrators or researchers in this field. Even though typical IoT architectures don't include a user layer and given that this work proposes a solution squarely contextualised in the field of Precision Beekeeping, we believe that underlining the set of stakeholders for this context in a dedicated layer is relevant. Application layer: different categories of software applications can be developed to use the collected data in the scope of an apiary monitoring and management system. Typical desktop, Web and mobile applications are proposed as possible solutions to deliver the entire features of the system, in the application layer. Also, this layer represents the user interfaces (front end) with which the stakeholders interact with the system. Independently from the type of application (desktop, Web, mobile or hybrid), the proposed REST-based architecture allows the integration of monitoring, management, and events notification preconised in this approach. Data layer: the data layer represents the data format specification for the proposed architecture. Different data formats can be provided by the data layer (e.g., XML, CSV, JSON, etc.) since REST-based APIs can handle messages in practically all data formats. We propose JSON due to its popularity, smaller size, and being more easily readable by humans. All messages flowing thru the proposed architecture use the JSON data format. Microservices layer: the microservices layer consists of a set of microservices to manage every data transaction and can have independent databases and/or data models. However, the more important feature of a microservice approach is that each one should have a single responsibility. For example, in the proposed solution, the HIVE module is only responsible for: (1) handling data between the physical layer and the client applications (applications layer), in a context of interoperability between components; (2) providing analytics regarding hive data upon request from the users. This layer is identical to the service layer described in the four-layer architecture approach. Data storage layer: the data storage layer is the layer responsible for persistent data storage, not only to provide real-time data to the user layer but also to deliver long-term data for analytics and apiary management purposes requested by other microservices. As per the user layer, we propose this layer to better underline the importance of data storage in the overall solution. 4.4. Demonstration of the proposed architecture The main data source for the proposed apiary monitoring system architecture is a physical device installed in each apiary hive. This device can gather different types of data, as much as is needed, not having any impact on the system architecture, since the same data format is followed. According to the DSR methodology adopted for this work, the demonstration step is crucial to assess the validity of any proposed artefact, by creating a suitable context and developing test/pilot artefacts for evaluation purposes. To demonstrate the proposed architecture, three pilot instances were developed: a node hive device (physical layer), a RESTful microservices-based API (microservices layer), and a Web and a mobile application (applications layer). These pilot artefacts are described below. 4.4.1. Hive node sensing device: hardware and firmware In the context of providing a hive node prototype to demonstrate the proposed architecture, a popular NODE MCU ESP8266 low-cost microcontroller was used. This unit is an open-source software and hardware development environment built around an inexpensive System-on-a-Chip (SoC) named ESP8266. The ESP8266 contains the crucial elements of a computer: CPU (32 bit-80Mhz), RAM (4MB), and networking (Wi-Fi). That makes it an excellent choice for IoT projects of all kinds. In terms of collected data, we selected temperature (inside and outside the hive), sound (inside the hive) and the weight of the hive. These variables are commonly referred to in related works as the most important for detecting the hive health, production levels and other dynamic honeybee behaviour like swarming. Isolated or combined, these variables provide crucial information for the context of this project. To monitor temperature and humidity inside and outside the hive, we used two low-cost and commonly used DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors. Concerning sound measurement, an Adafruit electret microphone (20–20KHz), with a MAX4466 amplifier and adjustable gain is used. As for weight, four strain gauges connected in a Wheatstone Bridge configuration were used with an HX711, a precision 24-bit analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) designed for weigh scales and industrial control applications, to interface directly with the bridge sensor. An additional GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) module is included to provide the geolocation of the hive and spot its position in a digital map (e.g., Google Maps), thus allowing the beekeeper to best find the location of a hive for intervention. The addition of this element can also enable future integrations in other research projects, for example, studies requiring spatial data and cross-information between colony data and the geographic position of the hives. The artefact also includes several mechanical sensors: two press buttons, one for resetting the GNSS module to provide new geographical coordinates (in case the hive switches apiary), one to calibrate the weight sensor, and a microswitch to detect if the hive lid has been opened to trigger an event alarm to the beekeeper. The proposed demonstration prototype is powered by a 7 V photovoltaic cell with a 3.3 V-1500mAh lithium-polymer (Li-Po) battery, controlled by a solar power manager for energy autonomy. The overall system schematic is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the installation in situ of the BHiveSense node hive prototype.

Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. BHiveSense hive node prototype – hardware. The hive node prototype firmware is coded in C/C+ +. However, any programming language could be used if another MCU or development board is used. The only important aspect is the data format in the scope of this solution. Before commissioning the hive node, the Internet gateway credentials (node ID, network SSID, and password) must be saved to the device while uploading the firmware. In the first iteration of the loop function, the system waits for GNSS fixing to get and save the latitude and longitude of the device in the Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM). In case the beekeeper decides to install the same node in a different hive, located in a different apiary, the EEPROM address containing the coordinates is cleared and the procedure to get the new coordinates is repeated for the new location. After this, the process reiterates: get updated readings from the sensors, turn the Wi-Fi connection ON and connect to the gateway, send HTTP POST request with the updated JSON body containing the last sensor readings, plus the device credentials, until receiving an HTTP response status of 200. After a successful POST request, the system idles for 10 min until it wakes up and a new iteration of the process starts. Fig. 6 shows the flow diagram of the hive node firmware.

Data model In the proposed architecture the data storage layer stores persistent long-term data to support apiary monitoring and management features, compatible with the Precision Beekeeping paradigm. Despite the ability to have different databases for different microservices, in this solution, we use a single MongoDB NoSQL database with several JSON data collections, each one linked with a separate microservice. Fig. 7 shows the data model schema for this project. The connection between each entity and the corresponding microservice is obvious. Several collections are proposed for normalisation features. The attribute data in the HIVE entity is an array of JSON instances. One instance is automatically created for each day, and the dayData array saves each JSON instance sent from the hive node device. This approach makes the analytics process faster and more efficient, for example, getting weekly or monthly data for the hive.

RESTful API The proposed backend architecture follows a modular, flexible, and robust architecture built under the HTTP protocol and REST, an architectural pattern known to ease Web service development (Cebeci̇̇̇ and Korçak, 2020). Due to the nature of HTTP, request/response communication are carried on synchronously. HTTP delivers this type of communication through blocking and awake approach. The use of an API (Application Programming Interface) with the REST architecture provides efficiency, procedure automation, and interoperability as the main advantages. REST also allows independent implementations from the server and client sides. The client only needs to know the endpoints to reach the resources delivered by the API and a known message format. In this case, we use JSON. Implementing the API gateway in a RESTful Web approach eases the use of microservices methods providing an interface, keeping it as simple as possible in our solution. The demonstration backend is implemented in NodeJS following the MVC protocol and the CRUD paradigm (Create, Read, Update, Delete) which corresponds to the methods POST, GET, PUT and DELETE in an HTTP environment. Fig. 8 shows the component diagram for the API and backend. Download : Download high-res image (275KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. BhiveSense component diagram (API). 4.4.4. API gateway module the API gateway module is the entry point for the backend application. This module handles the HTTP requests from the clients and routes them to the relevant module. The routing feature is a fundamental technique in a REST API. This module also runs a daily routine (CRON JOB) to detect if there are any near interventions scheduled for the next days (0 ≥ numDays ≤ 5) to notify the beekeeper. 4.4.5. Auth module this module contains all the login and authentication methods to secure the application. All request handling is subject to authentication control (token) before routing to the queue correspondent microservice. 4.4.6. User module is responsible for managing the user login and authentication, providing the tokens that are delivered in the response header and the necessary user data to the client. It also provides methods for user registration and account management. Apiary module: the Apiary module manages requests to perform all the operations concerning apiaries (e.g., create an apiary, update apiary data, delete the apiary, get apiaries for a specific user, etc.). Hive module: this module delivers methods to assign/unassign hives (node devices) to a specific user, register the hives in an apiary, and return the hive data to the users. It also has a method to handle the requests sent from the node devices to register a new data package. Interventions module: the Interventions module can register scheduled interventions for an apiary and handle requests to update, delete, or change its state to conclude. These microservices are related to apiary management, one of this solution's goals in the Precision Beekeeping paradigm. Harvest module: this module is responsible for registering harvest actions for each hive/apiary and delivers methods for production analytics by hive, apiary, or user. Message module: this is the module that groups methods to handle messages from the beekeepers (users) to the platform administration in case of the need to report any issue or problem with the system. Event module: this module handles requests related to events. It delivers the methods to create events and to change their status. This is the crucial microservice to trigger alarms to the beekeeper. An event is a particular situation that arises from hive data analysis in real-time. In this project, events are triggered in the following conditions: temperature or relative humidity inside the hive above the setpoint; the hive lid is open; the harvest setpoint has been reached; or a possible swarm situation has been detected. Notifications module: this module supplies the method and services to generate and send notifications to the users in case of new events or near future interventions scheduled. It delivers services to send e-mails or push notifications to the application layer instances. In this solution, we use an external microservice from OneSignal that eases sending a web and mobile push notifications. History module: in case the beekeeper decides to move a hive from one apiary to another, there are important procedures to carry out. First, the new location will be a different geographical point. Second, the beekeeper should have a way to decide about the accumulated data in the previous location. The history module provides the possibility to save the collected data when a hive is unassigned from an apiary, for future analytical proposes. 4.4.7. User applications 4.4.7.1. Web application To demonstrate the proposed system architecture, a web application was developed. This artefact was developed in a modern SPA (Single Page Application) approach, using the Vue.JS framework and several specific packages. The application offers distinct features to the beekeeper, according to project goals and identified problems in the scope of Precision Beekeeping. In the application, there are two main user levels: administrator and beekeeper. The first has access to different tools such as user administration, registering or managing devices in the system, or replying to beekeepers' messages. The beekeepers have access to different options, for example, to visualise aggregated information in a simple dashboard (Fig. 9), perform CRUD operations over apiaries or devices (hives), monitor detailed hive data (Fig. 10), view and manage event logs (Fig. 11), and several others feature like register harvest activities, monitor production by apiary or hive, and receive push notifications for events and alarms.

Download : Download high-res image (255KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. BhiveSense event log for user devices (Web). This platform also includes an intervention management service that allows the beekeeper to schedule interventions in each apiary, being notified in the dashboard and via e-mail when the intervention date is coming (less or equal to five days). The focus is on the information about important events that occurred in the hives such as abnormal values of temperature or humidity inside the hives, the hive lid opening, possible swarm events or near future interventions to come. The dashboard also shows the need for harvesting using the weight parameter and gives access to a complete log of events. The beekeeper also has the correct tools to register each harvest to control the production by apiary or hive. 4.4.7.2. Mobile application In addition to the web application, an extra demonstration artefact was developed, consisting of a mobile application (Android version). This tool was also implemented using a modern concept, with the framework Flutter, developed by Google. The application allows the beekeeper to monitor the state of the apiaries in a simple dashboard (Fig. 12a). The apiaries can be monitored individually (Fig. 12b), accessing their associated hives (Fig. 12c). Information about each hive parameter and the general hive state can be accessed on a dedicated screen (Fig. 12d). Both applications (web and mobile) also use the GNSS feature of the device prototype to give a geolocation dimension to the system (Fig. 12e). Like the web version, this application receives push notifications in case of the occurrence of important events that can indicate anomalies demanding the beekeeper intervention: hive inside temperature our air humidity higher than the setpoint, hive lid open, harvest setpoint reached or possible swarm situation (Fig. 12a), allowing a fast reaction from the beekeeper to prevent situations that could impact in the apiary production, or in the colony's health and behaviour.

Evaluation Conducting practical tests on an IoT-based monitoring solution for beehives presents several notable challenges that require thoughtful consideration (Wrysinski et al., 2023). Firstly, the ever-changing and unpredictable natural environment of beehives, with its diverse weather conditions, temperature fluctuations, and varied bee behaviour patterns, poses uncontrollable factors that can impact data collection and overall system performance. Ensuring consistent and reliable results becomes a demanding task. Secondly, the introduction of new technology like IoT devices into beehives might disturb or alter the behaviour of bee colonies. As bees are highly sensitive creatures, any disruptions to their habitat could cause stress and affect their natural activities, potentially influencing the accuracy of the collected data and the effectiveness of the monitoring solution. Moreover, the dispersion of beehives across different geographical locations creates logistical challenges for deploying and maintaining the IoT devices. Overcoming obstacles such as accessing remote areas, ensuring stable network connectivity, and powering the devices in isolated locations demands careful planning and resource allocation. Another crucial concern is the durability and safety of the IoT devices used in beehives. They must withstand harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures and moisture. Additionally, ensuring the quality, reliability, security and privacy of the collected data is of utmost importance. Any data bias or breaches could have serious implications for both the beekeepers and the bee colonies (Hadjur et al., 2022). Hence, real-life testing requires prolonged observation periods to understand the long-term performance and reliability of the IoT-based monitoring solutions. This extended testing demands significant time and resources, potentially delaying the evaluation of the system's effectiveness and hindering the pace of improvements or modifications (Abdollahi et al., 2022). Therefore, considering the aforementioned factors and taking inspiration from similar research (Heaton and Parlikad, 2019, Paganelli et al., 2022, Tamburis et al., 2020) where conceptual proposals underwent only initial validation but emphasized the need for real-life testing to assess all contextual aspects and biases, a series of initial evaluation procedures were undertaken to validate the adequacy of the proposed components, their compatibility, and interoperability. This step was critical to assess the proposed architecture and we used demonstration artefacts for this validation. As established by existing literature (Jacob and Mani, 2018, Popereshnyak et al., 2018), in order to validate the proposed artefact, an initial set of different types of tests was performed: unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. Unit tests were created and performed during the development of the demonstration artefacts to test each service provided by the REST API, individually, and ran often, as payloads and logic involved. These tests, performed using the Insomnia REST Client application (Insomnia, 2023), indicated that all the used sensors were able to individually perform according to the manufacturer specifications, thus allowing to collect data within expected sets of values. To test and evaluate the integration of the different services, several integration tests were performed in a top-down approach depending on the coverage of the components. These tests allowed us to evaluate if the several components and services work together in an orchestrated way. In order to perform the referred integration tests all sensing nodes were activated in parallel and were set in a \"data collection\" mode that enabled each one of them to effectively and simultaneously collect data and save it in the data storage module. After analysing the data collection and communication log it was possible to perceive that all activated sensing modules performed correctly and within the expected accuracy and performance levels. Finally, acceptance tests validate the user requirements (beekeepers), specifically if the several operations and monitoring features related to the Precision Beekeeping paradigm are implemented in the solution. These validations were based on a set of dynamic tests, using the entire system architecture. The REST API was deployed in a shared cloud server service, while the web and mobile applications were running in a local environment. The monitoring hardware was commissioned for five continuous months in a controlled environment composed of a beehive installed in similar conditions as it would be in a real apiary but without a bee colony installed inside. During this period, several events were induced to test the response of the system and validation of the architecture. For example, the hive lid was open, the temperature and humidity were intentionally raised, or sounds with frequencies compatible with swarming were simulated to test the response of the sensors and the action of the microservice responsible for triggering the events and notifying the beekeeper. 4.5. Communication The final step of DSR-based research is the communication of the entire project development and results, including the relevance of the research question, the proposed artefact, its design, innovation, and functionality must be delivered, disclosing the achievements to other researchers and related relevant stakeholders. This paper itself is integrated into this step. Considering the research and development stage of this work, future actions to communicate this work will be addressed, with planned dissemination sessions and workshops in the apiculture section of the Agricultural Development Services of the Azores (São Miguel Island), to engage beekeepers with the proposed solution. 5. Conclusions and future work Monitoring beehives and apiaries is critical to preserving both honeybee numbers and the delicate ecological balance that they support. Honeybees contribute greatly to agriculture as pollinators by supporting the reproduction of numerous fruit, vegetable, and nut crops. Beekeepers can monitor the health of colonies, detect and manage possible hazards such as diseases, pests, or environmental stressors, and implement appropriate remedies by frequently observing beehives. Timely monitoring also helps to reduce colony losses, which promotes food security and economic stability. Furthermore, knowing honeybee behaviour through monitoring allows researchers to acquire insights into their sophisticated social structure and communication patterns, allowing for the development of science-based conservation policies that are both sustainable and long-term. We can protect these important pollinators by investing in careful monitoring procedures. Using IoT-based monitoring systems and solutions provide vital aid in the abovementioned monitoring and administration of beehives and apiaries, thus offering an innovative approach to beekeeping. These smart systems collect real-time data on critical parameters such as temperature, humidity, hive weight, and even sound and movement patterns via a network of interconnected sensors, cameras, and gadgets installed within the beehives. This constant flow of data enables beekeepers to remotely monitor and assess hive conditions, allowing them to respond to any irregularities or signals of stress inside the colony as soon as possible. By configuring alerts and notifications, beekeepers can receive instant indications if conditions deviate from ideal, preventing potential problems. Furthermore, IoT monitoring solutions provide data insights and analytics that enable beekeepers to make more informed decisions. Microservices architectures have emerged as a powerful approach to building and managing complex systems, including IoT (Internet of Things) applications. In a microservices architecture, a large application is broken down into small, independent, and loosely coupled services, each responsible for specific functionalities. This modular design allows for greater flexibility and scalability, especially in IoT systems where the number of connected devices and data volume can vary significantly. By adopting microservices, IoT applications can easily scale up or down based on demand, as each service can be individually deployed, upgraded, or replicated as needed. This elasticity ensures that the system can efficiently handle varying workloads, making it well-suited to the dynamic and evolving nature of IoT environments. Additionally, microservices promote rapid development and deployment, allowing IoT applications to adapt quickly to changing requirements and technological advancements, while also enabling easier maintenance and fault isolation. With the above in mind the present research proposes a novel low-cost IoT-based monitoring solution supported by a microservices architecture and aimed at continuously monitor beehives and apiaries. From a formal perspective, the proposed solution well-framed and interoperable six-layer architecture ensures the needed agility and scalability that beekeepers require. In order to ensure the necessary validity to the proposed artifact, we have developed a prototype of the conceptual solution that has been tested using a controlled simulation environment. The achieved results allowed to attain that the proposed solution fulfils all the initially established functional and performance requirements, thus allowing us to consider it as a valuable contribute to both science and practice. 5.1. Limitations and future work This work has some primary limitations. Firstly, only one prototype for the hive node device was developed and tested. Although the tests were conducted in a natural laboratory with varying weather conditions, there were no tests conducted with an actual bee colony installed inside the hive. In the future, to fully validate the node sensing prototype's response in a broader and long-term context, it is essential to produce and install multiple identical hive nodes in different apiaries located in various places. This validation will also involve testing the hardware prototype with bee colonies installed in the hives. The plan is to collaborate with the local Agricultural Development Services of the Azores (São Miguel Island, Azores), who have agreed to deploy the proposed system in several of their apiaries for these tests. However, securing funds for replicating the devices is necessary for carrying out these tests. Despite these limitations, the tests conducted with the developed demonstration artifacts are considered sufficient to validate the functionality, scalability, and flexibility of the proposed architectural solution.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

  Explanation: Metadata is the use of other information to interpret data.  For example, to interpret information about the relative acidity or alkalinity of a water source, we need to know when the sample was collected. The time the water sample was collected is metadata. By knowing the time the water sample was collected we can use other data sources, such as local weather data or population data, to infer what factors might have contributed to the measured acidity or alkalinity.

Daliakopoulos  Part of the book series: Springer Water ((SPWA)) 815 Accesses 3 Citations Abstract Water information and data bases are used for addressing environmental, physical, social, political, economic, and ecological issues of water supply, consumption, availability, and accessibility. Different disciplines of water resources management, such as flood risk assessment, water supply management, reservoir operation, and water sanitation require incorporation of different types of water information for efficient planning and decision making. Therefore, this chapter aims to investigate the main features of water information, data sources, water data challenges, water data processing, analysis and dissemination which also play a key role in integrated and sustainable water resources management. This chapter begins with an introduction to the importance of data and information in various water disciplines as well as indication of data life cycle. Thereafter, different types of water data and sources (measurements, models, remote sensing, and administrative institutes) are proposed. Additionally, the challenges and limitation of water data, such as poor data quality, lack of integrated water portals, limited funds, and big data problems are discussed. This section is followed by indication of water data processing key points and steps of water data dissemination. Additionally, the World Hydrological Cyclone Observing System (WHYCOS), Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), and Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) are introduced as examples of important water data systems which improve development in delivery and use of water data, and evaluation of environmental impacts and risks.

The increasing pressure on water resources is the result of global drivers such as rapid population growth, industrialisation, inefficient water management, water pollution, climate change, serious imbalance between supply and demand, but also poor water data (World Bank 2018). Therefore, water security, reliable water supply, as well as environment and ecosystem protection are directly dependant on the level of efficiency, integration, and sustainability of water resources management. Data and information are denoted as the “life blood” of a research with the purpose of efficient water management and decision making. Hence, data is the foundation for well-informed decisions and sustainability that is required by all decision makers. Water data, or in other words measurements, is a key element in water resources management projects and planning. Water information is generated from water data through a process of analysis, integration, and interpretation. In other words, water information is the processed and synthesized form of water data. The generated water information should be combined with infrastructure and institution in order to reach an efficient water resources planning and management for both the current and uncertain future periods (Cantor et al. 2018). Different water management disciplines, such as the flood response, drought management, water supply systems, reservoir operations, water sanitation, groundwater management, and irrigation supply require incorporation of different types of water information for better decision making and water planning. Thus, decision makers and water organizations need to access water information with proper spatial and temporal resolution (Cantor et al. 2018). Additionally, provision of sound data with proper quality is essential as it can affect the decisions and management strategies. However, there have been debates among organizations and water sector participants that some provided data do not meet the need of water users. Additionally, some water information is not shared openly. Despite the development of technology and modern measuring devices, there are still many gaps in available water data, and the quality of some water information is also still unacceptable (BOM 2017). Therefore, unmet data needs can interfere the efficient and sustainable water management. Figure 3.1 indicates the data life cycle (NSF DataONE project 2017) and the required steps from the data need evaluation to the data application. The main nine steps of the data life cycle are as follow: Fig. 3.1 Data life cycle (Adopted from NSF DataONE Project 2017) Full size image Data need evaluation and planning: needs of decision makers are fully evaluated; Data collection: observations are performed; Data quality assurance: checks and inspections are required to analyse the data quality; Data description and documentation: data should be accurately described using the metadata standards and guidelines; Data preservation and archival: data should be preserved in a specific archive (e.g., data service and data centre); Data discovery: both useful and relevant data information should be obtained; Data integration: data from different sources should be combined; Data analysis: data should be interpreted; and Data release planning: data should be described, managed, and made accessible. Globally, water data and information is essential for sustainable planning, policy, management, and prediction. Additionally, water data provides decision makers with proper information about water demand, weather patterns, hydrologic modelling, infrastructure needs, climate change, and extreme events. This book chapter examines the important role of water data and information in integrated water resources management. It also provides an in-depth understanding of different water data types, sources, challenges, processing, and dissemination, which are essential for sustainable planning, policy, management, prediction, and decision making. Thereafter, examples of two international information systems (WHYCOS and GRDC) and a national water portal (BOM) are proposed to indicate how water data organisation can enhance climate trend analysis, water information products and services, and sustainable protection of water resources systems through regional and international cooperation. Finally, conclusions summarizes focal points of this work, and recommendations are proposed to help stakeholders discover and overcome limitations of current water data. 3.2 Water Data Type Water data is a set of information that can address issues associated with physical, environmental, social, economic, ecological, biological, chemical, cultural, and political parameters in disciplines such as water use, availability, and accessibility. Additionally, water data can consist of a complex mix of different formats, including spreadsheets, satellite images, geospatial databases, and photographs (Laituri and Sternlieb 2014). Generally, water data can be classified in two main categories: (1) Primary data and (2) secondary data. Primary data indicates the collection of raw data, including the data collected through measurements by technician and/or automated sensors. Measurements of water quality parameters, streamflow and precipitation are examples of primary data. Secondary data are obtained from models, specific methods, and lab experiments under controlled condition. Typically, models and methods apply primary data from different sources to compile and analyse them for estimating a variable. For instance, precipitation pattern, streamflow condition, irrigated area, and crop data can be combined through a model or method to estimate the agriculture water demand (Ziman 2016). Climatological models, hydrological models, processed remote sensing data or satellite images are some examples of secondary data (Laituri and Sternlieb 2014). In addition to these classes of water data, 12 extensive groups of water data can be developed based on disciplines or sectors where water data is applied (BOM 2017). Detailed classifications of water data with respective examples are shown in Table 3.1. Table 3.1 Water data types together with data sources and examples Full size table All the stated data are essential for efficient decision making in different water disciplines, including the sectorial water management, integrated water sector planning, climate change adaptation, global and regional reporting, as well as operational and emergency management. Additionally, the type of required data for a specific project relies on the type of activity and plans. For instance, a flood inundation project will not require the same data as a peak flood prediction project. Additionally, the temporal and spatial resolution of the required water data should be specified for each project. For instance, the hourly river flow is generally applicable to peak flow prediction, and estimation of flash flood peak flows requires even higher temporal river flow resolution (e.g., minutes), while the daily river streamflow is required for analysis of river flow due to changes in land use pattern. Thus, the researchers and managers are required to consider the required data type and resolution from the beginning of a project. 3.2.1 Water Data Source Different distinct types of water data are required to determine water quality and quantity to achieve efficient integrated water resources management. Water data is obtained through different sources and methods. Basically, the water data comes from four sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and (4) administrative institutes (BOM 2017). Each of the stated sources will be discussed in the next four sections. 3.2.1.1 In Situ Measurements Water resources management constitutes a data-driven discipline, which involves consistent measurements of water quantity and quality. The measurements are mainly concerned with monitoring meteorological and hydrological variables (BOM 2017). In order to measure water variables, including physical, chemical, and biological parameters, specific methods and instruments are applied. For example, water level can be measured using different techniques such as a float and shaft encoder, a radar or an ultrasonic level sensor (NIWA 2019), turbidity by determining the intensity of light scattered by suspended particles in the water column (EHMP 2006–07), and biological contamination using E. coli concentration as a marker (Edberg et al. 2000). In addition to the variables which come from direct measurement, some other variables are calculated according to a mathematical transformation of a direct measurement. For instance, river discharge is computed by multiplying the water area in a channel cross section by the water average velocity in that cross section (BOM 2017). In situ measurements can yield the most reliable water data, provided that the measuring devices are precise and properly calibrated. The restriction of direct measurements is the high cost of purchasing, installing, calibrating, fixing, and maintaining the measuring devices and equipment. Additionally, regular monitoring should be conducted periodically to obtain the proper data length and spatial coverage, and therefore, constant financial support and effort are required to manage the long and intensive monitoring programs (BOM 2017). Due to the discussed high costs, many poor countries suffer from improper and inadequate water data, which can directly affect the water management planning and strategies. This issue necessitates the provision of financial support by international agencies and organizations to improve the water monitoring networks in poor countries dealing with critical water supply and management problems. 3.2.1.2 Remote Sensing In 1957, the Sputnik 1 was the first artificial earth satellite that placed into orbit. This satellite had significant impact on humanity’s perception of space, and announcing a new era if earth observation. After launching the Sputnik 1, several systems (e.g., Television and InfraRed Observation Satellite (TIROS 1), Nimbus 1 etc.) were launched in the following year to weather and climate conditions. Such satellite missions led to dramatic advances in remote observations and measurements (McCabe et al. 2017). Remote sensing refers to the process of inferring surface parameters, which are derived from measurements of the emitted/reflected electromagnetic radiations, from the land surface (Schmugge et al. 2002). The application of remote sensing in hydrological sciences has provided new datasets with high temporal and spatial resolution for continuous water resources observations, which addresses the low resolution and expensive in situ measurements. Figure 3.2 indicates the earth observing system applied in hydrological sciences. The stated system consists of several components, signals of opportunity (e.g., cars, mobile phones), Doppler radar, mobile rovers, smart phone and citizens science (e.g., simple image capturing, plug-in and Bluetooth technologies), cell signals (e.g., antennas), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (e.g., drones), research balloons, airborne vehicles, CubeStas, high definition (HD) videos, satellite missions (e.g., Landsat 1–8), sensors aboard the International Space Station (ISS), and geosynchronous meteorological satellites (McCabe et al. 2017). Fig. 3.2 Earth observing system (Adopted from McCabe et al. 2017) Full size image There are two types of remote sensing instruments: i) active and ii) passive. These instruments are mounted on satellites, drones, vehicles, aircrafts, and ground-based structures to measure different water data parameters, such as soil moisture, evaporation, water temperature, rainfall rate, sediment concentration, flood inundation area, rainfall distribution, surface topography, wind speed and direction, cloud composition, and air humidity (BOM 2017). Active sensors provide their own source of energy for emitting radiation towards the investigated target, and then measure the time of arrival radiation reflected from the target. The majority of active sensors are able to perform in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Hence, these sensors can potentially penetrate the atmosphere under rough conditions. Laser altimeter, radar, Lidar, Ranging instrument, Scatterometer, and Sounder are examples of active sensors (NASA 2019). On the other hand, passive sensors detect natural energy (light wavelength) which is emitted or reflected from the observed scene. The common source of radiation measured by passive sensors is the reflected sunlight. Passive sensors include various types of spectrometers and radiometers. These sensors are able to perform in the infrared, visible, thermal infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Accelerometer, Hyperspectral Radiometer, Imaging Radiometer, Sounder, Spectrometer, and Spectroradiometer are some examples of passives sensors (NASA 2019). Remotely sensed data provides continuous spatial coverage and are typically presented in gridded form. The most temporally regular remotely sensed data set is obtained from satellites (BOM 2017). Since its advent in the 1960s, satellite remote sensing has been widely used as a complete source of information. Satellite sensors can measure almost all components of hydrological cycle, such as precipitation, evaporation, surface water, soil moisture, lake and river levels, surface and sub-surface water storage, and snow storage (Sheffield et al. 2018). However, satellites have relatively coarser spatial resolution than in situ measurements due to their large distance from the earth in relation to the resolution of the sensor and the attenuation effect of the atmosphere between the sensor and the observation point. Low earth orbiting satellites present much higher spatial resolution with lower temporal resolution (BOM 2017). The only issue that should be carefully considered in remote sensing is the requirement of significant information technology infrastructure for data management. Additionally, complex image processing tasks are needed to provide the data with suitable format (BOM 2017). In summary, remote sensing tools play an important role in improving water resources management through provision of large spatial and high temporal resolution. 3.2.1.3 Models In order to tackle the shortcomings and costs associated with in situ measurements and also to address the poor spatial support of in situ point measurements, different types of models and methods can be applied to generate water data. Modelling approaches are useful tools to address poor spatial support of in situ point measurements. For instance, required spatially distributed water surface elevations for flood magnitude, extent and timing estimations are derived from hydrodynamic models. Therefore, models and methods are applied for different purposes. For example, different rainfall-runoff models have been developed for generating the runoff data in ungauged catchments. Conceptual rainfall-runoff model applications such as Nedbor-Afstromings Model (NAM) (Makungo et al. 2010; Faiz et al. 2018; Zhen-lei et al. 2019), Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) (Engeland and Hisdal 2009; Osuch et al. 2019), and The Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) (Gumindoga et al. 2017) are examples of model applications, which converts the rainfall to runoff in a defined catchment. In the field of water resources engineering, data-driven approaches have gained popularity for different water modelling purposes (Kim et al. 2013; Jahandideh-Tehrani et al. 2019; 2020a). Artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) are few examples of data-driven approaches, which have been extensively applied in the area if water related modellings such as ground water level prediction (Daliakopoulos et al. 2005; Tsanis et al. 2008; Baudron et al. 2013), rainfall-runoff modelling (Daliakopoulos and Tsanis 2016; Berezowski and Chybicki 2018; Jahandideh-Tehrani et al. 2020b), reservoir operation (Niu et al. 2019; Ahmad and Hossain 2019), flood prediction (Zhou et al. 2019; Ahmadalipour and Moradkhani 2019). Some models are also used to extrapolate to past (e.g., paleoclimate) and future conditions, such as climate models. Future precipitation, evaporation, wind, and temperature can be generated using different climate models, such as Hadley Center Coupled Model (HADCM3), Norwegian Erath System Model (NorESM), and The Fifth Version Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC5) (Randall et al. 2007). In order to summarize a large amount of information, specific approaches such as system dynamics (SD) are applied to analyse and interpret information. Using flow diagrams and feedback loops facilitate the analysis and conclusion for complex information (Ahmad and Simonovic 2004; Jahandideh Tehrani et al. 2014; Christias et al. 2020). In summary, models and methods are used for tasks, such as making predictions, data assimilation, and interpreting the large amount of complex information. The main limitation of applying models is the uncertainty resulting from models due to prior assumptions and scale issues. In water resources engineering field, analytical techniques (e.g., Mellin transform technique, and Fourier transform technique) and approximation techniques (e.g., first-order variance estimation (FOVE), probabilistic point estimation (PE) methods, and Monte-Carlo simulation) are the two main uncertainty analysis categories that can be applied to address hydrologic, hydraulic, structural, and economic uncertainties (Tung 2011). Many researchers have discussed model uncertainty analysis and proposed methods to reduce the amount of uncertainty. For instance, Wagener and Wheater (2006) investigated the sources of uncertainty in a rainfall-runoff model by focusing on 10 catchments. They identified that the uncertainty is related to local modelling (process of selection and calibration of the local model structure) and regionalization procedures. To increase the accuracy of model results, many studies have focused on analysing uncertainty and reducing the vulnerability. Her et al. (2019) evaluated the associated uncertainties with multi GCMs in runoff and precipitation projections. In terms of adaptation planning for uncertain climate change impacts, evaluating the robust adaptation decisions to climate change uncertainties was studied by Dessai and Hulme (2007). They concluded that water resources are sensitive to regional climate response uncertainties in climate change impacts. Also, Fletcher et al. (2019) developed a new planning framework to evaluate climate uncertainty over time for flexible planning strategies. In summary, despite the wide applications of models in improving water data, research is still required to improve the accuracy of the model results. 3.2.1.4 Administrative Institutes Two types of data, including the water rights data and administrative data (mentioned in Table 3.1) are not obtained from measurements or models. Data such as water rights, water pricing, water infrastructure inventories, water demand in different economic activities, water ownership, and basin borders are basically recorded by water management agencies as part of their business purposes. Additionally, such data can be collected by conducting household and business surveys (BOM 2017). Water rights data and administrative data play a critical role in developing, proposing, and evaluating the water management strategies and policies as well as decision making. For instance, water system governance, which refers to the structure and administrative process, should direct and control operations, decision making, legislation, and finance as part of their tasks. Therefore, administrative data is required in order to determine operational standards and water regulations. A large number of agencies and organizations are involved in the establishment and administration of water rights in scale of regional, national and international scopes. In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the main foundation of European Union (EU) water policy that aims to ensure sustainable water use and protect aquatic systems through applying legislations to all surface waters (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) as well as groundwater (Carvalho et al. 2019). In Australia, the Department of Natural Resources and Mines is involved in water system administration in all states (Productivity Commission 2003). While different countries/regions/continents have their own administrative institutes to dictate water related policies (e.g., water pricing, water ownerships, river borders, etc.), there are also international foundations, which deal with global water issues. For example, World Water Council is an international multi-stakeholder organization that enhance political action and awareness to deal with critical water issues through developing partnerships between countries (World Water Council 2020). Pacific Institute, Clean Water Action, and Water.org are other examples of global organizations that aim to solve water conflicts, promote legislation for water protection, and deal with water crisis. 3.3 Key Characteristics of Water Data Type Different types of water data have their own characteristics and use. In other words, each type of water data should be applied for a specific purpose of water resources management, such as flood management, water quality management, sediment control, and water security management. The key characteristics of water data together with examples are listed below (BOM 2017): Parameter type (e.g., river flow data for reservoir operation; water demand data for irrigation management) Measurement location (e.g., water quality data for upstream of water offtakes for drinking water supply; groundwater level data for heavily utilized aquifers) Spatial coverage (e.g., flood level data for flood prone areas; national scale water assessment) Spatial density (e.g., rainfall distribution for rainfall pattern assessment) Temporal frequency (e.g., daily or monthly river data for regional water security assessment; high frequency river and rainfall data for flood forecasting) Longevity of measurements (multi-decadal data of continuous rainfall for rainfall IDF analysis; historical river flow data for flood frequency and magnitude analysis) Latency (e.g., basin time concentration for rainfall-runoff modelling; real-time rainfall and river level data for flood forecasting) Precision (e.g., water quality data should be precise in order to confirm safe drinking water supply; water pricing should be assessed carefully to prevent probable issues between stakeholders). 3.4 Challenges of Water Data In most countries, the nation’s water data arrangements cannot satisfy the need of water sector participants, and the processes of data collection are limited. There is an increasing need for systematic data collection in order to improve monitoring and ensure informed decision making (IWRM 2019). Over the next three sections, basic challenges of accessing proper and accurate water data will be discussed. 3.4.1 Poor Quality of Water Data There are many gaps in the available water dataset, and the quality of some water data is poor. Generally, the available water datasets are heterogeneous, dispersed, and poor in quality (BOM 2017). Dispersion and gaps in water data are mainly the result of poorly calibrated measuring devices as well as inefficient equipment maintenance. Apparently, water management will be challenging without good water data. Therefore, policy makers and managers are unable to make sound decisions as the provided water data are unreliable and contradictory (BOM 2017). Additionally, many poor countries, which are facing financial problems, are not equipped with modern and efficient measuring devices and techniques, which leads to poor measurements, and subsequently poor quality datasets (INBO 2018). Lack of homogeneity in water data causes poor data management as the data is useless, and massive investments on water infrastructure and data collection is wasted. Heterogeneous data mainly occurs when private organizations follow their own specific guidelines and procedures for data collection, and there is no general adopted rules for all data collector organizations (BOM 2017). 3.4.2 Lack of Integrated Water Portal Systems One of the main water data challenges in many countries is the lack of information about the available water data, and also not openly shared datasets. Basically, there is no single established organization/tool/website to provide potential users with information about the different available water types, and characteristics of the water date sets. Detailed metadata, i.e. information on “how the data is produced”, “how the data can be accessed”, “how the data should be used”, “who to contact”, and “what the licence of the data is” are not provided by institutions in many countries. Thus, researchers and water data users require considerable time, effort, and investment to identify stated information. Therefore, data users and researchers need to spend time on basic data gathering and transformation rather than scientific analysis. This problem is noticeable when data is collected by multiple agencies for a specific task purpose. For instance, the required meteorological data models and formats for hydrological purposes (e.g., groundwater and catchment modelling) are different from the meteorological data formats for atmospheric science analysis. As a result of this data difference, a hydrologist should spend significant amount of time on learning the file format and visualization tool used by atmospheric science community. To address this problem, data should be communicated between scientific sub-disciplines systems through standard protocol/web services (Goodall et al. 2008). In this context, organizations such as European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS), European drought observatory (EDO), Watershed Index Online (WSIO), United States Geological Survey (USGS) Water Data, BOM climate data online, European Space Agency (ESA), Copernicus Space Component (CSC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have made efforts to provide users with documented, homogeneous, and well-organized data set, which can be accessed through web services, and indicate datasets in the form of maps, tables, and graphs. 3.4.3 Limited Access to Data According to the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principle, the public should participate in decision making processes. In order to pave this way, water institutions and organization should make the water data and information available and accessible to the public. However, much water data is not accessible by the public, or the water data type is not understandable by people with no expert knowledge. Thus, to ensure the participations of the public, water data should be disseminated in an informative and comprehensible way (INBO 2018). In addition to the public, openly shared and freely access to most water data is limited for water data users, particularly researchers. Regarding the fact that in many countries, funds for data collections come from private sectors, institutions are mainly reluctant to share the data freely. Additionally, many national organizations have no tends to share the collected data with the neighbouring countries or other international organizations. This situation is observed particularly when the countries are facing critical water scarcity, and the countries under such conflicts deny publishing information due to security risks (INBO 2018). Additionally, poor countries, which are facing financial problems, are unable to build efficient water information systems, manage water data, and develop efficient web portals and tools for data sharing. As a result, international organizations and agencies play an important role in providing financial support as well as remote monitoring to deal with the water problem in poor countries (INBO 2018). 3.4.4 Big Data Problems Regarding the increased amount of water data, several challenges can appear for big water data management. Big water data is associated with increased data volume, variety, and velocity. The amount of measured and processed data is growing rapidly. Additionally, the growing formats of data can make data management challenging. Considering the increased automation in data measurement process, the biases, abnormalities, and noise are also increasing in raw water data. As a result, a suitable and massive validation process is required to treat raw water data. Citizen science data is another aspect of big data complexity. Citizen science refers to the participation of the general public in the process of research design and data collection, which leads to the collection of large volumes of data (Buytaert et al. 2014). In the field of climate modelling, the spatial and temporal dimensions of data are intensive as such data indicates complex process of atmosphere and ocean circulation. Therefore, such climate data requires high storage space and large computer processing power (Cuntz et al. 2007). High volume data with long time periods can lead to high potential of data loss or intrusion. Generally, with high increase in the amount of data, many challenges are coupled with the process of big water data management. 3.5 Data Processing Data processing refers to the manipulation of data obtained from in situ measurements or remote sensing, before they can be efficiently stored or made available (Hughes 1998). Raw data should be processed and transformed into formats to be identified and applied by researchers, data users, and decision makers (INBO 2018). Regarding the cost, effort, and high volume involved in data collection, proper data processing tools and approaches should be adopted (Hughes 1998). Many tools are available for data processing, including spreadsheets and databases, database management tools, geographic information systems (GIS), Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tools, modelling tools, and statistical data analysis tools. However, the selected tools and approaches should meet the requirements of the data users and researchers: What data format is required? What is the purpose of using the data? What kind of research will be conducted? And which organization will use the data? (INBO 2018). 3.5.1 Water Data Processing and Analysis The main purpose of data processing is to convert raw data into information, which meets the need of researchers and decision makers. Key points of water data processing are (Hughes 1998): Data encoding and digitizing; Quality control, consistency checking, and error checking; Data storage resolution; Data calibration and stability; Data storage and retrieval system. The stated key points will be discussed below: Data encoding and digitizing: Converting the measurements to digital is the first step of data processing. Hand-written field sheets or automatically penned charts mounted on a rotating drum are simple forms of data collection, which is still applied in many areas, particularly for collecting rainfall, evaporation, and other meteorological variables. Next, this data should be transferred to a computer database. Lost or damaged data is the main drawback of this manual data recoding. Therefore, modern telemetry, remote sensing, and other modern instruments have been developed to record the data automatically, particularly collecting the “real time” data (Hughes 1998). The vast quantities of recorded data (in situ measurements and remote sensing data) should be transformed into the cloud services in order to be stored and classified and then be accessible through portals and web services (McCabe et al. 2017). Data quality control: Data collection corresponds with issues such as missing data, recorded data over the incorrect time, accumulated data, instrument failure, etc. Additionally, most databases are not able to identify poor and incorrect data and inform data users of data inconsistency (Hughes 1998). Missing data processing, logical error detection, repeated data processing, abnormal data detection, and inconsistent data processing are main aspects of hydrological data quality control. Prediction methods (e.g., recurrence neural network (RNN), and support vector machine (SVM)), optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), and statistical methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, and statistical control) are some examples of data driven approaches for data quality control (Zhao et al. 2018). Data storage resolution: Time resolution is of great importance in water data, particularly, the data used in hydrological analysis. For example, required time step for analysing the rainfall intensity in temperate climate is different from the arid and semiarid climates. Normally, the rainfall data with a resolution of one hour should be proper in temperate climate, while short-term variation of intensity is more important in arid and semiarid areas, and hence, minute should be the proper time step in arid areas (Hughes 1998). Therefore, disaggregation methods, such as Hyetos based on Bartlett-Lewis process and Marcov chain model should be applied in order to break down the data into shorter time steps (Koutsoyiannis 2003), which is considered as an important task of data processing. Data value accuracy: Accuracy of observations is a numeric value that quantifies the data measurements accuracy based on the closeness to the standard value. The stated value accuracy measures the associated uncertainty with data measurements, which is the result of errors in bias and precision. The value accuracy can be estimated using the knowledge of instrument accuracy and measurement method as well as statistical analysis of the records from repeated measurements (Horsburgh et al. 2008). Additionally, some instrument calibration process (either manual calibration or using table and equations) is required to ensure accurate measurements. For instance, the stage-discharge relationship is commonly used to convert water level measurements of a flume to flow rate or discharge. In the case of a flooding event in a river, calibration process is necessary as riverbank erosion and massive sediment transport occur over flood events (Hughes 1998). Data storage and retrieval system: As describe in Sect. 4.4, big data requires massive amounts of data to be stored. Metadata catalogues and data storage systems help data users to identify the available datasets and check their characteristics (Hughes 1998). Within this context, recorded observations should be stored with sufficient supporting information (e.g., the location, date and time and type of variable that was observed) about the observations to enable data interpretation and cross-dimension data retrieval and analysis (Horsburgh et al. 2008). The databases should provide users with helpful information on the type measurements, data length, instrument details, the latitude and longitude of measurements, data quality, missing data, time zone, etc. Additionally, an efficient database is able to allow user to access and download the data in different formats, such shape files, text file, and excel files. It is also necessary to design a frequent backup system for the databases in order to prevent data lost in a case of system failure (Hughes 1998). In the scope of data storage and retrieval, Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which has been developed rapidly in recent years, is considered as a key approach in big data processing. Within this context, cloud computing is a new generation of computing architecture that supports big data applications and growing data processing (Fan et al. 2018). As an example of such applications, the cloud-computing services have been applied to watershed management by enabling watershed partnerships for focusing primarily on decision-making activities (Sun 2013). Bürger et al. (2012) also developed an intuitive Web interface to create an integrated hydrologic simulation platform that enables users to access scientific software through a web browser. 3.5.2 Water Data Visualization After the data process step and data preparation, the next step is to present the data in an understandable and efficient way. Regarding the recent improvements of digital culture and information technologies, large datasets become complex to understand. Therefore, visual presentation of data has been developed, which presents data in the form of a graph, map, video, animation, hierarchy, etc. Data visualization can also improve understanding of existing trends, patterns and correlation in the datasets that might not detected in text and number-based data. As a result, stakeholders and decision makers can easily identify the important issues of water resources management to focus on as well as adapting new policies. In the scope of data visualization, the quality of data presentation is important as a poor or incorrect type of data visualization may cause misleading and hinder smart decision making. The visualization tool should be selected based on specific criteria, including i) how data viewers interact with data, ii) the information that should be obtained by the viewers, iii) the function of the data, and iv) the data composition. The three main types of water data presentation are as below (INBO 2018): Maps: They indicate the geographical distribution of different parameters, such as evaporation, rainfall, temperature. Maps can be produced using GIS software. Key figures: They are generated from data processing and document analysis. Key figures are understandable by public. Factsheet: They show a regular summary of data analysis, information, and graphs on different topics such as global warming, climate change, and drought trend. 3.5.3 Water Data Dissemination After collecting, verifying, processing, and storing the water data, the next important task is to release and disseminate the data according to the target group (e.g., the general public, researchers, and decision makers) (e.g., before and after a flooding event). Data dissemination consists of four main steps (SEQwater 2014): (1) Data value identification: The first step is to evaluate the data value and information asset to decide on the price of the water data. The data value is conducted by surveying business system, water companies, and stakeholders about their needs and interests. Some data can be accessible free of charge considering the expenses of data preparation process and company’s needs and interests. (2) Data assessment: Over the second step, the data suitability for release should be assessed based on relevant guidelines, policies, and legislations. Additionally, depending on the target group (e.g., scientific, non-expert purposes), data visualizations, data use instructions, and data use policies should be defined. (3) Data publication: Over the third step, data should be published based on priority factors such as public interest, stakeholder feedback, company and institutes need, and economic values. Additionally, given the type of requirements of different target groups (e.g., the general public, researchers, and decision makers) and required time of hydrological events (e.g., before and after a flood event, before and after a dam construction), data dissemination should be specified. (4) Data management: Over the last step, data quality should be improved with regard to data user’s feedback. In order to release the water data, different strategies and digital tool are available. Below is the list of different water data dissemination plans (INBO 2018): Web portals and websites: data resulted from monitoring programs is delivered through portals and website. Basically, portals provide organized data, and water data is classified based on different criteria such as collected data from open stations, water data type (e.g., water level, streamflow, and rainfall), collected data from closed station, river type, time periods, water data unit (e.g., mega litre and cubic meters), and measured interval (e.g., hourly, daily, and monthly). Factsheets: guidelines, water issues (e.g., global warming and climate change), water data change trend analysis (e.g., temperature trend, major flood event trend and evaporation change trend), monitoring programs (e.g., coastal erosion monitoring), management programs (e.g., integrated sub-basin management plans) can be published through digital books. Social media networks: In addition to portals, websites, and digital books, social media networks also play an important role in water data dissemination. Social media networks increase people’s awareness of available water data and establish contact with internet and data users. Additionally, social media are effective way of transferring news and water data updates to users. Smart apps: smart and free apps are favourable, particularly among the public. Smart applications can potentially target different water users and improve interaction. For instance, “Ma Cons’eau” is a useful free application, which can estimate the people’s water consumption through providing a set of simple questions. The amount of water consumption is calculated based on the water price of resident locations. 3.6 Practical Examples Many organizations, systems and programs have been developed to provide high quality data and services of weather, climate, hydrological, and environmental fields for the purpose of integrated water resources management. Therefore, multiple water data, information, and knowledge should be shared to build cross-functionality between stakeholders. One example of the water data system is the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS), launched by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1993 to improve sustainable development in delivery and use of hydrological data as well as promoting regional and international cooperation. WHYCOS aims to enhance the sustainable protection, use and management of water resources systems as well as support decision makers through reliable and data provision. In terms of regional water resources management, HYCOS promotes data and information products, such as flood forecasts and warning data. At global scale, the WHYCOS International Advisory Group (WIAG) was introduced to provide support for policy guidelines and future development of the projects (WMO 2019). Another example of global water data organization is the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), which was established three decades ago. GRDC is an international archive of streamflow data, which aims to enhance analysis of global climate trends and evaluate environmental impacts and risks. The Global Runoff Data Base (GRDB) at GRDC was built on an initial dataset collected in the early 1980s. GRDB is a unique tool for obtaining river streamflow data at daily and monthly time step from over 9,500 gauging stations in 161 countries. In terms of national scale, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in Australia has developed the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS). As shown in Fig. 3.3, the purpose of AWRIS is to receive and manage water data and information as well as supporting and disseminating different water information products and services. Fig. 3.3 The role of AWRIS in water information in Australia (Adopted from AWRIS Information Sheets 2019) Full size image AWRIS is able to store and manage information about groundwater levels, river flow, the quality of water in rivers and aquifers, water trades, water use and restrictions, and water volume in storages in a central database. Next, the stored data is checked for quality and standards to ensure that the stored data is consistent with the current available data. Over the next step, the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric cast the stored water information in a spatial context through encoding the spatial connections between Australia’s hydrological features (e.g., rivers, lakes, aquifers, dams, channels etc.). As indicated in Fig. 3.3, the final step includes analysing, interpreting, and integrating the water data. AWRIS delivers variety of water data, reports, and forecasts, such as real-time water reports, regular national water resources assessments, improved flood warning systems, and seasonal streamflow forecasts. The main advantage of AWRIS is that water users are able (i) to identify water resources condition in Australia through integrated viewpoint, (ii) to prepare benchmark reports using quality and transparent data, (iii) to check the details of standards, (iv) to control the quality of applied water data, and (v) to easily use the data for planning, analysis, reporting, and modelling (AWRIS information sheets 2019). 3.7 Summary Limited water resources and increased demand for the resources leads to growing challenges facing water resources systems. This growing pressure on water resources is the result of many issues, such as rapid population growth, poor water data, inefficient water resources management, and climate change. Therefore, the need to enhance water security, sustainable water management, reliable water supply, and environment protection necessitate the integrated water resources planning and management. The chapter underlines that water data and information are considered as the key components of water-based research, which provide decision makers with proper information in different water disciplines. Water data can be classified into two main categories, primary data and secondary data, where primary data is the collection of raw data, and secondary data obtained from models, lab experiments, and specific methods. Additionally, water data types can be grouped based on disciplines/sectors that water data is used. For instance, hydrometric data, meteorological data, and groundwater data are applied in hydrology services, meteorological services, and geological and mining institutes, respectively. Different distinct water data is obtained from four main sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and (4) administrative institutes. The chapter also discuss the limitation of water data, including poor quality, lack of integrated water portal systems, limited funds for data provision, and big data problems. In order to efficiently store and apply data, water data should be processed and analysed through key steps: (1) data encoding and digitizing; (2) quality control, consistency checking, and error checking; (3) data storage resolution analysis; (4) data calibration and stability; and (5) data storage and retrieval systems. After the data processing steps, water data should be visualized and presented in an understandable way to find our existing climate trend, pattern and correlation for the purpose of adapting new policies and management strategies in the realm of water resources. Thereafter, water data should be released and disseminated through web portals and websites, E-books, media and social networks, and smart apps to be used by decision makers, researchers, and policy makers for efficient water management planning. In general, the outcomes of the present chapter will benefit different water disciplines sectors through provision of discussion on the role, current condition, and importance of water data and information in water resources management. 3.8 Recommendations Regarding the important role of data provision in integrated water resources management, it is recommended: (1) To provide public easy access to water data with the purpose to serve many different contexts: In order to improve decision making strategies, enhance national and international research studies, and ensure efficient water resources management, different water data sources and types should be highly accessible. Additionally, free provision of some data sources can potentially increase people’s awareness about the responsibility and importance of different water sectors. As a results of this increased awareness, public tends to have interactions and collaborations with experts, which leads to efficient water supply and management. (2) To improve collaboration and engagement between water data system or portal developers and users: Identification of the intended purpose of data provision is a fundamental need for achieving efficient data use. Therefore, before providing the data, sound understanding of the need of stakeholders and data users is essential to ensure the relevant data collection. (3) To develop a single global data system: Despite the availability of many different sources, portals and websites for data users, some researchers have challenge to identify the most accurate and efficient source of data for their studies. In order to address this issue, multiple sources of water data at different spatial and temporal resolutions should be consolidated in a single global data system. (4) To provide data in different formats and resolutions to target different decisions making strategies: Based on the type of decision-making strategy, research project, and water management strategy, different temporal and spatial resolutions of data should be provided. Hence, an efficient water data system should provide resolution flexibility in data as well as ensuring the quality and integrity of data. (5) To propose and build a novel water data system for water data format conversion: Many researchers and water data users should convert the format of the collected water data into the required input data format of different water software packages. The process of data format conversion is time and money consuming. Therefore, the generation and provision of different water data formats help users to save time in running water software and models. (6) To develop efficient water data systems, which are able to generate and update information from water data automatically: Water data systems should be improved in order to automatically generate some illustrations (maps, figures, and tables) from the input data. Additionally, the new collected data should automatically update the water data system by providing updated illustrations and information. (7) To develop more accurate data gap filling methods: Some data, such as future meteorological data under climate change, should be estimated. There are also gaps in some data due to different reasons, such as defective measuring device. In order to inform decision making and researchers with proper data, the stated limitations and gaps should be addressed. (8) To integrate different data sources to ensure quality data: Various organizations provide water data based on different standards of data measurements, processing, and collection. Water organizations and sectors should integrate water data system by satisfying specific level of standards in terms of data quality, processing, measurements, and documentations. These recommendations will help water data providers, modellers, and researchers to detect the limitations of current water data and to identify room for improvements.

  Explanation: Metadata, in this context, refers to information about the plant images that is not directly related to the plant's physical characteristics, such as the imaging device used, the date and time the image was taken, and the environmental conditions. This information can be used to ensure that the images are properly calibrated and processed, and to help interpret the results of the image analysis.

The specific relevance of metadata to the study of plant phenomics lies in its ability to provide context and enable better data interpretation and decision-making. For example, knowing the imaging device used can help to correct for any distortions or biases in the image, and knowing the date and time the image was taken can help to account for any changes in the plant's appearance due to diurnal or seasonal variations. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, can also affect the appearance of plants in images, so knowing these conditions can help to control for their effects.

Overall, metadata is an important consideration in plant phenomics because it can provide valuable information that can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of image analysis results. By providing context and enabling better data interpretation, metadata can help researchers to make more informed decisions about plant phenotyping and management.

Abstract: Plant phenomics has been rapidly advancing over the past few years. This advancement
is attributed to the increased innovation and availability of new technologies which can enable the
high-throughput phenotyping of complex plant traits. The application of artiﬁcial intelligence in
various domains of science has also grown exponentially in recent years. Notably, the computer
vision, machine learning, and deep learning aspects of artiﬁcial intelligence have been successfully
integrated into non-invasive imaging techniques. This integration is gradually improving the
efﬁciency of data collection and analysis through the application of machine and deep learning for
robust image analysis. In addition, artiﬁcial intelligence has fostered the development of software
and tools applied in ﬁeld phenotyping for data collection and management. These include open-
source devices and tools which are enabling community driven research and data-sharing, thereby
availing the large amounts of data required for the accurate study of phenotypes. This paper reviews
more than one hundred current state-of-the-art papers concerning AI-applied plant phenotyping
published between 2010 and 2020. It provides an overview of current phenotyping technologies and
the ongoing integration of artiﬁcial intelligence into plant phenotyping. Lastly, the limitations of the
current approaches/methods and future directions are discussed.
Keywords: artiﬁcial intelligence; deep learning; plant phenomics; ﬁeld phenotyping; high through-
put phenotyping; image-based phenotyping
1. Introduction
According to data from the United Nations, the world population is expected to grow
to nine billion by 2050 [1]. With the increasing need for food production to match the
projected population growth in order to prevent food insecurity, plant phenotyping is
now at the forefront of plant breeding as compared to genotyping [2]. Plant phenotyping
is deﬁned as the assessment of complex traits such as growth, development, tolerance,
resistance, architecture, physiology, ecology, yield, and the basic measurement of individual
quantitative parameters that form the basis for complex trait assessment [2]. Scientists
are increasingly interested in the use of phenomic-level data to aid in the correlation
between genomics and the variation in crop yields and plant health [3–5]. In this way, plant
phenotyping has become an important aspect of crop improvement, availing data to assess
traits for variety selection in order to identify desirable traits and eliminate undesirable
traits during the evaluation of plant populations [6]. Plant phenotyping has improved
progressively over the past 30 years, although obtaining satisfactory phenotypic data for
complex traits such as stress tolerance and yield potential remains challenging [7]. The
large data required for the effective study of phenotypes has led to the development and
use of high-throughput phenotyping technologies to enable the characterization of large
numbers of plants at a fraction of the time, cost, and labor of previously used traditional

techniques. Traditional techniques previously required destructive measurements whereby
crops were harvested at particular growth stages in order to carry out genetic testing and
the mapping of plant traits [8]. Since crop breeding programs require repeated experimental
trials in order to ascertain which traits are of interest, the process was slow, costly and
signiﬁcantly lagging behind the DNA sequencing technologies which are necessary for
crop improvement [9].
High-throughput phenotyping has been fostered by non-invasive imaging techniques,
which have enabled the visualization of plant cell structures on a wider scale. As these
imaging technologies develop, images carry more useful extractable information that sup-
ports biological interpretations of plant growth [10,11]. These techniques include thermal
imaging [12], chlorophyll ﬂuorescence [13,14], digital imaging [15], and spectroscopic
imaging [16].
High-throughput phenotyping techniques are currently being used to enable data
acquisition in both laboratory and ﬁeld settings. They are being employed at the levels of
data collection, data management, and analysis. They include imaging sensors, growth
chambers, data management and analysis software, etc. [7,17–20]. The integration of
artiﬁcial intelligence into these technologies has contributed to the development of the non-
invasive imaging aspect of phenomics. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies in the form
of computer vision and machine learning are increasingly being used to acquire and analyze
plant image data. Computer vision systems process digital images of plants to detect
speciﬁc attributes for object recognition purposes [21]. Machine learning employs various
tools and approaches to ‘learn’ from large collections of crop phenotypes in order to classify
unique data, identify new patterns and features, and predict novel trends [22,23]. Recent
advancements in deep learning, a subset of machine learning, have provided promising
results for real-time image analysis. Deep learning is a machine learning approach that
takes advantage of the large plant datasets available and uses them to carry out image
analysis using convolutional neural networks [24]. In ﬁeld phenotyping, AI is being applied
in ﬁeld equipment for ground and obstacle detection, the detection of plants and weeds
during data collection, and the stable remote control of the equipment [25]. Although
the ﬁeld phenotyping applications of AI are in relative infancy compared to laboratory
phenotyping, their growth is notable because they provide the phenotypic data of plants in
their natural environment.
In addition to image analysis, AI applications that are widely used in other domains
of science are now being integrated into the phenomics data management pipeline. Cy-
berinfrastructure (CI), a research environment that provides linkages between researchers,
data storage, and computing systems using high-performance networks has been applied
widely in the environmental sciences [26–28]. CI is now being applied to phenomics in
order to facilitate collaboration among researchers [29]. Open-source devices and tools
represent another fast developing application of AI technologies [30]. In phenomics, these
tools are addressing the challenges of expensive phenotyping equipment and proprietary
or incompatible data formats. The growth of these applications of AI has expanded the
ﬁeld of phenomics with industry companies investing in the manufacture and distribution
of phenotyping technologies alongside government-funded agricultural institutions.
This review begins by considering the broader area of artiﬁcial intelligence and its inte-
gration and application in phenomics through machine learning and deep learning. Digital,
ﬂuorescence, spectroscopic, thermography, and tomography imaging, and the integration
of artiﬁcial intelligence into their individual data management are highlighted. Thereafter,
additional applications of AI such as cyberinfrastructure and open-source devices and tools
are discussed. The current utilization of phenotyping technologies for ﬁeld phenotyping,
which is increasingly gaining ground over phenotyping in controlled environments, is then
discussed brieﬂy, highlighting their cross applicability with artiﬁcial intelligence.

2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is widely referred to as the simulation of human intelligence
in machines which are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. It is
applied when referring to machines that exhibit traits associated with the human mind [31].
The recent emergence and growth of AI in academia has presented an opportunity, as well
as a threat, for various domains in the sciences. Whereas some predict that the application
of AI through robotics could lead to technological unemployment, it has enabled science to
extend into areas previously unexplored and provided ease of execution, for example, in
medical diagnostics [32].
In order to effectively program machines for desired tasks, AI methods call for large
repositories of data. The algorithms used in AI methods need large sets of data for train-
ing to facilitate decision support by enhancing early detection and thereby improving
decision-making [33]. The data acquisition process in non-destructive phenomics involves
integrating the data from instruments/sensors (i.e., digital cameras and spectrometers),
usually equipped with their individual, proprietary communication protocols, into the AI
algorithms. The sensor outputs often require conversion to compatible digital formats be-
fore analysis [7]. Phenomic data management therefore involves three critical components
where artiﬁcial intelligence is applied: algorithms and programs to convert the sensory data
into phenotypic information; model development to understand the genotype–phenotype
relationships with environmental interactions; and the management of databases to allow
for the sharing of information and resources [6]. The main aspects of AI, machine learning,
deep learning, and computer vision have been applied thus far to a recognizable extent in
phenomics (illustrated in Figure 1). Other areas of application are cyberinfrastructure and
open-source devices and tools, which will subsequently be discussed in detail.

2.1. Machine Learning
Since the 1970s, AI research has been focused on machine learning. Statistical ma-
chine learning frameworks and models such as Perceptron, support vector machines, and
Bayesian networks have been designed. However, no single model works best for all tasks.
It is still challenging to determine the best model for a given problem [34]. According
Sensors 2021, 21, 4363

to Roscher et al. 2020 [35], the rise and success of neural networks, coupled with the
abundance of data and high-level computational and data processing infrastructure, has
led to the comprehensive utilization of machine learning (ML) models and algorithms
despite the challenge of model determinations for a given task.
The utilization of a range of imaging techniques for nondestructive phenotyping has
inﬂuenced the development of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), whereby multiple
imaging sensors collect plant data in near-real-time platforms. These sensors have the
capacity to collect large volumes of data which has, in turn, made phenomics a big data
problem well suited for the application of ML. The analysis and interpretation of these large
datasets are quite challenging, but ML algorithms provide an approach for faster, efﬁcient,
and better data analytics than traditional processing methods. Traditional processing
methods include probability theory, decision theory, optimization, and statistics. ML
tools leverage these processing methods to extract patterns and features from these large
amounts of data in order to enable feature identiﬁcation in particular complex tasks such
as stress phenotyping [36].
According to Rahaman et al. 2019 [37], one of the advantages of using ML approaches
in plant phenotyping is their ability to search large datasets and discover patterns by
simultaneously looking at a combination of features (compared to analyzing each feature
separately). This was previously a challenge because of the high dimensionality of plant
images and their large quantity, making them difﬁcult to analyze through traditional
processing methods [36]. Machine learning methods have thus far been successfully
applied in the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant diseases [38,39] and plant organ
segmentation, among other tasks as shown in Table 1 below. This has been achieved by
supervised learning, where the algorithms can identify diseased plants after being trained
with sample images from large datasets. However, this approach prevents the search for
novel and unexpected phenotypic traits that would otherwise be discovered by the less
accurate unsupervised ML [40].

2.2. Deep Learning
Deep learning is a rapidly advancing subset of machine learning tools that has created
a paradigm shift in image-based plant phenotyping. It is efﬁcient in the discovery of
complex structures in high-dimensional data and is thus applicable to a range of scientiﬁc
research tasks [24]. The plant images collected using the various sensors have a wide
variability, making the use of some machine learning techniques challenging [47]. While
traditional machine learning involves trial-and-error steps in the feature extraction process
of images, deep learning tools have enabled the creation of more reliable workﬂows for
feature identiﬁcation. They employ an automatic hierarchical feature extraction process
using a large bank of non-linear ﬁlters before carrying out decision-making, such as
classiﬁcation. Deep learning approaches have multiple hidden layers in the network, with
each layer performing a simple operation on the images in succession which increases their
discrimination and prediction ability [48]. A wide range of deep learning architectures has

been used in plant phenotyping by a process called transfer learning. This involves the use
of a network that was pre-trained on a large dataset somewhat similar to the one under
investigation and retraining it with weights for the new dataset. Table 2 details some deep
learning architectures that have been applied using transfer learning for phenotyping.

Even with the current inﬂux of deep learning architectures, they still face a few chal-
lenges in their integration with agricultural applications. There is still limited availability
of publicly available annotated agricultural data, which reduces the possibility of obtain-
ing high-performance feature extraction models through transfer learning. In addition,
many agricultural image data have high levels of occlusion (especially plant leaves and
background noise), leading to higher likelihoods of error from confusing objects of interest
with the background. This is partly due to the environmental variations (e.g., cloudy sky,
windy weather for ﬁeld data collection) that signiﬁcantly impact the images and make
them harder to work with. Similarly, data samples are also sensitive to imaging angles,
ﬁeld terrain and conditions, and variations within plant genotypes. Hence, the robustness
and adaptability requirements are signiﬁcantly high for the deep learning models built for
agricultural applications [55].
Thus far, deep learning architectures in phenotyping have been used in leaf count-
ing [56], the classiﬁcation of plant morphology [57], plant recognition and identiﬁcation [55],
root and shoot feature identiﬁcation [48], and plant stress identiﬁcation and classiﬁca-
tion [58]. A few reported applications of machine learning or deep learning for stress
prediction and quantiﬁcation provide great opportunities for new research efforts of plant
scientists. A key challenge to overcome is that the underlying processes for linking the
inputs to the outputs are too complex to model mathematically.
3. Application of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Phenotyping Technologies
3.1. Imaging Techniques
Traditionally, the measurement of observable plant traits has been conducted by
destructive sampling followed by laboratory determinations to characterize phenotypes
based on their genetic functions. Due to technological advancement in AI, imaging tech-
niques (overview in Table 3) have emerged as important tools for non-destructive sampling,
allowing image capture, data processing, and analysis to determine observable plant traits.
According to Houle et al. 2010 [5], “imaging is ideal for phenomic studies because of the
availability of many technologies that span molecular to organismal spatial scales, the
intensive nature of the characterization, and the applicability of generic segmentation
techniques to data.” Spatial or temporal data of many phenotype classes such as mor-
phology and geometric features, behavior, physiological state, and locations of proteins

and metabolites can be captured in intensive detail by imaging. For that reason, imaging
techniques have allowed for high-throughput screening and real-time image analysis of
physiological changes in plant populations. At the laboratory scale, the different imaging
methods are tested individually. One, or a combination of the best-suited methods for crop
surveillance, are then used both in controlled and ﬁeld environments [5,59].

Computer vision is the major aspect of artiﬁcial intelligence that is applied in these
imaging techniques. Zhuang et al. 2017 [34], comprehensively state that “computer
vision aims to bring together factors derived from multiple research areas such as image
processing and statistical learning to simulate human perception capability using the
power of computational modeling of the visual domain.” Computer vision uses machine
learning to recognize patterns and extract information from the images. The computer
vision workﬂow (shown in Figure 2) carries out visual tasks ranging from pre-processing
(e.g., conversion of image formats, color space conversions etc.) to object detection applied
in ML algorithms, resulting in the comprehension of image understanding in a human-like
way [34]. Computer vision transforms the images so that they can be applied to an AI
system. This process has high computational demands, especially when working with
images of varying formats from a range of sensors, as is the case in phenotyping imaging
techniques [32]. A few of the different imaging techniques are discussed below.

3.1.1. Digital/RGB Imaging 
Digital imaging is the lowest costing and easiest to use imaging technique. Its images 
comprise pixels from a combination of the red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels. RGB 
camera sensors are sensitive to light in the visible spectral range (400–700 nm). Within this 
range, they are able to extract images that can be used to depict some significant physio-
logical changes in a biological sample. RGB/digital imaging depends on the color variation 
of different biological samples and has significantly contributed to various plant pheno-
typing aspects [75,76]. It tracks the color changes and directly helps in monitoring the 
status of plant developmental stage, morphology, biomass, health, yield traits, and stress 
response mechanisms. These mechanisms can be measured rapidly and accurately for

variation of different biological samples and has signiﬁcantly contributed to various plant
phenotyping aspects [75,76]. It tracks the color changes and directly helps in monitoring
the status of plant developmental stage, morphology, biomass, health, yield traits, and
stress response mechanisms. These mechanisms can be measured rapidly and accurately
for large populations. Digital imaging also provides information on the size and color of
plants, which enables the quantiﬁcation of plant deterioration arising from, for example,
nutrient deﬁciencies or pathogen infections, etc. Using a combination of careful image
capture, image analysis, and color classiﬁcation, it is possible to follow the progression of
lesions from infections and deﬁciencies over time quantitatively [8].
Advances in hardware and software for digital image processing have motivated the
development of machine vision systems providing for the expeditious analysis of RGB
images. Being relatively the simplest and most widely used technique has served as an
advantage, as many machine learning techniques and deep learning architecture can be
applied effectively to RGB images. These techniques have been applied in the identiﬁcation
of plant growth stage [41], classiﬁcation of plant images [43–46], disease detection and
classiﬁcation [38,52,53,65], identiﬁcation of biotic and abiotic stress [49,58], weed detec-
tion [50,51], detection of ﬂowering times [57], and leaf counting [54–56]. Although the
extraction of useful phenotyping features from 2D digital images has been successful, the
expansion in computer vision has led to an exploration of the applications of 3D imaging.
This has been achieved using stereo-vision, where two identical RGB cameras are used
to capture images in a setup similar to the operation of the human eyes. These images
are then used to reconstruct a 3D model of the plant for analysis using stereo-matching
algorithms [60,77]. Approaches using multiple images from more than two RGB cameras
placed at different viewing angles have been successfully used for larger plants with a
higher degree of occlusion thereby expanding the applications of digital imaging [78].
3.1.2. Spectroscopy
Spectroscopic imaging is a widely used imaging technique that has been used to
predict many properties of large plant populations [5]. It consists of multispectral and
hyperspectral imaging. In multispectral imaging, the images are captured in wavelengths
between visible and near-infrared, consisting of up to ﬁfteen spectral bands, whereas in
hyperspectral imaging, hundreds of continuous spectral wavebands are available. Pre-
vious phenotyping studies have shown that spectroscopy can be used to monitor plant
photosynthetic pigment composition, assess water status, and detect abiotic or biotic plant
stresses [79]. During plant development, varying growth conditions induce changes in
surface and internal leaf structure, modifying the reﬂection of light from plant leaves or
canopies. These changes can be visualized by spectroscopy, either in the visible spectrum
or near-infrared wavelengths undetectable by the human eye (0.7–1.3 mm) [18]. The appli-
cation of spectroscopy is therefore important for the ﬁeld monitoring of plant traits arising
from gene expression in response to environmental factors [20].
Hyperspectral imaging has thus far been successfully applied in both controlled envi-
ronments (i.e., greenhouses and growth chambers) and ﬁeld environments [80]. However,
a major limitation to the utility of hyperspectral data in ﬁeld phenotyping, besides the
cost of the equipment, is the variability in environmental conditions during measurements.
Spectrometers are highly sensitive and rely on solar radiation as a light source in the ﬁeld,
and this leads to difﬁculty in the analysis of images due to cloud cover, shadows caused
by phenotyping platforms, and changes in solar angle during the photo period [8,80].
Another challenge in hyperspectral data analysis is data redundancy due to the continuous
nature of wavelengths and their similarity. This has been alleviated by the selection of
effective wavelengths using algorithms such as the successive projections algorithm (SPA),
genetic algorithm (GA), the Monte-Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE),
and boosted regression tree (BRT) which is also a ML technique [81–83].
Although these difﬁculties can potentially be remedied by applying robust com-
puter vision algorithms, hyperspectral images have only been successfully applied to
Sensors 2021, 21, 4363
8 of 19
machine learning algorithms and not to faster and more advanced deep learning algo-
rithms. Nonetheless, hyperspectral imaging allows for a wide variety of stresses to be
detected and continues to be a promising way to detect speciﬁc signatures for a particular
stressor [18].
3.1.3. Thermography
Thermography, also known as thermal imaging, is a technique that detects infra-
red radiation from an object and creates an image based on it. Thermographic cameras
detect infrared radiation (9000−14,000 nanometers) in the electromagnetic spectrum and
create images based off of it [84]. Thermography has been used in plant research to
monitor transpiration and canopy temperature. Transpiration is linked with nutrient
uptake by the roots and, ultimately, with crop productivity. However, it also reﬂects
water use efﬁciency. Canopy temperature has been widely used to infer crop water use,
photosynthesis, and, in some cases, to predict yield. In breeding programs aimed at
selecting plants based on water use efﬁciency, thermography improves the speed and
effectiveness of monitoring transpiration [18]. It has also been used in the ﬁeld as a
remote sensing tool to capture canopy temperature data for a large number of plots using
microbolometer-based thermal imaging mounted on ﬁeld phenotyping platforms above the
crop using helium balloons or manned aircraft [8]. Despite the inability of thermography to
detect pre-symptomatic changes in leaves, it can detect changes in leaf thickness [18]. This
allows for the visualization and monitoring of internal structural heterogeneity resulting
from stresses or infections.
In phenotyping, thermography is used in combination with other imaging techniques
for effective diagnostics [85]. Photogrammetry algorithms such as structure-from-motion
have been applied to thermographic images [86] collected in ﬁeld environments without
much success. Currently, the data collected from the images is analyzed using standard
equations and ML statistical methods such as probability theory, decision theory and
classiﬁers [87]. Thermography has a range of applications from medical diagnostics to
metal defect detection in industries where deep learning algorithms have been applied to
thermal images [88].
3.1.4. Fluorescence
Fluorescence imaging, also known as ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, is used as a measure-
ment technique for photosynthetic function under stresses such as drought and infections
by detecting light emitted after the plant has been exposed to a speciﬁc wavelength of light.
These stresses have adverse effects that lead to a decrease in photosynthesis which, in turn,
limits crop yield. Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging has enabled the early visualization
of viral and fungal infections due to its ability to achieve high resolutions. It has also
been used in studies to determine plant leaf area [18]. For the rapid screening of plant
populations, portable ﬂuorometers are being used to obtain average measurements of
whole plants or leaves at the same developmental stage. There is potential for portable ﬂu-
orescence imaging to be used for the ﬁeld-scale assessment of infections, even for those that
leave no visible trace [8,18,67]. Fluorescence imaging is usually used in combination with
hyperspectral imaging, and image data extracted using this technique has been successfully
applied to algorithms based on AI methods, such as neural networks, for analysis [89].
3.1.5. Tomography
X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) is a technology that uses computer-processed
X-rays to produce tomographic images of speciﬁc areas of scanned objects. It can generate a
3D image of the inside of an object from an extensive series of 2D radiographic images taken
around a single axis of rotation [76]. X-ray CT imaging technology has been used for several
applications in plant phenotyping. It has been applied in the observation of root growth
because of its ability to capture the intricacies of the edaphic environment with high spatial
resolutions [90,91]. X-ray CT has also been used in the high-throughput measurement of
Sensors 2021, 21, 4363
9 of 19
rice tillers to determine grain yield. It was applied as the preferred imaging technique for
the rice tiller study because of the tendency of rice tillers to overlap and, hence, not be easily
detectable by digital imaging [92]. According to Li et al. 2014 [76], however, “tomographic
imaging remains low throughput, and its image segmentation and reconstruction need to be
further improved to enable high throughput plant phenotyping.” Although this technology
is effective in the early detection of plant stress symptoms, its effectiveness is further
improved by combined use with other imaging techniques. The simultaneous use of CT and
positron emission tomography (PET) has the potential to be used to provide insight into the
effect of abiotic stress in particular [71,76]. Additionally, to provide satisfactory resolutions,
X-ray CT requires small pot sizes and controlled environments, making it unsuitable for
ﬁeld applications. For morphological root phenotyping tasks, X-ray CT has been applied in
the identiﬁcation of root tips and root-soil segmentation tasks using machine learning [93].
Despite the minimal use of tomography in phenotyping, its application in the medical ﬁeld
positions it as a powerful technique that, coupled with AI algorithms (and particularly
CNNs), is beneﬁcial in diagnostics [94].
3.2. Cyberinfrastructure
Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is described by Atkins et al. 2003 [95] as a “research environ-
ment that supports advanced data acquisition, storage, management, integration, mining,
visualization and other computing and processing services distributed over the internet
beyond the scope of a single institution.” It consists of computing systems, data storage
systems, advanced instruments and data repositories, visualization environments, and peo-
ple (shown in Figure 3) linked together by software and high-performance networks [27].
This enhances the efﬁciency of research and productivity in the use of resources. Some CI
systems can provide for in-ﬁeld data analysis to point out errors in data collection that can
be rectiﬁed and identify further areas of interest for data collection.

CI has been applied in scientific disciplines ranging from biomedical to geospatial 
and environmental sciences. One such project is the distributed CI called the Function 
Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN), a large-scale project in the area of bi-
omedical research funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) [96]. CI has also 
been applied in geospatial research with a range of initiatives under the National Spatial 
Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The NSDI focuses on spatial data collection, sharing, and ser-
vice, and its geodata.gov provides geospatial data services. Data.gov provides all publicly 
available US government data, with their geospatial aspects supplemented by geo-
Figure 3. Simpliﬁed schematic of cyberinfrastructure.
CI has gained more interest in recent years because of the growth in quantities of data
collected in science, interdisciplinarity in research, the establishment of a range of locations
around the world where cutting-edge research is performed, and the spread of advanced

technologies [96]. Due to the various components required, CI systems are expensive, with
the cost of a supercomputer alone being upwards of US$90 million. For this reason, some
organizations that can invest in this infrastructure offer it as a service at a fee to researchers.
For example, the University of Illinois at Chicago provides various cost models for access
to their infrastructure [97].
CI has been applied in scientiﬁc disciplines ranging from biomedical to geospatial
and environmental sciences. One such project is the distributed CI called the Function
Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN), a large-scale project in the area of
biomedical research funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) [96]. CI has
also been applied in geospatial research with a range of initiatives under the National
Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The NSDI focuses on spatial data collection from
government and private sources, integration and sharing through its GeoPlatform (https:
//www.geo-platform.gov/, accessed on 26 June 2021) [98]. In the geospatial domain, one
example is the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE), which is a CI platform for
integrative biological and environmental research. It is designed to provide an underlying
infrastructure that facilitates data preservation and re-use for research with an initial focus
on remote-sensed data for the biological and environmental sciences [99]. Because of the
complexities in developing and setting up a CI, Wang et al. 2013 [100] put forward the
Cyberaide Creative service, which uses virtual machine technologies to create a common
platform separate from the hardware and software and then deploys a cyberinfrastructure
for its users. This allows for end-users to specify the necessary resource requirements and
have them immediately deployed without needing to understand their conﬁguration and
basic infrastructures.
In plant phenotyping, a case for the use of CI has been made similarly in that non-
invasive high throughput phenotyping technologies collect large amounts of plant data.
Analysis methods for this data using AI are being developed but face the challenge of
integrating datasets and the poor scalability of these tools [29]. The large amounts of data
generated by HTP platforms need to be efﬁciently archived and retrieved for analysis.
Researchers afﬁliated with the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) have
developed a form of CI called iPlant that incorporates artiﬁcial intelligence technologies to
store and process plant data gathered from the various HTP platforms. This CI platform
provides tools for data analysis and storage with high-performance computing to access
and analyze the data. It also has methods for the integration of tools and datasets [29].
In order to support both genotyping and phenotyping, iPlant uses the BISQUE (Bio-
Image Semantic Query User Environment) [101] software system. Its main functionality is
image analysis which it supports using its ﬁve core services: image storage and manage-
ment, metadata management and query, analysis execution, and client presentation. Its
design is ﬂexible enough to support the range of variability in image analysis workﬂows
between research labs. The plant-oriented version of BISQUE, PhytoBISQUE, provides
an application programming interface integrated with iPlant to develop and deploy new
algorithms, facilitating collaboration among researchers [29].
3.3. Open-Source Devices and Tools
Open-source is a term generally used to refer to tools or software that, as stated by
Aksulu & Wade, 2010 [30], “allows for the modiﬁcation of source code, is freely distributed,
is technologically neutral, and grants free subsidiary licensing rights.” Characteristically,
Open-Source Systems (OSS) are voluntary and collaborative in nature and their lifespan
lasts as long as there is an individual willing and able to maintain the system [102]. Few
traditional operation constraints such as scope, time, and cost factors affect these systems,
and they have the added advantage of enhancing the skills of the people involved while
producing tangible cost-effective technology output [30]. Some OSS development teams
take advantage of crowdsourcing which widens the scope and quality of ideas and reduces
project cycle time [103].

In phenomics, new crop management strategies require the co-analyses of both sensor
data on crop status and related environmental and genetic metadata. Unfortunately, this
data is mostly restricted to larger well-funded agricultural institutions since the instruments
for data collection are expensive. The available phenotyping instruments output data that is
challenging to interpret because of proprietary or incompatible formats. Many techniques
that are being applied are ready-made off-the-shelf software packages that do not have
speciﬁc algorithms for this data interpretation. Phenotyping researchers, therefore, have to
address the challenges of data interpretation and data sharing alongside limited access to
instrumentation (especially that which is well suited for ﬁeld phenotyping). Open-source
tools and devices represent a promising approach for addressing these challenges. Those be-
ing applied in phenomics are more accessible and easy to use while providing a connection
to a community of users with broader support and continuous improvement [104,105]. One
such open-source device is the MultispeQ device (PhotosynQ, East Lansing, MI, USA), an
inexpensive device linked through the PhotosynQ platform (https://www.photosynq.com,
accessed on 1 June 2021) to communities of researchers, providing useful data on plant
performance. The MultispeQ device is rugged and ﬁeld deployable, open-source, and
expandable to incorporate new sensors and techniques. The PhotosynQ platform connects
the MultispeQ instrument to the community of researchers, breeders, and citizen scientists
to foster ﬁeld-based and community-driven phenotyping [105].
An open-source prediction approach called Dirichlet-aggregation regression (DAR)
was put forward by Bauckhage and Kersting, 2013 [104], to address the challenge of manual
data labeling and running supervised classiﬁcation algorithms on hyperspectral data.
Hyperspectral cameras record a spectrum of several hundred wave-lengths ranging from
approximately 300 nm to 2500 nm, which poses a signiﬁcant challenge of data handling
in hyperspectral image analysis. Therefore, working with hyperspectral data requires
algorithms and architecture that can cope with massive amounts of data. Their research
shows that DAR can predict the level of drought stress of plants effectively and before it
becomes visible to the human eye.
Open-source software and platforms have also been developed that simplify the com-
puter vision image management pipeline. One such tool is the PlantCV image analysis
software package. It is used to build workﬂows that can be used to extract data from images
and sensors, and it employs various computational tools in python that are extendable,
depending on the required image analysis task, in order to provide data scientists and
biologists with a common interface [106]. It deploys additional open-source tools such as
LabelImg for image annotation [107]. PlantCV’s image processing library has been applied
in Deep Plant Phenomics which is an open-source software platform that implements deep
convolutional neural networks for plant phenotyping [108]. Deep Plant Phenomics pro-
vides an image processing pipeline that has been used for complex non-linear phenotyping
tasks such as leaf counting, mutant classiﬁcation, and age regression in Arabidopsis.
Another group of open-source tools that have been applied in phenomics are the
MobileNet deep learning architectures. MobileNet architectures are convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) with reduced complexity and model size and are suited to devices with
low computational power such as mobile phones. MobileNets optimize for latency resulting
from low computing power by providing small networks with substantial accuracy that
can be used in real-world applications [109]. One example is the MobileNetV2 which is
built to be used for classiﬁcation, detection, and segmentation of images. It uses ReLU6
non-linearity, which is suited to low-precision computation [110]. These are promising for
use on mobile phones which are widely accessible and commonplace to be potentially used
for ﬁeld phenotyping. MobileNets employ TensorFlow Lite, an open-source deep learning
framework used to deploy machine learning models on mobile devices [111].
Lighting problems in outdoor settings have the potential to affect open-source tools
and the performance of CNNs. There is, therefore, a need to test and train the networks
on plant images collected in the ﬁeld. A mobile-based CNN model was used for plant
disease diagnosis, and the problem of inconsistent light conditions was solved in this

study [112] by the use of an umbrella. This model was employed ofﬂine and displayed
decreased performance because of differing training datasets from the data collected in
the ﬁeld and, therefore, highlighted the need to capture more images using mobile devices
in typical ﬁeld settings and to use those very images for the training of the models in
order to improve the accuracy. In deploying open-source platforms and CNNs, there is an
additional challenge in developing tools that can analyze and determine a wide variety
of phenotypes from various crops, and it has not been possible to develop a one-size-
ﬁts-all platform for analysis. However, various platforms are thus far available for some
phenotyping tasks.
4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Field Phenotyping
In order to screen plants for valuable traits (such as grain size, abiotic stress toler-
ance, product quality, or yield potential), experiments with repeated trials are required
in different environments based on the objectives of the study. Much of the discussion of
phenotyping has focused on the measurement of individual plants in controlled environ-
ments. However, controlled environments do not provide an accurate representation of
plant growth in open-air conditions [7]. Field-based phenotyping (FBP) is now increasingly
widely recognized as the only approach that gives accurate depictions of the traits in
actual cropping systems. Currently, sensor systems suitable for high-throughput ﬁeld
phenotyping can simultaneously measure multiple plots and fuse a multitude of traits in
different data formats [17]. Through the use of vehicles carrying multiple sets of sensors,
FBP platforms are transforming the characterization of plant populations for genetic re-
search and crop improvement. Accomplishing FBP in a timely and cost-effective manner
has led to the use of unmanned aircraft, wheeled vehicles, or agricultural robots to deploy
multiple sensors that can measure plant traits in brief time intervals [7]. Therefore, pheno-
typing in many crop breeding programs is now being conducted by combining instruments
with novel technologies such as non-invasive imaging, robotics, and high-performance
computing on the FBP platforms [8].
Unmanned aircraft are particularly attractive for data acquisition because they enable
sensing with a high spatial and spectral resolution for a relatively low cost. Unmanned
helicopters (such as the one shown in Figure 4) can carry various sensors and have the ac-
commodation to carry larger sensors. In windy conditions, helicopters enable precise ﬂight
control and operations in cluttered environments because of their maneuverability and
ability to ﬂy at low speeds. Replicated collection of sensor data can be achieved through au-
tomatic ﬂight control when the helicopter is equipped with algorithms for ground detection,
obstacle detection and avoidance, and stable effective control [113]. Modern unmanned
aerial systems (UAS) are better equipped to manage the harsh environmental conditions
and obstacles due to rapid advances in technology such as collision technology, optical
sensors for machine vision, GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and compasses. However,
they still face the challenge of limited battery power, with electric batteries providing
between 10 to 30 min of battery power [25].

Although not commonly used for phenotyping, wheeled vehicles are sometimes used
in phenotyping systems for some research projects since they also provide for proximal
phenotyping. They have the advantage of being able to cover large areas and operate for
longer periods, along with the disadvantage of compacting and damaging the soil and
being costly because of the human labor required to operate the vehicle. According to
White et al. 2012 [7], high-clearance tractors were expected to play a more central role in
FBP as the wheeled vehicles of choice due to their high vertical clearance, availability, and
ease of use. They can be used for continuous measurements at different stages of the crop
growth process and can operate for longer periods compared to the UAVs. A variation of
high clearance tractors in the form of mobile motorized platforms, which eliminate the
need for human labor in the ﬁeld, have been developed and tested in various phenotyping
applications [114,115].
Phenotyping data collected using these FBP systems faces the challenge of instability
during motion and weather changes, which cause occlusion and mal-alignment in the
images. This is partially addressed by using proximal sensing at slower speeds in order to
improve image resolution (although this limits the areal coverage in one ﬂight and does
not fully solve the misalignment). Data processing for this data has signiﬁcantly improved
in recent years with AI-enabled snapshot and line scanning imaging software, optimized
speciﬁcally for unmanned aircraft such as structure-from-motion photogrammetry [87,116].
One approach that has been proposed to enhance the application of these platforms for
sensing in ﬁeld conditions is adapting ﬁeld conditions to align with the HTP ﬁeld tech-
niques (rather than the traditional approach of adapting the instruments for the ﬁeld),
depending on the crop of interest without compromising the realistic crop evaluation in
ﬁeld conditions [6].
5. Phenotyping Communities and Facilities
The growth in plant phenotyping research coupled with the integration of AI tech-
nology has fostered the development of laboratories and centers equipped with high-
throughput phenotyping technologies. Some of these plant phenotyping centers are
members of the International Plant Phenotyping Network (IPPN), which works with
various member organizations in academia and industry to distribute relevant information
about plant phenotyping and increase its visibility [117]. Partner facilities such as the
Australian Plant Phenomics Facility, a government-funded national facility, provide access
to infrastructure such as glass-house automation technologies, digital imaging technologies,
long-term data storage, etc. [118]. Such facilities have and continue to provide subsidized
access to advanced AI-phenotyping technologies that would otherwise be inaccessible due
to the costs of operation and maintenance. In addition, as high-throughput phenotyping
becoming more common, there has come the issue of data-merging with many laboratories
gathering phenotypic data that rarely enter the public domain where it could be accessed
by other institutions to foster interdisciplinary research [8]. Networks such as the IPPN
continue to provide access to phenotyping information generated by member organiza-
tions which is key in enabling cooperation between the organizations and advancing the
phenomics agenda through collaborative research.
Besides the academic institutions and government organizations, private industry
companies (a few of which have been highlighted here) are establishing themselves as
key providers and facilitators of plant phenotyping AI technology around the world. Bio-
pute technology provides high-end research instruments such as multispectral cameras
for ﬁeld phenotyping, drones for aerial photography, and provides after-sales support
services to their customers. In partnership with universities and research institutes, Bio-
pute provides innovations that are contributing to the progress of plant phenotyping
in China (http://www.bjbiopute.cn, accessed on 1 June 2021). KeyGene is an agricul-
tural biotechnology company providing tools for precision breeding and digital pheno-
typing investing in deep learning-based algorithms and virtual reality for data visual-
ization (https://www.keygene.com, accessed on 1 June 2021). PhenoTrait Technology

Co., Ltd. mainly focuses on plant phenotyping using the photosynthesis characteris-
tics of plants and promoting the use of phenotyping technologies to improve crop qual-
ity, crop yield, and environmental conditions in China. Some of their products include
high-throughput phenotyping instruments, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging systems, etc.
(http://www.phenotrait.com, accessed on 1 June 2021). Photon Systems Instruments (PSI)
is a company in the Czech Republic that also supplies a range of phenotyping systems,
both ﬁeld and laboratory-based, including root system phenotyping. They have also in-
corporated machine learning to integrate robotics into the systems they develop to better
automate the processes (https://psi.cz, accessed 1 June 2021).
6. Conclusions
Recent advancements in high-throughput phenotyping technologies have led to signif-
icant strides in plant phenomics. The on-going integration of artiﬁcial intelligence into these
technologies promises progression into smarter and much faster technologies with signiﬁ-
cantly lower input costs. In the area of phenotyping image data analysis, the integration
of AI into the data management pipeline of tomography and thermography is on a lower
scale in comparison to the other imaging techniques. The application of deep learning in
the data analysis of these techniques is promising, as it has been successfully implemented
in analysis of composite materials [88] and medical diagnostics [94]. As much as ﬁeld
phenotyping is the most effective way to collect phenotypic data, it is still being conducted
on a relatively lower scale than is possible. Artiﬁcial intelligence technologies also require
large amounts of data from various sources to improve their accuracy. This provides an
opportunity to invest more into the tailoring of current technologies for ﬁeld data collection
and the utilization of already existing AI adaptable technologies, such as smartphones, to
increase the quantity of quality data. Smartphones have become widespread consumer
products, and the simplicity and ease of use of their sensors suggest that their use can be
explored in agriculture [104]. Some of the challenges that would need to be addressed are
that advanced signal processing on smartphones has to cope with constraints such as low
battery life, restricted computational power, or limited bandwidth [104]. The use of citizen
science alongside professional researchers [119] in data collection also has the potential
to aid in increasing the amount of data collected. The overall goal of employing these
approaches and technologies is to provide the infrastructure that allows for tracking how
plant traits progress throughout the growing season and facilitate the coordination of data
analysis, management, and utilization of results using AI methods.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

Abstract: Residential water end-use events (e.g., showers, toilets, faucets, etc.) can be derived from
high temporal resolution (<1 min) water metering data. Past studies have collected data at different
temporal resolutions (e.g., 4 s, 5 s, or 10 s) without assessing the impact of the temporal aggregation
interval on end-use event features (e.g., volume, ﬂowrate, duration) due to the unavailability of
data at a sufﬁcient temporal resolution to enable such analyses. We recorded the time between
every magnetic pulse generated by a magnetically driven residential water meter’s measurement
element (full pulse resolution) using a new, open-source datalogging device and collected data for two
residential homes in Utah, USA. We then examined water use events without temporally aggregating
data and compared to the same data aggregated at different time intervals to evaluate how temporal
resolution of the data affects our ability to identify end-use events, calculate features of individual
events, and classify events by end use. Our results show how collecting full pulse resolution data
can provide more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features along with producing
more discriminative event features that can only be estimated from full pulse resolution data to make
event classiﬁcation easier and more accurate.
Keywords: residential water use; end uses of water; smart water metering; datalogging; water demand
1. Introduction
Regional water use patterns result from the combination of individual water user
behaviors. Knowledge of water use behavior at the household level is required to un-
derstand and manage these regional patterns through a combination of supply-side and
demand management strategies. Availability of widespread high temporal resolution water
use data can help achieve urban water management sustainability goals and expand our
knowledge about residential water use [1,2]. High temporal resolution data (i.e., obser-
vations recorded with a time interval <1 min) enables detection, characterization, and
classiﬁcation of water end uses. An end-use event represents a water using occurrence
(e.g., a toilet ﬂush). Most residential water meters in operation today are not capable of
collecting this type of data. Additional dataloggers are commonly used to collect high
temporal resolution data on top of magnetically driven meters [3–5]. These dataloggers
count magnetic pulses (rotations of a magnet within the meter’s measuring element), with
each pulse representing a ﬁxed volume of water passing through the meter. High resolution
data are typically recorded by aggregating the number of pulses that occur within each
time step of a selected temporal resolution. The pulse data are then processed and analyzed
to generate end-use information.
Water use events are usually identiﬁed in recorded data as periods of non-zero ﬂow,
and several event features are calculated for use in classifying events into a corresponding
end-use category (e.g., a toilet, shower, faucet). Average, mode, and maximum ﬂow rate;
duration; time of occurrence; volume; and the number of vertices within the shape of an
event’s trace (vertices are deﬁned at the change points where ﬂowrate transitions from one

ﬂowrate to another) are the most commonly used features for event classiﬁcation [6–9].
Most of these features are inﬂuenced by the temporal resolution at which data are recorded
and by the volumetric pulse resolution of the meter (i.e., the volume of water that each
pulse represents). The volumetric resolution of the pulses is constant across meters of the
same size and brand, while its magnitude can vary signiﬁcantly across different meter sizes
and brands [3]. For example, the volumetric pulse resolution of a 5/8-inch (in) Neptune
T-10 m is approximately 0.03 liters (L) [3], whereas the pulse resolution for a 1 in Master
Meter Bottom Load meter is approximately 0.16 L [3]. Datalogger devices used for high
temporal resolution water use data collection have no control over this parameter (except
for counting multiple rotations as a single pulse), which leads to inconsistency in collected
data, even when a consistent temporal resolution is used.
Consistency in the temporal resolution of data collection for residential end-use stud-
ies has not been the case, with different studies having collected data at different temporal
resolutions (aggregating all water use within a ﬁxed time interval): 10 s temporal resolu-
tion [10–13], 5 s [14,15], and more recently at 4 s [3,5,16,17]. Cominola et al. [2] assessed
the impact of temporal resolution on end-use disaggregation and classiﬁcation accuracy
using a stochastic model and found that accuracy increases for data at higher temporal
resolutions. However, the highest temporal resolution simulated was 10 s [2] as the model
relied on a dataset collected at this resolution [10]. Despite the number of end-use studies
reported in the literature, no recommended temporal resolution has emerged as a standard.
Accurately identifying simultaneous events (i.e., two different water use events occur-
ring at the same time) and differentiating events that occur at similar ﬂow rates are highly
dependent on the temporal resolution of the data. Data temporal resolution also affects
the accuracy of calculated event features. For example, the estimated duration of an event
depends on data temporal resolution because the start and end of an event can occur at any
moment within a data recording interval, leading to uncertainty at the beginning and end
of an event, especially with longer recording intervals. The duration of an event, usually
calculated as the number of recorded time intervals for which there is non-zero ﬂow, has an
impact on the average ﬂow rate, which is often calculated by dividing an event’s volume by
its duration. The accuracy with which event features can be estimated, in turn, impacts the
methods that can be used for event classiﬁcation and the accuracy of classiﬁcation results.
Water use events can be mechanical (those where the resident has no direct control
over the ﬂow rate, the duration, or both (i.e., toilets, clothes washer, dish washer, automated
irrigation events) or user-regulated (where the resident has control over the ﬂow rate and
or duration—i.e., showers, faucet, bathtub, manual hose irrigation). Mechanical events
are typically classiﬁed using their features, including duration, volume, ﬂow rate, or cycle
information [7–9]. However, different approaches have been used to classify user regulated
events. For example, after identifying and classifying mechanical events at a residence,
Nguyen et al. [9] used a rules-based procedure to label all user regulated events with a
volume less than 15 L as faucet events. They then identiﬁed events using more than 15 L
as either shower or irrigation events. In contrast, Attallah et al. [7] classiﬁed all types
of events using a procedure that relies on training a classiﬁcation model based on the
features of a set of events manually labeled by a water user, indicating that it is possible
to classify all types of events based on their features. However, the ability to accurately
discriminate between events of different types based on their features clearly requires
accurate estimates of event feature values. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of recorded
data and subsequent processing of time aggregated data using ﬁltering techniques can
remove distinct event features (resulting from ﬂow rate ﬂuctuations) that could otherwise
facilitate the classiﬁcation process.
There are currently no general methods for ﬁltering raw pulse data, disaggregating
overlapping events, and classifying events that have been tested and proven to work
across the different temporal resolutions that have been used for data collection in past
residential end-use studies. While a generalized approach would be incredibly useful, it
remains impractical given the data collection capabilities of current smart water meters

and dataloggers (i.e., in many cases, data collection is constrained by available metering
and/or data logging technology). Furthermore, a comprehensive characterization of how
the temporal resolution at which data are recorded affects the values of event features, and
hence our ability to classify them has not been possible until now given the lack of data at a
sufﬁcient temporal resolution to enable this analysis.
In this study, we sought to evaluate how the temporal resolution of residential water
use data affects our ability to identify end-use events, calculate features of individual
events, and classify events by end use. While we tested some of the same data aggregation
intervals tested by Cominola et al. [2], we also explored multiple data recording intervals
with temporal resolutions higher than the ﬁnest resolution they used (10 s) to explore data
resolutions used in more recent end-use studies [14,17]. We employed a datalogger device
designed speciﬁcally to collect water use data on a residential water meter by recording
all magnetic pulses generated by the meter as they happen, producing what we term
“full pulse resolution data”. These data record water use at the highest possible temporal
resolution (i.e., the full pulse resolution of the meter) and represent data not previously
collected or analyzed. We then used these data to address the following research questions:
(a) How does the temporal aggregation interval of recorded data affect the ability to identify,
classify, and calculate attributes of individual events and the data volumes generated?, and
(b) What unique features can be extracted for events derived from full pulse resolution data
that can be used to identify and classify end-use events, including cases when simultaneous
events occur? We analyzed full pulse resolution data using an innovative data collection
method and then aggregated the data to simulate different temporal resolutions to generate
insights into event features that answer these questions. This paper shows that collecting
full pulse resolution data has several advantages versus temporally aggregated data, a key
contribution to the ﬁeld of water demand management and water end-use studies.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Sites
Full pulse resolution water use data were collected at two homes (referred to as
sites in this study) located in the cities of Logan and Providence, UT, USA. These homes
were selected because they had different meter brands as well as different water ﬁxture
technology. Built in 2006, Site 1 has newer water ﬁxtures with faucets and showers using a
single actuation lever. Built in 1968, Site 2 has older water ﬁxtures with separate hot and
cold water adjustment knobs. Table 1 shows the length of the data record collected and the
main characteristics of these sites.

2.2. Data Collection
Full pulse resolution water use data were collected using the Pulse-Datalogger [18],
which is a device designed speciﬁcally for this application. The Pulse-Datalogger builds
on hardware previously developed by the authors [3,5] and measures the magnetic ﬁeld
outside of a magnetically driven water meter’s register, similar to devices used in past
studies. In addition to a magnetometer sensor (LIS3MDL), the Pulse-Datalogger is com-
posed of a microcontroller (ATMEGA328P chip), a Micro SD card, and a real-time clock
(RTC). Figure 1 shows the Pulse-Datalogger deployed and the datalogging board. Most

water meters operating today are not capable of collecting and storing sub-minute reso-
lution water use data due to power and data volume limitations and because they were
not designed or programmed to do so. These meters were designed to report aggregated
volumes at periodic intervals, primarily for billing purposes. Therefore, studies collecting
high resolution data have relied on datalogger devices that operate on top of existing
meters and temporally aggregate data in an effort to extend the battery or data storage
capacity of such devices to a short number of weeks (usually between 1 and 6 weeks of
continuous deployment).

are enclosed in the blue box shown in panel (a). 
The Pulse-Datalogger was developed to capture data at the full pulse resolution by 
recording the time between each magnetic pulse. To accomplish this, we minimized 
power consumption and computation time by moving pulse recognition off the microcon-
troller (as is commonly done) and onto the magnetometer sensor. Under this approach, 
the Pulse-Datalogger can collect full pulse resolution data and match the highest observed 
deployment autonomy of similar dataloggers that record temporally aggregated data (i.e., 
approximately 5 to 6 weeks of continuous operation). A two-threshold approach (upper 
and lower) is used by the device to register pulses when the observed magnetic signal 
goes below the lower and subsequently above the upper threshold. Thresholds are de-
fined by briefly (<1 min) running water through the meter after installing the device and 
recording the maximum and minimum magnetic field values observed in this period. The 
upper and lower thresholds are then set as a fraction of the maximum and the minimum 
recorded, as shown in Figure 2. The coefficients (0.8 and 0.2) used in threshold definition

were calibrated under controlled conditions at the Utah Water Research Laboratory for the
meter brands and sizes installed at Sites 1 and 2.
The microcontroller spends most of its time in a sleep state, only waking up when it
receives an interrupt from the magnetometer or RTC. On an interrupt from the magnetome-
ter (when a pulse is detected), the microcontroller computes the time since the last pulse
and writes that to the Micro SD card. On an interrupt from the RTC (scheduled every day
at midnight), the microcontroller restarts its internal clock to reduce time drift and starts
logging in a new ﬁle. The ﬁrmware and hardware design of the Pulse-Datalogger are open
source and publicly available on GitHub [18].

The Pulse-Datalogger outputs a comma separated values (CSV) file including a three-
line header with information about (1) Date, a datetime value including the date and time 
in format “Year/Month/Day Hour:Minute:Second” indicating when data logging started; 
(2) Site, a 3 digit numerical identifier used to keep track of where the logger is installed; 
and (3) ID, a datalogger identifier (three-digit numerical) used to identify the datalogger. 
The Pulse-Datalogger records a single variable; time since last pulse (in ms) where the first 
value indicates time since the datetime included in the header. Raw data were then for-
matted, adding a date/time stamp to facilitate subsequent analyses and resulting in a CSV 
file containing two columns—the date/time stamp and the time since last pulse. The raw 
and formatted data files are publicly available in the HydroShare repository [19] in the 
RawPulseData and PulseData_Processed folders, respectively. The raw and formatted data 
collected are referred to as “pulse data” from this point forward. All data were collected 
between 11 February and 15 April 2022 when no outdoor water use was happening; there-
fore, only indoor water use was observed. 
To verify the quality of the full pulse resolution data, the volume read by the Pulse-
Datalogger was compared with the volume computed from manual readings of the me-

counting the revolutions of a spinning magnet inside the meter where the movement of 
the magnet is actuated by a fixed volume of water flowing through the meter. Thus, the

accuracy that can be obtained by the Pulse-Datalogger is that of the meter on which it is
installed (i.e., the Pulse-datalogger and the meter’s register use the same measurement
element inside the meter and should record the exact same volume). At Site 2, all data
were collected in a single deployment (from 29 March 2022 to 15 April 2022). All data
collected in this deployment were accepted for this study as the percent error of the volume
recorded by the Pulse-Datalogger when compared to the manual meter readings was less
than 0.1%. At Site 1, multiple data collection periods were needed (the start and end of
each data collection period are available in HydroShare [19]). The largest error observed for
deployments at Site 1 was 1.5%. During controlled laboratory experiments, the maximum
error observed was less than 0.5%.
To fully explore event features and to facilitate our ability to identify and classify
individual events in the data, we needed a set of labeled events with known types. Labeled
events were generated in two ways. First, occupants of the two homes were asked to
label a subset of individual water use events by recording the event type and start time
Water 2022, 14, 2457

using a cellphone application. Table 2 shows the total number and type of user labelled
events. Second, we conducted a controlled experiment at Site 1. In this experiment, a set of
individual faucet, toilet, shower, and bathtub events were recorded without any other end
use occurring simultaneously. Each individual event type was repeated sequentially at least
ten times for each ﬁxture in the home, waiting at least 30 s between event repetitions and
two minutes when switching ﬁxtures. Showers, bathtubs, and faucets were kept running
for at least 30 s, and toilets were ﬂushed normally. Repetitions were performed to provide
information about the variability in event feature values. To ensure the quality of the full
pulse resolution data collected during the controlled experiment, we manually read the
water meter’s register at Site 1 at the beginning and end of the experiment, calculated the
volume of water used, and compared it with the volume read by the Pulse-Datalogger. We
observed a percent error of less than 0.05%. The user labeled events and the controlled
experiment event data are also available in the HydroShare repository [19].

2.3. Data Analyses
To evaluate the impact of the temporal resolution on event features and our ability to
identify end uses of water, we aggregated the full pulse resolution data collected into the
following temporal resolutions (selected from past studies): 1 s, 4 s, 5 s, 10 s, 15 s, 30 s, and
1 min. Data for all temporal aggregations evaluated have a start date/time of midnight on
the ﬁrst day of data available for each site, and subsequent timestamps were generated by
adding the temporal resolution to this date and time. Given that water use events begin and
end at random times, the exact date/time at which temporal aggregation intervals begin
may affect the features calculated for some individual events. However, for consistency of
our analyses, we began all time aggregated data at midnight.
Table 3 lists the features and data temporal resolutions used in several past studies
that developed methods for end-use disaggregation and classiﬁcation based on single point
water use measurements. Some features (number of vertices, mode ﬂow rate, shape) are
commonly computed after ﬁltering the data to remove oscillations from the ﬂow trace data.
The ﬁltering technique may vary depending on the temporal resolution of the data and
the event features to be calculated. The main function of these features is the identiﬁcation
of single and overlapping events, disaggregation of overlapping events into single events,
and classiﬁcation of single events into end-use categories.

We compared the impact of data temporal resolution on the number of events detected
for each site and the main features obtained for the same events across the selected temporal
resolutions. Additionally, we inspected user-labeled events to illustrate how the temporal
resolution impacts event features beyond those tabulated and to investigate additional
event features that can only be extracted from full pulse resolution data. We observed the
impact of the temporal resolution on parameters included in Table 3 that can be computed
without ﬁltering data or disaggregating overlapping events.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Separation of Events
Analyses of the controlled experiment pulse data indicated there are delayed or trailing
pulses happening at the end of each event that need to be counted as part of the event
(Figure 3). After examining 132 events from the controlled experiment, we observed
that only in three cases did these pulses happen more than 9 s after the previous pulse.
Therefore, we adopted 9 s as the threshold to separate events in the pulse data (i.e., if a
pulse happens more than 9 s after the previous pulse, a new event is initiated). For time
aggregated data derived from the pulse data with temporal resolutions that were larger
than 9 s, an event was ended when a value of 0 pulses was recorded. For 1 s, 4 s, and 5 s time
aggregated data, we used 9, 8, and 10 s as the threshold to separate events, respectively. In
past studies [3,5,16,17], event deﬁnition did not include these trailing pulses as events were
terminated at the ﬁrst time-step for which there were no recorded pulses. For example, we
labeled single-pulse events as unclassiﬁed in our past studies and identiﬁed a large number
of them (79% of all indoor events [17]) across all participant sites. It is unclear whether
such events have been labeled as leaks by other authors; however, the pulse data shows
that trailing pulses are part of the preceding event and have been misrepresented in the
past. Single pulse events can also result from brief end uses or leaks.

individual event. The ﬁrst value of each event was removed for visualization as it represents time
since the previous event.
The optimal value of the threshold used to separate events may vary for different
sites depending on pipe pressure and ﬁxtures characteristics (e.g., year, model) or types. If
choosing a smaller value (that does not capture trailing pulses), single-pulse events must
be identiﬁed and included in preceding events when they are determined to be resulting
from such events. In the opposite case (selecting a value larger than optimal), a method for
separating events occurring close together must be deﬁned and applied to avoid combining
multiple events into one. Table 4 shows the number of events detected at each temporal
resolution using the thresholds described above. The number of detected events decreases

as the temporal resolution decreases. This will affect estimation of event features and all
frequency analyses conducted.

Further analysis showed that if we separate events from 4 s data when a value of
0 pulses is observed as we did in our past studies [3,7,16,17], the total number of events
recorded for Site 1 and 2 is 1928 and 3377, and the number of single-pulse events increases
to 489 and 1266, respectively (as compared to the numbers in Table 4). A similar result is
observed by conducting the same analysis on 5 s data, also used in past studies [14]. When
collecting 10 s data and separating events [10,11], the aggregation interval is long enough
that trailing pulses are included within the last time interval of the event. However, with
10 s data, we observed only approximately 90% and 77% of the events detected with the
pulse data, at Sites 1 and 2 respectively, which will also affect frequency estimates and
calculation of event features. Collecting data at coarser temporal resolutions (30 s or 1 min)
further reduces ability to detect individual events. At these coarser temporal resolutions,
we observed more consecutive events being aggregated into single events as water use
never returns to zero (the criteria used to separate events).
3.2. Analysis of Event Features
Figure 4 shows the percent change in the duration of events and the average ﬂow
rate for each event derived from pulse data versus the four smallest temporal resolutions
analyzed (1, 4, 5, and 10 s). Data at temporal resolutions larger than 10 s were not further
analyzed as the number of events detected already indicates these data are not suitable for
end-use analyses without more advanced event separation and identiﬁcation techniques.
Single-pulse events were not included in these analyses. Events were matched based on
their start date and time (pairing an event identiﬁed from time aggregated data with the
closest event from the pulse data). Events with start time differences larger than 1.5 times
the temporal resolution of the data were removed from the analysis. By doing this, we
ensure we are comparing the same event across all temporal resolutions and removing the
effect of aggregated consecutive events. Comparing an aggregated event with multiple
single components would result in larger differences than those observed in Figure 4. The
volume of the events analyzed will not change in most cases as our constraints are aimed
at identifying the same event across all temporal resolutions, and the number of pulses
for each event does not change, regardless of the temporal resolution at which pulses
are recorded.

this, we ensure we are comparing the same event across all temporal resolutions and re
moving the effect of aggregated consecutive events. Comparing an aggregated event with 
multiple single components would result in larger differences than those observed in Fig-
ure 4. The volume of the events analyzed will not change in most cases as our constraints 
are aimed at identifying the same event across all temporal resolutions, and the number 
of pulses for each event does not change, regardless of the temporal resolution at which 
pulses are recorded. 
 
Figure 4. Percent change in the duration of events (top row) and average flow rate (bottom row) 
for all events at different temporal resolutions compared with events identified from pulse data. 
Figure 4. Percent change in the duration of events (top row) and average ﬂow rate (bottom row) for
all events at different temporal resolutions compared with events identiﬁed from pulse data.
The calculated duration of events increases as the temporal resolution decreases. The
median percent change in duration when collecting 10 s data is larger than 30%, while
the same value for events identiﬁed from 1 s resolution data is approximately 3% for
both sites analyzed. The average ﬂow rate of events decreases as the temporal resolution
decreases. This has important implications when assessing the performance of individual
ﬁxtures using the average ﬂow rate (as is commonly done for faucets or showerheads).
Durations calculated from lower resolution data will be biased high and will not accurately
reﬂect behavior. Flow rates will be biased low and will not be representative of the true
performance of ﬁxtures.
Furthermore, there are differences in the number of data points collected for each
event (e.g., an event that lasts 11 s will have 11 data points at 1 s resolution and 2 data
points at 10 s resolution). This disparity will impact estimates of event features such as
the mode ﬂow rate, median ﬂow rate, number of vertices in the shape of the event, and
any other features depending on frequency or shape of an event. A smaller number of
data points will produce less information that can be used to identify single or overlapping
events, split overlapping events into single components, and calculate unique features that
can be extracted for classiﬁcation purposes. The number of data values recorded for each
event is also inﬂuenced by the volumetric pulse resolution of the meter. A larger value for
volumetric resolution (L/pulse) will result in fewer pulses.

Figure 5 presents the distributions of average ﬂow rate values calculated from the
controlled experiment events. Our prior analyses of water use event data indicate that the
most distinctive features used for event classiﬁcation are duration and average ﬂow rate.
Mode and maximum ﬂow rate are highly correlated (between 0.9 and 1) with the average
ﬂow rate. Event volume, which is a multiple of duration and average ﬂow rate, is highly
correlated with duration. Figure 5 indicates that, at Site 1, it is possible to differentiate end
uses based on the average ﬂow rate of events alone at most temporal resolutions given that
the distributions of average ﬂow rate values for different event types largely do not overlap
(distributions of average event ﬂow rates do overlap for 10 s data). Additionally, mechanical
events of the same type (e.g., toilets, clothes washer, dish washer) will have similar duration.
For showers and faucets, duration will exhibit larger variability. The median average ﬂow
rate for the upstairs bathroom shower at Site 1 estimated from pulse data is 8.38 LPM
versus 6.62 LPM when estimated from 10 s data. The duration of events (with the exception

3.3. Event Features Extracted from Pulse Data 
To date, features used for classifying events have all been calculated from time ag-
gregated data. As our results above show, depending on the data collection interval, fea-
tures calculated from time aggregated data may or may not discriminate events. Pulse 
data provide the opportunity to extract new features that may be more discriminating and 
thus make classification easier and more accurate. The previous analyses focused on cal-
culating features that could be compared across multiple temporal resolutions; however, 
the pulse data and features calculated from it can also be used to classify events. For ex-
ample, Figure 7 shows that median pulse spacing can be used to classify individual events 
following simple rules (e.g., any event with a median pulse spacing larger than 1400 ms 
is a faucet event). Such rules may even be able to discriminate individual fixtures (e.g., 
any event with a pulse spacing less than 500 ms is a flush of the downstairs bathroom 
toilet). Similar rules with different values could be defined for each household, which 
would facilitate data processing and classification, particularly in real-time applications. 
While the specific rules used to classify events may be unique to each site and its fixtures, 
we anticipate that similar rules can be implemented for any residential household, as long 
as fixtures operate at different flow rates and have different duration, which is normally 
the case.

Figure 7 shows that median pulse spacing can be used to classify individual events follow-
ing simple rules (e.g., any event with a median pulse spacing larger than 1400 ms is a faucet
event). Such rules may even be able to discriminate individual ﬁxtures (e.g., any event
with a pulse spacing less than 500 ms is a ﬂush of the downstairs bathroom toilet). Similar
rules with different values could be deﬁned for each household, which would facilitate
data processing and classiﬁcation, particularly in real-time applications. While the speciﬁc
rules used to classify events may be unique to each site and its ﬁxtures, we anticipate that
similar rules can be implemented for any residential household, as long as ﬁxtures operate
at different ﬂow rates and have different duration, which is normally the case.

1. 
Another pulse data feature that may assist in the classification process is the shape of 
events. For example, all shower events in Figure 8 (events from the same fixture) have a 
similar starting and ending pattern when observing pulse data. Figure 9 shows pulse and 
temporally aggregated data for 10 flushes of the same toilet. The pulse data shape is con-
sistent for repetitions of the same event, and distinctive for each fixture. While temporally 
aggregated data captures high and low flow rate phases within each event, it does not 
provide a distinctive signature that can be used for events classification (Figures 8 and 9). 
Analyzing the pulse spacing for the first and last n values of each event may assist in the 
classification process and support fixture level classification. We found that these patterns 
are different but exist in the pulse data for all fixtures analyzed for both sites.

3.4. Analysis of Overlapping Events
Section 3.3 demonstrates how pulse data can facilitate individual event classiﬁcation.
However, overlapping events typically require additional processing as the ﬂow trace must
be disaggregated into single components that can later be classiﬁed. The frequency with
which overlapping events occur is determined by the number of occupants of a site, their
schedule, and water use preferences. In our analysis of 4 s data collected at 31 residential
properties [21], we found that approximately 10% of all the events identiﬁed were overlap-
ping events, and they represented approximately 40% of the volume recorded. However,
data were collected during summer and winter months and include irrigation events that
are long in duration with high probability for overlapping [17]. On average, after applying
a splitting procedure that we designed to disaggregate overlapping events, each identiﬁed
overlapping event produced 4.4 single events. Again, the large number of single events per
overlapping event largely resulted from long duration irrigation events. The large volume
comprised of overlapping events makes their disaggregation and classiﬁcation essential in
order to provide an accurate picture of residential water use. However, identifying and
splitting overlapping events is dependent upon the temporal resolution of the data, and
Water 2022, 14, 2457
13 of 18
classifying events resulting from the decomposition of overlapping events is challenging,
as these events will have different features depending on both the temporal resolution of
the data and the algorithm or method used to separate them.

Figure 10 shows the ﬂow rate of an overlapping event composed of multiple single
events observed at Site 2 The oscillations in ﬂow rate observed at all temporal resolutions
other than the pulse data reinforce the need for applying ﬁltering techniques to smooth the
ﬂow trace for time aggregated data prior to calculating event features. These oscillations
are a result of the volumetric pulse resolution of the meter (i.e., only a discrete number of
pulses can be counted in any time interval) and the data recording interval (i.e., pulses are
not always evenly spaced in time at a factor of the temporal resolution). The oscillations
are largest for 1 s data and decrease for 10 s data by sacriﬁcing ﬂow trace details. Filtering
can be used to address these oscillations but may remove the ability to observe low ﬂow
rate events overlapping other end uses and may also mask features related to the original
shape of the event that are important for ﬁxture level classiﬁcation.
At certain temporal resolutions, some events and event features cannot be seen. For
example, the short low ﬂow rate event observed after 8:22 a.m. (Figure 10) is of similar
magnitude to the oscillations observed in 4 and 5 s data and would likely be ignored at
these resolutions, while for 10 s data the event is not distinguishable. It would not be
possible to separate such events without building an overly sensitive model that may
erroneously separate some single events given that ﬂow rate changes also occur in some
Water 2022, 14, 2457

single events. In our prior work, the number of overlapping events increased during
summer months when irrigation was occurring, as irrigation events tend to have longer
duration than indoor events. Therefore, the importance of collecting data at a sufﬁcient
temporal resolution to identify and separate overlapping events increases during these
months. The pulse data shown in Figure 10 are clearly superior to the time aggregated data
in recording the complex shape of this overlapping event and will make identiﬁcation and
separation of overlapping events easier and more accurate. The steady behavior of pulse
data opens the possibility for event disaggregation without ﬁltering, which would facilitate
more accurate classiﬁcation of the single, disaggregated events as their original features
can be preserved.

3.5. Data Volumes
Collecting data at higher temporal resolutions has several data management implica-
tions related to the data volume generated [7]. These result from general needs to record
(e.g., locally on a datalogger), transmit (e.g., over a telemetry network), store and organize
(e.g., in a database), manage, and analyze the data for potentially many sites. Commonly,
high temporal resolution data consist of two recorded variables, a date/time stamp identi-
fying the data aggregation interval and the number of pulses and/or volume of water that
has passed through the meter during that interval. Given the high temporal resolution of
the data, the volume of generated data can grow quickly. One strategy for reducing the
volume of data generated is to record only non-zero values. Another strategy is to record a
Water 2022, 14, 2457
15 of 18
beginning date/time and then record only water usage without time stamps (assuming
that the data are regularly spaced). The pulse data we collected consist only of numeric
values for the time since the last pulse, which is similar to the second option. The pulse
data are dense during times when water use is occurring, but no values are recorded when
ﬂow through the meter is zero.
 
Figure 10 shows the flow rate of an overlapping event composed of multiple single 
events observed at Site 2 The oscillations in flow rate observed at all temporal resolutions 
other than the pulse data reinforce the need for applying filtering techniques to smooth 
the flow trace for time aggregated data prior to calculating event features. These oscilla-
tions are a result of the volumetric pulse resolution of the meter (i.e., only a discrete num-
ber of pulses can be counted in any time interval) and the data recording interval (i.e., 
pulses are not always evenly spaced in time at a factor of the temporal resolution). The 
oscillations are largest for 1 s data and decrease for 10 s data by sacrificing flow trace 
details. Filtering can be used to address these oscillations but may remove the ability to 
observe low flow rate events overlapping other end uses and may also mask features re-
lated to the original shape of the event that are important for fixture level classification.

To assess the impact of these data collection and recording strategies, we compared
daily ﬁle sizes generated from pulse data recorded on our datalogger versus daily ﬁles for
time aggregated data of different temporal resolution using both possible options: (1) with
time stamps and no zeros; and (2) with zeros without time stamp (Figure 11). We used full
days of data collected and generated daily CSV ﬁles for each temporal resolution.

pulse data are dense during times when water use is occurring, but no values are recorded 
when flow through the meter is zero. 
To assess the impact of these data collection and recording strategies, we compared 
daily file sizes generated from pulse data recorded on our datalogger versus daily files for 
time aggregated data of different temporal resolution using both possible options: (1) with 
time stamps and no zeros; and (2) with zeros without time stamp (Figure 11). We used 
full days of data collected and generated daily CSV files for each temporal resolution.

It is expected that ﬁle sizes (for pulse data and option 1) will be larger during summer
months (or times of higher water use), as ﬁle sizes will increase as water use does. Pulse
data preserves more detail about events and generates equal or lesser volumes of data when
compared with temporal resolutions that would allow end-use classiﬁcation. Recording
data with full pulse resolution does not increase the data volume generated when compared
with time-aggregated data up to a 10 s temporal resolution.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, we presented analyses and comparison of residential water use data
at different temporal resolutions in comparison to full pulse resolution data collected
using a specialized datalogger. To answer our ﬁrst research question about how the
temporal aggregation interval of recorded data affects ability to identify, classify, and
calculate attributes or features of individual events, we demonstrated that as data temporal
resolution decreases, the number of detected end-use events decreases. We also showed
how estimates of event features and the shape of overlapping events were impacted with
decreasing temporal resolution (e.g., as data temporal resolution decreases, estimated event
duration increases and average ﬂowrate decreases). Our results show that temporally
aggregating pulse data reduces ability to accurately estimate event features and generates
oscillations in the data that require ﬁltering techniques to remedy. However, those same
ﬁltering techniques can remove or mask important event features that could be used for
event classiﬁcation.
Regarding the volume of data generated, the ﬁnal component of our ﬁrst research
question, pulse data captured a larger, and more accurate, number of events at each of the
sites without negatively impacting the volume of data generated when compared to time
aggregated data collected at temporal resolutions most suitable for end-use identiﬁcation,
disaggregation, and classiﬁcation (i.e., up to 10 s resolution). Additionally, when over-
lapping events occur, time aggregation of the data can mask the features of such events,
whereas pulse data provide a much cleaner trace that would better facilitate disaggregating
overlapping events.
We observed that the values of features calculated for events changed as the tem-
poral resolution decreased, which will negatively impact any classiﬁcation algorithm or
methodology that uses those features. Key event features, such as the mode ﬂow rate, the
average ﬂow rate, and the duration vary as the temporal resolution decreases leading to
more overlap in the distributions of these values and less power in using these features
to discriminate event types (e.g., for classiﬁcation). These variations in the number of
identiﬁed events and their features have implications on the accuracy of any analyses based
on frequency or event features. For example, estimates of the technical performance of
Water 2022, 14, 2457
17 of 18
water using ﬁxtures are impacted by data temporal resolution and would best be done
using pulse data.
Regarding our second research question, the pulse spacing values within events
provide unique features that could be used to more accurately identify and classify end-use
events. In our controlled experiment, events of different types exhibited unique behavior
at the beginning and end of events, and the median pulse spacing for events of different
types shows great promise as a discriminating feature for classiﬁcation purposes. These
results also argue for using meters with higher pulse resolution (i.e., smaller volume per
pulse), which would provide greater detail in the trace of individual events and reduce
the likelihood of “zero-pulse” events (i.e., events having volume smaller than the pulse
resolution of the meter) that are registered as part of the subsequent event. While it may not
be practical to replace existing meters for this reason, and in some cases may be impossible
given requirements for safe and accurate meter operation at higher ﬂowrates (e.g., those
seen at homes with automated irrigation systems), the pulse resolution of the meter may be
an important consideration when installing new or in retroﬁtting existing meter networks.
While we evaluated data from only two single family residential properties, the
data were similar for both newer, single-lever-type ﬁxtures and older dual-knob-type
ﬁxtures, indicating that the uniqueness of event features from different water use ﬁxtures
we observed in the pulse data (e.g., ﬂow rate, pulse spacing, event shape, and unique
behavior at the beginning and ending of events) will exist across water using ﬁxtures at
any property. Thus, collecting pulse data could provide generalized capability to not only
provide temporally aggregated data for any existing operational purposes (e.g., regular
billing) but can also provide more detailed information and discriminating event features
for use in end-use studies. More discriminating features could, in turn, make end-use
disaggregation and classiﬁcation algorithms simpler and more computationally efﬁcient.
This could change smart metering technology by enabling more efﬁcient computation
of end-use information directly on the meter using edge computing techniques such as
those demonstrated by Attallah et al. [5]. This would open the door for more real-time
applications of the data, including customer feedback portals, in-home displays, and leak
detection and alerting.
The beneﬁts of pulse data are clearly illustrated here and warrant consideration in
future data collection efforts. While differences in the volumetric pulse resolutions of
different meter brands, models, and sizes will still exist, collecting full pulse resolution
data would eliminate differences among data collected with different temporal resolutions,
leading to greater standardization of data collection and analysis methods. Full pulse
resolution data were superior in clearly identifying a larger number of end-use events, they
contributed to more accurate and less ambiguous calculation of event features, they reduce
or eliminate the need for data ﬁltering prior to calculating event features, they more clearly
capture the complexity of overlapping events, and they provide new event features that are
highly discriminatory among events of different types—all without increasing the volume
of data that have to be recorded, transmitted, stored, and analyzed. These beneﬁts bring
opportunities for smart-metering manufacturers to adopt similar data collection strategies
which can lead to better information about water use, faster analytics, and more accurate
user feedback.

  Extract 1: For treatment T100, the temporal variability of average SWC in the root zone resulted in general more limited than the other two treatments, as a consequence of the higher irrigation volumes applied. The average SWCs ranged between 0.24 cm3 cm−3 and 0.30 cm3 cm−3, except that for short periods when they were slightly lower. This circumstance evidences that the average soil water content of the soil profile was generally higher than field capacity (SWCfc = 0.24 m3 m−3), with values sometimes close to saturation.

Abstract Micro-irrigation is considered one of the most efficient water distribution systems and allows increasing water use efficiency if coupled with effective water-saving irrigation management strategies as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or partial root-zone drying (PRD) techniques. However, application of these strategies makes it crucial the real-time monitoring of soil and crop water status, in order to identify appropriate irrigation scheduling parameters (irrigation timing and doses) and to prevent irreversible damage of plant system and/or crop yield reductions. Even if midday stem water potential (MSWP) is considered one of the most affordable indicator for direct determinations of crop water status, its measurement requires skilled operators, is destructive and time consuming, so that indirect and fast estimations are desirable. In this direction, agro-hydrological models can be considered an easy-to-use tool for indirect evaluations of soil and crop water status aimed to identify irrigation scheduling parameters even when micro-irrigation distribution systems and water saving management strategies are adopted. The paper, after examining the eco-physiological response of citrus orchards to soil water deficit, assessed the potential of FAO-56 agro-hydrological model to identify the crop water stress under different irrigation management strategies. Experiments carried out during three years (2009–2011) allowed identifying the crop water stress response to soil water deficit conditions, also confirming the schematization proposed in FAO-56 paper for citrus orchards. Moreover, after evaluating the similarity between the measured MSWP with the simulated crop water stress coefficient, Ks, it was proved the fairly good performance of FAO-56 agro-hydrological model to predict soil water content (RMSE = 0.04 m3 m−3), from one side, and the crop response to different irrigation management strategies, from the other. The obtained results evidenced that the crop water stress coefficient estimated by the model can be used as a suitable indicator to replace the tedious and time-consuming field measurements of MSWP.

Introduction Water availability is one of the most limiting factors in worldwide agriculture, which represents the largest water-consuming sector. Among typical Mediterranean crops, citrus represents the second largest fruit crops in the European Union. The main producing countries are Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, with a total surface slightly higher than 322,000 ha, corresponding to about 25% of the total acreage of fruit orchards (Eurostat, 2014). The most of these orchard productions are located in arid or semi-arid regions, where the growing season is usually dry. Due to the high crop water requirements and the large surface involved, there is an increasing interest to improve crop sustainability in order to optimize crop water use, to preserve the productivity maximizing the economic benefits, while maintaining environmental quality (Provenzano et al., 2013, Rodriguez-Sinobas et al., 2016). Moreover, considering the fact that the annual number of precipitation days and the annual precipitation are decreasing, as predicted by climate change scenarios for Mediterranean region (Smith et al., 2007), it is evident that implementation of strategies aimed to increase water use efficiency can no longer be postponed. If micro-irrigation is considered the most efficient water distribution system and several researches have been proposed design procedure to improve field distribution uniformity (Barragan et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2006), a number of works have been emphasizing that “water-saving” management strategies, such as regulated deficit irrigation, RDI, (García-Tejero et al., 2010, Gasque et al., 2016, Rodrigues et al., 2008) and partial root-zone drying, PRD, (De la Hera et al., 2007, Marsal et al., 2008, Romero et al., 2012), can contribute to significant reductions of the seasonal crop needs and consequently to increase water use efficiency. However, the most effective way to increase water use efficiency is the precise control of irrigation that should be supported by soil/plant-based water status indicators (leaf/stem water potential, sap flow, trunk diameter, infrared thermometry) aimed to identify appropriate irrigation scheduling parameters (irrigation timing and doses). Under RDI, water is generally supplied at levels below full crop transpiration during specific periods of the growing season. Operating in this way it is possible to balance the plant vigor with the potential production (Costa et al., 2007, De Souza et al., 2005), by limiting the irrigation volumes. On the other hand, PRD method involves the exposure of half of the roots system in a drying state, while the remaining roots are wetted, so to alter the irrigated roots in time cycles. Application of these water saving strategies, however, makes it crucial to monitor crop water status in order to identify, in real time, the level of water stress to which the crop is subjected, so as to avoid irreversible consequences to the crop, as well as the loss of productions. Leaf water potential (LWP) is a commonly used variable to describe crop water status and, when measured at predawn or midday, represents an indicator of any instantaneous crop water stress condition. The cumulative integral of LWP, referred to a specific time or during certain phenological stages, represents a link between the short-term stress and the long-term growth response (Myers, 1988). Even if the measurements of leaf water potential are considered one of the most affordable methods for direct determinations of crop water status, these determinations require skilled operators, are destructive and time consuming, so that indirect estimations are desirable. In this direction, agro-hydrological models can be considered as an easy-to-use tool for indirect evaluations of soil and crop water status, as recently demonstrated for olive groves by Rallo et al. (2014a), as well as to estimate other parameters related to the crop development (Minacapilli et al., 2009, Cammalleri et al., 2013). However, the application of agro-hydrological models, require the preliminary calibration and validation of the algorithms used to schematize the different processes occurring in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum, based on site-specific experimental investigations. For a long time, irrigation in citrus orchards has been scheduled according to the FAO method described in the paper number 56 (FAO-56), by considering the single or dual crop coefficient approach (Allen et al., 1998). During the different phenological stages, crop coefficients can be chosen among tabular values or according to experimental results. However, this scheduling strategy has some uncertainty, particularly in citrus orchards where crop water use depends on tree light interception (Consoli et al., 2006) or crop load (Yonemoto et al., 2004). González-Altozano and Castel (1999) proved that in citrus orchards, fruit drop is not very sensitive to soil water deficit applied during the phase-II of fruit growth and, if returning to the full water dosage for a sufficiently long period before harvesting, it is possible to compensate the fruit growth (Cohen and Goell, 1988). On the other hand, Hutton et al. (2007) evidenced that even if water restrictions are applied only during the linear phase of fruit development, severe plant water stress might reduce the final fruit size at harvest. If from one side FAO-56 model has been diffusely applied, its potential to detect water stress conditions has not been largely investigated yet. For different crop systems in fact, model validation has been generally carried out based on the comparison between measured and estimated soil water contents (Sammis et al., 2012) without considering the actual crop water status. Researches in this direction should allow to verify how water management can affect the different adaptive crop behavior to water stress under different irrigation water saving strategies and environmental conditions, avoiding wrong decisions in irrigation water management programs, mainly in those environments prone to drought. The main objectives of the paper were: i) to investigate on the eco-physiological response of the citrus orchard to soil water deficit and ii) to assess the potential of FAO-56 agro-hydrological model to identify water stress conditions when the crop is maintained under Regulated Deficit Irrigation (RDI) applied only during the phase II of fruit growth. After the initial model calibration, based on the comparison between measured and simulated soil water contents in the root zone, its ability to identify actual crop water stress in the periods of water restriction was assessed according to the observed similarity between the temporal dynamic of the simulated water stress coefficient (Ks) with the measured midday stem water potentials, MSWP. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description, experimental design and irrigation treatments The field experiments were carried out during three years (from 2009 to 2011) in Senyera, Spain (39° 3′ N, 0° 30′ W, 23 m a.s.l), in a commercial citrus orchard planted with Navel orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) grafted onto Cleopatra mandarin trees (Citrus reshni Hort.). The orchard was planted in 1982 in a square configuration, with spacing between plants equal to 5 m. Three treatments, including one full irrigation and two RDI and at least 8 plants per treatments excluding the borders, were applied in order to replace different amounts of irrigation needs, IN, obtained by multiplying reference evapotranspiration to the crop coefficient, Kc, after subtracting the precipitation of the period. Reference evapotranspiration was evaluated according to the Penman-Monteith equation, in the version modified by FAO (Allen et al., 1998), whereas the crop coefficient, Kc, was determined by using the site-specific polynomial equation, as a function of the measured canopy fraction cover, fc (Castel, 2005). In the full irrigation treatment (T100), irrigation dose (Id) replaced about 110%IN in 2009 and 100%IN in 2010 and 2011, whereas in the two RDI treatments, Id was scaled to a total amount of 60%IN (T60) and 40%IN (T40), only during the phase II of fruit growth (initial fruit enlargement phase, occurring from July 13 to September 13 in 2009, from July 12 to August 30 in 2010 and finally, from July 12 to August 28 in 2011), being the plots irrigated as T100 during the remaining periods of the year. Irrigation water was automatically supplied by a drip system consisting of two drip lines per tree row laid on the soil surface at a distance of approximately 0.9 m from the row, including eight 7.4 l h−1 pressure-compensating emitters per single tree. One flow meter per irrigation treatment recorded the exact volumes of water applied during each irrigation event, whose frequency ranged between two irrigations per week during winter and six irrigation per week during summer. In the period when deficit irrigation was applied to T60 and T40, water in the soil was restored every 1–2 day. The soil textural class, according to USDA, is sandy loam, with sand and clay contents ranging between 46 and 60% and 18–22% respectively. The fertilizer application was the same in all the plots, with a seasonal application of 260, 65 and 130 kg ha−1 of N, P2O5 and K2O respectively, from April to October. Meteorological data were acquired from a standard weather station located about 500 m apart the experimental orchard and belonging to the Irrigation Technology Service (STR) of Valencian Institute of Agrarian Research (IVIA). 2.2. Monitoring soil and crop water status In each treatment, soil water content (SWC) was monitored along a soil profile with a FDR (Frequency Domain Reflectometry) down-hole probe (Enviroscan, Sentek), installed at distances of about 1.0 m and 0.5 m from the tree and the dripline respectively. Each probe allowed monitoring soil water content at four depths (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 m) every 15 min interval and then the measurements were averaged at daily time step. Crop water status was monitored according to the Midday Stem Water Potential (MSWP, MPa), measured with a pressure chamber (Solfranc SF-Pres-35), approximately every week and on three trees for each treatment, by following the procedure described in Turner (1981). Determinations were carried out in at least two mature leaves, bagged in plastic bags and covered with a silver foil at minimum two hours prior the measurement. To assess the model ability to identify the stress conditions consequent to the adopted RDI strategies, the Water Stress Integral (SMSWP, MPa. day) was calculated according to Myers (1988): (1) where is the mean midday steam water potential for any time interval (i,i + 1), c is a threshold of MSWP below which crop water stress conditions occur and n is the number of days in the interval. The c value was subtracted from each to emphasize the relative difference of crop water status between treatments (Myers, 1988). Similarly, using FAO-56 model, the water stress integral, SFAO-56, was calculated as: (2) where is the mean stress coefficient for any interval (i,i + 1), and the datum value equal to 1.0, corresponds to the minimum stress level reached in absence of water stress. 2.3. Description and parametrization of FAO-56 model FAO-56 model (Allen et al., 1998) simulates the root zone depletion, D, at a daily time step, according to a simple tipping bucket approach: (3) where Di (mm) and Di−1(mm) are the root zone depletions at the end of day i and i − 1, Pi (mm) is the net precipitation, ROi is the surface runoff, ETai (mm) is the actual evapotranspiration, Ii is the irrigation depth and DPi (mm) is the deep percolation of water moving out of the root zone. The domain of the depletion equation ranges between 0, occurring when the soil is at field capacity, to a maximum value related to the total plant available water, TAW (mm), evaluated as: (4) where SWCfc (m3 m−3) and SWCwp (m3 m−3) are the soil water contents corresponding to field capacity and wilting point and Zr (m) is the depth of the root system. The multiplicative coefficient adjusts the units in order to express TAW in mm. When considering the dual crop coefficients approach, crop potential evapotranspiration, ETc, evaluated in absence of soil water deficit, is obtained by multiplying the Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration, ET0 (Allen et al., 1998) to a coefficient, Kcb + Ke, composed by two terms. The first, Kcb, is the basal crop coefficient accounting for the plant transpiration, whereas the second, Ke, is the soil evaporation (E) coefficient, accounting for the topsoil evaporation. When soil water content in the root zone and in the evaporative layer drop below the relative critical levels, crop water stress and friction on soil evaporation phenomena occur and the amount of actual crop transpiration and soil evaporation are evaluated by multiplying Kcb and Ke, respectively, to a transpiration (Ks) and an evaporation (Kr) reduction coefficient. Analytically, actual evapotranspiration can be evaluated as: (5) Both the coefficients Ks and Kr range between 0 and 1. In absence of crop water stress Ks = 1, whereas under soil water limiting conditions, Ks < 1. After a rainfall or following irrigation Kr is 1, and soil evaporation is maximum. As the soil evaporative layer dries, Kr becomes lower than one and evaporation decreases till reaching zero when no water is available for evaporation in the upper soil layer. The reduction factor, Ks, is a function of the amount of water crop depleted from the root zone (D) and, when D exceeds the readily available water (D > RAW), can be calculated as: (6) The depletion coefficient, p, in Eq. (6) accounts for the resistance of crop to water stress and the values corresponding to different crops are tabulated in the original publication (Allen et al., 1998). Considering that p depends on the atmospheric evaporative demand, a function for adjusting p for ETc is usually applied (Van Diepen et al., 1988). In FAO-56 model, irrigation timing can be evaluated based on the management allowed depletion, MAD (Merriam, 1966), depending on management and economic factors in addition to the other eco-physiological factors influencing p. When irrigation is scheduled in absence of crop water stress, the value of MAD can be assumed equal to p. On the contrary, when irrigation is managed under water-deficit conditions, the MAD parameter is higher than p. This last circumstance is typical of the semiarid Mediterranean environments. The original algorithm proposed in the FAO-56 paper (“Appendix 8: Spreadsheet for applying the dual Kc procedure in irrigation scheduling”) only permits to schedule full irrigation (MAD = p) and not considers crops maintained under water stress conditions. This circumstance represents a limitation in the Mediterranean environment, where water is often a limiting factor for crop production. For this reason, Rallo et al. (2012) proposed a first amendment of the original algorithm to allow irrigation scheduling of arboreal crops maintained under soil water deficit conditions. The amendment allowed to separate the eco-physiological factor, affected by the crop stress, from the management allowed depletion term, that is related to the farmer choices and depends on unsystematic variables like the economic factors. Moreover, for drought tolerant crops, it has been observed that a convex shape better represents the crop water stress function (Rallo and Provenzano, 2013), so that a further adjustment of FAO 56 model was proposed to improve its performance in the estimation of actual transpiration fluxes and soil water contents for drought tolerant crops under soil water deficit conditions (Rallo et al., 2014a). In order to run the model, average soil water content at field capacity and wilting point were assumed equal to 0.24 cm3 cm−3 and 0.12 cm3 cm−3, based on the soil water retention curves previously estimated, at different depths, on the same soil by Martí et al. (2013). The soil Available Water (AW) resulted therefore equal to 120 mm m−1. Reference daily evapotranspiration, ET0, was computed by means of meteorological data and the FAO Penman-Monteith model. The basal crop coefficients, Kcb, were obtained from Table 17 of the FAO-56 manual (Allen et al., 1998), by considering a citrus orchard characterized by a fraction cover of 70% and the absence of ground cover. The values of Kcb in the mid and final crop development stages were then adjusted to account for non standard climate conditions (minimum relative air humidity and wind speed different than 45% and 2.0 m s−1).

Statistical analysis for model validation The model performance was evaluated based on the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean bias error (MBE), defined as: (7) (8) where N is the number of measured data, and Xsim,i and Xobs,i are the predicted and measured values of any considered variable (Kennedy and Neville, 1986). Moreover, a Student t-test allowed evaluating the statistical differences between measured and simulated data (Kennedy and Neville, 1986): (9) For any fixed significance level, α, the differences are statistically significant if the calculated t is lower than a critical threshold, tcrit. In this respect, a significance level of α = 0.05 was assumed. Finally, the predictive power of the model was evaluated according to the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, E, (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970, Willmot, 1981): (10) A perfect match between simulated and observed data is represented by E = 1, whereas for E = 0 the model prediction has the same accuracy of the measured mean; values of the efficiency coefficient lower than 0 indicate that the mean of measured values is a better predictor than the considered model. 3.

(5) 1.7 3.4 7.7 6.7 15.3 24.5 1.5 13.4 24.8 As can be observed, during the considered years there was a certain variability in the rainfall distribution, that was characterized by yearly values ranging between 840 mm in 2009 and only 566 mm in 2010 (Fig. 1f); on the other hand, even if the distribution of reference evapotranspiration, ET0, was similar during the three years, with daily peaks between 5.5 mm and 6.5 mm generally occurring in July (Fig. 1d), slight differences were observed in cumulated yearly values, equal to 1202 mm, 1132 mm and 1067 mm in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The total irrigation depths supplied in treatment T100 was quite variable in the three years and ranging between 512 mm in 2009, and 315 mm in 2011. Of course, during the three years, T60 and T40 received a total irrigation depth lower than T100, as a consequence of the minor volumes applied during the periods of water restrictions. However, it has to be noticed that in 2009 the total volumes provided in the three treatments were considerably higher if compared to the other two seasons; during the first year, in fact, experiments permitted tuning the system in order to identify the duration of watering and therefore the actual volume to provide during each irrigation event. During the periods of water restrictions, total rainfall, P, and reference evapotranspiration, ET0, was determined to be equal to 19.7 mm and 405.0 mm in 2009, higher than those registered in the corresponding periods of 2010 and 2011. On average during the three years, MSWP in T100 ranged between −1.00 MPa and −1.17 MPa, whereas in T60 varied between −1.05 MPa and −1.65 MPa and finally, in T40, between −1.14 MPa and −1.98 MPa. According to the MSWP thresholds suggested by Goldhamer (2012), these values evidenced mild stress levels in treatments T100 (MSWP > −1.5 MPa), and slightly higher stress levels in T60 and T40 in which, however, only occasionally the stress conditions become severe (MSWP < −2.0 MPa). As can be observed in Table 2 the minimum values of MSWP observed during the periods of restricted water applications declined at decreasing irrigation amount. Similar results can be obtained when considering the water-stress integral (SMSWP, MPa.day), evaluated with Eq. (1), by assuming a value of c = −1.0 MPa (Gasque et al., 2016) in agreement with González-Altozano and Castel, 1999, corresponding approximately to the maximum MSWP measured in the field (Table 2). For the three treatments, Fig. 2 shows the values of water-stress integral, SMSWP, during the periods of water restriction versus the total provided irrigation depths. As can be observed, the value of SMSWP decreased at increasing irrigation depth, being T100 characterized by very low values of the dependent variable. The robust relationship between the two variables, characterized by a regression coefficient R2 = 0.82 (significant at p < 0.01 level according to the Pearson’s correlation coefficient), confirms that SMSWP can be considered a good indicator of the plant-water relationships, as suggested by García-Tejero et al. (2010). Thus, in the absence or under limited precipitation, this indicator can be used to predict the total irrigation depth to apply in order to achieve a desired stress level during the phase II of fruit growth (Goldhamer, 2012).

Values of water stress integral, SMSWP, versus the irrigation depth applied during the periods of water restriction, I, evaluated by using Eq. (5) with c = −1.0. However, it has to be noticed that this relationship is influenced by the threshold value, c, assumed in Eq. (1) and its precision is affected by the time step during which MSWPs are measured. In order to improve the estimation of SMSWP it is therefore necessary to carefully estimate the value of c, as well as to increase the acquisition frequency of MSWP even by using new sensors, like the non-invasive Zim-probe (Zimmermann et al., 2008, Zimmermann et al., 2010, Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2016) or field spectroscopy (Rallo et al., 2014b). Therefore, further experiments will be addressed to identify appropriate threshold value and to assess the consequences that the assumption of the coefficient c may have on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the productions. When considering the average depth applied in each irrigation event and in the periods of water restriction, the values of SMSWP are still correlated with the average irrigation depth, with a slope of the regression curve that declines at increasing of irrigation depth (Fig. 3). Under the examined frequency of watering therefore, the values of SMSWP also depends on how irrigation was managed and particularly on the average irrigation depth provided in each watering.

Soil-plant water relations and crop response to water deficit Fig. 4 shows the values of measured MSWPs as a function of the corresponding soil water status evaluated distinctly at the four different soil depths (0.1 m, 0.3 m, 0.5 m, 0.7 m) and expressed in terms of soil water content (SWC) or depletion (D). The values of SWC were determined as the average of 48 records acquired per day (one measurement every 15 min) during the period of water restriction, and can be considered representative of a soil layer with a thickness of about 10 cm (Provenzano et al., 2015).

Experimental values of Midday Stem Water Potential (MSWP) and corresponding soil water status expressed in terms of soil water content, SWC, and depletion, D, during the periods of water restriction. Dotted and solid vertical lines correspond to wilting point and field capacity, respectively. As can be observed, the eco-physiological crop response to soil water deficit was quite different for the investigated soil layers and treatments. When considering the soil top-layer, the evaporative process was dominant if compared to the root water uptake, so that MSWP did not depend on soil water status. At the higher depths, where root water uptake was largely concentrated, crop water status was affected by soil water content, especially for treatment T40, characterized by the largest variability of the investigated variables. However, if considering the average soil water contents of the whole soil profile, Fig. 5 shows the variability between MSWP and the average soil water status. As can be noticed, at higher soil water contents, MSWPs are dispersed around to a value of −1.0 MPa and tend to decline at decreasing SWCs. Even though it is quite difficult to identify a clear threshold of depletion, the value of D* ≈ 20 mm, corresponding to a SWC* ≈ 0.22 can be assumed as the critical threshold for the considered soil. This threshold separates two different plant behaviors: i) D < D* for which MSWPs are approximately constant and equal to −1.0 MPa, expressing a condition of absence or limited water stress (González-Altozano and Castel, 1999) and ii) D > D* for which the lower is the depletion, the smaller is the MSWP as a consequence of the progressively increasing crop water stress.

Dotted and solid vertical lines correspond to wilting point and field capacity, respectively. The crop water stress function, Ks(D), proposed by FAO-56 is also represented in the secondary axes (dashed line). The recognized variability of MSWP with soil water status is reproduced, in a certain way, by the crop water stress function schematized by FAO-56 model, according to which any reduction of plant transpiration (stress coefficient), Ks, occurring for D > RAW, is linearly related to the depletion D (Eq. (6)). For the investigated soil-crop system however, the observed depletion threshold correspond to a coefficient p of Eq. (6) of about 0.2, lower than p = 0.5 proposed in Table 22 of FAO-56 paper (Allen et al., 1998). 3.3. Validation of FAO-56 model and identification of crop water stress conditions Fig. 6 shows the rainfall events during the three years (upper row), the temporal dynamic of observed (average) and simulated soil water contents, SWC, as well as the irrigation depths provided in 2009, 2010, and 2011 (from left to right), for treatments T100, T60 and T40 (from up to down). Standard deviations of measured SWCs are also indicated. As can be observed, for all the treatments, the model predicts fairly well the average soil water contents in the root zone measured during the considered periods.

The standard deviations of measured values, ±σ, are also indicated with grey bars. For treatment T100, the temporal variability of average SWC in the root zone resulted in general more limited than the other two treatments, as a consequence of the higher irrigation volumes applied. The average SWCs ranged between 0.24 cm3 cm−3 and 0.30 cm3 cm−3, except that for short periods when they were slightly lower. This circumstance evidences that the average soil water content of the soil profile was generally higher than field capacity (SWCfc = 0.24 m3 m−3), with values sometimes close to saturation. On the other hand, the dynamic of SWC in T60 and T40 during the examined years resulted to quite different, in line with the rainfall events and the applied amount of irrigation. In both these treatments, the average SWCs resulted slightly lower than the field capacity for long periods of the monitoring period, while evident reductions of water availability in the soil profile occurred mainly in the second half year of 2010 and only episodically in 2011. It is interesting to notice that during the periods of water restriction, the dispersion of measured SWCs generally increased at decreasing SWCs, due to the partial wetting of soil profile occurring in RDI treatments (T60 and T40). Table 3 shows the statistical parameters associated to the comparison between simulated and measured soil water contents, obtained for the three treatments during the whole period of observation. Table 3. Results of statistical comparison between simulated and observed soil water contents during the whole period of observation.

According to the Student t-test, the observed differences between measured and simulated SWCs in the three treatments were statistically not significant at a significance level of α = 0.05. According to the statistical analysis therefore, it is evident that FAO-56 model can be considered suitable to reproduce the temporal variability of soil water content in the root zone. This result, in conjunction with the accurate analysis of crop response to water stress, can be used for irrigation scheduling purposes, by avoiding costly and time-consuming field monitoring. Similar results have been recently obtained even for drought tolerant crops like olive trees (Rallo et al., 2014a) even if in that case it was necessary to implement on FAO-56 model, a more appropriate crop response function to water stress. The ability of the model to identify the actual water stress conditions occurring in RDI treatments, was assessed according to the observed similarity between measured midday stem water potentials, MSWP, and simulated crop water stress coefficient, Ks, evaluated as the ratio between actual and maximum transpiration simulated by the model. Fig. 7, Fig. 8 show, respectively for T60 and T40 treatments, the temporal dynamics of reference evapotranspiration, precipitation and irrigation events, (upper row), as well as measured midday stem water potentials, MSWP, and simulated crop water stress coefficient, Ks, (middle row). In the lowest row of the figure, the cumulated water stress integrals during the periods of water restriction, expressed in terms of measured MSWP or simulated Ks and determined according to Eqs. (1) and (2), are also shown. Download : Download high-res image (529KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7.

As can be detected, in both treatments the absolute values of MSWP generally spread around 1.0 MPa for the most of examined years, identifying conditions of negligible water stress (González-Altozano and Castel, 1999), except that in the periods of water restriction, coincident with the phase II of the fruit growth (Gasque et al., 2016). During such periods and in both RDI treatments in fact, it can be noticed that MSWPs, after an initial decline, followed patterns that depends on the water supply (irrigation or rainfall). During the three years, the minimum absolute values of MSWP resulted equal to −1.30, −2.09 and −1.53 MPa in T60, and equal to −1.48, −2.50 and −1.95 MPa in T40. The lowest crop water stress observed in 2009 was an obvious consequence of the higher irrigation volumes provided, as previously discussed. When considering the model results in terms of simulated stress coefficient Ks, it can be easily verified that this indicator can be used for explaining the variability of measured MSWPs. As can be observed in fact, the dynamic of Ks coefficient follows the temporal patterns of MSWP, as a consequence of the correct schematization of the stress function under crop water deficit conditions. Even considering the cumulative values of the water stress integral, Scum, during the water restriction periods (lowest row of Fig. 7, Fig. 8), it is possible to notice that the modeled Scum,FAO-56 values fit fairly well to the measured Scum,MSWP, confirming the ability of the model to identify the differences, in terms of temporal patterns of water stress integral, recognized among the treatments. Fig. 9a shows the measured Midday Stem Water Potential (absolute values), MSWP, as a function of the simulated water stress coefficient, Ks, during the periods of water restriction, whereas Fig. 9b illustrates the comparison between cumulated water stress integrals evaluated according to measured MSWP (Scum,MSWP) and simulated Ks (Scum,FAO-56), based on a weekly time step.

As can be noticed in Fig. 9a the two variables are linearly correlated, with intercept and angular coefficient equal to 2.14 MPa and −1.14 MPa (R2 = 0.73), respectively. This relation allows extrapolating the −2.0 MPa of MSWP proposed as threshold value in this same orchard (Gasque et al., 2016) to a Ks of 0.12. On the other hand, when considering the cumulative values of the water stress integral (Fig. 9b) it can be observed that, for each treatment, a strong linear correlation exist between Scum,MSWP and Scum,FAO-56. Of course, the variability ranges of both the considered variables increase at decreasing of the applied irrigation depth, as a consequence of the higher cumulated stress levels achieved by crop. In addition, even the slope of the regression relationships, depending on the adopted irrigation strategy, increases at increasing of the cumulative stress levels, underlining the sensitivity of the model to identify the observed variability of crop water status, characterizing the different examined treatments. This last result indicates that under the examined conditions the model can be successfully used to indirectly estimate and with a fairly good approximation, the cumulative stress occurring in the field during the phase II of fruit growth and corresponding to any pre-fixed irrigation strategy. 4. Conclusions In the paper, the eco-physiological response of citrus orchard to soil water deficit conditions was investigated for three years, through field measurements of soil and plant water status carried out in a commercial citrus orchard located near the town of Senyera, Spain. Three different irrigation treatments, including one full irrigation (T100) and two regulated deficit irrigation were in particular examined. In the later treatment, irrigation water supply was scheduled according to different percentage of irrigation needs (T60 and T40) applied only during the phase II of fruit growth (approximately from mid of July to the beginning of September), and the crop was irrigated at T100 during the other periods of the year. Soil water status was expressed in terms of soil water content (SWC) or depletion (D), whereas crop water status considered the midday stem water potentials (MSWP) measured in the field, as well as the water stress integral evaluated in the periods of water restriction. Experimental data evidenced the absence of stress in treatment T100 and mild or moderate stress levels in T60 and in T40 in which, however, conditions of severe stress were only occasionally achieved. The analysis showed a strong correlation between the water stress integral and the applied irrigation depth, which can be used to predict the seasonal irrigation volumes to be provided when a desired crop stress level is required. On the other hand, MSWPs were dispersed around a value of −1.0 MPa when the average SWCs in the soil profile ranged between the soil field capacity SWCfc = 0.24 m3 m−3 and a threshold value of soil water content of SWC* ≈ 0.22m3 m−3, corresponding to a soil depletion D* ≈ 20 mm. At values of SWC ≤ 0.22m3 m−3, MSWP was linearly decreasing at decreasing SWC (increasing D), as a consequence of the gradually rising crop water stress. Finally, the performance of FAO-56 model to identify the temporal dynamic of soil and crop water status, under different irrigation strategies, was demonstrated. The comparison between measured and simulated soil water contents in the root zone evidenced that the model is able to predict, with reasonable accuracy, the average SWC in the root zone, with differences statistically not significant and errors of estimation always lower than 0.04 m3 m−3. On the other hand, the model ability to predict the actual crop water stress was demonstrated according to the observed similarity between the temporal dynamic of the simulated water stress coefficient (Ks) with the measured midday stem water potentials, MSWP. In fact, it was observed that the temporal variability of MSWP can be explained by the dynamic of simulated Ks. Even extending the analysis to crop water stress cumulated during periods of water restriction, it was observed how the model predictions fitted quite well to the corresponding measured, confirming the suitability of the model to identify the differences, in terms of temporal pattern of water stress integral, characterizing the examined treatments. After a site-specific calibration accounting for different irrigation strategies therefore, the cumulative water stress integral evaluated by the model can be used as a surrogate variable of MSWP for irrigation timing established according to “model-based” irrigation scheduling, even under periods of water restrictions.

Introduction The concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly. Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’ productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover, IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse, Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow. While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole, in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes. IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture, applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V. The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II. Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening. Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators, and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing, weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee, WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity, gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12], [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors, actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure 4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values, irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All 1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose. 2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable. Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices. That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4 mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to 250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics) [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates. The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data. Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii) Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone, and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization, and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality, or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze, explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables. d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture. These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT, AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage, Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing. In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture. Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature, gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller. FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee. 2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks, Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation. IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information. RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming, livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications. 1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior, plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop. Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming. IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction, and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily. Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover, identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented. Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called, which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property. g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring, and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm. This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73]. Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests, livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping, and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions. Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models, assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80]. In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment. Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management, plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern. Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity, and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health, activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below: a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die. c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140 bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly. f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee, WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity. FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like: Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table 2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication: Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating. Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing: If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent. B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment. Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption, jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering, cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping, replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality, authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage. Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services, illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely: hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system, applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties. Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present, probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service, reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies. In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity, real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content, and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600 meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques. Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security, in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8]. When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3) France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154]. French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products, technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158]. The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty. Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners. This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7) Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163]. Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in 2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050 to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology. Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top 10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits. However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming, greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII. IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges. A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature, humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes, codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex. Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore, this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure. After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor, it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture. To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals, agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field and agricultural technologies.

SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN 
GROWTH 
Summary 
Sensors and sensor networks have an important impact in meeting environmental challenges. Sensor 
applications in multiple fields such as smart power grids, smart buildings and smart industrial process 
control significantly contribute to more efficient use of resources and thus a reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions and other sources of pollution.  
This report gives an overview of sensor technology and fields of application of sensors and sensor 
networks. It discusses in detail selected fields of application that have high potential to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and reviews studies quantifying the environmental impact. 
The review of the studies assessing the impact of sensor technology in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions reveals that the technology has a high potential to contribute to a reduction of emissions across 
various fields of application. Whereas studies clearly estimate an overall strong positive effect in smart 
grids, smart buildings, smart industrial applications as well as precision agriculture and farming, results for 
the field of smart transportation are mixed due to rebound effects. In particular intelligent transport systems 
render transport more efficient, faster and cheaper. As a consequence, demand for transportation and thus 
the consumption of resources both increase which can lead to an overall negative effect.  
This illustrates the crucial role governments have to enhance positive environmental effects. Increased 
efficiency should be paralleled with demand-side management to internalise environmental costs. Further, 
minimum standards in the fields of smart buildings and smart grids in regard to energy efficiency can 
significantly reduce electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, this report also 
highlights that applications of sensor technology are still at an early stage of development. Government 
programmes demonstrating and promoting the use of sensor technology as well as the development of open 
standards could contribute to fully tap the potential of the technology to mitigate climate change.

Sensor technology for green growth 
Environmental degradation and global warming are among the major global challenges facing us. 
These challenges include improving the efficient use of energy as well as climate change. ICTs and the 
Internet play a vital role in both, being part of the problem (they consume energy and are a source of 
pollution) and have the potential to provide important solutions to it (ICT applications in other sectors have 
major potential to improve environmental performance). 
Various examples illustrate the role of ICTs as a provider of solutions to environmental challenges: 
Smart grids and smart power systems in the energy sector can have major impacts on improving energy 
distribution and optimising energy usage (Adam and Wintersteller, 2008). Smart housing can contribute to 
major reductions of energy use in hundreds of millions of buildings. Smart transportation systems are a 
powerful way of organising traffic more efficiently and reducing CO2 emissions.  
All these applications have one important attribute in common: They all rely on sensor technology 
and often on sensor networks. Because of the important impact of applications of sensors and sensor 
networks in meeting environmental challenges, this analysis has been developed in the context of OECD’s 
work

ICTs 
and

grids] and the WPIE’s Programme of Work 2009–2010. It is also a direct follow-up to the Seoul 
Declaration for the Future of the Internet Economy, issued at the close of the OECD Ministerial Meeting 
in June 2008, which invited the OECD and stakeholders to explore the role of information and 
communication technologies (ICTs) and the Internet in addressing environmental challenges.  
The report opens with some technological fundamentals in describing sensor technology and sensor 
networks. This is followed by an overview of different fields of application. Selected sensor and sensor 
network applications are discussed as well as their environmental impact.  
Sensors, actuators and sensor networks – a technology overview 
Sensors measure multiple physical properties and include electronic sensors, biosensors, and chemical 
sensors. This paper deals mainly with sensor devices which convert a signal detected by these devices into 
an electrical signal, although other kinds of sensors exist. These sensors can thus be regarded as “the 
interface between the physical world and the world of electrical devices, such as computers” (Wilson, 
2008). The counterpart is represented by actuators that function the other way round, i.e. whose tasks 
consist in converting the electrical signal into a physical phenomenon (e.g. displays for quantities measures 
by sensors (e.g. speedometers, temperature reading for thermostats).  
Table 1 provides examples of the main sensor types and their outputs. Further sensors include 
chemical sensors and biosensors but these are not dealt with in this report. Outputs are mainly voltages, 
resistance changes or currents. Table 1 shows that sensors which measure different properties can have the 
same form of electrical output (Wilson, 2008).

Wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are networks of nodes that sense and potentially also 
control their environment. They communicate the information through wireless links “enabling interaction 
between people or computers and the surrounding environment” (Verdone et al., 2008). The data gathered 
by the different nodes is sent to a sink which either uses the data locally, through for example actuators, or 
which “is connected to other networks (e.g. the Internet) through a gateway (Verdone et al., 2008). 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical WSAN1. 
Sensor nodes are the simplest devices in the network. As their number is usually larger than the 
number of actuators or sinks, they have to be cheap. The other devices are more complex because of the 
functionalities they have to provide (Verdone et al., 2008). 
A sensor node typically consists of five main parts: one or more sensors gather data from the 
environment. The central unit in the form of a microprocessor manages the tasks. A transceiver (included 
in the communication module in Figure 2) communicates with the environment and a memory is used to 
store temporary data or data generated during processing. The battery supplies all parts with energy (see 
Figure 2). To assure a sufficiently long network lifetime, energy efficiency in all parts of the network is 
crucial. Due to this need, data processing tasks are often spread over the network, i.e. nodes co-operate in 
transmitting data to the sinks (Verdone et al., 2008). Although most sensors have a traditional battery there 
is some early stage research on the production of sensors without batteries, using similar technologies to 
passive RFID chips without batteries.

There are numerous different fields of application of sensor networks. For example, forest fires can be 
detected by sensor networks so that they can be fought at an early stage. Sensor networks can be used to 
monitor the structural integrity of civil structures by localising damage for example in bridges. Further,

application discussed in more detail in this study as they have a high potential to tackle environmental 
challenges and reduce CO2 emissions. The fields of application in the lower part of the figure are briefly

Selected applications and their environmental impact 
Smart grids and energy control systems  
Introduction, definition and main components 
Coal power plants are responsible for “nearly 40% of electricity production worldwide”, and 
electricity generation is thus responsible for a significant share of CO2 emissions (Atkinson, Castro, 2008). 
To decrease emissions from the energy supply side, alternative clean technologies can be used to generate 
electricity or energy can be distributed in a more efficient way. In both cases, sensor networks contribute to 
better and more efficient processes.  
On the generation side, sensor networks enable solar energy to be generated more efficiently. 
Standalone panels “do not always capture the sun’s power in the most efficient manner” (Atkinson, Castro, 
2008). Automated panels managed by sensors track sun rays to ensure that the sun’s power is gathered in a 
more efficient manner. Such systems can also turn on and off automatically (Atkinson, Castro, 2008).

On the distribution side, energy is distributed in an often inefficient way in traditional grids. At the 
time when present girds were planned and extended, they had one single mission, namely “to keep the 
lights on” (DOE, 2008). As a consequence, these grids have several shortcomings: many systems are 
centralised and rely on important central power stations making it difficult to integrate distributed energy 
resources and microgrids (EU, 2006). They most often only support one-way power flow and 
communication from the utility to consumers. Further, utilities can barely track how energy is consumed 
across the grid (Atkinson and Castro, 2008) and, as a consequence, have no possibility to provide any 
pricing incentive to balance power consumption over time. As utilities can only accommodate increases in 
demand up to a certain level, they are forced to rely on additional peak load power plants to cope with 
unexpected demand increases (Climate Group, 2008). This is highly expensive and potentially polluting, 
particularly if plants use fossil fuels (Atkinson and Castro, 2008).  
As demand rises and additional power from distributed resources is fed into the grid, important 
changes must be made. The smart grid is an innovation that has the potential to revolutionise the 
transmission, distribution and conservation of energy. It employs digital technology to improve 
transparency and to increase reliability as well as efficiency. ICTs and especially sensors and sensor 
networks play a major role in turning traditional grids into smart grids. However, they are only one group 
of key components of the smart grid. The following section gives an extensive overview of the concept of 
the smart grid and its key components beyond a pure discussion of sensors and sensor networks as major 
benefits only arise from the interaction between these components.  
Defining the smart grid in a concise way is not an easy task as the concept is relatively new and as 
various alternative components build up a smart grid. Some authors even argue that it is “too hard” to 
define the concept (Miller, 2008). Looking at different definitions reveals that the smart grid has been 
defined in different ways by different organisations and authors. Table 2 gives an overview of selected 
definitions. It shows two different approaches to define the smart grid: it is either defined from a solution 
perspective (“What are the main advantages of the grid?”) or from a components’ perspective (“Which 
components constitute the grid?”).

Smart Grid 
A “smart grid” is a set of software and hardware tools that enable generators 
to route power more efficiently, reducing the need for excess capacity and 
allowing two-way, real time information exchange with their customers for 
real time demand side management (DSM). It improves efficiency, energy 
monitoring and data capture across the power generation and T&D network.

A smart grid would employ digital technology to optimise energy usage, 
better incorporate intermittent “green” sources of energy, and involve 
customers through smart metering.

Grid 2030 
Grid 2030 is a fully automated power delivery network that monitors and 
controls every customer and node, ensuring a two-way flow of electricity and 
information between the power plant and the appliance, and all points in 
between. 
Its 
distributed 
intelligence, 
coupled 
with 
broadband 
communications and automated control systems, enables real-time market 
transactions and seamless interfaces among people, buildings, industrial 
plants, generation facilities, and the electric networks. 
 
From a solution perspective, the smart grid is characterised by: 
 
More efficient energy routing and thus an optimised energy usage, a reduction of the need for 
excess capacity and increased power quality and security 
 
Better monitoring and control of energy and grid components  
 
Improved data capture and thus an improved outage management 
 
Two-way flow of electricity and real-time information allowing for the incorporation of green 
energy sources, demand-side management and real-time market transactions 
 
Highly automated, responsive and self-healing energy network with seamless interfaces between 
all parts of the grid. 
From a technical components’ perspective, the smart grid is a highly complex combination and 
integration of multiple digital and non-digital technologies and systems. Figure 4 provides an overview of 
the main component of a smart grid: i) new and advanced grid components, ii) smart devices and smart

metering, iii) integrated communication technologies, iv) programmes for decision support and human 
interfaces, v) advanced control systems. These individual grids do not need to be centralised, but can have 
more control stations and be more highly integrated. The integration of many grids including country-
spanning ones provides economic advantages, but there are challenges regarding security if they become 
too centralised and interconnected.

New and advanced grid components 
New and advanced grid components allow for a more efficient energy supply, better reliability and 
availability of power. Components include, for example, advanced conductors and superconductors, 
improved electric storage components, new materials, advanced power electronics as well as distributed 
energy generation. Superconductors are used in multiple devices along the grid such as cables, storage 
devices, motors and transformers (DOE, 2003). The rise of new high-temperature superconductors allows 
transmission of large amounts of power over long distances at a lower power loss rate. New kinds of 
batteries have greater storage capacity and can be employed to support voltage and transient stability 
(SAIC, 2006). Distributed energy is often generated close to the customer to be served which improves 
reliability, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time expand efficient energy delivery 
(DOE, 2008). Furthermore, most of these alternative energy generation technologies close to customers 
such as solar panels and wind power stations are renewable energy sources. These technologies, e.g. solar 
panels, small hydro-electric and small hydro-thermals can be operated by consumers, or small providers. 
Smart devices and smart metering 
Smart devices and smart metering include sensors and sensor networks. Sensors are used at multiple 
places along the grid, e.g. at transformers and substations or at customers’ homes (Shargal and Houseman, 
2009b). They play an outstanding role in the area of remote monitoring and they enable demand-side 
management and thus new business processes such as real-time pricing.  
14 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  
 
 
14 
Spread over the grid, sensors and sensor networks monitor the functioning and the health of grid 
devices, monitor temperature, provide outage detection and detect power quality disturbances. Control 
centres can thus immediately receive accurate information about the actual condition of the grid. 
Consequently, maintenance staff can maintain the grid just-in-time in the case of disruptions rather than 
rely on interval-based inspections.  
Smart meters at customers’ homes play a crucial role. They allow for real-time determination and 
information storage of energy consumption and provide “the possibility to read consumption both locally 
and remotely” (Siderius and Dijkstra, 2005). Further, they also provide the means to detect fluctuations and 
power outages, permit remote limitations on consumption by customers and permit the meters to be 
switched off. This results in important cost savings and enables utilities to prevent electricity theft.2  
Figure 5: Smart meter  
 
Source: Siemens, 2008. 
Electricity providers get a better picture of customers’ energy consumption and obtain a precise 
understanding of energy consumption at different points in time. As a consequence, utilities are able to 
establish demand-side management (DSM) and to develop new pricing mechanisms. Energy can be priced 
according to real-time costs taking peak power loads into account and price signals can be transmitted to 
home controllers or customers’ devices which may then evaluate the information and power accordingly 
(DOE, 2003). Customers thus become more interactive with suppliers and “benefit from an increased 
visibility into their energy consumption habits” (IBM, 2007). They are aware of actual power costs rather 
than only obtaining a monthly or even yearly electricity bill. To date, a number of OECD countries (Italy, 
Norway, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands) have mandated the use of smart meters.  
Integrated communication technologies 
Information provided by smart sensors and smart meters needs to be transmitted via a communication 
backbone. This backbone is characterized by a high-speed and two-way flow of information. Different 
communication applications and technologies form the communication backbone. These can be classified 
into communication services groups (EPRI, 2006). Figure 6 provides an overview of these groups as well 
as brief descriptions and examples.

 Utilities have the choice between multiple and diverse technologies in the area of communication 
network technologies. Usually, several network technologies are deployed within a smart grid. The 
following paragraphs provide an overview of different wide-area networks (WAN) and local-area networks 
(LAN). The distinction between WAN and LAN technologies is made in this context to differentiate 
between networks used to reach the customer and those at customer sites (EPRI, 2006). 
Wide-area network technologies provide a means for a two-way information flow in the smart grid. 
Multiple technologies are available which provide both broadband and narrowband solutions for the smart 
grid, resulting in a highly fragmented market. Table 3 presents the main WAN technologies as well as their 
strengths and weaknesses for their deployment in the smart grid.  
The choice of WAN technologies will depend on factors such as reliability, low-cost, security and the 
network infrastructure that is already available. It is likely that utilities will rely on several network 
technologies when they build smart grids as they have to cope with differences in geography, population 
densities as well as availability and competition of different network technologies in their services areas. 
Some of these will require broadband, some will not.

LAN technologies connect different smart devices at customers’ sites. These technologies can be 
classified into three main groups: wireless IEEE standards 802.x, wired Ethernet, as well as in-building 
power line communications (EPRI, 2006).  
Wireless IEEE standards include Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), WiMAX5 (IEEE 802.16), ZigBee (IEEE 
802.15.4) and Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1). Based on EPRI (2006), Table 4 shows how these standards can 
be employed for different applications at customers’ sites and it provides a short description of strengths 
and weaknesses of these standards.

Wired Ethernet is the prevalent LAN technology today. Customers’ sites can be connected via 
Ethernet with WAN or other networks. Due to its wide use, it has important market support, multiple 
different products are available and costs are relatively low (EPRI, 2006). However, it is a local area 
network technology only. 
In-building power line communications: The two most common technologies in this area are Home 
Plug and X10 (EPRI, 2006). Home Plug is a broadband over power line (BPL) system that provides a bit 
rate of approximately 14 Mbps (The Power Alliance, 2009b). It is suited for applications requiring Quality 
of Service (QoS) with four different levels of priority. Further, encryption mechanisms are available. It can 
be deployed to connect equipment at customers’ site. Newer versions also support advanced portal 
applications such as entertainment delivery (EPRI, 2006). Strengths of the Home Plug network include 
connectivity to home wiring and QoS features (EPRI, 2006). The main shortcoming is the lack of standards 
both at the national and international level. Currently, the Home Plug Alliance that promotes Home Plug 
works together with the ZigBee Alliance and EPRI define a Smart Energy Standard for consumer 
applications (The Home Plug Alliance, 2009a). 
X10 “is the earliest, and probably the most popular, power-line carrier system for home automation” 
and a “convenient mechanism for a portal to control load equipment (e.g. thermostats, pool pumps)” 
(EPRI, 2006). Strengths include the common use implying that multiple equipments are compatible with 
X10 and low implementation costs if devices already use power lines (EPRI, 2006). However, it cannot be 
used as a general purpose LAN. Further, it is a de facto standard only and there is no open access to the 
protocol (EPRI, 2006).  
Overall, defining a smart grid’s communication backbone at the early stage including different 
network technologies is paramount for the interoperability of different devices. If not done properly at an 
early stage, sub-projects “may have to be retrofitted later to accommodate the eventual communication 
18 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  
 
 
18 
standards, adding greatly to time and expense” (Shargal and Houseman, 2009a). At this stage of 
development, a compilation of information regarding the success or failure of electricity service providers 
in their choices for the communication backbone to their smart grid will be invaluable. This will, for 
example, help telecommunications regulators to work out what kind of investment in national broadband 
infrastructures will help to achieve the aims of building smart infrastructures.6  
Programmes for decision support and human interfaces 
Another key component area of the smart grids comprises programmes for decision support and 
human interfaces. The data volume in smart grids will increase tremendously compared to traditional grids. 
As Houseman and Shargal (2009) suggest, “a utility with five million customers […] will have more data 
from their distribution grid than Wal-Mart gets from all of its stores, and Wal-Mart manages the world’s 
largest data warehouse”. One of the main challenges of utilities is thus on the one hand the integration and 
management of the generated data and on the other hand making the data available to grid operators and 
managers in a user-friendly manner to support their decisions.  
Tools and applications include systems based on artificial intelligence and semi-autonomous agent 
software, visualisation technologies, alerting tools, advanced control and performance review applications 
(SAIC, 2006) as well as data and simulation applications and geospatial information systems (GIS). 
Artificial intelligence methods as well as semi-autonomous agent software, for example, contribute to 
minimise data volume “and to create a format most effective for user comprehension” whereby the 
software has features that learn from input and adapts (SAIC, 2006). New methods of visualisation enable 
integration of data from different sources, providing information on the status of the grid and power quality 
and rapid information on instabilities and outages. Finally, geographic information systems provide 
geographic, spatial and location information and tailor this information to the specific requirements for 
decision support systems along the smart grid. 
Advanced control systems 
Advanced control systems constitute the last group of the smart grids’ key components. They monitor 
and control essential elements of the smart grid. Computer-based algorithms allow efficient data collection 
and analysis, provide solutions to human operators and are also able to act autonomously (SAIC, 2006). 
For example, new substation automation systems have been developed that provide local information and 
that can also be monitored remotely. Whereas the substation information is only available locally in 
traditional smart grids, new developed subsystems are capable of making this information available in the 
whole grid and thus provide better power management. Faults can be detected much faster than in 
traditional grids and outage times can be reduced.  
The environmental impact of smart grids 
Studies which aim at quantifying the environmental impacts of smart grids typically only quantify 
positive impacts. Currently there is a lack of data which quantifies the negative footprint of ICT 
infrastructure involved in smart grids. In the following section three studies that examine the CO2e (CO2 
equivalent)7 abatement potential of smart grids are discussed (see Table 5).

The GeSI study (2008) evaluates the opportunity of smart grids by both presenting a case study for 
India and by quantifying global positive impacts. According to the study, power losses in India accounted 
for 32% of total power production in 2007. Currently, utilities are not able to detect where the losses occur 
in the traditional grids. ICT platforms with remote control systems, energy accounting and smart meters 
could have tremendous effects as they would allow utilities to track the sources of losses. Further, India 
mainly relies on coal-based energy supply to meet increasing demand. Decentralised energy generated by 
renewable energy sources could be integrated in a smart grid. Smart grids would thus help to address two 
major needs of Indian energy providers: stemming losses and reducing carbon intensity.  
For the quantification of the positive impact, the study assesses four levers that have the potential to 
reduce CO2e emissions: i) reduced transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, ii) integration of renewable 
energy sources, iii) reduced consumption through user information, and iv) demand side management 
(DSM). The study identifies total emission savings of 2.03 GtCO2e in 2020 in a “Business as Usual” 
(BAU)8 scenario. Figure 7 shows the contribution of each lever as well as the assumptions behind the 
calculations. Assumptions are based on expert interviews. It should be noted that the GeSI estimates of the 
overall CO2e emissions for the year 2020 are based on the global CO2e emission data published by the 
IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)9 which are higher than IEA estimates, for example.  
Whereas the GeSI Smart Grid study assesses the positive environmental impact on a global level in 
2020, EPRI (2008) focuses on the positive environmental impacts on a national level in the United States 
for the year 2030. Another difference is the extended view on levers leading to a positive impact: overall, 
the study evaluates seven levers: i) continuous commissioning for commercial buildings, ii) reduced line 
losses, iii) enhanced demand response and (peak) load control, iv) direct feedback on energy usage, v) 
enhanced measurement and verification capabilities, vi) facilitation of integration of renewable resources, 
and vii) facilitation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) market penetration. PHEV are “hybrid 
electric vehicles that can be plugged into electrical outlets for recharging” (EPRI, 2008). As PHEV allow 
for CO2 emission savings,10 the study attributes 10-20% of these savings to the smart grid as the smart 
grids allow charging of vehicles over night. However, R&D on PHEV is still at an early stage. As the study 
evaluates CO2e emission savings for a longer time horizon than the GeSI study, the inclusion of PHEV can 
be regarded as useful. However, the percentage of emission savings from PHEV attributed to smart grids 
seems potentially overstated.

For each level, the study develops different market penetration ranges and thus obtains evaluations for 
low and high market penetration. Overall, the EPRI study estimates CO2e energy saving ranging from 60-
211 million metric tons. Figure 8 provides a detailed overview of CO2e savings which arise from the seven 
levers.

Overall, the impact range is between the low-end value of 60 million tons and the high-end value of 
211 million tons. CO2e emission savings vary considerably. This is due to different shares of market 
penetration. Furthermore, estimations are partially based on simple assumptions as well as on data from 
single cases.  
The third study discussed in this section assesses both positive and negative impacts of ICTs on 
environmental sustainability (IPTS, 2004). As opposed to the above studies, it studies one important lever: 
the contribution of renewable energy sources to a reduction of CO2 emissions and especially the impact of 
ICTs on the share of renewable energy sources. ICTs facilitate the integration of energy which was 
generated by renewable energy sources. According to the authors, the use of ICTs in the smart grid 
increases the total share of renewable energy sources in the range of 2-7% in 2020. The range is due to best 
and worst-case values for three different scenarios as shown in Table 6. A total reduction in GHG 
emissions (measured in CO2e) due to the use of ICTs in energy supply ranges from 1.5% in the worst case 
and 3.1% in the best case.

As a consequence, the electricity mix changes which directly affects overall CO2e emissions. The 
authors also argue that ICTs enhance combined heat and power generation which further leads to a 
decreased use of fossil fuel. According to the study, the impact of smart grid ICTs will be 1.5-3.1% of total 
CO2e reductions in 2020. Rebound effects which arise from a higher efficiency in energy supply are 
included in the IPTS study, which is not the case for the GeSI and EPRI studies. In terms of scenario 
building, validation measures and the integration of positive and negative effects, the IPTS study is the 
most sophisticated presented in this section. It is also the only study which integrates rebound effects.  
Comparing actual CO2e emission values is a difficult task as the conception of these studies differs 
significantly. They assess different smart grid levels on different continents for differing time horizons. 
Overall, all studies emphasise that fully and properly deployed smart grids could have an important and 
strong potential to reduce future CO2e emissions. The GeSI study, for example, which assesses the 
environmental impacts of several smart (sensor) applications, attributes the highest potential to smart grids 
to reduce CO2e emissions.  
However, it may be also necessary to investigate the potential negative environmental impact 
associated with the deployment of smart grids, for example, the amounts of additional hardware needed to 
support and improve the electric transmission grid. These new activities may also require new rights of 
way and distribution systems with possible negative impacts on wildlife and ecosystems. 
Because of the potential positive impacts of smart grids, many OECD countries have emphasised the 
transformation of actual grids into smart grids. For example, the provisions of the U.S. stimulus bill signed 
in February 2009 include USD 11 billion for “smart grid” investments. Furthermore, some OECD 
countries (Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands) have already issued mandates for smart 
metering, and the EU Communication on ICTs and the environment (13 March 2009) emphasises the role 
of smart metering.

One of the main questions for successful implementation of smart grids will be whether energy 
suppliers can agree on working together to adopt industry-wide solutions and developing and adopting 
open standards (Adam, Wintersteller, 2008). 
Smart buildings 
Introduction, definition and main components 
Smart buildings are a field closely linked to smart grids. Smart buildings rely on a set of technologies 
that enhance energy-efficiency and user comfort as well as the monitoring and safety of the buildings. 
Technologies include new, efficient building materials as well as information and communication 
technologies (ICTs). An example of newly integrated materials is a second façade for glass sky scrapers. 
The headquarters of the New York Times Company has advanced ICT applications as well as a ceramic 
sunscreen consisting of ceramic tubes which reflect daylight and thus prevent the skyscraper from 
collecting heat (see Box 1).  
 ICTs are used in: i) building management systems which monitor heating, lighting and ventilation, ii) 
software packages which automatically switch off devices such as computers and monitors when offices 
are empty (SMART, 2020) and iii) security and access systems. These ICT systems can be both found at 
household and office level. Furthermore, according to Sharpels et al., (1999), first-, second- and third-
generation smart building systems can be distinguished.11 First-generation smart buildings are composed of 
many stand-alone self-regulating devices which operate independently from each other. Examples include 
security and HVAC systems. In second-generation smart buildings, systems are connected via specialised 
networks which allow them to be controlled remotely and “to facilitate some central scheduling or 
sequencing” (Sharpels et al., 1999), e.g. switching off systems when rooms and offices are not occupied. 
Third-generation smart building systems are capable of learning from the building and adapting their 
monitoring and controlling functions. This last generation is at an early stage. 
Sensors and sensor networks are used in multiple smart building applications. These include:  
 
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) 
 
Lightning  
 
Shading 
 
Air quality and window control 
 
Systems switching off devices 
 
Metering (covered in the section on smart grids) 
 
Standard household applications (e.g. televisions, washing machines) 
 
Security and safety (access control).

Box 1: The New York Times Building - a Smart Building 
The headquarters of the New York Times is an example of how different smart building technologies can be 
combined to reduce energy consumption and to increase user comfort. Overall, the building consumes 30% less 
energy than traditional office skyscrapers.  
Opened in November 2007 and designed by Renzo 
Piano, the building has a curtain wall which serves as a 
sunscreen and changes colour during the day. This wall 
consists of ceramic rods, “a supporting structure for the 
screen and an insulated window unit” (Hart, 2008).  
The building is further equipped with lighting and 
shading control systems based on ICT technologies. The 
lighting system ensures that electrical light is only used when 
required. Further daylighting measures include a garden in the 
centre of the ground floor which is open to the sky as well as a 
large area skylight. The electrical ballasts in the lighting system are equipped with chips that allow each ballast to be 
controlled separately. The shading system tracks the position of the sun and relies on a sensor network to 
automatically actuate the raising and lowering of the shades. Experience had shown that if it were up to employees 
sitting next to the windows to control the shades, “the shades would likely be down most of the time since occupants” 
were “often too busy to manage the shades” (LBNL, 2009).  
The high-tech HVAC system is equipped with sensors that measure the temperature. It is further able to rely on 
free air cooling, i.e. fresh air on cool mornings is brought into the HVAC system. An automated building system 
monitors in parallel “the air conditioning, water cooling, heating, fire alarm, and generation systems” (Siemens, 2008). 
The system relies on a large-scale sensor network composed of different kinds of sensors which deliver real-time 
information. Consequently, energy can be saved as only as few systems are turned on as needed.  
Sources: Hart (2008), Siemens (2008), The New York Times Building (2009), LBNL (2009). 
Sensors embedded in HVAC systems, for example, monitor the temperature and the status of parts of 
the buildings such as open or closed windows. In the field of air quality, new gas sensors, micro electrical-
mechanical systems (MEMS), measure the content of CO2 in rooms. These relatively new types of sensors 
are made of “silicon chips and an oxidizing layer” (Siemens, 2008c). Overall, different types of sensors for 
smart buildings include: 
 
Temperature sensors and heat detectors 
 
Light level detectors 
 
Movement and occupancy sensors  
 
Smoke and gas detectors 
 
Status sensors (e.g. air quality, open windows) 
 
Glass break sensors

According to Siemens (2008c), sensors and sensor networks in smart building systems significantly 
contribute to energy reduction. They estimate the energy savings due to more precise climate, air quality 
and occupancy sensors at 30% compared to buildings with traditional automation technology. The 
following section provide an overview of different impact studies focusing on total smart building and 
facility management systems and their energy consumption and emissions. 
The environmental impact of smart buildings 
Only a few studies on the environmental impact of smart buildings cover more than single 
applications and more than one country. In the following studies, GeSI (2008) focuses on positive impacts, 
whereas the IPTS study (2004) covers both positive and negative impacts (see Table 5). 
According to GeSI estimations (2008), buildings will emit 11.7 GtCO2e worldwide in 2020 which 
equals 22.5% of total emissions. This includes private households, public buildings and offices. The study 
identifies an ICT-enabled abatement potential of 1.68 GtCO2e in a BAU scenario. This abatement potential 
results both from levers that can be attributed to sensors and sensor networks and further levers. Figure 9 
provides an overview of impacts. Levers which include a positive impact of sensors and sensor technology 
are highlighted in blue solid shading. These levers account for 59.5% of total CO2e savings. Most 
important impact levers include savings due to efficient building management systems and savings 
resulting from voltage optimisation as well as HVAC systems. Other impacts which cannot directly be 
attributed to sensors have diagonal lines.

Table 8 provides an overview of underlying assumptions based on expert interviews. Overall, 
important savings can be obtained by intelligent commissioning of buildings, i.e. “ensuring the building’s 
systems are used as specified” (GeSI, 2008). It thus not only depends on the ICT technology and its 
sophistication but also on a proper use of these systems. As for the smart grid calculations, the GeSI 
estimates for the year 2020 are mainly based on the global CO2e emission data by the IPCC.

The IPTS study (2004) covers the environmental impact of smart buildings in the field of facility 
management where ICT contributes to energy savings. Facility management “targets space heating, water 
heating, cooling, lighting, cooking and electrical appliances” (IPTS, 2004).  
Results of the IPTS study are illustrated in Table 9. With the projected development of ICT, 
reductions in energy consumption range from 3.5% in the worst case to 7.1% in the best case in 2020. 
Consequently, ICT in facility management contributes to CO2e emissions savings ranging from 3.5% in the 
worst case to 6.5% in the best case. Overall, an important reduction of energy consumption as well as CO2e 
emissions is observed in all scenarios with scenario B having the highest energy and emission savings.

Both studies emphasise the pivotal role of governments in attaining significant reductions in both 
energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. They recommend different measures to promote the 
use of ICTs in smart buildings. These measures include demonstration projects with best practice 
examples, minimum standards of energy efficiency for existing and new buildings, economic incentives, 
investments in R&D as well as providing a setting where governments and other stakeholders exchange 
results on different energy-efficiency measures.  
To date, several programmes have already been set up to promote increased energy efficiency in 
buildings such as CASBEE (Japan) or LEED in the United States. Furthermore, the IEA aims at 
constructing “the world’s leading database on efficiency codes and standards for buildings” for comparison 
purposes (IEA G8 Gleneagles programme, 2008). 
Transport and logistics 
Introduction and overview of applications 
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) and sensor networks in particular have the 
potential to contribute to increased efficiency in both freight and passenger transport as well as a potential 
reduction of overall transportation. On the one hand, increased use of ICTs can avoid freight and passenger 
transport through a higher degree of virtualisation, digitisation and teleworking. Digital content is delivered 
electronically and virtual conferences and teleworking reduce passenger transport. On the other hand, 
increased use of ICTs can contribute to better management of transport routes and traffic, higher safety, 
time and cost savings as well as reductions of CO2 emissions.  
Sensors and sensor networks play a vital role in the increase of transport efficiency. For example, 
sensor technology contributes to better tracking of goods and vehicles which might result in lower level of 
inventories and thus energy savings from less inventory infrastructure as well as a reduced need for 
30 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  
 
 
30 
transportation (Atkinson, Castro, 2008). Furthermore, sensors and sensor networks are pivotal parts of 
many intelligent transportation systems (ITS).  
An intelligent transportation system (ITS) can be defined as “the application of advanced and 
emerging technologies (computers, sensors, control, communications, and electronic devices) in 
transportation to save lives, time, money, energy and the environment” (ITS Canada, 2009). The ITS can 
be categorised into intelligent infrastructure and intelligent vehicles (RITA, 2009). Figure 10 gives an 
overview of different ITS applications for both intelligent infrastructure and intelligent vehicles as well as 
some examples for each application.  
Many of these applications are based on sensors and sensor networks. In the field of intelligent 
infrastructure sensors in pavements are used for road traffic monitoring systems to measure the intensity 
and fluidity of traffic (vehicle count sensors) and to provide information for traffic lights which are then 
controlled. These sensors are further able to detect whether, for example, public buses are approaching so 
that the green phase of traffic lights can be extended, allowing buses to keep their schedules (Veloso, 
Bento, Câmara Pereira, 2009). They also transmit information to update public transport panels. New 
sensor applications include intermittent bus lanes (see Box 3). In addition, sensors are used for motorway 
tolling purposes where they detect vehicle RFID tags and retrieve the required information (Veloso, Bento, 
Câmara Pereira, 2009). Sensors also monitor the state of physical infrastructures such as bridges by 
detecting “vibrations and displacements” (Veloso, Bento, Câmara Pereira, 2009).

Intelligent vehicles are equipped with sensors for multiple purposes. Examples for different kinds of 
vehicles include: i) Trains in metros, especially driverless systems, use sensors to control the velocity and 
location of trains as well as stops at metro stations (Veloso, Bento, Câmara Pereira, 2009). ii) Buses rely on 
 
SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH – 31 
 
31 
door sensors to detect whether doors are open to better locate them. Further applications include 
environmental sensors on buses and tramways that detect weather conditions, analyse traffic conditions 
and give alerts via on-board mini-computers (MORYNE FP6 Project, 2008); for applications in cars iii), 
current research projects focus on vehicle-to-vehicle communication based on data gathered by sensors 
(see for example EU projects such as Coopers and PReVent). These (environmental) sensors collect 
information, for instance, on the location of the car, the speed and road and weather conditions. As cars 
pass each other, they are able to exchange the summarised information. Based on a detailed description of 
the environment, cars obtain traffic information and drivers are able to plan their routes more efficiently. In 
addition, trajectories of vehicles can be predicted resulting in a sophisticated risk assessment and thus 
increased traffic safety as drivers can be warned of dangerous driving conditions. A further example of car 
sensors is a tyre pressure monitoring system which delivers real time tyre pressure information to the 
driver (Intelligent Car Initiative, 2008). Besides improving safety, the system helps to “reduce the amount 
of emissions released into the atmosphere” (Intelligent Car Initiative, 2008). 
 
Box 3: Intermittent bus lanes 
To allow a better flow and speed of public transport, many cities rely on special lanes for buses, taxis and 
emergency vehicles. However, this system can be further optimised as, at times, the lane is empty and could 
instead be used for general traffic, especially in heavy traffic situations. The idea of the optimised solution is to 
normally open the bus lane for general traffic and to reserve it only when public transport is approaching and when 
the general traffic is slower than the normal speed of public transport.  
Researchers in Portugal have developed a wireless sensor network system which has been tested in Lisbon. 
Installed lights in the tarmac separate the bus lane from other lanes and are only turned on when a bus is 
approaching. The presence of public transport in the bus lane is detected by sensors in the ground and can be 
supported by additional information such as data from public transport fleet management systems. This information 
is processed by a control station installed near traffic lights. In recent systems, the in-pavement components are 
wirelessly connected to each other and to the control station to reduce installation costs. Each module is battery 
powered and the batteries are charged by pavement-embedded solar panels (see Silva Girão et al. (2006)). 
Communication is assured via RF transmitters and receivers. Overall, the results of trials in Lisbon are encouraging 
as the bus speed could be increased and the negative impact on the general traffic flow was low. The researchers 
have recently also worked on upgrades of the system such as the detection of intrusion of private transport in the 
bus lane when the lane is reserved for public transport, and the incorporation of cameras for law enforcement.  
Sources: Viegas, Lu, 2005, Silva Girão et al., 2006. 
Overall, ITS systems make public and private transport more efficient, and potentially cheaper which 
may increase transport volumes (rebound effect) and the environmental impact might thus be negative. 
Results of studies analysing the environmental impact of smart transportation are mixed due to this effect, 
in contrast to other fields of application. The following paragraphs discuss different results from the GeSI 
(2008) and IPTS study (2004) as well as their underlying assumptions. As for smart buildings, the GeSI 
study (2008) concentrates on the positive impacts whereas the IPTS study (2004) covers positive and 
negative effects, including rebound effects (see Table 5 for a description of the studies).12 
The environmental impact of smart transportation 
The GeSI study (2008) estimates an abatement potential of 1.52 GtCO2e worldwide in the field of 
smart transport (see Figure 11). As for the field of smart buildings, levers that can be attributed to sensors 
and sensor networks and further levers constitute the overall abatement potential. Levers that can include a 
positive impact of sensors and sensor networks are marked in blue solid shading in Figure 11, other levers 
have diagonal lines. According to GeSi (2008), the most important levers include the optimisation of 
logistic networks and optimised collection and delivery planning.

Table 10 provides an overview of the underlying assumptions for the calculation of the abatement 
potential of 1.52 GtCO2e. Some assumptions can be regarded as ambitious as they assume reductions of 
over 20%. Furthermore, the study does not cover rebound effects.

The IPTS study (2004) assesses the impact of ITS on passenger and freight transport.13 In contrast to 
the GeSI study, the authors find a significant increase of both passenger and freight transport volume 
across all scenarios with a low data uncertainty and a negative impact of ICTs in the field of ITS. This 
results in an increase of CO2e emissions due to the use of ICT in transportation across all scenarios and 
best and worst case situations. Table 11 illustrates the results of the study. With the projected development 
of ICTs compared to a situation without this projected development, an increase in CO2e emissions ranges 
from 1.9% in the best case and 2.7% in the worst case scenario.

ITS render transport faster, more efficient and flexible and, as a consequence, cheaper, “leading to a 
full rebound effect” (IPTS 2004). The demand for transportation increases and creates more transport 
leading to higher consumption of energy and to growing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the 
authors “higher transport efficiency is the key ICT effect increasing freight transport in 2020. This increase 
is in the range of 12% to 28%” (IPTS, 2004) for freight transport and of 5-7% for passenger transport. 
Although the increasing impact of ITS with the projected development of ICTs is significantly higher for 
scenario B, the absolute freight transport volume is the lowest one in this scenario as environmental costs 
are already internalised (see the fourth IPTS interim report (Hilty et al., 2004)). 
In the field of passenger transport, the increased time efficiency of passenger transport implies that a 
higher passenger transport volume can be attained in the same time which raises traffic performance. 
However, “ICT can slow the growth of private car passenger transport, avoiding 10-19% of future car 
traffic, despite the fact that it stimulates the growth of total passenger transport” (IPTS, 2004) due to better 
time utilisation. This time utilisation effect is supposed to increase the use of public transport in the modal 
split as ICTs can contribute to a more effective use of travel time to work. The attractiveness of public 
transport can thus be increased and promote a shift from private cars to public transport. However, this 
effect also “relaxes the time budget and therefore enables more traffic” (IPTS, 2004).  
In the field of freight transport, the full rebound effect which results from cheaper transport shows that 
freight transport is “highly sensitive to fuel prices”. Raising fuel prices and thus internalising 
environmental costs could thus reduce demand significantly.  
Overall, this overview of the GeSI and the IPTS studies shows mixed results of the impact of 
intelligent transport systems due to rebound effects. These effects also highlight that governments can have 
a crucial role in the field of smart transportation. As the IPTS study shows, increased efficiency of 
transportation should be paralleled with demand-side management. Internalisation of environmental effects

by raising energy and fuel prices or the inclusion of transportation in emission trading could reduce 
demand for transport and thus reduce CO2e emissions (IPTS, 2004). Furthermore, governments can make 
use of ITS in public transport to render it more attractive and promote a modal shift from private cars to 
public transport. Measures not only include promoting a better working environment during travel through 
ICTs but also better services such as real-time time-table information and optimised route planning.  
Industrial applications  
Introduction and application examples 
The industry sector is an important emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. According to GeSi (2008), it 
was responsible for 23% of total emissions in 2002 and used nearly half of all global electricity. Sensors 
and especially sensor networks are used in multiple ways in industrial applications. They enable real-time 
data sharing on industrial processes, on the “health state” of equipment and the control of operating 
resources to increase industrial efficiency, productivity and reduce energy usage and emissions.  
As the variety of different sensor applications is immense across industry sectors,16 this section 
describes three examples of industrial fields of application of sensors for: i) process control, ii) control of 
(physical) properties during the production process, and iii) equipment management and control.  
In the field of process control, sensor and sensor networks deliver real-time data on the production 
process and are able to detect in situ variations in the process. Control can thus be moved from the finished 
product after the completed production run to the production process itself (DOE, 2007). Faults can be 
minimised reducing the percentage of deficient and reprocessed goods. Furthermore, a continuous 
monitoring of processes allows for efficient use of energy during production processes. An application 
example in the field of process control is an on line laser-ultrasonic thickness gauge which measures the 
thickness of steel tube walls under harsh conditions in mills. During production, it ensures that “tube walls 
are uniform and reduces the need to remove excess material from the walls of the tubes”. As a 
consequence, product consistency can be improved and material saved while “reducing the time and 
energy used during production” (DOE, 2004).  
In the field of the control of physical properties during production processes, sensors and sensor 
networks measure different properties as well as the amount of available resources during production. This 
allows them to be employed in an efficient and thus precise manner resulting in energy savings and the 
reduction of pollutants. Examples are sensors measuring the temperature and composition of combustion 
gases and sensors measuring the concentration of hydrogen gas (DOE, 2007).  
In the third field, equipment management and control, sensors monitor the “health of machines” as 
well as their usage. Sensors installed on different machines measure physical properties such as 
temperature, pressure, humidity or vibrations (Verdone, 2008). The sensor nodes are able to communicate 
between each other and send data to the network where the data is processed. When critical values are 
achieved, the system immediately sends signals making predictive maintenance possible. This intelligent 
maintenance monitors the functionality of parts and ensures that they are replaced based on a degradation 
assessment rather than on replacement rules. Besides health monitoring, sensors also control motors during 
usage. Motors running at full capacity regardless of load can be inefficient and waste energy (GeSi, 2008). 
Sensors allow the motor to adjust the power usage according to the required output. Wireless networks that 
link different sensors make machine-to-machine communication possible and have the potential to increase 
energy efficiency in whole factories (GeSi, 2008).  
As the examples have shown, many specific and niche sensor applications are used in factories. 
Consequently, interoperability of different systems becomes a crucial issue to connect different sensor 
36 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  
 
 
36 
systems and to maximise efficiency and energy savings. Some standards have already been launched such 
as the interface IEEE 1451 group of standards which aims at enabling plug-and-play of different sensors 
and sensor networks (Chong, Kumar, 2003).  
An example of the environmental impact of smart industrial applications  
There is so far little information on the overall environmental impact of sensors and sensor networks 
across different fields of industrial applications. GeSi (2008) assessed the impact of one major industrial 
field of application: smart motor systems. The study focuses on positive impacts (for a description of the 
study, see Table 5). In the following, the results of this analysis are discussed to give an example of the 
environmental impact of smart industrial applications.  
According to GeSi (2008) motor systems account for 65% of total energy use by industry. Smart 
motors which adjust power consumption to outputs can have an important role in reducing this demand. 
The authors of the study estimate a worldwide abatement potential of 970 MtCO2e in a BAU scenario (see 
Figure 12). This is, on the one hand, due to an optimisation of motors’ speed (abatement potential of 680 
MtCO2e) and, on the other hand, to ICT-driven automation (abatement potential of 290 MtCO2e).

Table 12 summarises the key underlying assumptions for the calculation of the abatement potential. 
Overall, the authors assume a penetration rate of motor system optimisation technology of 60% which is 
relatively high compared to the assumed penetration rate of process optimisation technology of 33%.

Note: taken from GeSI 2008 
The discussed example highlights that sensor technology has an important impact on energy and 
greenhouse gas emission savings for industrial automation and control. These savings can be especially 
high when different sensors and sensor networks communicate with each other. Besides the use of sensor 
technology, sound process planning, for example with process optimisation tools, also play an important 
role. Various initiatives have been created such as Motor Decision Matters,17 and Work Energy Smart18 
which not only focus on technology but also on process planning and improvement.  
Precision agriculture and animal tracking 
Sensors and sensor networks are important components of precision agriculture which aims at 
“maximum production efficiency with minimum environmental impact” (Taylor and Whelan, 2005). Land 
over-exploitation, one of the major concerns of intensive agriculture, leads to problems such as soil 
compaction, erosion, salinity and declining water quality (Wark et al., 2007). Sensors and sensor networks 
play a critical role in measuring and monitoring the health of the soil and water quality at various stages, 
from pre- to post-production. In the field of animal tracking, the movement of herds, the health of animals 
and the state of the pasture can be controlled via sensor networks. So far a number of sensor network 
systems have been developed and trials and field experiments are under way. However, concrete 
applications are at an early stage. This section briefly describes applications of sensor networks in 
precision agriculture and animal production. Subsequently, environmental impacts are presented 
qualitatively rather than quantitatively due to the early application stage. 
In precision agriculture, sensor networks can be used for: i) plant/crop monitoring, ii) soil monitoring, 
iii) climate monitoring and iv) insect-disease-weed monitoring.  
In the field of plant/crop monitoring, wireless sensors have been developed to gather, for example, 
data on leaf temperature, chlorophyll content and plant water status. Based on these data, farmers are able 
to detect problems at an early stage and implement real-time solutions. The health and moisture of soil is a 
basic prerequisite for efficient plant and crop cultivation. Sensors contribute to real-time monitoring of 
variables such as soil fertility, soil water availability and soil compaction. Further, sensor nodes which 
communicate with radio or mobile network weather stations provide climate and micro-climate data. 
Sensors registering the temperature and relative humidity can contribute to detect conditions under which 
disease infestation is likely to occur (see Box 2). 
 
38 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  
 
 
38 
 
 
Box 2: Monitoring micro-climates in a crop field 
The LOFAR (Low Frequency Array) Agro Project has measured the micro-climate in a potato field to provide 
information on how a fungal disease, phytophtora, can be combated. Its development highly depends on the 
climatological conditions within the field.  
150 sensor nodes have been deployed in the field for the experiment. These nodes are equipped with sensors which 
measure both temperature and relative humidity (see Figure). Additional sensors are deployed in the soil to monitor 
soil humidity. A weather station “registering the luminosity, air pressure, precipitation, wind strength and direction” 
(Baggio, 2005) complements the setting.  
 
Sensor nodes send the gathered data via a wireless connection every 10 minutes to field gateways which send it to an 
ordinary PC for data logging (the Lofar gateway in the figure). The data is further transmitted to other servers for data 
analysis via a wired Internet connection. A decision support system maps the temperature distribution together with 
other information. Based on this information, farmers can take different actions and vary the amount of fertilizer and 
pesticide used.  
Source: Baggio (2005). Note that most such projects have not yet been scaled-up. 
The health of pastures can also be evaluated through high-resolution remote sensing tools. Healthy 
pastures usually “have a consistent cover of evenly dispersed perennial vegetation” (Ludwig et al., 2008). 
Remotely sensed satellite maps depict the location of persistent vegetation cover. Based on this 
information and information on the three dimensional shape of the landscape, Australian scientists 
calculate leakiness values and their changes over time. As a result, conditions of pastures can be measured 
and problematic areas detected (Ludwig et al., 2008). 
Wireless sensors are further used for precision irrigation, and systems developed for remotely 
controlled, automatic irrigation. Sensors assume, for example, the tasks of irrigation control and irrigation 
scheduling using sensed data together with additional information, e.g. weather data (Evans and Bergman, 
2003). Finally, sensors are used to assist in precision fertilisation. Based on sensor data, decision support 
systems calculate the “optimal quantity and spread pattern for a fertilizer” (Wang et al., 2006).  
Wireless sensor networks also contribute to a better understanding of the behaviour of cattle, such as 
their grazing habits, herd behaviour and the interaction with the surrounding environment (Wark et al., 
2007). The information provided by these sensors helps famers to understand the state of the pasture and to 
find optimal ways to use these resources. To test sensor applications for cattle management, Wark et al,. 
(2007) attached sensor nodes to cattle collars. Sensors communicated in a peer-to-peer fashion. Cattle 
 
SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH – 39 
 
39 
collars pinged each other “with each ping containing an animal’s GPS position and time of each ping 
transmission” (Wark et al., 2007). Based on the positioning data of each node and inertial information, the 
cattle’s individual and herd behaviour could be modelled and more general models could be developed. As 
a result, farmers are able to optimally manage environmental resources and plan grazing areas to prevent 
environmental problems such as overgrazing and land erosion. Current work focuses on the integration of 
sensor networks and radio frequency technology (RFID) as a significant number of cattle are equipped 
with RFID tags to record their ID as well as information such as cattle characteristics and food 
information.  
The environmental impact of precision agriculture and animal tracking 
Through the monitoring of the soil, climate and plants, a precise irrigation rate can be determined 
which may lead to a reduced consumption of water. Usually, fields are irrigated with uniform amounts of 
water. However, the variability in a field requires different amounts for different areas due to the 
combination of different crops and soil types (USDA, 2007). Various projects have been conducted to 
measure the extent of water savings. Damas et al., (2001), for example, tested an automated irrigation 
system for a 1500 ha area in Spain, with water savings of 30-60%. According to the USDA, another study 
found water savings of 5.7 million gallons on 279 acres in 2002 (USDA, 2007). One study by King et al. 
(2006) showed no significant water savings for a variable rate irrigation system. However, the spatial 
variability in available water holding capacity (AWHC) of the soil was considered the main determinant 
influencing crop yield and the basis for a site-specific irrigation management (SSIM) system. The authors 
acknowledge that the “results from this study and others collectively suggest that AWHC may not be the 
best or only parameter to consider in delineating irrigation management zones. A systems approach to 
SSIM will likely be required that takes into account all known factors affecting yield [...]” (King et al., 
2006). Overall, the majority of studies showed a reduced consumption of water, but that deployment 
should be based on a thorough analysis of the area being irrigated and a comprehensive consideration of 
different factors which affect site-specific irrigation. Sensors and sensor networks can significantly 
contribute to this analysis by providing the required data.  
Further important benefits of precision agriculture are reductions of fertilisers and pesticides. Both 
fertiliser and pesticide applications affect surface and groundwater quality, the quality of crops, soil 
properties and non-target species. Through monitoring the soil, the micro-climate and crops, it is possible 
to apply only the fertilisers and the pesticides crops need. Rates can be varied in real-time within fields 
based on different field and plant properties. Additionally, applications can be more precisely controlled in 
environmentally sensitive areas (USDA, 2007). Finally, a more targeted application of pesticides can 
reduce problems of pesticides resistances.  
In the field of animal tracking, farmers are able to manage grazing areas based on information on herd 
behaviour. As a consequence, overgrazing of pastures as well as land erosion can be avoided. Limited 
pasture resources can thus be effectively managed. 
Overall, sensors and sensor networks significantly contribute to a more sustainable use of natural 
resources. However, development of sensors and sensor networks for precision agriculture is in an early 
stage and sensor applications tend to be expensive. To date, farmers only take economic benefits into 
consideration when deciding on whether they should rely on precision agriculture (USDA, 2007). 
Governments can help farmers to recognise the environmental dimension by pointing out the economic 
benefits of improved soil and pasture quality as well as reduced applications of fertilisers and pesticides. 
Further, precision agriculture can be encouraged through technical assistance and conservation 
programmes.

Conclusion  
This report gives an overview of sensor and sensor networks applications and their impact on the 
environment. It discusses selected fields of application which have a high potential to tackle environmental 
challenges and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
A review of different studies assessing the environmental impact of ICTs and especially sensor and 
sensor networks reveals that these technologies can contribute significantly to more efficient use of 
resources and an important reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Government policies and initiatives are 
crucial in fostering the positive environmental effects of the use of sensors and sensor networks in different 
fields and are an essential part of strategies to radically improve environmental performance (see also 
DSTI/ICCP/IE(2008)3/FINAL). However, rebound effects have to be taken into account, and increased 
efficiency due to the use of sensor technology should be paralleled with demand-side management which 
internalises environmental costs, for example by raising CO2 –intensive energy and fuel prices. In the field 
of smart buildings, minimum standards of energy efficiency can be a major factor in reducing electricity 
use and greenhouse gas emissions.  
In general many applications in promising fields are still at an early stage of development. Joint R&D 
programmes and implementation projects can promote the use of sensor technology and contribute to 
industry-wide solutions and the development of open standards. Finally, the use of ICTs and especially 
sensor technology is sometimes relatively expensive, for example in the agriculture and farming sector in 
terms of farmers’ economic considerations. Governments can encourage the use of ICTs and sensor 
technology through conservation programmes and by accentuating the environmental dimension of ICTs in 
agriculture and farming.

NOTES
 
1  
Wireless networks have several advantages over wired networks: for instance, installation and maintenance 
costs tend to be lower, replacement and upgrading is easier for wireless networks, the flexibility of wireless 
systems is higher and (more recently developed) wireless networks have the capability to simply organise 
and configure themselves into effective communication networks (see also DOE, 2002). 
2  
Note that customer power inputs into the power system require a separate inverter module and input meter. 
3  
Costs are dependent on the technical infrastructure: e.g. the signal must bypass the final transformer from 
the utility to costumers’ site. In the United States, bypassing the final transformer is, for example, much 
more expensive than in Europe as only a small number of customers are connected to one final transformer 
(EPRI, 2006).

A measure often used in quantifying emissions is the measure carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) 
emissions. Different emissions vary in their warming influence, the radiative forcing, on the climate. The 
common metric which is used in many studies is the radiative forcing of CO2. “The equivalent CO2 
emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the 
given time horizon.” (IPCC)

ANNEX A1. 
OTHER FIELDS OF SENSOR AND SENSOR NETWORK APPLICATIONS 
Environmental monitoring 
 
As multiple different applications exist, the following section will present some examples of 
environmental monitoring in the following areas: water pollution, air pollution, analysis of global 
warming, as well as facilitated recycling (Atkinson, Castro, 2008).  
Sensor networks are deployed in waters to monitor the level of pollution as well as the state of marine 
life. Along the entire Hudson River in New York, scientists are installing sensors nodes which will 
partially be suspended from buoys. Data is transmitted wirelessly and provides information about current 
pollution levels.  
For air pollution monitoring, sensor networks are deployed within cities in order to detect specific 
times and locations when pollution peaks. Engineers from Harvard University deployed 100 general 
purpose nodes onto streetlights to cover the city of Cambridge, L. A. aiming at measuring the amount of 
particles in the air and collecting weather data. The sensors are directly powered by the city streetlights and 
communicate via Wi-Fi radios (Greene, 2007). 
The analysis and assessment of global warming requires sophisticated IT technology to understand to 
which extent and why the climate has changed. Some applications involve sensor networks. For instance, a 
plane which is deployed in the arctic by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers 
is equipped with 30 airborne sensors and collects “data that can be used to produce a detailed simulation of 
the chain of chemical reactions that arctic pollution cause and that increase ice melting” (Atkinson, Castro, 
2008). Furthermore, a worldwide sensor network, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems 
(GEOSS) is currently being developed with the aim to collect data relating to climate change and more 
generally air pollution. Currently, 76 countries and the European Union participate in the project (GEO, 
2008). 
The final application presented here in the section of environmental monitoring is dealing with the 
collection and recycling of waste. Automatic sorting machines are not only equipped with magnets to sort 
out metal objects but also with optical sensors. These sensors identify different kinds of plastics and paper 
allowing them to be put in different bins. Furthermore, RFID tags with integrated sensors on private 
households’ bins measure the weight of the waste. Costs are then allocated according to the weight of the 
waste during the year.  
Urban terrain tracking and civil structure monitoring 
 
This field of application covers the structural health monitoring of large civil or urban structures. One 
prominent example is the Ben Franklin Bridge. A network of ten sensors monitors the strain of the bridge 
structure when trains are crossing the bridge. Two different operation modes reduce the required power: a 
low-power sampling mode checks if any trains are passing. If this is the case, the strain increases and leads 
the system to switch to a second mode in which samples are collected at a higher pace to monitor precisely 
changes in the strain.

Entertainment 
 
Multiple different and heterogeneous applications are conceivable in the entertainment area. 
According to Verdone et al. (2008), there are application scenarios in which live TV shows react to user 
(emotional) feedback. This enables viewers to get more involved in the shows and the provider to adapt the 
shows more to the viewers’ needs. Further examples include applications in the games area: Via sensor 
networks, game players are able to project their moods and gestures in the virtual world (Verdone et al. 
2008). 
Security and surveillance 
 
Security and surveillance sensor networks are used in the military and defence area, for example for 
the surveillance of borders. In this case, different kinds of sensors are used, ranging from sensors 
monitoring temperature to sensors monitoring light to acoustic sensors. Further, they are also employed for 
civil structure, for instance for fire detection systems in buildings. 
Health care 
 
Sensor networks can be and are currently used in multiple ways in the healthcare sector. Applications 
cover telemonitoring of patients’ state of health, tracking and monitoring the movements of patients and 
doctors, drug administration and diagnostic applications (Heppner, 2007, Verdone, 2008). In the field of 
patients’ state of health, sensor networks are particularly useful for patients under medical observation. 
Sensors communicate gathered data to a telecommunication device such as a mobile phone, which further 
transmits the data to nurses’ or doctors’ rooms in case of dangerous changes of the state of health. It is also 
possible to carry out medication control via these sensors (Heppner, 2007). Sensor networks and location-
based services allow doctors to be quickly tracked in hospitals in case of emergency. The same principle is 
applicable to their patients. Furthermore, wireless sensors are developed for implants such as glaucoma 
sensors or intra-cranial pressure sensor systems (Healthy Aims, 2008).

Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world's population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities.

A global food security problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation, food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%, and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages, namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage), and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting, etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption, optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming, or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs, farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides, and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8].

Research motivation and contribution The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture 4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type, the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction, the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture; after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section 8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly, cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title, abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies” mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1) is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate, and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3. Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature, such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques used, system's maturity level, and farm type? RQ3: What are the primary roadblocks in implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for smart farming? Study selection criteria Inclusion criteria: • Peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. • Studies published during the period between 2011 and 2021. • Studies should provide answers to the research questions. • The article must include the title, year, source, abstract, and DOI. • Literature focussing on application of Industry 4.0 technologies in crop plantation and harvesting activities particularly in-field processes. Exclusion criteria: • Summaries of events and seminars, book review, and editorial. • Literature focusing on application of Industry 4.0 technologies in livestock farming; pre-field processes such as genetic development, seed development and seed supplying; post-field stages such as crop distribution, food processing and consumption; and agri-food supply chain. • Studies published before 2011. • The publication is not available in full text. • The publication is not in English. Literature search Sources: Scopus, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore for academic literature, citations in identified literature Search equation: (("agriculture*") AND ("Industry 4.0" OR “Digital Farming” OR “Intelligent Farming” OR “Smart Agriculture” OR “Agriculture 4.0” OR “Smart Farming” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT” OR “Cloud Computing” OR “Edge Computing” OR “Wireless Sensor Networks*” OR “Artificial Intelligence*” OR “Big Data*” OR “Data Analytics*” OR “Data Science*” OR “Cyber Physical System*” OR “Robotics*” OR “Computer Vision*” OR “Machine Learning*” OR “Deep Learning*” OR “Data Integration*”)) 2.2. Evaluation process The evaluation of the literature search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165 records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to 2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed, and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another 11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected in the final stage for further analysis.

Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed. However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011 to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15].

Download : Download high-res image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance, the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types. Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn. For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise, services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/ spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight, green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll) and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature, humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis, energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation); vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection); vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop quality management (3%).

Service-wise distribution of selected research studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined using European Union's TRL scale that partitions system's maturity level into three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype, which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9 (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype levels to the commercial level.

Distribution of studies based on the service category and system's maturity level. 4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies This section provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication), middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight, etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee, LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23]. Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22]. RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies, on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters. In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity.

The integration of IoT in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring, and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural systems.

Wireless sensor networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing, transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure, and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications, TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore, the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’ applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention, such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure, platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability compliance with standards of food safety and quality.

Self-leveling scale, control box, LCD display, and RFID tags Open-air Conceptual [74] The cloud-based agricultural systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover, because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed. Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based agricultural systems.

Autonomous robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling, and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However, when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of UGVs designed for performing agricultural tasks.

Open-air Prototype [95] Most of the agricultural robotic systems presented above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras. Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure) and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras, etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area, and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations.

Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces, and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6. Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119]. The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture, which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors, aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content), marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management. A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture. A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques. Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing, and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Five dimensions of “Big Data”. Table 8.

Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML) techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type, moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table 9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques are employed. Considering the digital transformation's cyber-security and data privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures, and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases, pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images, and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled) are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming, most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL and computer vision approaches.

Agricultural decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven. The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig. 14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental components, each having its specific purpose.

Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature. From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge, which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user's needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems.

Agricultural cyber-physical systems As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS) refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms, with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted significant research interest because of their promising applications across different domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical systems.

Digital twins in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object's lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13.

Only one study is found that has proposed DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence, implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector. After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability: data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications, and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results, data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness. The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging. This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity, strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically, the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because, in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210]. The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution, but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices, as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage, adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication. For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence, there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas, cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy: the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks, or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size, and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables, resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices, machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces: complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry. Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers. • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating, and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones, WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited. To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs. To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications. The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies, how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16]. Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption. Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring, tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture 4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems. Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems, the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies. Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature, humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale. But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise the farm's productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility: digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218]. 4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section 5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships, the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture 4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture 5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0 focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture 5.0 settings, farm's production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise, digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed, detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions. The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture 4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct), and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover, studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

The COVID-19 preventive measurements restrict farm-workers from travel to their farms, social distancing and lockdown
to prevent them from getting infected. Consequently, farming and irrigation activities are dramatically reduced due to
shortage of farm-workers and reduction of crops production. To find solutions, various technologies have been adopted
to remotely connect farmers with their farm-fields from their homes and perform the same work as they are in the farm.
An Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern sensor technologies, and smart irrigation equipment are coupled to allow
the collection of the field data for automatic irrigation of the field. This paper presents the IoT system based on Fuzzy
logic controller that assists farmers to receive and monitor necessary irrigation data from the farm field through their smart
phones and PCs. The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are deployed in the field to measure the water content in the soil
and water used for plants by measuring the soil moisture dynamics throughout the entire duration of the crop growing sea-
son in the Maize crop farm. The Fuzzy logic controller was used for data analytics and intelligent decision making as well
as Fuzzy logic toolbox in MATLAB to simulate irrigation scheduling process. The system saves 50% of water and energy
consumption for irrigation, 80% reduction of farm-workers and increase in 20% of crop production.

Introduction
Agriculture sector is crucial to the population welfare as it
provides the food, employment and raises the national econ-
omy; In Rwanda, about 96% of its population living in rural
areas depends mainly on agriculture for their income and it
is almost impossible to survive without this sector. However,
the climate change, the irregular precipitation and long dry
season are negatively affecting the quantity and quality of crop
production and results in agriculture production crisis in the
region. Each agricultural crop has its weather requirements for
growing, that’s why the farmers wisely select the right season
when to sow on the basis of weather condition (Zhu et al.,
2020; Patil et al., 2019). Therefore, in order to achieve a high
quantity and quality of crop production by balancing weather
condition, irrigation is essential.
The method used in irrigation involves building canals
which supply uniformly water from water resources or use of
water pumps for spraying water evenly in the field. Never-
theless, the scarcity of water resources has been a problem that
impacts the agriculture development. Therefore, A convenient
irrigation system shall make the agricultural process more
effective (Patil et al., 2019). However, not only the currently
used methods of irrigation consume more water than what
plants need, but also require farmers to manually and con-
stantly operate water valves or water pumps in case of absence
or excess of water in the field. In addition, COVID-19 pan-
demic as the biggest health crisis in this decade, due to its
preventive measures taken by different organ around the world
which restrict the people to stay at home (lockdown) and
social distancing have severely affected agricultural activities
(Filtjens, n.d.; GSMA, 2021). Therefore, the introduction of
ICT in agriculture has emerged as the effective and sustainable
solution to improve irrigation systems.
The emergence and rapid development of IoTs and Big Data
Analytics presents interesting solutions to the above problem.
(Badrun and Manaf, 2021; Salvi et al., 2017). In this context,

smart devices located in the field and link them to a local or
cloud based controller. These nodes in turn collect and trans-
mit real-time data from their surroundings to the controller.
This information can be either used to offer for example a
farmer both immediate and long term response or used by pre-
dictive and adaptive algorithms to execute operational
responses such automate irrigation scheduler (Gautam and
Sen, 2015; Jamroen et al., 2020).
The use of Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low Energy
Consumption overcomes the above mentioned problems with
An Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern sensor tech-
nologies, and smart irrigation equipment are combined to per-
mit the collection of the field data for automatic irrigation and
notification . This study presents the IoT based irrigation sys-
tem using Fuzzy logic controller that assists farmers to receive
and monitor the field parameters such as soil moisture, and
temperature as well as remotely controlling irrigation system
installed in the farm field through their smart phones and PCs.
Related works
This section presents the cutting-edge studies for currently
available related solutions. First, threatenings to farmers due
to COVID-19 pandemic are evaluated followed by IoT tech-
nologies for irrigation and finally the applications of Fuzzy
logic in agriculture are presented.
1. Threatening to farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic
Threatening to farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic has
exacerbated, especially in developing countries. in Rwanda,
big number of the citizen are employed in farming activities
where the report shows that in 2019 in Rwanda, 64% of the
population was hired in this agriculture sector (MINAGRI,
2020). Since outbreak of COVID-19, one among the effective
measures to control the spread of the pandemic was to enforce
the citizen to stay-at-home (4.I. Workshop: Health systems
resilience during COVID-19: Lessons for building back better,
2021; Tripathi et al., 2021). The agriculture also was one
among sectors affected by these COVID-19 prevention mea-
sures. One among affected farming parts was irrigation where
farmers were restricted to go to irrigate their fields and had
to depend again on rain season only which reduced dramat-
ically their production (Boughton et al., 2021; Selim and
Eltarabily, 2022). nevertheless the IoT was introduced and
being used in agriculture sector, challenges of COVID-19 pan-
demic have proved that the digital agriculture need to be accel-
erated, where smart irrigation systems are needed for
autonomous irrigation and assisting farmers in remote mon-
itoring and tracking forming activities (GSMA, 2021; Nyakuri
et al., 2022).
2. IoT connectivity technologies for irrigation
Wi-Fi connectivity is a widely used wireless communication
technique. Many agricultural monitoring systems, such as the
one presented in (Mendez et al., 2012) by Gerard Rudolph et
al and (Hasan et al., 2021), employ Wi-Fi to communicate
amongst the various agents of their designs. They demon-
strated a Wi-Fi wireless sensor network for farm monitoring,
with nodes collecting data on temperature, humidity, light, soil
moisture, and water level. The data was also sent to a server
so that it could be viewed later. As a result, researching MiFi
coverage in various agricultural settings is of tremendous
interest. In (Mendez et al., 2012; Li et al., 2020), Muhammad
A. et al. reported a method for estimating the location of wire-
less nodes based on signal intensity. The IEEE 802.11 b/g
standard was used and the locations included urban regions,
rural areas, woodlands, and plantations. However, Wi-Fi
requires more internet infrastructure when deployed in remote
area. 
Cellular system employs GSM/GPRS standard for data
communication between field sensor node and the cloud
server for data storage and further analysis. Additionally, the
Android app is being developed to track the system's current
state instantly (Science, 2018). In (Munir et al., 2021; Yang
et al., 2021), the GSM module was used to connect an IoT
cloud server to a network of sensors, analyzes the data at the
edge server, transfers only a subset of the data to the main
IoT cloud server to predict the amount of water that a field
of crops will need, and uses an edge Android application to
display the outcome. The IoT devices communicate with cel-
lular networks by using second generation (2G), third gen-
eration (3G), fourth generation (4G) and GPRS standards due
to its relatively long-range wireless communication and its
robust communication links (Khattab et al., 2019; Science,
2018).
Bluetooth Low Energy enabled technology allows IoT
devices in irrigation system to communicate effectively with
minimized cost and energy consumption but within a short

range less than 100 m (Kim et al., 2008), developed sensor-
based variable rate irrigation systems with Bluetooth tech-
nology. The application in this article requires plug-and-play
compatibility to serial devices with affordable wireless com-
munication modules in order to accommodate existing data
loggers and sensors. For wireless data transmission between
in-field sensor stations and a base station, the Bluetooth mod-
ule was chosen (Ilapakurti and Vuppalapati, 2015) and (Hasan
et al., 2021) used the Bluetooth low energy framework to sen-
sor sensor nodes. Their choice for using Bluetooth low energy,
also known as Bluetooth Smart, was to maintain a same com-
munication range as Wi-Fi but using significantly less power
and cost. When compared to other previous stated technol-
ogies used in irrigation, system design optimization, trans-
mission energy, cost and security can be achieved by improved
with the only limitation of the device communication range.
3. Fuzzy logic for Data Management and Analytics for
Irrigation Optimization
Fuzzy logic system determines degree of truth for right deci-
sion making to the problem as that of human perception and
reasoning can make. Fuzzy logic algorithms are robust and
adapt easily to the changing environments (Jane and Ganesh,
2019; Pezol et al., 2020) in (Phogat et al., 2021) an irrigation
system based on ANN and Fuzzy Logic was developed. Soil
moisture dynamics, precipitation, evapotranspiration for wheat
crop were considered. And the results of Fuzzy logic was
found suitable with 89% better performance due to better deci-
sion making the lower implementation cost. An intelligent
automatic control system was developed in (Shongwe, 2022)
and (Jamroen et al., 2020) using the fuzzy logic controller to
enable smart irrigation based on environmental factors such
as soil moisture variation, soil Ph, solar irradiation, air tem-
perature, and air humidity. The system showed water and
energy usage efficiency relatively to the optimal growth of the
plant.
After observing irrigation challenges faced by formers
during COVID-19 pandemic and reduction of their production
due to those challenges, based on the necessity of digitali-
zation in irrigation system and gaps identified in different
researches, the Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low
Energy Consumption was developed. It works by deploying
sensor nodes in the field so that irrigation can be done based
on water requirements by the plants to reduce water wastage
from irrigating unneeded location and assisting farmers in irri-
gation activities using smart device.

System design 
1. System architecture
The proposed system is illustrated in the Figure 1 and is
designed for semi-automatic irrigation system. The sensor
nodes are deployed in the field and work in WSN mode at
the edge of the network and consist of sensors, Microcon-
troller and ZigBee technology and gather all necessary field
data to a single gateway. The gateway gathers all data sends
data to the cloud platform for further analysis. The water for
irrigation came from AKAGERA River and stored in the
water reservoir where it is pumped to the field by the solar-
powered pump when it is needed by any sensor node in the
field. For any sensor node, if the water content in the soil get
below the threshold value, the irrigation is done either auto-
matically or by the farmer according to the weather fore-
casting.The field data is sent to the cloud platform through the
gateway using SGM system. The cloud plat form receives big
data from the field and weather forecasting, analyses it, take
decision and sent notification to the farmer through smart
phone and PC. The farmer accesses to all field information
and can operate the irrigation system from home (whether to
irrigate or stop irrigation if it is going to rain) using his smart
phone. 
2. Solar powered sensor node
The sensor node presented in this project collects data from
the given section of the field (for this case is 2 ha), processes
it and communicates it to the gateway which is the central unit
of the WSN. It consists of four main units; the sensing unit
that employs Hobonet TEROS 12 Soil Moisture/Temperature/
EC Sensor to detect the water content and temperature dynam-
ics in the soil, Atmega 328 microcontroller which is respon-
sible for processing data from sensors and determine the
irrigation requirements, communication units using Xbee
module for transmitting processed data to the gateway and
finally the solar panel module for powering the whole device.
3. Wireless sensor network (WSN)
WSN is the distributed sensor nodes structure that allows
many sensor nodes to communicate each other wirelessly in
the network. In this study, the standalone sensor node can
cover area not more than 2 hectares while the field is 12 hect-
ares; so, the sensor nodes are connected in the WSN structure
in order to collect the entire field information to the central
unit (The gateway) for further processing and communicating
the same data to the cloud for further analysis and decision
making. The ZigBee technology has been chosen for their low
power consumption, low cost and easy transmission compared
to Lora, Wi-Fi and GSM technologies.

4. Mobile application
The bazafarm mobile application is found in the google play
store. Its dashboard show the farm information and soil con-
dition with notification to the farmer. The soil moisture level,
soil electrical conductivity, the battery level of each device and
the device ID is shown in the dashboard.
5. System flowchart
Smart crop irrigation operates by using microcontroller
Atmega 328 which starts by scanning soil moisture, soil tem-
perature, and electrical conductivity of the soil. Those three
parameters were scanned with help of moisture sensor placed
to in the soil. Therefore, those scanned parameters are sent to
both cloud and to mobile phone by using GSM. When soil
moisture becomes less than twenty four percent, then, turn on
the pump for irrigating the crop. Otherwise pump is off. The
electrical conductivity of soil turns pump on while it is
becomes greater 570 ms/m. 
Fuzzy logic controller and MATLAB 
simulation
1. Fuzzy logic system for decision making
Fuzzy logic approach is a machine learning technique for
data analytics and intelligent decision making for uncertain
problems based on the degree of truth. Fuzzy logic helps in
right decision making as that can be made by human per-
ception and reasoning based on the environment variation
rather than convention true or false (1 or 0) logic (Arcos-
Aviles et al., 2021). 
2. Fuzzy inference system and membership functions
For the simulation of the output based on the input variation
through the Fuzzy Logic Controller is done in the Fuzzy logic
Toolbox in MATLAB (Alfin and Sarno, 2018). The output is
the speed variation of the electrical pump for irrigation that
determines the quantity of water to be irrigated according to
the soil state. The soil state is determined by the soil moisture,

soil temperature and the soil EC data collected by sensors as
illustrated in Fuzzy Inference System editor Figure 5.
In the proposed work, there are three Fuzzy input mem-
bership functions including soil moisture, soil temperature and
EC. The input membership functions with their linguistic vari-
ables, corresponding ranges and plots are illustrated in the
Table 1. 
The output membership function of the Fuzzy system is the
variation speed of electrical pump that varies from 0 to 30%
for low state, 30% to 60% for medium state and 60% to 100%
for high state of its total power. The linguistic variables, cor-
responding ranges and plot are described in the Table 2.

3. Fuzzy IF-THEN Rules
In this study, the fuzzy IF-THEN rule system is based on
the expert knowledge in the field of irrigation to manage the
appropriate quantity of water to irrigate the farm field at real-
time. The Fuzzy Rule System starts by determining water con-
tent in the soil (in %), temperature (in oC) and EC (in mS/
m) of the soil as input Fuzzy values. The input Fuzzy values
are applied to IF-THEN rule system that determines the output
Fuzzy values as described in IF-THEN Rule viewer Figure 6.
4. Surface view
The surface viewers of the proposed Fuzzy system are the
three-dimensional output surfaces that shows output variations
with their corresponding inputs. The surface views in Figure
7(a), Figure 7(b) and Figure 7(c) represent the output variation
speed of the electrical pump during irrigation process that cor-
respond to soil moisture/soil temperature, soil moisture/EC
and soil temperature/EC respectively.
Results and Discussion

The 6 sensor nodes were deployed in the Maize farm
located at Nyagatare in Eastern province of Rwanda near the
Akagera River. The C9 section of the farm covers 12 hectors
and each sensor node is able to serve not more than 2 hectors

section of the field. After smart irrigation system with low
energy consumption installed in the Maize farm, the data col-
lected in two consecutive seasons, the season 1 started from
April to July 2021 and the season 2 started from August to
October the results obtained are presented in the Figure 8.
1. The data collected by each sensor during those seasons
show that the average of the soil moisture was 29.45%
and 33.55% respectively, which are exactly in the
expected normal range.
2. The average soil temperature was 22.56oC and 23.53oC
respectively which correspond to the normal recom-
mended temperature range.
3. Water usage and energy consumption was reduced by
45% due to the reduction of the irrigation time duration.
4. The 80% reduction in number of farm-workers due to
automatic irrigation and remote farm irrigation moni-
toring system via smart phone.
5. 20% increase in maize production compare to previous
seasons.
The resulting Averages of soil moisture and temperature in
the period of two seasons showed that water content in the
soil was maintained at desired level due to the regular auto-
matic irrigation system based on the water needs for the plant.
Data were collected in two periods, the first period was from
May to July and the second was from August to December
and C9 section covers 12 Ha and the crop planted is Maize.
Each sensor node sends data every 30 minutes and each single
data packet has 2.5 kb size.
According to the above chart, the number of data collected
in C9 section in season1 is estimated to 22.9 MB while num-
ber of data collected in season 2 is 18.5 MB. So, the number
of data collected in season1 is more than season 2 because
season 1 was longer than season two.
2. Discussion
The project was well conducted durig the two seasons peri-
ode which had defferent rainfall and sunshine patterns. The

resulting average soil moisture and temperature in that period
proved that water content in the soil was maintained at desired
level due to the regular automatic irrigation system based on
the water needs for the plant. By using this system, farmers
can nolonger rely on rainfall condition. In addition, a sig-
nificant benetit for farmers was achieved by saving 80% of
labor force (as COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures
were conserned) and 45% of energy consumption was saved
with 20% increase in crop productivity.
By introducing this smart irrigation system, other types of
crop than Maize such as vegetables and potatos can be grown
and increase significantly the productivity. The availability of
sufficient sunlight makes renewable enery an additive source
of free energy for irrigation equipment to overcome electrical
energy problem in the region.
Conclusion
This study presents smart irrigation project based on soil
parameters dynamics suitable for Maize crop irrigation. It uses
sensors to sense variation in moisture and temperature in the
soil, process them using Raspberry-pi 3 and Fuzzy Inference
Controller for decision making and gives recommendation
(notification message) to the farmers according to standards
predetermined through mobile application. This system pro-
vides capabilities for the farmer to monitor their farm irri-
gation activities anywhere they can be and at any time as the
COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures prevent movement.
The results shows that there are significant reduction of water
quantity and energy for irrigation as well as preventing the
COVID-19 transmission by monitoring the farm activities
remotely through smart phone.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

    Impact of data temporal resolution on quantifying residential end uses of water.
    Water, 14(16), 2457. https://doi.org/10.3390/w14162457
  data_sources: Residential water use data
  explanation: The paper demonstrates that data collected at full pulse resolution
    from water meters, compared to collecting data at aggregated temporal resolutions,
    improves estimates of event occurrence, timing and features. This is because full
    pulse resolution data provides a more accurate representation of the underlying
    event process, capturing more discriminative event features that can only be estimated
    from full pulse resolution data to make event classification easier and more accurate.
  extract_1: '"Our results show how collecting full pulse resolution data can provide
    more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features along with producing
    more discriminative event features that can only be estimated from full pulse
    resolution data to make event classiﬁcation easier and more accurate."'
  extract_2: '"collecting full pulse resolution data has several advantages versus
    temporally aggregated data, a key contribution to the field of water demand management
    and water end-use studies."'

  data_sources: Survey data, Interviews, Case studies, Literature review
  explanation: The article is about a new energy-efficient approach based on genetic
    algorithms and fuzzy logic for increasing network lifetime in wireless sensor
    networks, which are used for agricultural monitoring. The suggested technique
    uses an integrated clustering structure to reduce the distance between sensor
    nodes where data must be transmitted.
  extract_1: The volume of data, resource constraints, and scattered nature of wireless
    receiving networks have brought about new challenges. The paradigm of data transfers
    in application programs should guarantee energy efficiency because communicating
    with a sensor node is frequently expensive.
  extract_2: As part of the clustering process, sensor nodes are grouped together
    into various clusters, each of which has a coordinator known as the cluster head
    and other nodes known as the cluster members. There should only be one cluster
    for each sensor node. Data is sent from sensor nodes to the relevant cluster heads.
    The data are then gathered by the cluster heads and sent through one-hop or multiple-hop
    communications to a base station, or sink.
  inline_citation: (Tabatabaei, 2023)
  key_findings: The proposed technique uses an integrated clustering structure to
    reduce the distance between sensor nodes where data must be transmitted. The results
    of OPNET's simulations showed that the suggested system performs better than the
    IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in terms of energy usage and WSN lifetime.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: To present a novel energy-aware clustering-based routing algorithm

    to deficit irrigation and evaluate the FAO-56 agro-hydrological model's ability
    to predict crop water stress under different irrigation management strategies.
    The data used in the study includes soil water content, crop water status, irrigation
    management data, and meteorological data which were collected over a three-year
    period from a commercial citrus orchard in Spain. The study found that the FAO-56
    model was able to accurately simulate soil water content and water stress in the
    citrus plants under different irrigation strategies, demonstrating its potential
    as a tool for irrigation scheduling and water management in citrus orchards.
  extract_1: For treatment T100, the temporal variability of average SWC in the root
    zone resulted in general more limited than the other two treatments, as a consequence
    of the higher irrigation volumes applied. The average SWCs ranged between 0.24
    cm3 cm−3 and 0.30 cm3 cm−3, except that for short periods when they were slightly
    lower. This circumstance evidences that the average soil water content of the
    soil profile was generally higher than field capacity (SWCfc = 0.24 m3 m−3), with
    values sometimes close to saturation.

  relevance_evaluation:
    extract_1: Modeling the climate of urban areas is of interest for studying urban

      efficacy of various heat mitigation strategies requires accurate prediction
      of urban temperatures and realistic representation of land surface physical

      real-time satellite observations of green vegetation fraction (GVF) and albedo.
      Satellite-based GVF and albedo replace constant values that are assumed for
      urban pixels in the default version of WRF.
    extract_2: Using the improved model, we quantify relationships between surface
      and 2 m air temperatures versus urban fraction, GVF, albedo, distance from the

  explanation: "The paper in question presents a quality control study of daily and\
    \ semihourly meteorological data from the Agroclimatic Information Network of\
    \ Andalusia (RIAA) in southern Spain. The data were collected from 1999 to 2006\
    \ and included solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed,\
    \ precipitation, and other climate variables. The study's primary purpose was\
    \ to develop and evaluate procedures for identifying and correcting erroneous\
    \ data in the network, ensuring the accuracy of the data used for various agricultural\
    \ and hydrological applications. The study involved applying a comprehensive suite\
    \ of quality control tests to the data, including range checks, step tests, internal\
    \ consistency checks, persistence tests, and spatial consistency tests. The authors\
    \ also provided a concise summary of the rationale and methodology employed in\
    \ their research, which is captured in the following key points:\n\n1. **Necessity\
    \ of quality control**: Meteorological data often contain errors or inconsistencies,\
    \ necessitating the use of quality control procedures to ensure data accuracy.\
    \ This is particularly critical for data used in climate assessments, reference\
    \ evapotranspiration calculations, and other applications that rely on reliable\
    \ climate data.\n\n2. **Quality control steps**: The study employed a multi-pronged\
    \ approach to data quality control, including: \n   - **Range checks**: Data values\
    \ were compared to expected ranges based on sensor specifications and local climate\
    \ conditions.\n   - **Step tests**: Temporal consistency was assessed by comparing\
    \ consecutive data points to identify abrupt changes.\n   - **Internal consistency\
    \ checks**: Data values were evaluated for logical consistency within each variable\
    \ (e.g., minimum temperature cannot be higher than maximum temperature) and between\
    \ related variables (e.g., relative humidity and temperature).\n   - **Persistence\
    \ tests**: Temporal variability was analyzed to detect periods of constant or\
    \ unusually low variability, which could indicate sensor malfunctions or data\
    \ transmission issues.\n   - **Spatial consistency tests**: Data values were compared\
    \ to neighboring stations to identify outliers and potential errors in data collection\
    \ or transmission.\n\n3. **Results**: The study found that the quality control\
    \ procedures identified a substantial number of erroneous data points. The percentage\
    \ of flagged data varied depending on the variable and the specific test applied,\
    \ but overall, the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the quality control\
    \ procedures in detecting and correcting errors in the meteorological data.\n\n\
    4. **Importance of quality control**: The study emphasizes the critical importance\
    \ of data quality control for reliable climate assessments and modeling efforts.\
    \ Erroneous data can lead to biased results and incorrect conclusions, making\
    \ it essential to implement robust quality control procedures to ensure the integrity\
    \ of the data used in these applications."

- explanation: "Evapotranspiration (ET) refers to the sum of water evaporation and\
    \ plant transpiration from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. This process\
    \ is crucial in the water cycle and can be used as an indicator of crop water\
    \ consumption and stress. The study uses a remote sensing approach to estimate\
    \ daily ET at a 30-m spatial resolution over two vineyard sites in central California\
    \ for the 2013–2016 growing seasons to investigate the utility for irrigation\
    \ management. The research team evaluated the accuracy of the ET estimates by\
    \ comparing them with in-situ eddy covariance measurements, resulting in mean\
    \ absolute errors of 0.6 mm day−1, which is about 17% of the mean observed value.\
    \ \n\nThe study's key findings include:\n1. The remote sensing ET mapping approach\
    \ can provide detailed and robust information on daily to seasonal crop water\
    \ use and stress. \n2. Spatial and temporal monitoring of ET can improve water\
    \ allocation and conservation efforts by identifying areas of uneven productivity/stress\
    \ due to variations in soil texture and composition and other environmental or\
    \ anthropogenic factors. \n3. The ET mapping approach is applicable to different\
    \ vine varieties and climate regions within California and can potentially be\
    \ integrated with variable rate irrigation systems to optimize water and nutrient\
    \ application."
  extract_1: A remote-sensing approach for mapping daily ET at 30-m spatial resolution
    is evaluated over two vineyard sites in central California for the 2013–2016 growing
    seasons to investigate the utility for irrigation management. Mean absolute errors
    in comparison with in-situ eddy covariance measurements of daily ET were 0.6 mm
    day−1, or about 17% of the mean observed value. Errors reduced to 15% at the weekly
    time steps relevant to irrigation management.
  extract_2: In comparison with eddy covariance fluxes forced for closure, the model
    tended to underestimate closed observations in the northern vineyard site during
    highly advective periods for the peak growing season in 2013 and 2016. During
    this period, the closure errors in the observations were exacerbated, and therefore,
    the tendency to underestimate is partly attributed to issues with the flux measurements
    and closure technique and not the model alone. Model errors may be associated
    with the self-preservation assumptions in the daily upscaling technique, which
    may be less reliable under advective conditions.
  limitations: "1. Though errors of 0.6mm/day are reported, these errors were not\
    \ reported as a fraction of the ET values measured, making it difficult to determine\
    \ the true error of the approach. \n2. The approach was only tested over two growing\
    \ seasons, and it is not clear how the approach holds up during non-growing seasons."

    Abstract: As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies,
    soil moisture

    (SM) inﬂuences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land
    surface and

    atmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of SM is critical
    for numerous

    large-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave remote sensing provides many
    algorithms to

    obtain SM at large scale, such as SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products,
    they are

    almost low resolution and not applicable in small catchment or ﬁeld scale. Estimations
    of SM from

    optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and signiﬁcant
    progress

    has been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive
    and

    systematic review of using optical and thermal remote sensing for estimating SM.
    The physical basis

    and status of the estimation methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The
    most important

    and latest advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have
    been shown in this

    paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly depends on
    the relationship

    between SM and the surface reﬂectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared
    remote sensing

    methods uses the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or variations
    of surface

    temperature/vegetation index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes
    and many

    approximations. Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely
    sensed data can

    provide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages
    and weaknesses

    of different approaches are compared and applicable conditions as well as key
    issues in current soil

    moisture estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested
    solutions are

    proposed for future research.'

  data_sources: The study utilized a publicly available dataset of plant leaf images,
    but the specific dataset name is not mentioned in the text.
  explanation: 'The proposed method aims to develop a novel deep neural network, namely
    ERCP-Net, for automated plant leaf disease classification. The ERCP-Net is tailored
    to effectively diagnose and identify diseases in plant leaves using image-based
    data. The methodology is grounded in three primary building blocks: the Channel
    Extension Residual Block (CER-Block), the Adaptive Channel Attention Block (ACA-Block),
    and the Bidirectional Information Fusion Block (BIF-Block).'
  extract_1: Meanwhile, various degrees of diseases impair the synthesis of nutrient
    proteins and result in yield reduction, reducing the economic efficiency of crops1.
    Traditional plant leaf disease identification mainly relies on the experience
    accumulated by generations of researchers in the plant production process, which
    requires a high level of professional knowledge for plant producers.

    and deep learning techniques are becoming increasingly mature. The application
    of deep learning technology4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 to identifying plant leaf diseases
    intelligently has become a prominent trend, which helps to overcome the defects
    of traditional methods to improve plant yields12.
  inline_citation: (Adebayo et al., 2023)
  key_findings: The key findings of the study include the development of the ERCP-Net
    model, which combines the CER-Block, ACA-Block, and BIF-Block to effectively capture
    discriminative features for leaf disease classification. The model achieved an
    impressive accuracy of 99.82% on the PlantVillage dataset and 86.21% on the AI
    Challenger 2018 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying plant
    leaf diseases.
  limitations: While the study demonstrates promising results, it is important to
    note a few limitations. Firstly, the model's performance may be influenced by
    variations in environmental conditions and imaging setups, as the dataset used
    for training and evaluation may not cover all possible scenarios. Additionally,
    the current version of ERCP-Net might face challenges in cases of extremely rare
    or unseen leaf diseases, as the training dataset may not comprehensively represent
    the entire spectrum of plant leaf diseases.
  main_objective: The primary goal of this study is to develop an accurate and robust
    deep learning model, ERCP-Net, for automated plant leaf disease classification
    using image data.
  relevance_evaluation: The study's relevance lies in its potential to automate the
    process of plant leaf disease identification. The development of an intelligent
    system for diagnosing leaf diseases reduces the need for manual inspection by
    human experts, leading to increased efficiency and reduced subjectivity. Accurate
    and timely identification of plant diseases is critical for timely interventions
    and effective disease management, playing a crucial role in ensuring crop health

    could provide a more accurate prediction of adverse events compared to traditional
    assessments like the ECOG-PS. The study utilized various statistical analysis
    techniques, including machine learning-based models, to determine the optimal

  explanation: 'The authors began by creating a daily salinity climatology at a fixed
    oceanographic mooring site (PH100) using data from 2009-2023 (~13 years). They
    then used this daily climatology to identify extreme low salinity (freshwater)
    events based on the daily-varying 5th percentile of salinity. They found that
    during 2022, large rainfall events resulted in widespread extreme low salinity
    in coastal waters, extending more than five times farther than previously thought.
    Additionally, they observed a previously unseen stratification dynamic for the
    region: a ''double-stacking'' of freshwater layers in the upper 50 m of the water
    column resulting in one salinity stratified layer and another deeper, temperature-stratified
    layer. This ''double-stacking'' of freshwater layers was not observed in previous
    years and may be due to a buildup of low salinity water from multiple large rainfall
    events. The authors also analyzed the impact of freshwater discharge on coastal
    circulation and found that extreme low salinity events can alter the direction
    and strength of surface and depth-integrated currents. They conclude that the
    combination of long-term ocean observations and a daily salinity climatology allows
    for the quantification of extreme salinity events and their impacts on coastal
    circulation and stratification.'

  data_sources: Optical and microwave satellite data, and other ancillary data.
  explanation: 'The study combines optical and microwave satellite data, and other
    ancillary data, to create simultaneous continental-scale inundation and vegetation
    maps for Siberia. Daily temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution (500
    m) allowed the monitoring of the interrelationships between water and vegetation
    parameters, as part of a larger study on the impacts of climate change. Furthermore,
    the study introduces a method of producing inundation maps from surface reflectance
    data using thresholding of the NDWI.


    The maps produced in this study were validated by comparing original and created
    maps in 12 monthly averaged original images, and their statistical criteria across
    four seasons and 12 MODIS tiles. The accuracy of RF prediction varied among tiles,
    but the regression slope was close to unity for both the NDWI and NDVI in summer,
    indicating minimal biases in the reproduced images. RMSE for all tiles was approximately
    0.1 for both the NDWI and NDVI. The discrepancies between the original and newly
    created maps in seasons affected by snow or soil freezing were attributed to the
    mixture of snow and no-snow areas within a scene and spectral features due to
    snow cover. Because of these seasonal issues, the study focused on spring through
    fall when snow cover and soil freezing were less likely to be major factors. Although
    gap-filling by the climatology maps (i.e., an average value for the same date
    over 15 years) can potentially lead to bias in the prediction, the study found
    that the biases were minimal for the NDWI and NDVI.'
  extract_1: The basic algorithm used for map generation was previously developed
    by us for use in a limited study area (Mizuochi et al. 2021a). In the ML-based
    algorithm used in this study, a pixel-based random forest (RF; Breiman 2001) approach
    is used to fill observation gaps in MODIS data (explained variable) by referring
    to other matching data sources (explanatory variable). Subsequently, bias correction
    is applied using a conditional generative adversarial network (pix2pix; Mirza
    and Osindero 2014; Isola et al. 2017). This study expands the previous study area
    to a pan-Arctic scale and includes an update to the NDVI map, the details of which
    are summarized in Table 1.
  extract_2: In addition to the original water maps, a merged product was also created
    using a commonly used latitude/longitude projection. The product was resampled
    using the nearest neighbor method and stored in GeoTiff format. To reduce the
    cost of data handling on a continental scale, the original resolution was aggregated
    into a 0.1° pixel spacing. Within these pixels, the average NDVI and NDWI values
    were stored, along with the fractional coverage of both permanent and intermittent
    wet areas.
  inline_citation: null
  key_findings: The study introduces a method of producing inundation maps from surface
    reflectance data using thresholding of the NDWI. The resulting inundation maps
    show good agreement with existing wetland maps and other water-related datasets,
    and they capture the seasonal and interannual variability of surface water extent
    in the study area.

  limitations: 'The major limitation of the paper is the assumption that the 15-year
    average is a good representation of the study area. This could lead to inaccuracies
    in the prediction of recent climatic extremes and historical events that deviate
    significantly from this average. A more robust approach would be to develop a
    model that can dynamically adjust to changing climatic conditions and account
    for extreme events.


    Another potential limitation is that the study did not investigate the spatial
    and temporal variability of the water fraction within different vegetation types.
    This could be important for understanding the role of vegetation in the water
    cycle and for developing more accurate models of land-atmosphere interactions.'

- explanation: 'In the article titled "The Power of Attention: Government Climate-Risk
    Attention and Agricultural-Land Carbon Emissions," the authors investigate the
    relationship between government attention to climate change (GCRA) and agricultural-land
    carbon emissions (ALCE) and agricultural-land carbon intensity (ALCI). They define
    GCRA as the extent to which a government prioritizes and addresses climate change
    risks in its work reports. The authors use machine-learning and text-analysis
    techniques to construct an indicator of GCRA from the text of government work
    reports in 296 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021. They then conduct
    empirical tests to examine the impact of GCRA on ALCE and ALCI, controlling for
    other factors that may influence these outcomes. The results provide evidence
    that GCRA has a statistically significant negative effect on ALCE and ALCI, suggesting
    that increased government attention to climate change risks leads to a reduction
    in carbon emissions and carbon intensity in agricultural land.'
  extract_1: In this study, we utilize the text of government work reports of 296
    prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021 and use machine-learning and
    text-analysis techniques to determine the word set for government climate-risk
    concern. Finally, we use the dictionary method to derive word-frequency statistics
    to construct the government climate-risk concern index in the Chinese context.
  extract_2: The study further empirically examines the impact of GCRA on ALCE and
    ALCI from the three perspectives of environmental regulation, agricultural-mechanization
    level, and agricultural green-technology innovation.
  limitations: However, due to the complexity of the Chinese language, which leads
    to a complex expression of semantics in the context of government work reports,
    a significant inaccuracy may arise if the dictionary method is directly utilized
    to measure GCRA (Nagar and Schoenfeld, 2022). Suppose the dictionary method is

      prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021 and use machine-learning
      and text-analysis techniques to determine the word set for government climate-risk
      concern. Finally, we use the dictionary method to derive word-frequency statistics
      to construct the government climate-risk concern index in the Chinese context.

      ALCI from the three perspectives of environmental regulation, agricultural-mechanization
      level, and agricultural green-technology innovation.
    limitations: However, due to the complexity of the Chinese language, which leads

  data_sources: Wireless IRT sensors, soil water sensors, neutron probe
  explanation: 'This paper describes a system that can help farmers manage irrigation
    by providing highly localized temperature data via infrared sensors mounted on
    a central pivot. The primary goal of this system is to provide farmers with more
    accurate, site-specific information about crop water stress, making it possible
    for them to adjust irrigation schedules and amounts in real time.


    First, the authors detail how they set up the system. They used wireless sensor
    nodes that include infrared leaf temperature sensors and GPS nodes which are installed
    on a central pivot irrigation system. The sensor nodes are connected to a central
    station that uses a Raspberry Pi 3 computer, along with a zigbee wireless protocol,
    to collect and process data from the sensors. The central station uses an embedded
    computer to manage and visualize data, and to define irrigation prescriptions.


    The system was tested in a field experiment in Shorter, Alabama. The authors compared
    the data from the sensors to data from soil water sensors and from a neutron probe.
    They found that the system was able to accurately measure crop canopy temperature
    and that the data from the sensors was highly correlated with the data from the
    soil water sensors and the neutron probe.


    The authors conclude by discussing the potential benefits of the system. They
    note that the system can help farmers to improve water use efficiency, reduce
    costs, and increase yields. They also note that the system can be easily scaled
    up to larger farms and can be used to irrigate a variety of crops.'

  explanation: '**1. Yes.** The research team controlled for water availability by
    exposing juvenile cork oak seedlings to four different watering regimens: 100,
    50, 25, and 10 % of soil water holding capacity. Statistically significant differences
    in a variety of physiological traits were found across water availability treatments,
    indicating that seedlings adjusted their physiological performance accordingly.
    Moreover, seedlings from different locations (populations) showed different sensitivities
    to water limitation, suggesting that they are locally adapted to distinct water
    availabilities in their native environments.


    **2. Yes.** The research team addressed this question by investigating the relationship
    between water use efficiency, expressed as carbon isotope discrimination levels,
    and drought tolerance, measured as aboveground biomass production, across the
    different populations and watering treatments. Their results suggest that the
    southernmost populations had higher water use efficiency and greater biomass production
    than northern populations, particularly when subjected to extreme water limitation.
    This suggests that the southernmost populations are more drought-tolerant and
    better adapted to drier conditions.


    **3. Yes, in part.** The research team assessed three main parameters related
    to drought tolerance: (1) foliar morphological traits (leaf size and shape), (2)
    physiological responses (e.g., photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance),
    and (3) biochemical responses (e.g., levels of compatible solutes and malondialdehyde).
    Statistically significant variation was found among the three reproductive strategies
    for most of the leaf morphological traits, with northern populations generally
    having more drought-tolerant leaf traits than southern populations. For the physiological
    and biochemical traits, the research team only found significant differences among
    populations for a subset of the traits investigated. These results suggest that
    local adaptation to drought may have evolved differently for different traits
    in cork oak, with foliar morphological traits showing a more consistent pattern
    of local adaptation than physiological and biochemical traits.'

  - Seedling photosynthetic performance strongly relied on the seed provenance and
    the water availability during the growing period, as both factors were found to
    be significant for all the physiological variables monitored throughout the extreme
    drought phase of the experiment.
  - Both sapling photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were lowest for the
    southern provenances and gradually increased in northern provenances, whereas
    the opposite trend was found for Ci/Ca concentration.

    and analysis of soil microbial communities in organic and conventional paddy fields
    by farming season. Environmental Research, 249, 118341.
  explanation: 'In this study, the researchers compared the physical, chemical, and
    microbial characteristics of organic and conventional paddy soils in Korea. They
    found that the bacterial and fungal communities exhibited distinct compositions
    at the genus level, with specific genera being unique to each farming practice.
    The authors suggest that these differences in microbial community structure may
    have implications for crop disease resistance and overall soil health in organic
    versus conventional farming systems.


    More specifically, the researchers observed that the bacterial communities in
    organic and conventional paddy soils were similar in terms of their overall composition.
    However, at the genus level, there were some key differences. For example, the
    genera Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio, Vicinamibacter, and Clostridium
    were among the most abundant in both farming practices. However, the genus Mucor
    was exclusively found in organic paddy soils, while the genus Ustilaginoidea was
    exclusively found in conventional paddy soils. Mucor is known to contribute to
    soil nitrogen cycling, while Ustilaginoidea is a plant pathogen that causes false
    smut disease in rice. These findings suggest that the specific microbial communities
    present in organic and conventional paddy soils may influence their respective
    disease resistance and soil health outcomes.


    The fungal communities in organic and conventional paddy soils also exhibited
    distinct differences at the genus level. The genera Penicillium, Clohesyomyces,
    Mucor, and Sirastachys were predominant in organic soils, while the genera Clohesyomyces,
    Ustilaginoidea, Penicillium, and Plectosphaerella were dominant in conventional
    soils. The genus Sirastachys was exclusively found in organic soils, while the
    genus Ustilaginoidea was exclusively found in conventional soils. This suggests
    that the fungal communities in organic and conventional paddy soils may play different
    roles in nutrient cycling and disease suppression.


    The overall findings of this study indicate that the microbial communities in
    organic and conventional paddy soils in Korea are distinct, with specific genera
    being unique to each farming practice. These differences in microbial community
    structure may have implications for crop disease resistance and overall soil health
    in organic versus conventional farming systems. Further research is needed to
    investigate the functional roles of these specific microbial taxa and to understand
    how they contribute to soil health and crop productivity in different farming
    systems.'

    pathogen that causes false smut in rice, which negatively affects both yield and
    quality, and its toxins can adversely affect humans and animals (Shim et al.,

    The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of deficit irrigation
    on the growth, leaf characteristics, and pigment content of cabbage, as well as
    its gas exchange, head weight, size, and yield, in order to assess the potential
    of deficit irrigation as a water-saving strategy for cabbage production.


    **Main Objectives**


    1. To determine the effects of deficit irrigation on cabbage plant growth, including
    height, width, and leaf size.

    2. To evaluate the impact of deficit irrigation on various leaf characteristics,
    such as chlorophyll index, pigment content, leaf area, fresh and dry weight, water
    content, and specific leaf area.

    3. To analyze the physiological responses of cabbage plants to deficit irrigation,
    including gas exchange rates (photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration)
    and measurements of water stress (relative water content).

    4. To assess the effects of deficit irrigation on cabbage head characteristics,
    including head weight, size, and the ratio of head fresh and dry weight.

    5. To determine the impact of deficit irrigation on cabbage yield and yield components,
    such as marketable and total yield.'
  extract_1: Deficit irrigation at 75% ETc had little influence on plant growth, leaf
    characteristics, leaf pigment content, leaf gas exchange, head weight and size,
    except for a moderate reduction in marketable yield.
  extract_2: However, dry weight of marketable heads was not significantly different
    between 100 and 75% ETc irrigation. Since dry weight percentage increased under
    deficit irrigation, it suggests that most yield reduction under deficit irrigation
    is related to water content.

  explanation: 'This study explored different irrigation rates for dry beans to determine
    their impact on yield, water use efficiency, and root growth. The key findings
    include:


    1. The highest seed yield was obtained with an irrigation rate of 0.67ET in the
    cooler year (1992), while 1.00ET or greater was required for maximum biomass yield
    in both years.

    2. Total dry matter increased significantly as the irrigation rate increased up
    to 1.00ET in 1992, but there was no further increase beyond this point.

    3. Irrigation use efficiency for total dry matter was greater than that for seeds
    at all irrigation rates.

    4. Dry bean can extract soil moisture from the 24-inch soil profile under dryland
    conditions, but only from the 12-inch profile under over-irrigated conditions.

    5. Over-irrigation encourages a shallow root system and can lead to deep percolation
    and nutrient loss to the groundwater.

    1. Introduction

    Despite being the driest inhabited continent, Australia has one of the highest
    per capita

    water consumptions in the world. In addition, instead of having ﬁt-for-purpose
    water supplies

    (using different qualities of water for different applications), highly treated
    drinking water is used

    for nearly all of Australia’s urban water supply needs, including landscape irrigation.
    The water

    requirement of urban landscapes, particularly urban parklands, is of growing concern.
    The estimation

    of evapotranspiration (ET) and subsequently plant water requirements in urban
    vegetation needs to

    consider the heterogeneity of plants, soils, water, and climate characteristics.'
  extract_2: '1.3. The WUCOLS Method

    Nouri et al. [20] compared three observational-based methods of ET estimation
    in urban landscape

    vegetation. Three adjustment factors, or landscape plant coefﬁcients, for reference
    ET (ETo), namely

    WUCOLS, plant factor (PF), and a crop stress factor for the Irrigated Public Open
    Space (IPOS_2008)

    method, were estimated. The predicted irrigation rates using these three landscape
    factors were

    compared with actual irrigation rates for Veale Gardens, the site of the present
    study.

    In the IPOS-2008 method, the landscape factor is the product of a plant factor
    and plant stress

    factor that varies from 0.4 for passive recreational turf to 1.0 for elite sport
    turf. This method is mainly

    focused on turf grasses. In this approach, plant evapotranspiration (ETL) is calculated
    by relating ETo

    to a turf grass coefﬁcient (Kc) and a crop stress factor (Kst).

    ETL “ ETo ˆ Kc ˆ Kst

    (1)

    The Plant Water Use Factor (PF), which deﬁnes a landscape coefﬁcient for the minimum
    irrigation

    needed to maintain acceptable function aesthetics aspects, was also tested. This
    method was very

    limited in species and did not cover a majority of species in the study area.

    ETL “ ETo ˆ PF

    (2)

    The results conﬁrmed that the WUCOLS method produced the best estimation of urban
    vegetation

    water requirements for the study area, so it was adopted for the present study.
    WUCOLS is based on

    the expert opinion of a panel of 36 landscape horticulturists regarding water
    requirements for different

    classes of landscape plants, and it is calibrated for local conditions using estimates
    of reference ET

    (ETo), plant types and species, vegetation density, and microclimate factors:

    ET “ KL ˆ ETo

    (3)

    where KL is a coefﬁcient similar to the crop-coefﬁcient used for agricultural
    crops, but incorporating

    factors speciﬁc for urban landscaping plants. ETo is based on meteorological data
    and represents the

    maximum ET expected for a well-watered grass crop [9]. The WUCOLS method is practical
    because it

    does not require actual local measurements of ET.'

  data_sources: Satellite imagery, meteorological data
  explanation: 'In this study, the relationship between soil properties and topography,
    terrain attributes and vegetation indices was first explored. The focus was on
    the soil''s total carbon and nitrogen content, since these are important indicators
    of soil health and fertility. The authors found that total carbon and nitrogen
    content were negatively correlated with relative elevation and altitude above
    the nearest drainage channel, indicating that these soil properties tended to
    be lower on higher ground and higher in lower, wetter areas. Additionally, total
    carbon and nitrogen content were positively correlated with the wetness index,
    indicating that these soil properties were higher in areas with higher soil moisture
    content.


    The authors used regression kriging, a geostatistical technique, to predict the
    spatial distribution of total carbon and nitrogen content across the study area.
    They found that the regression kriging model, which incorporated ancillary information
    on terrain attributes and vegetation indices, outperformed simple kriging in predicting
    the spatial distribution of these soil properties. This suggests that incorporating
    ancillary information can improve the accuracy of soil property predictions, even

    System (CIMIS) station, soil heat flux plates, soil temperature sensors, and eddy
    covariance
  explanation: The intent of this research was to evaluate the crop coefficients (K
    co) for estimating evapotranspiration (ET c), particularly during the summer months,
    in a mature navel orange orchard irrigated with microsprinklers. The values of
    K co were found to generally range between 0.95 and 1.00 from April to October,
    indicating that actual crop evapotranspiration was nearly equal to or slightly
    higher than the reference evapotranspiration (ET o ), calculated using the ASCE-EWRI
    Penman-Monteith equation and weather data from a nearby CIMIS weather station.
  extract_1: During summer, the daily mean sensible heat flux density tended to be
    upwelling at around H = 5 "MJ" "m"^{-2} "d"^{-1}, the latent heat flux density
    was about LE = 15 "MJ" "m"^{-2} "d"^{-1}, and the net radiation was typically
    about 20 "MJ" "m"^{-2} "d"^{-1}. In general, the ETo was between 6 and 7 "mm"
    "d"^{-1} during midsummer in each year (Figs. 1 through 4). The ETc was somewhat
    lower than normal during April and May of 2003 when there was an atypical cool-rainy
    period.
  extract_2: In 2001, the K co values increased from about 0.70 to 0.85 during the
    summer. It is believed that the increase was due to canopy growth following topping
    and pruning prior to the 2001 experiment. During the summer of 2002, the K co
    values increased above 0.95. The K co factors were close to 1.00 during the summer
    of 2003 and 2004.

  data_sources: Field experiments
  explanation: This study examines the impact of precision land leveling using a laser
    and bed planting on irrigated wheat yields, water use, and nutrient efficiency
    in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, an area facing water scarcity. The results indicate
    substantial benefits from such practices. Precision land leveling alone increased
    yields by 9.49%, while combining it with raised bed planting further enhanced
    yields by 16.63% compared to traditional flat planting practices. Water savings
    were also significant, with precision land leveling saving 31.26% of water in
    flat planting and 22.56% in raised beds. The layered approach of precision land
    leveling and raised bed planting resulted in even greater water savings of 49.83%,
    highlighting the potential for sustainable water management. Furthermore, improvements
    in nutrient use efficiency were observed, indicating the positive impact of these
    techniques on soil health.

    Improving nitrogen and water use efficiency in a wheat-maize rotation system in
    the North China Plain using optimized farming practices. Agricultural Water Management,
    212, 172-180.
  explanation: 'The study''s focus is on identifying which data most effectively addresses
    the specific point in the literature you are making in your literature review,
    specifically looking at the relative relevance of types of data to irrigation
    management practices and their impact on water usage and efficiency. The paper
    you provided is about the impact of nitrogen and water use and efficiency in a
    wheat-maize rotation system in the North China Plain, with a specific interest
    in integrated management practices and their effect on crop yield, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and the groundwater table.


    The paper is highly relevant to the topic at hand, as it directly focuses on improving
    irrigation management practices in a real-world setting.  Specifically, it tests
    the integrated application of balanced fertilization, water-saving irrigation,
    tillage, and straw incorporation in a wheat-maize double-cropping system in order
    to determine how these practices affect crop production, nitrogen and water use
    efficiency, and gas emissions. The researchers found that the recommended farming
    management practices significantly improved many variables related to water use
    and efficiency, including:


    * Greater average grain yield of wheat and maize

    * Higher apparent nitrogen use efficiency, nitrogen recovery efficiency, and irrigation
    water use efficiency

    * Lower net global warming potential, greenhouse gas intensity, and greenhouse
    gas emissions

    * Reduced nitrogen application and groundwater input

    * Decreased nitrous oxide emissions


    The researchers conclude that the integrated management practices they tested
    have the potential to be environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and sustainable
    agricultural farming system in the North China Plain.  Since the referenced paper
    and your literature review have a common interest in the efficient use of water
    and nitrogen in crop production, and your review includes a section on improvements
    to data collection, this paper would be a good selection to mention.'
  extract_1: This study showed that an optimized farming practices REC is an environmentally
    friendly and energy-efficient sustainable agriculture farming system in the North
    China Plain. Balanced N fertilization, water-saving irrigation, and straw incorporation
    were optimized and integrated in REC farming practices that resulted in reducing
    N and irrigation water application, mitigating GHG emissions, and maintaining
    crop yield. Beneficial environmental effects, higher resource use efficiency,
    and high crop yields were achieved sustainably over the 4-year study period in
    this study. These results have important implications for agriculture in the NCP,
    where intensive agriculture requires urgent improvements.
  extract_2: When compared with the FP treatment, the REC treatment successfully decreased
    N and groundwater application rates while maintaining high crop yields, and improved
    N and groundwater use efficiencies (Table 1 and Table S2). These results are in
    accord with previous studies carried out in the NCP (Li et al., 2015; Liu et al.,
    2015; Wang et al., 2015). Balanced fertilization and reasonable, limited irrigation
    could increase water and nutrient utilization in the soil and maintain high crop
    yields (Hartmann et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016b). Other studies have suggested
    that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers, or deep tillage,
    can increase crop yields (Basir et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Omara et al.,
    2017).

    Soil and Tillage Research, 174, 193-204.
  explanation: "Studies have shown great variability in crop responses to deep tillage\
    \ treatments. The meta-analysis revealed that deep tillage increased crop yields\
    \ by an average of 6%. However, individual deep tillage effects were highly scattered,\
    \ with about 40% of the observations showing reduced crop yields after deep tillage\
    \ compared to ordinary tillage. Further statistical analysis showed that deep\
    \ tillage was most beneficial on sites with root-restricting soil layers at deep\
    \ tillage depth and when soils were not too silty, i.e. silty loam or less.\n\n\
    Subsoil fertilization benefited deep tillage effects on crop yields, but deep\
    \ tillage can also cause nutrient depletion in some cases due to nutrient mobilization.\n\
    \nDeep tillage has a range of positive effects, including creating a more favorable\
    \ soil structure that enhances root development and nutrient uptake, promoting\
    \ deeper rooting that stabilizes the mechanically disrupted soil structure and\
    \ provides access to subsoil resources, increasing water storage and access to\
    \ water during dry spells and mitigating yield reduction in drought years.\n\n\
    The most important predictor of deep tillage effects on crop yields identified\
    \ in this meta-analysis was whether the deep tillage treatment disrupted a root-restricting\
    \ soil layer. Deep tillage increased yields by 20 percent on sites with root-restricting\
    \ soil layers at deep tillage depth. \n\nThe second most important predictor of\
    \ deep tillage effects on crop yields in this meta-analysis was soil texture.\
    \ Silty loess soils have an increased risk of yield depression following deep\
    \ tillage. \n\nSubsoil fertilization with mineral fertilizer, manure or plant\
    \ residues tended to enhance deep tillage effects on crop yields.\n\nDeep tillage\
    \ increased the resilience of crops during droughts. The positive deep tillage\
    \ effects increased significantly with decreasing water inputs per growing day,\
    \ i.e. drought intensity."

  limitations: '1. The heavy skew towards short-term effects of deep tillage is partly
    explained by different experimental designs: about half the observations included
    in the meta-analysis derived from studies with recurring deep tillage treatments
    in at least every second year to achieve gradual topsoil deepening over time (mean
    period between yield measurement and preceding deep tillage 1.2 years; mean difference
    between tillage depth of control and deep tillage 16 cm). The other half of the
    observations described the effect of non-recurring, usually more intense, deep
    tillage interventions with the goal of long-term soil improvement (mean period
    between yield measurement and preceding deep tillage 2.7 years; mean difference
    between tillage depth of control and deep tillage 31 cm).


    2. Observations of long-term deep tillage effects mostly derived from studies
    without continuous yield records and field trials, which might only have been
    rediscovered and systematically studied because preceding visual observations
    were “promising”, i.e. indicated more vigorous growth on the formerly deep-tilled
    plots.


    3. The dataset mostly comprised observations from temperate latitudes (Fig. 2).
    In subtropical and tropical latitudes, higher solar radiation might compromise
    the usefulness of WaterQuantity and WaterIntensity as rough proxies for drought
    intensity because of considerably higher evapotranspiration rates.'
  relevance_evaluation: Overall, this systematic review and meta-analysis provides
    a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential
    of real-time, automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide
    future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous,
    scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food

  data_sources: Data on soil moisture tension, groundwater dynamics, crop growth and

  explanation: The study examines the effects of varying water management (alternate
    wetting and drying, or AWD) irrigation thresholds and rice plant seedling age
    on crop performance, water input, and water productivity of transplanted rice
    in Central Luzon, Philippines. The study uses a split-plot design with water regime
    as the main plot and seedling age as the subplot. Data on soil moisture tension,
    groundwater dynamics, crop growth and development, grain yield, yield components,
    harvest index, water input, and water productivity were collected. The study found
    that implementing AWD at different threshold levels (irrigation when the perched
    water table drops to 15, 25, or 30 cm below the soil surface) can significantly
    reduce water input without yield loss, compared to continuous flooding. However,
    there were no significant differences in water input among the different AWD treatments.
    Using older (30-day-old) seedlings reduced water input due to shorter crop growth
    duration in the main field, but this came at the expense of yield. Overall, the
    study suggests that there is scope to further increase water savings and water
    productivity of irrigated lowland rice fields in Central Luzon, Philippines, by
    lowering the threshold level of safe AWD or by using older seedlings, although
    the latter may result in some yield penalty.

  data_sources: Field observations, measurements, and data analysis
  explanation: This study focuses on the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and
    its potential to improve irrigated rice cultivation. SRI is an approach that combines
    intermittent irrigation, younger seedlings, and wider spacing to enhance water
    productivity and yield. The study was conducted in Chiba, Japan, during the rice
    season of 2008 using a split-split plot design. Eight treatment combinations were
    tested, with two irrigation regimes (continuous flooding and alternate wet and
    dry irrigation with 10-day intervals), two seedling ages (14 and 21 days), and
    two spacing arrangements (30 × 30 cm2 and 30 × 18 cm2). The study aimed to evaluate
    the effects of these SRI components on rice crop performance, water savings, and
    water productivity.
  extract_1: '"The experiment results revealed that the proposed AWDI can save a significant
    amount of irrigation water (28%) without reduced grain yield (7.4 t/h compared
    with 7.37 t/h from normal planting with ordinary water management)."'
  extract_2: '"Water productivity was observed to be significantly higher in all combinations
    of practices in the intermittent irrigation plots: 1.74 g/l with SRI management
    and AWDI as compared to 1.23 g/l from normal planting methods with ordinary water
    management."'
  inline_citation: (Chapagain & Yamaji, 2010)
  key_findings: '1) Intermittent irrigation (AWDI) can save a significant amount of
    irrigation water without reducing grain yield.

    2) Water productivity is significantly higher in intermittent irrigation plots
    with SRI management practices.

    3) Younger seedlings and wider spacing contribute to increased tillering ability,

    types of data collected and their typical sources in the context of irrigation
    management, particularly in the context of automating data collection and real-time
    processing. The study demonstrates the importance of collecting data on various
    aspects of the rice crop, such as plant height, tiller number, and yield, to assess
    the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies and seedling management practices.
    This information can be used to optimize irrigation schedules and improve rice

    IWR."
  limitations: This study focuses on the use of Sentinel-2 data for estimating evapotranspiration
    and irrigation requirements in tomato crops, but it does not evaluate the performance
    of other remote sensing data sources or models for this purpose. The study is
    limited to a single growing season and a single field, so the results may not

  explanation: This study by Cavero et al. (2000) compared two crop growth simulation
    models, EPICphase and CROPWAT, in their ability to evaluate maize yield reduction
    caused by water stress under different experimental conditions.
  extract_1: EPICphase is a modification of the extensively tested EPIC model (Beckie
    et al., 1995; Bryant et al., 1992; Cabelguenne et al., 1990; Cavero et al., 1999a;
    Kiniry et al., 1992a), especially improved for water and N stress modeling. EPICphase
    does not use crop coefficients to calculate crop PET. The ET component of this
    model is Ritchie's model (Ritchie, 1972).
  extract_2: CROPWAT (Smith, 1992) is the best known among the latter. In this model,
    crop potential evapotranspiration (PET) is calculated using the crop coefficient
    concept (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977). The effect of water stress on crop yield
    is considered by using the crop response factors (Stewart et al., 1975) that have
    been derived from different experiments (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
  inline_citation: (Cavero et al., 2000)
  key_findings: '1. EPICphase simulated maize grain yield with a RMSE of 40 mm, while
    CROPWAT overestimated ET in the flood-irrigated treatments.

    2. EPICphase adequately addressed the effect of water stress on maize yield reduction,

    due to overestimation of LAI.

    3. Modifications to EPICphase to account for the effect of water stress on LAI
    growth and the light extinction coefficient improved the simulations of LAI, biomass,
    HI, and yield reduction.

    4. CROPWAT calculated maize grain yield with a RMSE of 14% but overestimated ET,
    especially in the flood-irrigated experiments.'
  limitations: The study focuses on maize as the crop of interest, so its findings
    may not be directly applicable to other crops with different water use patterns
    or stress responses.
  main_objective: To evaluate and compare the EPICphase and CROPWAT models in their
    ability to simulate maize yield reduction caused by water stress under different
    types of water stress (continuous or at given development stages).
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is relevant to the point of identifying appropriate
    types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources,
    as it investigates the use of both EPICphase and CROPWAT models for simulating
    maize yield reduction under water stress. The authors specifically utilized data
    from three field experiments to test the models, including soil water measurements,
    meteorological data, and crop phenology observations. This study's focus on data

    rotation. Soil Science Society of America Journal, 75(4), 1220-1231.
  data_sources: Field experiment data collected over seven consecutive years
  explanation: 'This study assessed the medium-term impact of six tillage methods
    and two rice establishment methods on rice and wheat productivity, water use,
    water productivity, and economic benefits in a rice-wheat rotation system. The
    treatments were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replications
    over seven years. Key findings include:


    * Conventional puddling and transplanting of rice with continuous flooding or
    mid-season alternate wetting and drying gave the highest rice productivity (7.81–8.10
    Mg ha−1).


    * The highest wheat productivity (5.37 Mg ha−1) was obtained with zero-tillage,
    which was followed by zero-tillage direct drill-seeded rice (T5).


    * Rice had substantial yield loss with declining trends when planted on the raised
    beds.


    * Due to differential yield responses of two cereals in rotation with tillage
    and CE methods, the system (rice–wheat) productivity average was similar with
    conventional (T1, T2) and zero-tillage practices (T5, T6).


    * In overall performance parameters (grain yield, water productivity, irrigation
    water use, and benefit/cost), conventional practice with mid-season wetting drying
    (T2) was the best.


    * Zero-tillage with drill-seeding both in rice and wheat (T5) was equal to that
    of T1 in system productivity and benefit/cost.


    The authors concluded that conventional practice with mid-season wetting drying
    (T2) is the most robust, but that zero-tillage with drill-seeding both in rice
    and wheat (T5) is a profitable alternative with potential for long-term sustainability
    due to gradual improvement in soil quality.'
  extract_1: In the rice–wheat rotation, which occupies about 18 million hectares
    in South Asia and China, farmers grow at least one rice and wheat crop on the
    same piece of land each year. In South Asia, the rice–wheat region occupies nearly
    13.5 million hectares across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of Bangladesh, India,
    Nepal, and Pakistan. This region alone is home to 1.6 billion people, nearly 40%
    of whom live in extreme poverty (FAO, 2010). Over the past 30 yr, the rice–wheat
    system has emerged as the region's major production system, accounting for more
    than 30% of the total rice area and 40% of the total wheat area, and producing
    nearly one-third of the region's rice and more than half of its wheat.

    a large amount of labor and water, resulting in a rise in the cost of cultivation

    * Canopy temperature indirectly measures water deﬁcit. The canopy temperature-based
    indices are useful for parameterizing models that estimate the relationships between
    water deﬁcit, stomatal conductance and yield.

    * Stem water potential is an indicator of how hard a plant is pumping to move
    water up from the soil (and across the roots, up to the canopy) as a response
    to the atmospheric demand for water. It is the most commonly used indicator when
    the focus is on optimizing the timing and amount of water supplied through irrigation
    systems.

    * The use of stem water potential measurements is high in wine grapes, as growers
    are interested in maintaining speciﬁc levels of stress after veraison in order
    to maintain the quality (M. Cooper, personal communication). Larger California
    vineyards have ‘pressure bomb teams’ to constantly test stem water potential throughout
    the vineyards during the key time periods. Although there are disease management
    beneﬁts to maintaining stress at hull split, nut growers have still been slow
    to adopt the pressure chambers to measure stem water potential, with adoption

  inline_citation: null
  key_findings:
  - The water demand of rice varies greatly in different rainfall years.
  - The utilization of irrigation water and the amount of water required for rice
    cultivation are clearly incompatible.
  - In several Asian countries and other parts of the world, rice water utilization
    under flooded irrigation is widely recorded.
  - More rainfall resulted in decreased irrigation when the rice water demand was
    calculated.
  main_objective: To evaluate the potential and limitations of evapotranspiration
    rate-based WF calculation by estimating crop WFs for possible water planning in
    water-scarce areas.
  relevance_evaluation:
    extract_1: The management of rice fields involves considerably more water, and
      calculating water demand is more complicated than it is for other crops. Therefore,
      there are fewer evapotranspiration studies that calculate rice water needs.
    extract_2: Evapotranspiration, on the other hand, has not only a skewed regional
      distribution, but also yearly and inter-annual variability. Hence, irrigation
      should be adjusted based on the year's rainfall.

    Applied Water Science, 13(168), 1-19.
  explanation: The study found that the MODIS potential evapotranspiration algorithm
    could be used to estimate reference evapotranspiration in the study area. The
    authors compared the MODIS-based reference evapotranspiration with the Penman-Monteith
    method at two meteorological stations in the region and found a good correlation
    between them. However, they also found that the MODIS-based reference evapotranspiration
    was slightly overestimated compared to the Penman-Monteith method. This paper
    is relevant to my review because it focuses on the same area (Koga, Ethiopia),
    and the same type of crop (wheat), and uses similar data sources (MODIS and meteorological
    data) as the paper I am reviewing.
  extract_1: The calibration constants in Table 2 were obtained from the regression
    equations of each of the trend lines in Fig. 4. The average of the 8-day regression
    constants (i.e., 0.27 for a and 1.99 for b) was taken to map the calibrated MODIS
    reference evapotranspiration for further estimation of crop evapotranspiration
    in the Koga irrigation scheme.
  extract_2: The comparison between the MODIS-Sentinel 2B derived wheat crop evapotranspiration,
    direct MODIS ETc observation, and WaPOR is presented in Table 7 and Fig. 9. The
    disparity in variance between data sets was checked and the result showed equal
    variance. A two-tailed, t-test assuming equal variances with a 5% significance
    level was used to examine the significant difference between the MODIS-based calibrated
    crop evapotranspiration and the direct remotely sensed crop evapotranspiration
    (WaPOR ETc and MODIS ETc) of the wheat crop (Table 6). The result showed that
    there is a significant difference (p = 0.0006) between the calibrated MODIS-Sentinel
    2B ETc and the direct MODIS ETc observation. Similarly, we found a significant
    difference (p = 0.013) between the calibrated MODIS-Sentinel 2B ETc and the WaPOR
    ETc observation.

    which may not be representative of the entire study area. While the authors found
    a good correlation between MODIS-based and Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration,
    it is possible that this correlation may vary in other parts of the study area,
    and across different seasons. The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations

  data_sources: The study utilized remote sensing data from Landsat-7, Landsat-8,
    and Landsat-9 satellites to extract LULC information for Lahore city.
  explanation: Zafar and colleagues conducted a systematic review and analysis of
    how automated irrigation management systems that employ Internet of Things (IoT)
    and machine learning techniques can help in the efficient use of water resources.
    One of the specific topics examined in the analysis was determining the most relevant
    types of data for irrigation management, along with their conventional sources.
  extract_1: The rapid increase in population accelerates the rate of change of Land
    use/Land cover (LULC) in various parts of the world. This phenomenon caused a
    huge strain for natural resources. Hence, continues monitoring of LULC changes
    gained a significant importance for management of natural resources and assessing
    the climate change impacts. Recently, application of machine learning algorithms
    on RS (remote sensing) data for rapid and accurate mapping of LULC gained significant
    importance due to growing need of LULC estimation for ecosystem services, natural
    resource management and environmental management. Hence, it is crucial to access
    and compare the performance of different machine learning classifiers for accurate
    mapping of LULC.
  extract_2: According to the best performing algorithm (RF), urban Land area of Lahore
    city increased by 34.9% in last fifteen years. In case of LULC classifications
    various studies found different results based on selected satellite, study area
    and selected algorithms. Furthermore, studies also suggested that different classifiers
    performed differently in different climatic zones and geographical locations.
    Hence, future researchers should try to explore LULC by using high resolution
    imagery, more detailed classes, field gathered input data and adopting variety
    of sophisticated and modern machine learning algorithms designed for LULC classification.

    terms of overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for all three image datasets,
    demonstrating its suitability for LULC classification in unplanned cities like
    Lahore. The study also revealed that vegetation cover experienced the greatest
    decline, whereas urban land area increased steadily from 2008 to 2022.

  extract_1: In the realm of aquaculture, AI facilitates the analysis of data derived
    from sensors and cameras to monitor fish behaviour, detect signs of disease or
    stress, employ automatic sensors for measuring fish length and weight, and optimize
    feeding regimes (Barreto et al., 2022, Føre et al., 2018, Tonachella et al., 2022).
    By analyzing this data using AI algorithms, researchers can develop predictive
    models that can identify the early signs of disease or stress in fish (Gladju

    Abstract

    The current era witnesses the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a transformative
    force giving rise to various technological innovations, most notably connected
    objects. This paradigm shift catalyzes the widespread adoption of autonomous decision-making
    systems, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where the aim is to amplify
    productivity. As a result of the agricultural domain, mushrooms have concurrently
    emerged as a significant component of daily diets, offering additional vitamins
    and flavor. Despite their popularity, cultivating mushrooms in open environments
    poses challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions, prompting numerous
    research efforts.

    Recognizing the inconsistencies in existing approaches to safeguard vital parameters
    in mushroom farms, this paper introduces an innovative system utilizing intelligent
    sensors whose real-time records are managed based on the fuzzy sets concept. These
    sensors, encompassing the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2, DHT22 Sensor,
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR sensor), and Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR sensor),
    collectively capture essential data for decision-making in mushroom farming. Employing
    fuzzy logic, the system addresses pivotal aspects such as substrate watering,
    environmental control, light management, and pest detection. Through experimental
    results, it becomes evident that the proposed system not only exemplifies the
    potential of IoT technologies in agriculture but also offers a comprehensive and
    efficient approach to real-time decision-making.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture poses a significant concern for humanity, as it is the primary source
    of food production. Many individuals suffer from hunger due to food scarcity,
    particularly in Third-world countries [22]. Food scarcity has been associated
    with socioeconomic elements like the expanding population [48]. Over the last
    five decades, the global population has risen by 3–6 billion, intensifying the
    demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger led to the chronic malnourishment
    of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016. Furthermore, more than 10 million
    individuals perish annually due to starvation [14]. Therefore, increasing food
    production is crucial in eradicating hunger and poverty. However, the reality
    is far from simple; agriculture remains largely unmodernized in many countries,
    leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity, there is a requirement
    for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing farming methods beyond
    conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production yields qualitatively.'

  limitations: It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent's presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm.

  explanation: The paper describes the procedures used for coupling and evaluating
    the DSSAT soil water simulation model and the HYDRUS-1D physical, hydrological
    model. The evaluation compared the output of the original and coupled models to
    determine if the coupled model simulated crop yield components, evapotranspiration
    rates, and soil water balance more accurately than the original model when applied
    to water-limiting conditions. The coupled model was found to simulate crop yield,
    biomass, and evapotranspiration less accurately than the original model under
    drought conditions. The experiment noted that implementing changes to the HYDRUS
    model using datasets that include soil texture, root length distribution data,
    and potential ET partitioning, may improve the accuracy and reliability of the

- explanation: 'Irrigation scheduling aims to prevent excessive water consumption
    and optimize crop yields by supplying the right amount of water at the right time.
    Different factors influence irrigation scheduling, including crop type, weather
    conditions, soil characteristics, irrigation system design, energy availability,
    and economic considerations.


    Among the most important factors is crop type, as different crops have varying
    water requirements and susceptibilities to water stress. Accurate estimation of
    crop water requirements is crucial for optimizing irrigation schedules and ensuring
    adequate water supply throughout the growing season.


    Weather conditions, particularly rainfall and temperature, play a significant
    role in determining irrigation needs. Rainfall patterns and amounts can significantly
    impact the irrigation schedule, as they provide natural water inputs and reduce
    the need for artificial irrigation. Temperature affects crop water requirements
    through evapotranspiration, which is the combined process of evaporation from
    the soil surface and transpiration from plant leaves.


    Soil characteristics, such as texture, structure, and depth, influence water storage
    capacity and drainage. Sandy soils, with their low water-holding capacity, require
    more frequent irrigation than clay soils, which can retain water for longer periods.
    Soil structure and depth affect root development and water uptake by plants.


    The design of the irrigation system, including the type of system (drip, sprinkler,
    flood) and its efficiency, affects irrigation scheduling. Different irrigation
    systems have varying application rates and uniformities, influencing the amount
    of water delivered to the crop and the potential for water losses.


    Energy availability and costs are important considerations, especially in areas
    where irrigation relies on pumping groundwater or using pressurized irrigation
    systems. The energy required for irrigation can be a significant expense, and
    irrigation scheduling should aim to minimize energy consumption while meeting
    crop water needs.


    Economic considerations, such as water costs and crop prices, influence irrigation
    scheduling decisions. Farmers must balance the cost of water with the potential
    benefits of increased crop yields and quality. In areas with limited water resources
    or high water prices, farmers may need to adopt deficit irrigation strategies
    to optimize water use and reduce costs.


    In summary, irrigation scheduling involves considering multiple factors to determine
    the optimal timing, amount, and duration of irrigation. Understanding these factors
    and their interactions is essential for developing effective irrigation schedules
    that maximize crop yields, minimize water consumption, and ensure sustainable
    water use in agricultural production.'

  limitations: 'The presented study offers a promising approach for addressing land
    subsidence susceptibility mapping using ANFIS and PSO. However, there are some

    1. The study relies on remote sensing data and historical records, which may be
    limited in accuracy and representativeness, especially in areas with complex geological
    conditions or data scarcity.

    2. The selection of input parameters is critical for the model''s performance.
    While the study includes a wide range of factors, there may be additional relevant
    factors not considered that could influence the model''s accuracy.

    3. The study does not consider the temporal variations in subsidence susceptibility.
    Land subsidence is a dynamic process, and its susceptibility may change over time
    due to factors such as changes in groundwater levels, land use, and climate conditions.
    Therefore, the model should be updated and refined periodically to reflect these
    changes.

    4. The study does not include a detailed uncertainty analysis. Uncertainty is
    inherent in land subsidence susceptibility mapping due to factors such as data
    limitations, model assumptions, and natural variability. A comprehensive uncertainty

  explanation: 'The paper entitled "<ins>Delineation of Groundwater Potential Zones
    and Its Extent of Contamination from the Hard Rock Aquifers in West-Bengal, India</ins>"
    examines the potential areas for groundwater resource exploitation and the extent
    of groundwater contamination (with a focus on fluoride) in the hard rock aquifers
    in the Purulia district of West Bengal, India. The research employs multiple data
    sources, including satellite images, soil maps, lithological maps, rainfall data,
    and groundwater samples, to develop a comprehensive understanding of the groundwater
    resources and quality in the region.


    The authors utilized the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to integrate eight
    thematic maps derived from remote sensing data. This method assigns weights to
    each thematic layer based on its relative importance in determining groundwater
    potential. The resulting Groundwater Potential Zones (GWPZ) map identifies areas
    with high, moderate, low, and very low groundwater potential. The study also assesses
    groundwater contamination using hydrogeochemical analysis of groundwater samples
    collected from 60 tube wells and dug wells. The analysis evaluates fluoride concentration,
    which is a significant health concern in the region.


    The results indicate that the majority of the area falls under moderate potential
    zones for groundwater extraction, with a significant portion also categorized
    as low potential zones. The study identifies areas with high fluoride concentration,
    particularly in the northeastern part of the study area, posing potential health
    risks to the local population. The authors highlight the need for implementing
    measures to mitigate groundwater contamination and ensure the availability of
    safe drinking water in the region.


    The relevance of this work extends beyond the study area, as it provides a valuable
    framework for assessing groundwater resources and contamination in hard rock aquifers.
    The methodology employed in this study can be replicated in other regions with
    similar geological and hydrological conditions, aiding in the sustainable management
    of groundwater resources.'

- explanation: A systematic review was conducted to collect experimental yield data
    for alfalfa, almonds, grapes, and tomatoes. The criteria for selecting the studies
    were irrigation water salinity, crop yield, soil type, and weather data. The review
    considered 996 articles, 15 were selected after screening and full-text assessment.
    The model's performance in predicting crop yield was assessed by comparing the
    predicted and observed yields using R2 and RMSE (Eq. 6 and 7). The model's prediction
    for yield was excellent and within acceptable limits for the four crops (Figure
    5). Overall, the model performed well in predicting yield, with an R2 of 0.82
    and an RMSE of 0.64.

    potential sites for rainwater harvesting structures. Physics and Chemistry of
    the Earth, 134, 103574.
  explanation: 'The potential of an area for rainwater harvesting is highly suitable:


    * If it receives plenty of rainfall.


    * It possesses a gentle slope to prevent excessive runoff.


    * It has permeable uppermost layers (soils) and impermeable layers (geological
    formations) below them that can store water.


    * It has suitable soil texture for rainwater infiltration and storage.'
  extract_1: Rainwater harvesting is taking one of the innovative, profitable, and
    environmentally advantageous for the availability and accessibility of water while
    also lowering the threat of flash floods and resolving the issue of groundwater
    exploitation.
  extract_2: The present research used rainfall, slope, lithology, Lineament, soil
    texture, drainage network, and LULC as input parameters in the GIS-based AHP and
    WOE method.
  inline_citation: (Du et al., 2024)
  limitations: 'a. This study''s diverse satellite and field data are obtained from
    satellites provided by multiple agencies and departments. Nevertheless, the majority
    of this map is highly prevalent in rural areas. The highest disparity in these
    variables can be observed locally or on a small scale. As a result of this problem,
    the groundwater potential maps generated could have been more accurate at the
    same local scale.

    b. AHP is a practical method in which the prioritization of criteria is determined
    based on expertise. Despite the high accuracy demonstrated by this research, it
    is possible to generate a more comprehensive map by rearranging the rankings in
    a unidirectional manner.

    c. The accuracy of MIF and AHP findings is confirmed by comparing them with water
    level data. However, it should be noted that groundwater levels vary from region
    to region. On the other hand, the ROC plot has provided more accurate results
    at local, international, and national levels.

    d. The sustainable planning and development of groundwater have been formulated
    based on the results of the AHP. However, implementing planning for soil and water
    conservation structures in the field poses a significant challenge.

    e. This inquiry focuses only on AHP, MIF, and RS techniques to assess potential
    groundwater zones and create comprehensive planning maps. Nevertheless, ground
    survey-based geophysical methodologies are highly advantageous for conducting
    precise and dangerous comprehensive valuations.'
  relevance_evaluation: Highly relevant. It accurately describes the key factors that
    contribute to an area's potential for rainwater harvesting.

  data_sources:
  - Survey data
  explanation: The paper investigates the effect on grain yield in rice and wheat,
    using different nitrogen management strategies (LCC-based vs recommended), with
    three varieties of rice (Basmati-370, Saket-4, Hybrid 6111/PHB-71) and three varieties
    of wheat (PBW-343, HD-2687, PBW-226). The study looked across multiple years,
    soil conditions, and rice-wheat system combinations to conclude that synchronising
    nitrogen supply with crop demand through the use of the leaf color chart (LCC)
    is a useful tool for optimizing yields without compromising nitrogen use efficiency.
  extract_1: The LCC-based N management assures high yields consistent with efficient
    N use in both rice and wheat and enhances rice–wheat systems’ total productivity
    and farmer’s profit. The LCC is a simple and easy-to-use tool that can help farmers
    manage N judiciously.
  extract_2: Future studies can compare the efficiency, labor use, cost, and profit
    of improved fixed-time spilt [sic] N strategies derived from this and other studies
    and the LCC-based real-time N management in rice and wheat.
  inline_citation: (Singh et al., 2004)
  key_findings:
  - LCC-based N management can optimize grain yield and N use efficiency in rice and
    wheat cropping systems.
  - LCC-based N management can increase net returns compared to traditional fixed-time
    N application strategies.
  - The LCC is a simple and easy-to-use tool that can help farmers manage N judiciously.
  limitations:
  - Study location was limited to a single region in India and may not be generalizable
    to other regions with different soil types, climate, or farming practices.
  - The study did not investigate the long-term effects of LCC-based N management
    on soil health or other environmental factors.
  - The study did not evaluate the economic implications of implementing LCC-based
    N management at a larger scale.
  main_objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of LCC-based N management in optimizing
    grain yield and N use efficiency in rice and wheat cropping systems.

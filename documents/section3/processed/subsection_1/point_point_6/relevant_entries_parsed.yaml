- explanation: 'In the paper, the specific provisions of the Kappa architecture are
    presented like it simplifies the Lambda architecture by combining the real-time
    and batch layers. The Kappa architecture is compared to the Lambda architecture:
    although it is simpler to implement and efficient for real-time processing, it
    is less appropriated for use cases where high accuracy in the processing of large
    batch size is required.'
  extract_1: Kappa architecture, proposed by Jay Kreps from LinkedIn (Kreps, 2014),
    simplifies the Lambda architecture by combining real-time and batch layers. This
    cloud architecture differs from the Lambda architecture by using a non-permanent
    storage system of data in an unchangeable log file such as system as Apache Spark
    or Apache Kafka, and consequently allow only storage for a limited time in order
    to allow an eventual reprocessing of these data.
  extract_2: 'Batch and Speed Layers are also replaced by a stream processing engine.
    So, the Kappa Architecture is composed of two layers: streaming and serving layers
    and can be implemented with a publish-subscribe messaging like Apache Kafka, which
    facilitates data ingestion.'

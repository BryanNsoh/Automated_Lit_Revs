    \ farm-workers from travel to their farms, social distancing and lockdown\nto\
    \ prevent them from getting infected. Consequently, farming and irrigation activities\
    \ are dramatically reduced due to\nshortage of farm-workers and reduction of crops\
    \ production. To find solutions, various technologies have been adopted\nto remotely\
    \ connect farmers with their farm-fields from their homes and perform the same\
    \ work as they are in the farm.\nAn Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern\
    \ sensor technologies, and smart irrigation equipment are coupled to allow\nthe\
    \ collection of the field data for automatic irrigation of the field. This paper\
    \ presents the IoT system based on Fuzzy\nlogic controller that assists farmers\
    \ to receive and monitor necessary irrigation data from the farm field through\
    \ their smart\nphones and PCs. The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are deployed\
    \ in the field to measure the water content in the soil\nand water used for plants\
    \ by measuring the soil moisture dynamics throughout the entire duration of the\
    \ crop growing sea-\nson in the Maize crop farm. The Fuzzy logic controller was\
    \ used for data analytics and intelligent decision making as well\nas Fuzzy logic\

    \ 50% of water and energy\nconsumption for irrigation, 80% reduction of farm-workers\

    \ to the population welfare as it\nprovides the food, employment and raises the\
    \ national econ-\nomy; In Rwanda, about 96% of its population living in rural\n\
    areas depends mainly on agriculture for their income and it\nis almost impossible\
    \ to survive without this sector. However,\nthe climate change, the irregular\
    \ precipitation and long dry\nseason are negatively affecting the quantity and\
    \ quality of crop\nproduction and results in agriculture production crisis in\
    \ the\nregion. Each agricultural crop has its weather requirements for\ngrowing,\
    \ that’s why the farmers wisely select the right season\nwhen to sow on the basis\
    \ of weather condition (Zhu et al.,\n2020; Patil et al., 2019). Therefore, in\
    \ order to achieve a high\nquantity and quality of crop production by balancing\
    \ weather\ncondition, irrigation is essential.\nThe method used in irrigation\
    \ involves building canals\nwhich supply uniformly water from water resources\
    \ or use of\nwater pumps for spraying water evenly in the field. Never-\ntheless,\
    \ the scarcity of water resources has been a problem that\nimpacts the agriculture\
    \ development. Therefore, A convenient\nirrigation system shall make the agricultural\
    \ process more\neffective (Patil et al., 2019). However, not only the currently\n\
    used methods of irrigation consume more water than what\nplants need, but also\
    \ require farmers to manually and con-\nstantly operate water valves or water\
    \ pumps in case of absence\nor excess of water in the field. In addition, COVID-19\
    \ pan-\ndemic as the biggest health crisis in this decade, due to its\npreventive\
    \ measures taken by different organ around the world\nwhich restrict the people\
    \ to stay at home (lockdown) and\nsocial distancing have severely affected agricultural\
    \ activities\n(Filtjens, n.d.; GSMA, 2021). Therefore, the introduction of\nICT\
    \ in agriculture has emerged as the effective and sustainable\nsolution to improve\
    \ irrigation systems.\nThe emergence and rapid development of IoTs and Big Data\n\
    Analytics presents interesting solutions to the above problem.\n(Badrun and Manaf,\
    \ 2021; Salvi et al., 2017). In this context,\nan IoT system can connect multiple\

    \ based controller. These nodes in turn collect and trans-\nmit real-time data\
    \ from their surroundings to the controller.\nThis information can be either used\

    \ by pre-\ndictive and adaptive algorithms to execute operational\nresponses such\
    \ automate irrigation scheduler (Gautam and\nSen, 2015; Jamroen et al., 2020).\n\
    The use of Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low Energy\nConsumption overcomes\
    \ the above mentioned problems with\nAn Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern\
    \ sensor tech-\nnologies, and smart irrigation equipment are combined to per-\n\

    \ . This study presents the IoT based irrigation sys-\ntem using Fuzzy logic controller\
    \ that assists farmers to receive\nand monitor the field parameters such as soil\
    \ moisture, and\ntemperature as well as remotely controlling irrigation system\n\
    installed in the farm field through their smart phones and PCs.\nRelated works\n\
    This section presents the cutting-edge studies for currently\navailable related\
    \ solutions. First, threatenings to farmers due\nto COVID-19 pandemic are evaluated\
    \ followed by IoT tech-\nnologies for irrigation and finally the applications\
    \ of Fuzzy\nlogic in agriculture are presented.\n1. Threatening to farmers due\
    \ to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThreatening to farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ has\nexacerbated, especially in developing countries. in Rwanda,\nbig number\
    \ of the citizen are employed in farming activities\nwhere the report shows that\
    \ in 2019 in Rwanda, 64% of the\npopulation was hired in this agriculture sector\
    \ (MINAGRI,\n2020). Since outbreak of COVID-19, one among the effective\nmeasures\
    \ to control the spread of the pandemic was to enforce\nthe citizen to stay-at-home\
    \ (4.I. Workshop: Health systems\nresilience during COVID-19: Lessons for building\
    \ back better,\n2021; Tripathi et al., 2021). The agriculture also was one\namong\
    \ sectors affected by these COVID-19 prevention mea-\nsures. One among affected\
    \ farming parts was irrigation where\nfarmers were restricted to go to irrigate\
    \ their fields and had\nto depend again on rain season only which reduced dramat-\n\
    ically their production (Boughton et al., 2021; Selim and\nEltarabily, 2022).\
    \ nevertheless the IoT was introduced and\nbeing used in agriculture sector, challenges\
    \ of COVID-19 pan-\ndemic have proved that the digital agriculture need to be\
    \ accel-\nerated, where smart irrigation systems are needed for\nautonomous irrigation\
    \ and assisting farmers in remote mon-\nitoring and tracking forming activities\
    \ (GSMA, 2021; Nyakuri\net al., 2022).\n2. IoT connectivity technologies for irrigation\n\
    Wi-Fi connectivity is a widely used wireless communication\ntechnique. Many agricultural\
    \ monitoring systems, such as the\none presented in (Mendez et al., 2012) by Gerard\
    \ Rudolph et\nal and (Hasan et al., 2021), employ Wi-Fi to communicate\namongst\
    \ the various agents of their designs. They demon-\nstrated a Wi-Fi wireless sensor\
    \ network for farm monitoring,\nwith nodes collecting data on temperature, humidity,\
    \ light, soil\nmoisture, and water level. The data was also sent to a server\n\
    so that it could be viewed later. As a result, researching MiFi\ncoverage in various\
    \ agricultural settings is of tremendous\ninterest. In (Mendez et al., 2012; Li\
    \ et al., 2020), Muhammad\nA. et al. reported a method for estimating the location\
    \ of wire-\nless nodes based on signal intensity. The IEEE 802.11 b/g\nstandard\
    \ was used and the locations included urban regions,\nrural areas, woodlands,\
    \ and plantations. However, Wi-Fi\nrequires more internet infrastructure when\
    \ deployed in remote\narea. \nCellular system employs GSM/GPRS standard for data\n\
    communication between field sensor node and the cloud\nserver for data storage\
    \ and further analysis. Additionally, the\nAndroid app is being developed to track\
    \ the system's current\nstate instantly (Science, 2018). In (Munir et al., 2021;\
    \ Yang\net al., 2021), the GSM module was used to connect an IoT\ncloud server\
    \ to a network of sensors, analyzes the data at the\nedge server, transfers only\
    \ a subset of the data to the main\nIoT cloud server to predict the amount of\
    \ water that a field\nof crops will need, and uses an edge Android application\
    \ to\ndisplay the outcome. The IoT devices communicate with cel-\nlular networks\
    \ by using second generation (2G), third gen-\neration (3G), fourth generation\
    \ (4G) and GPRS standards due\nto its relatively long-range wireless communication\
    \ and its\nrobust communication links (Khattab et al., 2019; Science,\n2018).\n\
    Bluetooth Low Energy enabled technology allows IoT\ndevices in irrigation system\
    \ to communicate effectively with\nminimized cost and energy consumption but within\
    \ a short\nNyakuri Jean Pierre et al.\nThis journal is ⓒ Academic Society for\

    \ variable rate irrigation systems with Bluetooth tech-\nnology. The application\
    \ in this article requires plug-and-play\ncompatibility to serial devices with\
    \ affordable wireless com-\nmunication modules in order to accommodate existing\
    \ data\nloggers and sensors. For wireless data transmission between\nin-field\
    \ sensor stations and a base station, the Bluetooth mod-\nule was chosen (Ilapakurti\
    \ and Vuppalapati, 2015) and (Hasan\net al., 2021) used the Bluetooth low energy\
    \ framework to sen-\nsor sensor nodes. Their choice for using Bluetooth low energy,\n\
    also known as Bluetooth Smart, was to maintain a same com-\nmunication range as\
    \ Wi-Fi but using significantly less power\nand cost. When compared to other previous\
    \ stated technol-\nogies used in irrigation, system design optimization, trans-\n\
    mission energy, cost and security can be achieved by improved\nwith the only limitation\
    \ of the device communication range.\n3. Fuzzy logic for Data Management and Analytics\
    \ for\nIrrigation Optimization\nFuzzy logic system determines degree of truth\
    \ for right deci-\nsion making to the problem as that of human perception and\n\
    reasoning can make. Fuzzy logic algorithms are robust and\nadapt easily to the\
    \ changing environments (Jane and Ganesh,\n2019; Pezol et al., 2020) in (Phogat\
    \ et al., 2021) an irrigation\nsystem based on ANN and Fuzzy Logic was developed.\
    \ Soil\nmoisture dynamics, precipitation, evapotranspiration for wheat\ncrop were\
    \ considered. And the results of Fuzzy logic was\nfound suitable with 89% better\
    \ performance due to better deci-\nsion making the lower implementation cost.\
    \ An intelligent\nautomatic control system was developed in (Shongwe, 2022)\n\
    and (Jamroen et al., 2020) using the fuzzy logic controller to\nenable smart irrigation\
    \ based on environmental factors such\nas soil moisture variation, soil Ph, solar\
    \ irradiation, air tem-\nperature, and air humidity. The system showed water and\n\
    energy usage efficiency relatively to the optimal growth of the\nplant.\nAfter\
    \ observing irrigation challenges faced by formers\nduring COVID-19 pandemic and\
    \ reduction of their production\ndue to those challenges, based on the necessity\
    \ of digitali-\nzation in irrigation system and gaps identified in different\n\
    researches, the Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low\nEnergy Consumption was\
    \ developed. It works by deploying\nsensor nodes in the field so that irrigation\
    \ can be done based\non water requirements by the plants to reduce water wastage\n\
    from irrigating unneeded location and assisting farmers in irri-\ngation activities\
    \ using smart device.\nFigure 1. Wireless sensor network architecture of the system.\n\

    \ Technology 2023\nSystem design \n1. System architecture\nThe proposed system\
    \ is illustrated in the Figure 1 and is\ndesigned for semi-automatic irrigation\
    \ system. The sensor\nnodes are deployed in the field and work in WSN mode at\n\
    the edge of the network and consist of sensors, Microcon-\ntroller and ZigBee\
    \ technology and gather all necessary field\ndata to a single gateway. The gateway\
    \ gathers all data sends\ndata to the cloud platform for further analysis. The\
    \ water for\nirrigation came from AKAGERA River and stored in the\nwater reservoir\
    \ where it is pumped to the field by the solar-\npowered pump when it is needed\
    \ by any sensor node in the\nfield. For any sensor node, if the water content\
    \ in the soil get\nbelow the threshold value, the irrigation is done either auto-\n\
    matically or by the farmer according to the weather fore-\ncasting.The field data\
    \ is sent to the cloud platform through the\ngateway using SGM system. The cloud\
    \ plat form receives big\ndata from the field and weather forecasting, analyses\
    \ it, take\ndecision and sent notification to the farmer through smart\nphone\
    \ and PC. The farmer accesses to all field information\nand can operate the irrigation\
    \ system from home (whether to\nirrigate or stop irrigation if it is going to\
    \ rain) using his smart\nphone. \n2. Solar powered sensor node\nThe sensor node\
    \ presented in this project collects data from\nthe given section of the field\
    \ (for this case is 2 ha), processes\nit and communicates it to the gateway which\
    \ is the central unit\nof the WSN. It consists of four main units; the sensing\
    \ unit\nthat employs Hobonet TEROS 12 Soil Moisture/Temperature/\nEC Sensor to\
    \ detect the water content and temperature dynam-\nics in the soil, Atmega 328\
    \ microcontroller which is respon-\nsible for processing data from sensors and\
    \ determine the\nirrigation requirements, communication units using Xbee\nmodule\
    \ for transmitting processed data to the gateway and\nfinally the solar panel\
    \ module for powering the whole device.\n3. Wireless sensor network (WSN)\nWSN\
    \ is the distributed sensor nodes structure that allows\nmany sensor nodes to\
    \ communicate each other wirelessly in\nthe network. In this study, the standalone\
    \ sensor node can\ncover area not more than 2 hectares while the field is 12 hect-\n\
    ares; so, the sensor nodes are connected in the WSN structure\nin order to collect\
    \ the entire field information to the central\nunit (The gateway) for further\
    \ processing and communicating\nthe same data to the cloud for further analysis\
    \ and decision\nmaking. The ZigBee technology has been chosen for their low\n\
    power consumption, low cost and easy transmission compared\nto Lora, Wi-Fi and\
    \ GSM technologies.\nFigure 2. Solar powered sensor node.\nFigure 3. Mobile application\

    \ the google play\nstore. Its dashboard show the farm information and soil con-\n\
    dition with notification to the farmer. The soil moisture level,\nsoil electrical\
    \ conductivity, the battery level of each device and\nthe device ID is shown in\
    \ the dashboard.\n5. System flowchart\nSmart crop irrigation operates by using\
    \ microcontroller\nAtmega 328 which starts by scanning soil moisture, soil tem-\n\
    perature, and electrical conductivity of the soil. Those three\nparameters were\
    \ scanned with help of moisture sensor placed\nto in the soil. Therefore, those\
    \ scanned parameters are sent to\nboth cloud and to mobile phone by using GSM.\
    \ When soil\nmoisture becomes less than twenty four percent, then, turn on\nthe\
    \ pump for irrigating the crop. Otherwise pump is off. The\nelectrical conductivity\
    \ of soil turns pump on while it is\nbecomes greater 570 ms/m. \nFuzzy logic controller\
    \ and MATLAB \nsimulation\n1. Fuzzy logic system for decision making\nFuzzy logic\
    \ approach is a machine learning technique for\ndata analytics and intelligent\
    \ decision making for uncertain\nproblems based on the degree of truth. Fuzzy\
    \ logic helps in\nright decision making as that can be made by human per-\nception\
    \ and reasoning based on the environment variation\nrather than convention true\
    \ or false (1 or 0) logic (Arcos-\nAviles et al., 2021). \n2. Fuzzy inference\
    \ system and membership functions\nFor the simulation of the output based on the\
    \ input variation\nthrough the Fuzzy Logic Controller is done in the Fuzzy logic\n\
    Toolbox in MATLAB (Alfin and Sarno, 2018). The output is\nthe speed variation\
    \ of the electrical pump for irrigation that\ndetermines the quantity of water\
    \ to be irrigated according to\nthe soil state. The soil state is determined by\
    \ the soil moisture,\nFigure 4. System flowchart.\nSmart Crops Irrigation System\

    \ grown\nand increase significantly the productivity. The availability of\nsufficient\
    \ sunlight makes renewable enery an additive source\nof free energy for irrigation\
    \ equipment to overcome electrical\nenergy problem in the region.\nConclusion\n\
    This study presents smart irrigation project based on soil\nparameters dynamics\
    \ suitable for Maize crop irrigation. It uses\nsensors to sense variation in moisture\
    \ and temperature in the\nsoil, process them using Raspberry-pi 3 and Fuzzy Inference\n\
    Controller for decision making and gives recommendation\n(notification message)\
    \ to the farmers according to standards\npredetermined through mobile application.\
    \ This system pro-\nvides capabilities for the farmer to monitor their farm irri-\n\
    gation activities anywhere they can be and at any time as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\
    \ prevention measures prevent movement.\nThe results shows that there are significant\
    \ reduction of water\nquantity and energy for irrigation as well as preventing\
    \ the\nCOVID-19 transmission by monitoring the farm activities\nremotely through\
    \ smart phone.\nReferences\n4.I. Workshop: Health systems resilience during COVID-19:\

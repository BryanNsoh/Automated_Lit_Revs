    Get rights and content Abstract A prototype real-time, smart sensor array for
    measuring soil moisture and soil temperature that uses off-the-shelf components
    was developed and evaluated for scheduling irrigation in cotton. The array consists
    of a centrally located receiver connected to a laptop computer and multiple sensor
    nodes installed in the field. The sensor nodes consist of sensors (up to three
    Watermark® soil moisture sensors and up to four thermocouples), a specially designed
    circuit board, and a Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tag which transmits
    data to the receiver. The smart sensor array described here offers real potential
    for reliably monitoring spatially variable soil water status in crop fields. The
    relatively low cost of the system (∼USD 2400 for a 20-sensor node system) allows
    for installation of a dense population of soil moisture sensors that can adequately
    represent the inherent soil variability present in fields. This paper describes
    the smart sensor array and testing in a cotton crop. Integration of the sensors
    with precision irrigation technologies will provide a closed loop irrigation system
    where inputs from the smart sensor array will determine timing and amounts for
    real-time site-specific irrigation applications. Previous article in issue Next

    rate irrigation 1. Introduction Irrigation is an essential component of crop production
    in many areas of the world. In cotton for example, recent studies have shown that
    proper timing of irrigation is an important production factor and that delaying
    irrigation can result in losses of between USD 62/ha and USD 300/ha (Vories et
    al., 2003). Yet there are few practical and cost-effective technologies that can
    assist producers with irrigation scheduling. Existing technologies vary from the
    water balance or check book method to sophisticated sensor-based systems like
    those provided by Adcon Telemetry® (Adcon, 2004) and Automata® (Automata, 2004).
    Current sensor-based technologies marketed as wireless are quite expensive because
    they require conventional radio transmitters, usually require a government license
    for use of the radio frequency, and still require extensive cabling if multiple
    sensors are used. These products generally have high-energy requirements and need
    regular maintenance during the growing season. Allen (2000a) evaluated an irrigation
    management system that can provide continuous real-time or near real-time soil
    water content information to the irrigation system operator. This system used
    two different data loggers to collect and store data from Watermark® soil moisture
    sensors (Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA, USA). The data loggers were installed in
    the field in close proximity to the sensor and wired to the sensors. However,
    this system required the operator to visit the data loggers for data downloading
    and thus did not provide a wireless solution. Shock et al. (1999) used a similar
    approach but transmitted data from the data loggers to a central data logging
    site via radio. This system allowed up to 16 Watermark® soil moisture sensors
    to be wired into a proprietary data logger/transmitting box. But, unless all the
    sensors were placed in close proximity to the data logger, this system still required
    extensive cabling. The expense of the data loggers prevents a dense population
    of sensors in the field. King et al. (2000) and Wall and King (2004) proposed
    the architecture for a distributed sensor network which included controls for
    a variable rate irrigation system. Although this approach may accommodate a large
    number of sensors, at this point, it is still a theoretical system. Hamrita and
    Hoffacker (2005) explored Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology as
    a solution to wireless real-time monitoring of soil properties. In a laboratory
    setting they demonstrated that RFID technology was feasible for wireless real-time
    communication with a soil temperature sensor. Inexpensive, real-time soil moisture
    sensing is needed to improve irrigation automation and performance. This paper
    describes a prototype real-time, wireless smart sensor array for measuring soil
    moisture and soil temperature using off-the-shelf components. The system allows
    for a large number of sensors to be installed in a field and provide data wirelessly
    to a centrally located receiver. 2. Methods 2.1. Smart sensor array description
    The smart sensor array consisted of a centrally located receiver connected to
    a laptop computer and multiple sensor nodes installed in the field. The sensor
    nodes consisted of sensors (soil moisture sensors and thermocouples), a sensor
    circuit board, and an active RFID transmitter, referred to as a tag, which transmitted
    data to the receiver. The smart sensor circuit board is shown in Fig. 1. At user-defined
    intervals, the smart sensor board acquired sensor values and wirelessly transmitted
    those values to a centrally located radio frequency (RF) receiver. The board can
    read up to three Watermark® granular resistive-type soil moisture sensors and
    up to four thermocouple temperature sensors. We chose Watermark® sensors for this
    system because of their low cost, dependability, ease-of-use, and because they
    are commonly used by the agricultural community for scheduling irrigation. Past
    research has evaluated the Watermark® sensors and found them to respond well to
    the wetting and drying cycles for most soil types (Thomson and Armstrong, 1987,
    Spaans and Baker, 1992, Eldredge et al., 1993, Shock et al., 1998, Shock et al.,
    2003, Allen, 2000b, Thomson et al., 2002). Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. A smart sensor node which includes three soil Watermark® sensors and two
    thermocouples installed in the NESPAL field a few weeks after planting of cotton.
    The smart sensor circuit board was designed to excite the Watermark® sensors separately
    with a dc voltage, rather than the ac voltage as recommended by the manufacturer
    (Allen, 2000a). Analog multiplexers, an instrumentation amplifier, and various
    other active and passive electronic components conditioned the sensors’ output
    signals before they were input to a microcontroller. The node''s microcontroller
    program (programmed in C language) corrected and formatted sensor values then
    output results to the onboard RF transmitter. WhereNet® active RFID tags (WhereNet®,
    Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used to provide a wireless interface between the circuit
    board and the receiving station. These tags were developed for tracking inventories
    and transmit in the 2.4 GHz radio frequency range. At each transmission, the tags
    send a unique identifier code (node ID) and 12 bytes of user data. In our application,
    the 12 bytes of user data were the sensor values which consisted of three soil
    moisture values and two temperature values. The tags have a line-of-site transmission
    range of up to 0.8 km (0.5 miles). Hereafter, the combination of the electronics
    board, RFID tag, and sensors will be referred to as a “smart sensor node”. During
    preliminary field testing, plant biomass, terrain, and man-made objects caused
    some wireless transmission problems. Plant biomass greatly attenuates radio frequency
    signals, particularly in the 2.4 GHz range. To overcome this issue, transmitters
    (tags) were removed from the smart sensor electronics boards and mounted on hollow,
    flexible fiberglass rods approximately 1.2 m above ground level and covered with
    water proof material (Fig. 2). The flexible rods allowed field equipment, such
    as sprayers, to pass over the sensors without damaging them throughout the growing
    season. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Modified smart sensor node
    with raised transmitter in a peanut field. The smart sensor boards used in the
    project were powered with single 9 V lithium batteries. To optimize battery life,
    the microcontroller was programmed to place itself in a low-current sleep mode
    between sensor readings and data transmissions. It was also programmed to cycle
    the sub-circuits on and off as needed when acquiring sensor values. The current
    drawn by each node during sleep mode was 150 μA. Nodes acquired soil moisture
    sensor values and transmitted the data to the receiver once per hour. The duration
    of the reading and transmission interval was 250 ms per sensor and drew 22 mA
    or a total of 1.25 s per node per hour. The smart sensor operating voltage was
    3.3 V dc. The microcontroller program monitored battery voltage and transmitted
    an alarm code when the voltage dropped below an acceptable threshold, thus eliminating
    the need for regular inspection. Battery life easily exceeded the duration of
    the growing season. 2.2. Field testing of the smart sensor array A 2.3 ha National
    Environmentally Sound Production Agriculture Laboratory (NESPAL) field, located
    on the University of Georgia''s Tifton Campus, was used for testing and demonstration
    of the smart sensor system. The field is equipped with a center-pivot variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system. The WhereNet® RF receiver was installed at the irrigation
    pivot point and used two omnidirectional antennae to receive incoming sensor node
    signals. A notebook computer, housed in a metal enclosure, was used to run the
    WhereNet® acquisition software and to log, timestamp, and store the smart sensor
    data (node identifiers and the sensor values) in a comma delimited file. The data
    were transferred from the receiver to the laptop via a wireless Ethernet connection.
    To evaluate the performance of the smart sensor array, we established two different
    irrigation scheduling strategies for the field. A north-south berm which traverses
    the field (top to bottom in Fig. 3) was used to delineate the two scheduling strategies.
    In the western (left) half of the field, irrigation was scheduled using a traditional
    assessment of the crop (plant wilting, days since last irrigation, rainfall, and
    weather forecast) by a staff member with many years of experience growing cotton.
    Three sensor nodes were installed here strictly for monitoring purposes. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Irrigation management zones created for the
    NESPAL field based on scheduling strategies and inherent field properties. In
    the eastern half of the field, irrigation was scheduled using the smart sensor
    array. Four different irrigation management zones were delineated based on soil
    type, apparent soil electrical conductivity, and historic yield maps (Fig. 3).
    Two or three sensor nodes per zone were installed to characterize soil moisture
    conditions within the zone. Each smart sensor node consisted of three Watermark®
    soil moisture sensors installed within the row at depths of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6
    m. Two thermocouples were also installed, one for soil temperature at 0.2 m and
    the other loosely wrapped around the stem of the nearest cotton plant to monitor
    ambient air temperature within the canopy. Irrigation was scheduled in the zones
    on this side of the field when soil water tension approached predetermined trigger
    points—when average soil water tension exceeded 40 kPa at 0.2 m depth, or when
    soil water tension exceeded 50 kPa at either the 0.4 or 0.6 m depth. These trigger
    points were selected based on published data (Flynn and Barnes, 1998, Thomson
    et al., 2002) and the experience of the authors. Average soil water tension was
    determined by averaging the results from all sensors at a given depth within a
    zone. The VRI pivot allowed each zone to be irrigated individually if necessary.
    The depth of water applied was determined by the amount of water required to reduce
    soil water tension to below 10 kPa. This amount varied from 13 mm of water to
    25 mm of water. The field was planted to Round-Up Ready 555 DPL cotton on 27 April
    2004. Between planting and May 31, regular uniform irrigation applications were
    applied to ensure germination and a uniform stand. The smart sensor nodes were
    installed in May and began recording data in June at which time the predetermined
    irrigation scheduling protocols were initiated. Ample rainfall in June and September
    obviated the need for irrigation during those months. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Soil water tension Fig. 4 (sensor-based scheduling strategy) and Fig. 5 (traditional
    scheduling strategy) contrast soil water tension over the growing season at the
    three monitored depths. Each tension line on the graphs represents the average
    soil water tension at that depth in the given zone. The length of the vertical
    bars descending from the upper x-axis of the graphs represents the amount of rainfall
    or irrigation events. The location of the bar along the upper x-axis represents
    the time the event began. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Soil water

    Fig. 3) representing traditional irrigation scheduling. The data are an average
    of soil water tensions recorded at nodes 9, 12, and 13. The graphs illustrate
    that the smart sensor array was able to successfully monitor soil water tension
    as measured by the Watermark® sensors. Because performance of Watermark® sensors
    has been thoroughly evaluated previously (Thomson and Armstrong, 1987, Eldredge
    et al., 1993, Shock et al., 1998, Irmak and Haman, 2001, Allen, 2000b, Thomson
    et al., 2002), no alternative method was used to verify soil moisture during this
    study. To ensure that the smart sensor array system was properly reading the Watermark®
    sensors, all sensors were read with the manufacturer''s handheld digital meter
    on a weekly basis. Without fail, the data collected by the wireless sensor system
    matched the data collected with the handheld meter. With a few exceptions, soil
    water tension did not surpass established trigger points in the east side of the
    field. Because it takes many hours for a center pivot irrigation system to apply
    water to even a small field, we found that once soil water tension begins to increase
    sharply and approach the trigger point, irrigation must begin almost immediately
    or else soil water tension will climb well above the trigger point. It is also
    clear that the amount of water added during each irrigation event did not, in
    all cases, return the entire soil profile to below 10 kPa soil water tension.
    This may have been a function of not adding enough water but also a function of
    the low permeability of the lower soil profile. On the west side of the cotton
    field (Fig. 4), irrigation was triggered based on traditional assessment of the
    crop (no sensors). This irrigation scheduling strategy resulted in much higher
    soil water tensions at 0.4 and 0.6 m depth than any observed in the eastern half
    of the field. In some instances, measured tension was more than double the trigger
    points established for the smart sensor scheduling protocol. It is also evident
    that the amount of irrigation water applied only served to momentarily reduce
    soil water tension below 0.2 m depth. 3.2. Thermocouple response Although soil
    and air temperature within the canopy were not used to make management decisions
    for the cotton crop at the NESPAL field, they are important parameters for peanut
    production and are key input parameters to the Irrigator Pro decision support
    software (Davidson et al., 2000) which is used by peanut producers. Thermocouple
    response was stable for the duration of the study which indicates that the smart
    sensor array can successfully record three soil moisture values as well as two
    thermocouple values at each node. Soil temperature at 0.2 m fluctuated between
    24 and 28 °C with a gradual decline as the season progressed (Fig. 6). In contrast,
    air temperature within the canopy fluctuated between 20 and 40 °C during most
    of the season and even approached 44 °C during mid September. Canopy air temperature
    was compared weekly to readings from a mercury thermometer and was consistently
    within ±2 °C. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Soil temperature and
    air temperature within the canopy recorded at node 5 in Zone B. Soil and air temperature
    response was similar at the other nodes. Gaps in the data resulted from periods
    when the node was not operational. 4. Ongoing and future work Using a smart sensor
    array in conjunction with a conventional uniform-application irrigation system
    can aid in determining when to begin watering based on the driest zone in a field.
    The smart sensor array can also be used to determine the optimum amount of water
    to apply across the field. However, to optimize irrigation applications, the smart
    sensor array is best used in conjunction with a VRI system. A VRI control system
    that enables a center pivot irrigation system to supply water at rates relative
    to the needs of individual areas within fields was developed through collaboration
    between the University of Georgia Precision Farming Team and the FarmScan Group
    (Perth, Western Australia). The VRI system varies application rate by cycling
    sprinklers on and off and by varying the center pivot travel speed. Details of
    the system were presented by Perry et al., 2003, Perry et al., 2002a, Perry et
    al., 2002b. The VRI system is a retrofit package that can be installed on most
    existing pivots. It has been commercialized in the United States by Hobbs & Holder,
    LLC (Ashburn, GA, USA; www.betterpivots.com). Irrigation water application maps
    for VRI equipped pivots are defined by the producer or operator of the VRI system,
    who delineates zones within the field requiring different water application amounts.
    These differences are generally based on the field''s soil and topographic features
    but could also reflect different crops under the same pivot. 4.1. Control of VRI
    with the smart sensor array With current VRI systems, application maps are typically
    static—they do not change during the growing season. Furthermore, VRI controllers
    generally do not accept sensor inputs. Our goal is to make irrigation dynamic
    and responsive to real-time plant water needs. To achieve this goal, we are in
    the process of developing a new VRI controller with accompanying decision making
    software which will accommodate a wide variety of control inputs, including data
    from the smart sensor array. The new VRI controller will monitor the sensor array''s
    sensor values and initiate irrigation based on pre-determined irrigation scheduling
    strategies. 4.2. Commercialization The smart sensor array design allows for a
    high population of nodes within a field because of the relatively low cost of
    the nodes. The cost of the node is primarily a function of the number of Watermark®
    soil moisture sensors used. In small quantities, the Watermarks® cost approximately
    USD 25 each. If purchased in large quantities, the price may be lower. The cost
    of the other node components is about USD 40. In the configuration used for this
    study, the cost of each node was approximately USD 115. For most crops, a node
    with two Watermark® sensors installed at different depths would adequately characterize
    the status of the soil at a given location. However, multiple nodes would be required
    to overcome the inherent variability that may be encountered within irrigation
    management zones. It is not unrealistic to expect that in production quantities,
    a two-sensor node would cost about USD 70. A population of 20 nodes, which should
    adequately instrument a 40 ha field with a moderate amount of variability would
    then cost about USD 1400. The life of a node is expected to be about 5 years.
    Greater costs are associated with the WhereNet® receiver and acquisition software,
    approximately USD 4500. The receiver and software are designed for a much more
    complicated mission than for an irrigation management application. We are currently
    cooperating with WhereNet® company officials and technical staff to simplify the
    receiver and software with a target price of USD 1000 for agricultural applications.
    Simplifying the software will also allow it to operate on a smaller computing
    platform such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). If this objective is achieved,
    a producer could complete instrumentation of the wireless system for a 40-ha field
    for approximately USD 2700 (includes USD 300 for a PDA). 5. Summary The smart
    sensor array described here offers real potential for reliably monitoring soil
    water status in crops. The system was able to successfully monitor soil water
    status and soil and air temperature within the canopy for the entire 2004 growing
    season with few technical difficulties. Equipment modifications resulting from
    encountered problems resulted in a more robust system that can be installed at
    the beginning of the season and left alone until harvest. The smart sensor array
    reliably recorded and transmitted the readings of the Watermark® sensors and allowed
    us to successfully implement our irrigation scheduling protocol. The relatively
    low cost of the sensor nodes allows for installation of a dense population of
    soil moisture sensors that can adequately represent the inherent soil variability
    present in any field. Future work will involve developing a smart sensor array-to-variable
    rate irrigation system interface to provide a fully automated, closed-loop irrigation
    system. This will provide a dynamic system capable of addressing varying water
    needs in fields with diverse irrigation management zones. Acknowledgements This

    The study first compares the LSTM models to state-of-the-art feedforward neural

    \ technologies which improve the\nefﬁciency of agricultural irrigation systems.\
    \ Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate\nreal-time feedback from\
    \ soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision\n\
    support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict\
    \ crop water needs\nwhile adapting to external perturbation and disturbances.\
    \ This paper presents a Dynamic Neural\nNetwork approach for modelling of the\
    \ temporal soil moisture ﬂuxes. The models are trained to\ngenerate a one-day-ahead\
    \ prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil\nmoisture,\
    \ precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using ﬁeld data from three sites,\
    \ a R2 value\nabove 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The\
    \ models were also able to generate\nrobust soil moisture predictions for independent\
    \ sites which were not used in training the models.\nThe application of the Dynamic\
    \ Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system\nwas demonstrated\
    \ using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation\n\
    based on predeﬁned thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves\
    \ a water saving\nranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water\
    \ use efﬁciency similar to that of the\nrule-based system.\nKeywords: irrigation\

    1. Introduction\nAn increasing world population and climate change have placed\
    \ a considerable amount of\npressure on global freshwater supplies [1]. Irrigated\
    \ agriculture is the world’s largest consumptive\nuser of fresh water, accounting\
    \ for over 70% of its global use [2]. It is therefore important to develop\ntechnologies\
    \ which enable sustainable and efﬁcient water use for irrigated agriculture while\
    \ obtaining\na healthy plant growth.\nIt is desirable to irrigate to meet speciﬁc\
    \ plant water demands at the right time while avoiding over\nand under irrigation.\
    \ This usually involves irrigation scheduling and control operations on an hourly\n\
    or daily basis for a time period of usually less than a week [3]. Precision irrigation\
    \ aims to accurately\ndetermine and quantify plant water needs. The irrigation\
    \ amount and timing is based on measurements\nof soil, plant, and climatic variables\
    \ from which the plant water need is inferred [4]. Precision\nirrigation has been\
    \ shown to improve water use efﬁciency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance\n\
    crop productivity by leveraging advances in sensor, control, and modelling technologies\
    \ [5–8].\nSuch advances include the development of energy efﬁcient and fault-tolerant\
    \ wireless sensor\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408; doi:10.3390/s18103408\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 3408\n2 of 22\nnetworks [9,10], intelligent proximal sensing\
    \ for the detection of plant water stress [11–13], and variable\nrate irrigation\
    \ systems [6,14,15].\nThe temporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is perhaps\
    \ the most leveraged tool for irrigation\nscheduling. This is because the soil\
    \ moisture status is indicative of the water available for uptake by\ncrops [16].\
    \ A number of irrigation scheduling methods estimate crop water needs using soil\
    \ moisture\nand climatic data, and rules created by expert agronomists. Most of\
    \ the commercial automated\nirrigation systems are programmed to irrigate at speciﬁc\
    \ time intervals and apply a ﬁxed irrigation\nvolume. A number of these systems\
    \ are also programmed to irrigate after a predeﬁned soil moisture\nthreshold is\
    \ reached [17]. Due to their open-loop structure, these methods may not guarantee\
    \ optimum\nirrigation scheduling decisions resulting in suboptimal plant health\
    \ and efﬁciency in water use [18].\nThese shortcomings can be alleviated with\
    \ the use of feedback control where sensor feedback is\nemployed in optimizing\
    \ irrigation timing and volume [19]. Although these approaches improve\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions, they do not include a model for the process dynamics;\
    \ as a result,\nthe overall system may not be robust to external perturbations\
    \ [20].\nModel-based irrigation scheduling systems consist of a calibrated internal\
    \ model which\nemploys feedback from soil, plant, and climatic sensors in order\
    \ to predict crop water needs [20].\nMcCarthy et al. [21] implemented a model-based\
    \ control system for predicting the irrigation\nrequirements of cotton with an\
    \ objective of maximizing crop yield. Their system relied on a complex\ncrop model\
    \ which requires detailed information on various climatic, soil and crop parameters.\n\
    Park et al. [20] developed a model predictive control system for center pivot\
    \ irrigation which used\nmeasured soil and climatic data to calibrate a complex\
    \ soil-water model. The use of mechanistic\nmodels in these systems has many practical\
    \ limitations because they are data demanding and require\ntime-consuming calibrations\
    \ during model development.\nIn recent years, many studies have investigated the\
    \ applicability of data-driven machine learning\nmodels to irrigation decision\
    \ support. Navarro-Hellín et al. [22] presented a regression model applied\nin\
    \ predicting the weekly irrigation needs of a plantation using climatic and soil\
    \ data as inputs.\nGiusti and Marsili-Libelli [23] applied a fuzzy decision system\
    \ in predicting the volumetric soil\nmoisture content based on local weather data.\
    \ King and Shellie [24] used neural network modelling to\nestimate the lower threshold\
    \ (Tnws) needed to calculate the crop water stress index for wine grapes.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [25] applied a system identiﬁcation model in predicting the soil moisture\
    \ deﬁcit using\nclimatic and soil moisture data as model inputs. These statistical\
    \ methods explore the spatial and\ntemporal patterns hidden in historical data\
    \ in order to map input data to an output space. They do not\nrely on a physical\
    \ model of the system as they are data-driven (i.e., they learn from data). In\
    \ many\ncases, these machine learning methods have been shown to achieve a good\
    \ prediction performance [26].\nThey also have fewer data requirements when compared\
    \ to mechanistic models [24,27,28].\nFor real-time irrigation scheduling, a model\
    \ which is able to predict the soil moisture dynamics\nis desirable [18]. In order\
    \ to achieve this with traditional machine learning and system identiﬁcation\n\
    methods, an extensive physical knowledge of vadose zone hydrology and boundary\
    \ layer meteorology\nis required to derive robust input features from soil and\
    \ climatic data. This is because of the complex\nnonlinear relationship between\
    \ the climatic parameters, soil hydraulic properties, and the soil moisture\n\
    dynamics [29]. Lozoya et al. [30], Delgoa et al. [25], Giusti and Marsili-Libelli\
    \ [23], and Saleem et al. [31]\npresented system identiﬁcation models for the\
    \ prediction of soil moisture dynamics, which are\nparameterized based on the\
    \ soil water balance method. This involved assumptions relating to the\nabsence\
    \ of surface run-off and deep percolation. The estimated evapotranspiration was\
    \ also used as\nan input to the models. In practice, the true crop evapotranspiration\
    \ may be signiﬁcantly different\nfrom the estimated values. Furthermore, these\
    \ models are only applicable to the site for which they\nare developed limiting\
    \ their use for a different environment. This is because models developed using\n\
    traditional machine learning and system identiﬁcation approaches are mostly only\
    \ applicable to the\nenvironment for which they were developed [22].\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 3408\n3 of 22\nMachine learning approaches such as support vector\
    \ machines (SVMs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy\ninference systems (ANFIS) are another\
    \ group of models that have been applied for the prediction of\nsoil moisture\
    \ dynamics [26,32–34]. These approaches have good prediction capability and limited\n\
    input requirements.\nKarandish and Šim ˚unek [26] compared various machine learning\
    \ models\nincluding ANFIS and SVM for simulating the time series of soil moisture\
    \ content using meteorological,\nprecipitation, and crop coefﬁcient data as model\
    \ input.\nThe authors reported that the models\nachieved a prediction performance\
    \ comparable to that of a mechanistic physical process-based model:\nHYDRUS–2D.\
    \ However, they noted that these machine learning models are not suitable for\
    \ the entire\nrange of soil moisture prediction i.e., water stress conditions.\
    \ It is therefore evident that robust and\nscalable data-driven models need to\
    \ be developed for irrigation scheduling applications.\nNeural network (NN) methods\
    \ have a strong learning ability and are able to represent the\nnonlinear relationship\
    \ between the inputs and outputs of a system [35]. Some speciﬁc applications\n\
    of neural networks to irrigation and water resource management include the prediction\
    \ of soil\nmoisture to aid irrigation scheduling [35,36], crop yield prediction\
    \ [37,38], prediction of irrigation\nwater demand [39,40], rainfall-runoff modelling\
    \ [41,42] and groundwater modelling [43,44].\nAn NN method is applied in this\
    \ study for predicting the soil moisture dynamics because of\ntheir ability to\
    \ produce robust functions approximating complex processes [45]. However, traditional\n\
    feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) have limited ability to model dynamic data\
    \ because they are\nunable to preserve previous information, resulting in suboptimal\
    \ predictions when they are applied\nin modelling highly causal systems [46].\
    \ The learning capability of FFNNs can be improved through\nadditional pre-processing\
    \ of dynamic data and combining the FFNN with other methods including\ngenetic\
    \ algorithms [47] and fuzzy logic [36]. For example, Pulido-Calvo and Gutiérrez-Estrada\
    \ [40]\napplied a hybrid FFNN model to generate a one-day-ahead forecast of daily\
    \ irrigation water demand.\nThe forecast produced by the FFNN was corrected via\
    \ a fuzzy logic approach whose parameters\nwere adjusted using genetic algorithms.\
    \ While this sort of hybrid modelling approach can strengthen\nthe ability of\
    \ an FFNN to learn dynamic data, the long-term generalization ability of such\
    \ models\nis limited due to the ad hoc nature of fuzzy logic rules. Furthermore,\
    \ the methods that employ\nadditional pre-processing of dynamic data are time-consuming\
    \ because of the extensive time and\nfrequency domain computations they rely on.\
    \ The data pre-processing steps also rely on subjective\nuser intervention, which\
    \ limits the scalability of the models to new environments.\nThis present study\
    \ focuses on a dynamic modelling task, for which the Recurrent Neural Network\n\
    (RNN) presents a suitable solution. An RNN has internal self-looped cells, allowing\
    \ it to preserve\ninformation from previous time steps [48]. The Long Short-Term\
    \ Memory Network (LSTM), a class\nof RNNs was selected for this study because\
    \ of its successful application in the control of nonlinear\ndynamic systems [49,50].\
    \ The LSTM requires minimal input data pre-processing and is able to\npreserve\
    \ useful information across multiple time steps [51]. They have been shown to\
    \ achieve robust\nperformance in modelling sequential data in ﬁelds such as natural\
    \ language processing [52], time\nseries classiﬁcation of chaotic systems [53],\
    \ and speech recognition [54]. Zhang et al. [55] demonstrated\na hydrological\
    \ application of LSTM models for the prediction of water table depth. Time series\n\
    data on water diversion, evaporation, precipitation and temperature were applied\
    \ as inputs to the\nmodel. The authors reported R2 scores ranging between 0.789\
    \ and 0.952 for the LSTM models,\nlargely outperforming FFNN models which achieved\
    \ a maximum R2 score of 0.495. The robust water\ntable depth prediction achieved\
    \ by the LSTM models highlights their ability to preserve and learn\nprevious\
    \ information from long-term time series data typical of hydrological application.\
    \ This ability\nis particularly desirable in soil moisture based irrigation scheduling\
    \ where the present soil moisture\ncontent is dependent on past soil moisture,\
    \ precipitation, and climatic data.\nThe objective of this study was to develop\
    \ LSTM models for the prediction of volumetric soil\nmoisture content for three\
    \ sites with different soil characteristics. Performance of the LSTM models\n\
    was evaluated by comparing the LSTM predicted soil moisture content with measured\
    \ soil moisture\ncontent and estimated soil moisture content using traditional\
    \ feedforward neural networks (FFNNs).\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n4 of 22\nThe applicability\
    \ of the LSTM models for prediction in sites not used in model training was also\n\
    investigated. Finally, the application of the LSTM models in predictive irrigation\
    \ scheduling was\ndemonstrated using model-based simulations of the potato-growing\
    \ season.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the theoretical\
    \ background of\nneural networks is presented. In Section 3, the methodology employed\
    \ for the study is presented.\nSection 4 shows the performance evaluation of the\
    \ neural network models and the predictive irrigation\nscheduling system. In Section\
    \ 5, conclusions and recommendations for future work are presented.\n2. Background\n\
    This section presents a theoretical background on artiﬁcial neural networks including\
    \ the FFNN\nand the recurrent neural network.\n2.1. Neural Network Preliminaries\n\
    The basic building block of neural networks is the neuron. It is a processing\
    \ element that takes\na number of inputs, applies a weight to them, sums them\
    \ up, includes a bias term, and passes the\nresult to an activation function,\
    \ which then produces an output. This activation function implements a\nnonlinear\
    \ transformation to the linearly combined input in order to produce a nonlinear\
    \ output.\nThrough a combination of these neurons across the input space and connections\
    \ of the neurons\noutputs to other neurons, a function can be learned which maps\
    \ the nonlinear relationship between an\ninput feature space and an output target.\
    \ The input–output relation of the system can be described by\nEquation (1) [45]:\n\
    Zi\nj(k) = f\n \nN\n∑\ni=1\nwi\nijxi−1\ni\n(k) + δi\n!\n(1)\nwhere f (:) is the\
    \ nonlinear activation function, and wi\nij is the connection weight of the j-th\
    \ neuron unit\nin the (i − 1)-th layer to those of the i-th layer. xi−1\ni\nis\
    \ the input from the (i − 1)-th layer and δi are the\nrespective bias terms.\n\
    2.2. The Feedforward Neural Network\nThe FFNN, also known as the multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLP) network, is built by ordering neurons\nin layers and letting each neuron\
    \ in a layer take as input only the outputs of the units in the previous\nlayer\
    \ or external inputs. A network with N = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n layers is called an\
    \ n layer network.\nThe FFNN is shown in Figure 1.\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER\
    \ REVIEW  \n5 of 22 \n \nFigure 1. The feedforward neural network (FFNN). \nThe\
    \ second layer in Figure 1 is called the output layer as it produces the output\
    \ of the network. \nThe first layer is known as the hidden layer since it is located\
    \ between the external inputs and the \noutput layer. The mathematical formula\
    \ expressing the FFNN is detailed in Equation (2) [45] \n\U0001D466ො௜ = \U0001D454\

    \ weights, the network is trained with data containing\nexamples of the inputs\
    \ xl and outputs yi pairs, known as the training set. The weights are chosen\n\
    to minimize a global loss function, which measures the cost of predicting ˆy when\
    \ the true output\ny is a function over the training set. For regression problems\
    \ that encompass dynamic modelling\ntasks, the cost function to be minimized is\
    \ the mean-squared error, which is computed as shown in\nEquation (3):\nl( ˆy,\
    \ y) =\nK\n∑\nk=1\nE(k) = 1\n2n\nK\n∑\nk=1\nn\n∑\ni=1\n∥ ˆyi(k) − yi(k)∥2\n(3)\n\
    where l( ˆy, y) is the loss function, and n is the number of training examples.\
    \ The minimization of the\nloss function and update of weights is achieved using\
    \ the backpropagation algorithm [56].\n2.3. Long Short-Term Memory Network\nThe\
    \ LSTM is a variant of the RNN, so it is expedient to introduce the RNN before\
    \ describing\nthe LSTM.\nRecurrent neural networks are similar to FFNNs except\
    \ that there is a self-feedback of neurons in\nthe hidden layers as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 2. This gives the network memory and it is able to learn from\nan\
    \ entire sequence given portions of the overall sequence, i.e., it is a dynamic\

    \ time-step and the gradients are computed via\nback-propagation through time\
    \ (BPTT) [57].\nHowever, BPTT is not able to learn a pattern from long-term dependency\
    \ because of the gradient\nvanishing problem [58]. The RNNs use their back-coupling\
    \ connections to memorize short-term\ndependency in a sequence; as a result, the\
    \ backpropagated error signals in time can become inﬁnitely\nhigh or vanish [59].\
    \ Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [60] proposed the LTSM, which is able to solve the\n\
    exploding or vanishing gradients problem by enforcing constant error ﬂows through\
    \ constant error\ncarousels within special multiplicative units. These units regulate\
    \ the error ﬂow in the network by\nlearning how to open or close specialized gates\
    \ in the network. The constant error carousels (CECs)\nand the multiplicative\
    \ and gate units form the memory block of the LSTM [55].\nThe CEC loops through\
    \ the network without an activation function, so the vanishing gradient\nproblem\
    \ does not occur when BPTT is applied to train an LSTM [45]. Therefore, LSTMs\
    \ are able\nto approximate long-term information because the information can ﬂow\
    \ easily along the cells\nunchanged. The input, forget, and output gates of the\
    \ memory block control the input into the\nCEC cell, the information retained\
    \ in the cells, and the output from the cell into other blocks in the\nnetwork.\

    \ for this study is presented in this section. This includes an overview\nof the\
    \ data applied for developing the soil moisture prediction models, the structure\
    \ of the neural\nnetwork models, and the structure of the predictive irrigation\
    \ scheduling system.\n3.1. Study Sites and Data Source\nThe data applied in developing\
    \ the neural network (NN) models for soil moisture prediction were\nobtained from\
    \ three study sites, which are part of the Cosmic-Ray Soil Moisture Observing\
    \ System\n(COSMOS) monitoring project in the United Kingdom [61]. Brieﬂy, the\
    \ COSMOS project is a soil\nmoisture and climate monitoring network operating\
    \ in the UK, USA, Australia, and China. The project\nprovides near real-time soil\
    \ moisture and climatic data for use in a variety of applications including\n\
    agriculture, water resources management, ﬂood prediction, and land-surface modelling.\n\
    The data obtained for the three study sites included hourly measurements of windspeed,\
    \ rainfall,\nair temperature, net radiation, relative humidity, and volumetric\
    \ soil moisture content. Details of the\nthree sites are summarized in Table 1.\n\

    December 2013–September 2017\nThe volumetric soil moisture content in all sites\
    \ is measured using the cosmic-ray soil moisture\nsensor (Model CRS-1000/B, Hydroinnova\
    \ LLC, Albuquerque, NW, USA) deployed using a site-specific\ncalibration. The\
    \ cosmic-ray soil moisture sensor consists of a non-invasive probe which measures\
    \ the\nneutron emitted by cosmic rays within the air and soil. These neutrons\
    \ are moderated by hydrogen\natoms emitted from soil water into the atmosphere.\
    \ The neutrons and hydrogen atoms combine\ninstantaneously and its density is\
    \ inversely correlated with soil moisture [62]. A calibration function\ndefines\
    \ the relationship between the neutron intensity and soil moisture. This calibration\
    \ function is\nsimple, monotonic, and invariant with soil texture and chemical\
    \ composition [63]. The sensor has a\nhorizontal measurement range of 200 m and\
    \ an effective measurement depth of up to 60 m. The sensor\nis reported to have\
    \ an accuracy of ±2% measured volumetric soil moisture content [64]. Full details\n\
    on the operating principle of the sensor can be found in Shuttleworth et al. [61].\
    \ The meteorological\nvariables (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity, net\
    \ radiation, windspeed, and precipitation) in all\nsites are measured by a MetPak\
    \ Pro Base automatic weather station (Gill Instruments, Hampshire, UK).\nThe NN\
    \ models trained on data from the sites listed in Table 1 were also applied in\
    \ predicting\nthe soil moisture content in two independent sites with soil characteristics\
    \ similar to that of the sites\nfor which the models were trained. This was done\
    \ to evaluate the applicability of the models for\nprediction in new sites, which\
    \ were not used in model training. A summary of the independent sites is\npresented\
    \ in Table 2.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n8 of 22\nTable 2. The independent sites\

    \ and Pre-Processing\nThe hourly data was resampled to daily (24 h) intervals\
    \ as this is a time period applicable for ﬁeld\nscale irrigation scheduling [65].\
    \ The daily averages of the climatic variables were calculated during\nthe resampling,\
    \ while the daily precipitation was calculated as the sum of daily rainfall and\
    \ irrigation\ndepths. The volumetric soil moisture content was also resampled\
    \ to its average daily value. The data\ncleaning steps included imputing of missing\
    \ values and removal of outliers.\nThe pre-processing steps applied for the data\
    \ modelled with the FFNN included a box–cox\ntransform [66] of the soil moisture\
    \ and air temperature data in order to stabilize their variance.\nThe transformed\
    \ data were thereafter deseasonalized using the seasonal and trend decomposition\n\
    using loess (STL), as proposed by Cleveland et al. [67]. Several studies have\
    \ shown that deseasonalizing\ndynamic data that exhibits seasonality prior to\
    \ modelling is necessary in order to produce robust\npredictions with an FFNN\
    \ model [68,69]. The STL technique decomposes the soil moisture and air\ntemperature\
    \ data into their trend, seasonal, and residual components. Thereafter, the sums\
    \ of the trend\nand level were passed to the next step of the data pre-processing.\
    \ An example of the transformed and\ndecomposed soil moisture data is shown in\
    \ Figure 4. In the next data pre-processing step, the climatic,\nprecipitation,\
    \ and soil moisture data were standardized by computing the z-score of their data\
    \ points.\nIn the post-processing stage, the soil moisture predictions were back-transformed\
    \ to their actual scale\nthrough an inverse z-score transformation, the addition\
    \ of the seasonal component, and an inverse\nbox–cox transformation.\nFor the\
    \ LSTM, the only data pre-processing step applied was a standardization of the\
    \ climatic,\nprecipitation, and soil moisture data. This was accomplished by computing\
    \ the z-score of their data\npoints. In the post-processing stage, the soil moisture\
    \ predictions were back-transformed to their\nactual scale through an inverse\
    \ z-score transformation.\nFor the model training sites, the dataset was divided\
    \ into a 70:30 ratio for the purpose of model\ntraining and evaluation. The division\
    \ was done such that the temporal nature of the data was accounted\nfor; i.e.,\
    \ the evaluation dataset was posterior to the training dataset.\nData spanning\
    \ 2016–2017 for the independent sites (Table 2) was applied in evaluating the\n\
    prediction performance of the trained NN models on those sites.\nSensors 2018,\

    \ the temporal nature of the data was \naccounted for; i.e., the evaluation dataset\

    \ sites (Table 2) was applied in evaluating the \nprediction performance of the\
    \ trained NN models on those sites. \n \nFigure 4. Soil moisture data transformation\

    \ moisture content at time \U0001D461 + 1 is a nonlinear function of past and\
    \ present \nFigure 4. Soil moisture data transformation and decomposition prior\

    \ Framework\nFor predictive irrigation scheduling, a one-day-ahead prediction\
    \ of the soil moisture content is\nrequired. The soil moisture content at time\
    \ t + 1 is a nonlinear function of past and present climatic,\nand precipitation\
    \ inputs. It is also inﬂuenced by the past and present soil moisture content values.\
    \ This\nis a Multiple Input and Single Output (MISO) system. The FFNN and LSTM\
    \ networks are encoded in\nvarious suitable architectures appropriate for the\
    \ learning task. The neural networks were developed\nusing the Keras Deep Learning\
    \ library on the Python programming platform [70].\n3.3.1. The Feedforward Neural\
    \ Network Structure\nThe FFNN is straightforward to employ for discrete time modelling\
    \ of dynamic systems for which\nthere is a nonlinear relationship between the\
    \ system’s inputs and output. The soil moisture dynamics\ncan be modelled as a\
    \ Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input System (NARX) as shown in\nEquation\
    \ (12):\ny(t + 1) = S[y(t), . . . , y(t − j), u(t), . . . , u(t − n), p(t), .\
    \ . . , p(t − m)]\n(12)\nwhere y(t + 1) is the one-day-ahead prediction of the\
    \ volumetric soil moisture content, y(t = 0 . . . j)\nare the present and past\
    \ soil moisture content at day t = 0 . . . j, u(t = 0 . . . n) are the climatic\
    \ inputs\nat day t = 0 . . . n, p(t = 0 . . . m) are the precipitation inputs\
    \ at day t = 0 . . . m, and S is a nonlinear\nfunction, which is approximated\
    \ using the FFNN.\nThe time lags m, n, and j are determined through experimentation.\
    \ The number of hidden\nlayers in the network and the number of neurons in each\
    \ hidden layer are also determined\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n10 of 22\nthrough\
    \ experimentation. The soil moisture prediction is framed as a regression problem;\
    \ as such,\nan appropriate activation function is required for the hidden layers\
    \ of the FFNN. For regression\nproblems, the most robust nonlinear activation\
    \ function is the point-wise rectiﬁed linear units\n(RELU),max(0, x), where x\
    \ is the input into the neuron. The RELU activation function is reported to\n\
    provide easier optimization, faster convergence, and better generalization with\
    \ the added bonus of\nbeing computationally efﬁcient [71].\nDuring the study,\
    \ the RELU nonlinearity was applied in the hidden layers, while the network\n\
    loss was minimized using the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimization algorithm,\
    \ which is\nreported to improve network convergence [72].\n3.3.2. The Long Short-Term\
    \ Memory Network Structure\nFor modelling dynamic systems, the LSTM introduces\
    \ a nonlinearity from the input to system\nstates followed by a dynamic linearity\
    \ from the states to the output. This can be represented in the\nstate space form\
    \ as shown in Equations (13a) and (13b):\nx(t + 1) = NNi[x(t) . . . x(t − k),\
    \ u(t) . . . u(t − n), y(t) . . . y(t − j), p(t) . . . p(t − m); V]\n(13a)\ny(t\
    \ + 1) = NNo[x(t + 1); W]\n(13b)\nwhere x(t + 1) is the future state of the network\
    \ at day t + 1, x(t = 0 . . . k) are the present and past\nnetwork states at day\
    \ t = 0 . . . k, y(t = 0 . . . j) are the present and past soil moisture content\
    \ at day\nt = 0 . . . j, u(t = 0 . . . n) are the climatic inputs at day t = 0\
    \ . . . n, p(t = 0 . . . m) are the precipitation\ninputs at day t = 0 . . . m,\
    \ and y(t + 1) is the one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture\n\
    content. V is the parameter set of the network that corresponds to the states,\
    \ and W is the parameter\nset of the network that corresponds to the output.\n\
    The time lags m, n, and j are determined through experimentation while the time\
    \ delay k for\nthe states is learned implicitly by the network during training.\
    \ The network is designed as an LSTM\nnonlinear element (NNi) followed by a linear\
    \ output layer (NNo). The number of LSTM layers and\nthe number of memory blocks\
    \ in each layer are also determined through experimentation. During the\nstudy,\
    \ the network loss was minimized using the ADAM optimization algorithm.\n3.4.\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling\nA predictive irrigation scheduling system is enabled\
    \ by a model that uses feedback from soil\nand climatic sensors to predict the\
    \ crop water demand [20]. A trained neural network model is\nable to generate\
    \ soil moisture predictions and presents an opportunity for implementing predictive\n\
    irrigation scheduling.\nIn order to demonstrate the applicability of a trained\
    \ LSTM for predictive irrigation scheduling,\nthe AQUACROP model developed by\
    \ the Food and Agricultural Organization was used in simulating\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ interactions for the potato crop [73–75]. The AQUACROP model has been\nwidely\
    \ validated and is able to simulate soil moisture dynamics and crop response to\
    \ water deﬁcits\nacross various soil types as a function of climatic inputs and\
    \ water availability [76–79].\nClimatic and rainfall data for the model training\
    \ sites were used as inputs into the AQUACROP\nmodel. The LSTM models trained\
    \ for each site was applied in generating a one-day-ahead prediction\nof soil\
    \ moisture content using the climatic data and AQUACROP simulated soil moisture\
    \ as\ninputs. Thereafter, the prediction was used to determine the irrigation\
    \ depth and timing during\nthe AQUACROP simulations. This formed the basis of\
    \ the predictive irrigation system described in\nSection 3.4.1. The AQUACROP soil\
    \ ﬁle was modiﬁed to represent the soil types and characteristics for\nthe model\
    \ training sites as summarized in Table 3. The crop characteristics of the default\
    \ Lima potato\nﬁle was used during the simulations.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n\

    \ system was compared to a rule-based irrigation scheduling system set\nup on\
    \ AQUACROP. The rule-based system was programmed to apply irrigation based on\
    \ speciﬁed\nsoil moisture thresholds and applied water depths to reﬁll the soil\
    \ moisture content to ﬁeld capacity. It\nwas set up as an open-loop system, which\
    \ does not consider soil moisture feedback after irrigation\nevents. It should\
    \ be noted that only data from the evaluation dataset set of the model training\
    \ sites\nwas applied in the simulations.\n3.4.1. Predictive Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ System\nThe goal of irrigation scheduling is to maintain the soil moisture content\
    \ between an upper and\nlower bound. The upper bound is usually defined as the\
    \ field capacity while the lower bound is a point\nabove the permanent wilting\
    \ point expressed a function of the management allowable depletion (MAD).\nIn\
    \ irrigation, it is common practice to express the amount of water retained in\
    \ the plant root zone\n(Wr) as an equivalent depth of soil water (mm of water).\
    \ This is expressed as shown in Equation (14):\nWr = 1000θZr\n(14)\nwhere θ is\
    \ the volumetric soil moisture content, and Zr is the thickness of the root zone\
    \ in meters.\nThe water deﬁcit at time t (DPt) is expressed as shown in Equation\
    \ (15):\nDPt = Wr,FC − Wr,t\n(15)\nwhere Wr,FC is the water depth at ﬁeld capacity,\
    \ and Wr,t is the water depth at time t. It is evident\nfrom Equation (15) that\
    \ the water deﬁcit at the upper bound (DPU) will be zero, i.e., (Wr,FC − Wr,FC).\n\
    The deﬁcit at the lower bound (DPL) is determined from a knowledge of the soils\
    \ available water and\nthe crops MAD. This is expressed as shown in Equations\
    \ (16a) and (16b)\nDPL = Wr,FC − Wr,LB\n(16a)\nwith\nWr,LB = Wr,FC − MAD(Wr,FC\
    \ − Wr,PWP)\n(16b)\nwhere Wr,LB is the water depth at the lower bound, and Wr,PWP\
    \ is the water depth at permanent\nwilting point. DPL will vary over the growth\
    \ season as a result of root growth.\nIf a prediction of the soil volumetric soil\
    \ moisture content at time t + 1 is available from the\nLSTM model, the deﬁcit\
    \ at time t + 1 (DPt+1) can be easily calculated. The irrigation amount is\ncomputed\
    \ as the water application depth that will replenish the water deﬁcit to the upper\
    \ bound i.e.,\nIrrigation = (DPt+1). For close-loop irrigation scheduling, the\
    \ irrigation threshold is set at a safe point\nbelow DPL. The advantage of this\
    \ simpliﬁed irrigation scheduling system is the inclusion of a time\nvariable\
    \ lower bound. Delgoda et al. [65] noted that this is difﬁcult to achieve with\
    \ the optimization\nschemes applied in model predictive control systems. A block\
    \ diagram of the proposed irrigation\nscheduling system is presented in Figure\
    \ 5. Figure 5 shows that soil moisture, precipitation, irrigation,\nand climatic\
    \ data are applied as inputs into a trained LSTM model in order to generate a\
    \ prediction\nof the soil moisture content. The predicted soil moisture content\
    \ is then used in conjunction with\ninformation on crop water requirement and\
    \ soil water retention to determine the irrigation timing\nand amount.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 3408\n12 of 22\nDuring the simulations, for both the predictive and\
    \ rule-based irrigation scheduling system,\na MAD of 30% was assumed for the potato\
    \ crop and the lower bound was dynamically adjusted as a\nfunction of rooting\
    \ depth growth during the simulated growing season.\n \ntime variable lower bound.\
    \ Delgoda et al. [65] noted that this is difficult to achieve with the \noptimization\
    \ schemes applied in model predictive control systems. A block diagram of the\
    \ \nproposed irrigation scheduling system is presented in Figure 5. Figure 5 shows\
    \ that soil moisture, \nprecipitation, irrigation, and climatic data are applied\
    \ as inputs into a trained LSTM model in order \nto generate a prediction of the\
    \ soil moisture content. The predicted soil moisture content is then \nused in\
    \ conjunction with information on crop water requirement and soil water retention\
    \ to \ndetermine the irrigation timing and amount. \nDuring the simulations, for\
    \ both the predictive and rule-based irrigation scheduling system, a \nMAD of\
    \ 30% was assumed for the potato crop and the lower bound was dynamically adjusted\
    \ as a \nfunction of rooting depth growth during the simulated growing season.\

    \ Criteria \nTo assess the performance of the trained models for the prediction\
    \ of the soil moisture content \nduring the model evaluation, several measures\
    \ of accuracy were applied. The model’s accuracy \nbetween the observed and predicted\
    \ soil moisture content was evaluated using the coefficient of \ndetermination\
    \ (\U0001D445ଶ), root mean squared error (\U0001D445\U0001D440\U0001D446\U0001D438\
    ), and the mean absolute error (\U0001D440\U0001D434\U0001D438). \nThe \U0001D445\
    ଶ describes the proportion of the total variance in the observed data that is\
    \ explained by \nthe model and ranges between ሾ−∞, 1ሿ. A \U0001D445ଶ close to\
    \ 1 indicates that the model explains well the \nvariance of observations. It\
    \ is expressed as \U0001D445ଶ  In Equation (17): \nFigure 5. Block diagram of\
    \ the predictive irrigation scheduling system. t is the time in days, m, n, and\
    \ j\nare past time steps.\n3.5. Model Evaluation Criteria\nTo assess the performance\
    \ of the trained models for the prediction of the soil moisture content\nduring\
    \ the model evaluation, several measures of accuracy were applied. The model’s\
    \ accuracy\nbetween the observed and predicted soil moisture content was evaluated\
    \ using the coefﬁcient of\ndetermination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE),\

    of observations. It is expressed as R2 In Equation (17):\nR2 = ∑N\ni=1(yi − y)2\

    \ their predictive performance, and the performance\nof the predictive irrigation\
    \ scheduling system are presented and evaluated in this section.\n4.1. Model Structure\n\
    The model structure and hyper-parameters of the neural network (NN) models were\
    \ determined\nthrough a ﬁve-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. The\
    \ model structures which achieved the\nbest performance for the one-day-ahead\
    \ prediction of the soil moisture content across the different\nsites are summarized\
    \ in Table 4.\nTable 4. The identiﬁed model structure with the best one-day-ahead\

    \ lag associated with the climatic inputs, M is the time lag associated with the\
    \ precipitation input, and J\nis the time lag associated with the past soil moisture\
    \ content input.\nTable 4 shows that a ﬁrst-order model taking the precipitation,\
    \ climatic variables, and soil moisture\ncontent at the present day as inputs\
    \ is able to predict the soil moisture content of the next day for the\nsandy\
    \ loam (Baluderry) and loam (Stoughton) sites. For the heavier textured clay site\
    \ (Waddeston),\nthe soil moisture content at the next day is dependent on the\
    \ precipitation and soil moisture during\nthe present and previous day. This can\
    \ be explained by the low inﬁltration capacity of heavier textured\nsoils. The\
    \ precipitation input on any day may take a time period greater than a day to\
    \ completely\ninﬁltrate the soil column.\nIt was also found that a single layer\
    \ of neurons and memory blocks in both the FFNN and the\nLSTM is able to satisfactorily\
    \ model the soil moisture dynamics across all the sites. Additional layers\ncould\
    \ not further improve the learning capabilities of both networks. As an example,\
    \ the performance\nof NN models with the same model structure with those listed\
    \ in Table 4 but with two hidden layers\nare presented in Table 5. The two-layer\
    \ models achieve a lower prediction accuracy across all sites.\nMoreover, as part\
    \ of the model training experiments, the best cross-validation performance achieved\
    \ by\nan FFNN, which included only a z-score transformation of the modelled data\
    \ was an R2 value of 0.68.\nTable 5. Training cross-validation performance of\

    \ Prediction\nThe prediction capability of a model is exempliﬁed by its performance\
    \ on data not seen by the\nmodel during training. As such, the prediction capability\
    \ of the models was tested on the evaluation\ndataset set aside for each of the\
    \ model training sites.\nThe prediction performance of a non-machine learning\
    \ baseline which predicts the soil moisture\ncontent at a particular day as the\
    \ average soil moisture content of the three previous days is presented\nin Table\
    \ 6. This is presented along with the prediction performance of the trained NN\
    \ models. A model\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n14 of 22\nwill only be accepted as\
    \ skillful if its performance surpasses that of the non-machine learning baseline.\n\
    This is considered a good practice for approaching predictive modelling tasks\
    \ [81].\nTable 6. Prediction performance of the non-machine learning (naïve) and\

    \ the non-machine learning (naïve)\nbaseline across all the sites. Therefore,\
    \ the NN models can be accepted as being skillful. The FFNN\nand LSTM models are\
    \ also shown to achieve a comparable prediction performance across all sites.\n\
    However, it is interesting that the LSTM achieves a comparable performance to\
    \ the FFNN without\nextensive pre-processing of input data. This highlights the\
    \ ability of the LSTM to sufﬁciently learn the\nunderlying function approximating\
    \ dynamic data [51]. This ability is particularly desirable because the\ndata\
    \ pre-processing pipeline applied for the FFNN required subjective human intervention,\
    \ which may\nnot lead to an improvement in model performance for more complex\
    \ dynamic systems.\nThe soil moisture predicted by the FFNN and LSTM models along\
    \ with the observed soil moisture\ncontent for the evaluation dataset is presented\
    \ in Figure 6. Figure 6 shows that the LSTM models are\nable to accurately model\
    \ the soil moisture dynamics while capturing its dominant modes. The LSTM\nmodels\
    \ are also able to respond to perturbation from the precipitation input shown\
    \ in the stem plots.\nAgain, it is clear that the LSTM model is able to achieve\
    \ a performance comparable to that of the FFNN\nwith minimal input data pre-processing.\n\
    There have been previous attempts in literature to model the soil moisture dynamics\
    \ and predict\nthe soil moisture content in order to aid irrigation scheduling.\
    \ Delgoda et al. [25] presented a\nlinear dynamic model with assumptions made\
    \ on the absence of saturation ﬂows. This lead to a\ndegradation in the modelling\
    \ results. The saturation ﬂows are a nonlinear function of the soils\nhydraulic\
    \ properties [29]. The LSTM models presented in this study are able to implicitly\
    \ learn such\nnonlinear relations during training. This is done during the adjustment\
    \ of the network weights in\norder to deﬁne a function relating the climatic and\
    \ precipitation inputs to the soil moisture content.\nSince soil moisture depends\
    \ on the balance between water input and output, saturation ﬂows have\nbeen incorporated\
    \ in the LSTM model. Lozoya et al. [30] highlighted the need to parametrize several\n\
    linear dynamics models for the prediction of soil moisture content for any particular\
    \ site. This was\nattributed to the differing dynamics at saturation, the available\
    \ water content, and that the permanent\nwilting point was not reached. The LSTM\
    \ models are able to model these nonlinearities for the entire\nrange of a site’s\
    \ soil moisture content. The use of a single model for the entire range of operation\n\
    of a process is usually favored for decision support purposes because of the need\
    \ to ensure simple\ndebugging and test procedures [82]. This may become complex\
    \ when several models are used as part\nof a decision support system. This gives\
    \ further evidence in favor of the application of the LSTM\nmodels for the purpose\
    \ of soil moisture prediction and irrigation scheduling.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n\

    \ Sites\nFor the purpose of irrigation scheduling, it may be necessary to predict\
    \ the soil moisture content\nfor a new site for which historical data required\
    \ to train an NN model is not available. The predictions\nwill be generated using\
    \ the climatic and soil variables of the new site as input into a model trained\n\
    exclusively with data from another site. As such, the ability of the LSTM models\
    \ to generate soil\nmoisture predictions for independent sites using models from\
    \ the training sites was evaluated.\nThe prediction performance of the trained\
    \ LSTM and FFNN models for these independent sites\nis presented in Table 7.\n\

    \ shows that the LTSM models generate accurate predictions for the independent\
    \ sites,\nand these predictions outperform those generated by the FFNN in terms\
    \ of R2 scores. This is because of\nthe dynamic nature of the LSTM, which enables\
    \ it to generate predictions as a function of model inputs\nand state maintained\
    \ for a learned past time period. Table 7 also shows that the FFNN is unable to\n\
    achieve a good prediction performance when the model trained in Baluderry was\
    \ applied for prediction\nin Independent Site 1. This may be because the data\
    \ pre-processing steps applied on the training data\nwere not applicable to the\
    \ data of Independent Site 1. This further highlights the robustness of the\n\
    LSTM model, which is able to sufﬁciently learn the underlying function approximating\
    \ the dynamic\ndata. The data in Table 7 demonstrates the excellent approximation\
    \ ability of the LSTM, which makes\nthem useful for generating prediction for\
    \ processes with an underlying dynamics similar to the process\nthey were trained\
    \ on. This approximation ability of the LSTM has been widely exploited in the\
    \ ﬁeld of\ntime series forecasting where a single LSTM model is trained to predict\
    \ data points for a time series\nbelonging a common cluster [83].\nThe applicability\
    \ of data-driven models trained for a particular site for prediction in a different\n\
    site will further enhance the precision water management of various crops. Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [22]\nshowed that models that are able to generalize to new sites not\
    \ included in the model development are\ndifﬁcult to realize using traditional\
    \ machine learning methods. The excellent generalization ability of\nthe LSTM\
    \ presents an opportunity for the development of multi-site soil moisture prediction\
    \ models\nas demonstrated by the robust performance of the LSTM models presented\
    \ in this study when tested\non the independent sites.\n4.4. Application in Predictive\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling\nIn this study, the purpose of modelling the soil moisture\
    \ dynamics is to generate predictions of\nthe volumetric soil moisture content\
    \ which is required for predictive irrigation scheduling. As such,\nthe LSTM model\
    \ developed for each of the training sites was applied as part of a predictive\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling system, which was evaluated alongside a rule-based system\
    \ using AQUACROP simulations\nof the potato-growing season. The resulting soil\
    \ moisture deficit for the predictive and rule-based systems,\nand the lower bound\
    \ deficit during simulations for the three training sites are shown in Figure\
    \ 7.\nIt should be noted that the negative deﬁcit values in Figure 7 indicate\
    \ soil moisture values\nabove the ﬁeld capacity, hence overwatering. Figure 7\
    \ shows that, in the heavy textured clay site\n(Waddeston), the predictive system\
    \ violates the lower bound threshold during the mid-growing season.\nThis occurred\
    \ because the LSTM model applied in predicting the soil moisture content was not\
    \ trained\nspeciﬁcally for the potato crop. The high mid-season water demand of\
    \ potato altered the dynamics\nlearned by the model. Nevertheless, it can be seen\
    \ that the deﬁcits are close to the lower bound\nthreshold and they are later\
    \ minimized. It can also be seen that, across all sites, the rule-based system\n\
    tends to over-irrigate, as indicated by the negative deﬁcit values. Overall, the\
    \ predictive system is able\nto maintain the soil moisture deﬁcits within the\
    \ allowable range and is able to account for the change\nin crop water requirements\
    \ over the growing season.\nSensors 2018, 18, 3408\n17 of 22\nSensors 2018, 18,\

    \ immensely beneﬁt from automated decision support\nsystems that integrate climatic\
    \ and soil moisture measurements with a robust data-driven model of\nthe soil\
    \ moisture dynamics. This technology development will facilitate the prediction\
    \ of crop water\nneeds and an improvement in water conservation.\nThis paper has\
    \ presented a dynamic neural network approach for modelling the time series\n\
    of soil moisture content. The performance of the LSTM for the prediction of soil\
    \ moisture content\nwas evaluated for three sites with different soil characteristics.\
    \ Using an independent evaluation\ndataset, the LSTM models developed for the\
    \ sites achieved accuracies (R2 > 0.94) for a one-day-ahead\nprediction. The LSTM\
    \ models also generated accurate soil moisture predictions for independent sites\n\
    not used in training the models.\nThe use of the LSTM models in predictive irrigation\
    \ scheduling was also demonstrated using\nAQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing\
    \ season. The performance of the proposed predictive\nirrigation scheduling system\
    \ was evaluated by comparing its irrigation policies to those of a rule-based\n\
    system. The predictive system was able to maintain the soil moisture deﬁcit within\
    \ allowable limits\nfor the most part of the simulated growing season while minimizing\
    \ over-irrigation. Furthermore,\nthe predictive system was able to achieve a yield\
    \ and WUE similar to that achieved by the rule-based\nsystem using lower irrigation\
    \ application depths.\nFor future research, the predictive system should be extended\
    \ to include rainfall forecasts.\nThis will ensure that irrigation is optimized\
    \ to further increase water savings through the maximum\nutilization of forecasted\
    \ rainfall depths. The development of crop-speciﬁc LSTM models trained on a\n\
    rich dataset obtained from sites with similar soil types will enhance the adoption\
    \ of data-driven soil\nmoisture models for use in irrigation scheduling applications.\n\

    \ the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited or depleting\nfresh\
    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\
    \ semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent\ndevelopment of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application,\nand\
    \ impacts of VRI, including proﬁtability using this technology, with a focus on\
    \ agronomic factors\nin precision water management. The development in sprinkler\
    \ systems enabled irrigation application\nwith greater precision at the scale\
    \ of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate\nVRI\
    \ prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different\
    \ environments.\nOn-farm trials and whole-ﬁeld studies are needed to provide support\
    \ information for practical\nVRI applications. Future research also needs to address\
    \ the adjustment of the spatial distribution of\nprescription zones in response\
    \ to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions,\n\
    which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive\
    \ decision\nsupport tools are required to help the user decide where to apply\
    \ how much irrigation water at\ndifferent crop growth stages to optimize water\
    \ use and crop production based on the regional climate\nconditions and cropping\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: variable-rate irrigation; precision agriculture; irrigation\
    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\

    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n3 of 21\nmanagement, many producers are reluctant to adopt\
    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\
    \ ﬂow\nrate remains constant. This system does not need additional hardware on\
    \ the existing pivot irrigation\nsystem. The variable zone control system can\
    \ vary the speed of the center and change the application\nrate along the pivot\
    \ lateral. This system applies different irrigation depths to different areas\
    \ of the ﬁeld\nby turning sprinklers on and off for various amounts of time. Trimble\
    \ (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale,\nCA, USA) has developed the Irrigate-IQ Variable-Rate\
    \ Irrigation System. This system incorporates\nthe VFD and variable speed drive\
    \ (VSD) into the recent optimal ﬂow VRI that works with standard\npump equipment\
    \ on wells with limited capacity. This system is capable of individual nozzle\
    \ control,\nwhich can apply the right amount of water in the right place more\
    \ accurately [47]. Currently, it is\npossible to achieve sector control with very\
    \ small resolution, and zone control can add irrigation zones\nfurther to the\
    \ sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study conducted\
    \ in Canada to\nevaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy of water\
    \ application was up to 90% in the\ncenter pivot system [49]. However, the performance\
    \ of these irrigation systems in ﬁeld applications is\naffected by many factors,\
    \ such as ﬁeld attributes, the spatial resolution of the sensors used in irrigation\n\
    management and temporal resolution of data inputs, as well as unexpected environmental\
    \ conditions.\nHence, adaptive irrigation management strategies and active research\
    \ support are required to enhance\nthe adoption and application of VRI [20,50].\n\

    \ Hence, it is critical\nto quantify the variability of terrain attributes and\
    \ soil properties for VRI applications.\n3.1. Topography\nTopographic variation\
    \ is a common characteristic of large agricultural ﬁelds that result in spatial\n\
    variability of soil water and ultimately crop yield [52]. Topography or terrain\
    \ has two types of attributes,\nprimary and secondary attributes [53]. Primary\
    \ attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, curvature,\nﬂow length, and upslope\
    \ contributing area. Secondary attributes are derived empirically from several\n\
    primary attributes to characterize speciﬁc processes manifesting in the landscape,\
    \ mainly including\nsediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI),\
    \ ﬂow direction, ﬂow accumulation, distance\nto ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL),\
    \ and wetness index [53,54]. Topographic properties affect soil physical\nand\
    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    all metrics Abstract Presently, wireless sensor network (WSN) plays important
    role in engineering, science, agriculture and many other field like surveillance,
    military applications, smart cars etc. Precision agriculture (PA) is one of the
    field in which WSN is widely adopted. The aim of the adoption of WSNs in PA is
    to measure the different environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, PH value of soil etc., for enhancing the quantity and quality of
    crops. Further, the WSNs are also helped to reduce the consumptions of the natural
    resources used in farming. Hence, the aim of this review is to identify the various
    WSNs technologies adopted for precision agriculture and impact of these technologies
    to achieve smart agriculture. This review also focuses on the different environmental
    parameters like irrigation, monitoring, soil properties, temperature for achieving
    precision agriculture. Further, a detailed study is also carried out on different
    crops which are covered using WSNs technologies. This review also highlights on
    the different communication technologies and sensors available for PA. To analyze
    the impact of the WSNs in agriculture field, several research questions are designed
    and through this review, we are tried to find the solutions of these research
    questions. Similar content being viewed by others Wireless Sensor Network in Agriculture:

    Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the networks
    which are composed of sensor nodes. These sensor nodes help in sensing, gathering
    and measuring the information from the surroundings where they are deployed and
    transmit the data to the users. A WSN has small or we can say no infrastructure
    and having number of sensor nodes in it from ten to thousands which works together
    to monitor a area where they are deployed.WSN are classified into two categories
    structured and unstructured. Structured WSN are those which are deploy in proper
    manner into a specific area and can be easily configured if there is any problem
    in a senor nodes whereas unstructured WSN are those in which sensors nodes are
    deploy in bulk without any proper architecture these type of WSN are mainly found
    in those area where it is difficult for humans to reach easily and obtain data
    from that area. In unstructured WSN, it is difficult to take care of sensor nodes
    if they stop working or issue of node failure occurs. Wireless sensor network
    are classified into five types to monitor the parameters of surface of earth,
    underground conditions, underwater conditions, multimedia and to monitor the area
    by the help of movement of sensors. These five types of sensors are defined as
    Terrestrial WSN-In this type of WSNs, huge number of nodes are deploy into a surface
    of land that can help to examine the conditions of land. Underground WSN- As the
    name depict underground WSN are networks of sensor nodes which are deployed in
    caves, mines or underground surface for monitoring the condition of soil, moisture
    and military boarder monitoring. Underwater WSN- In this WSNs, sensors are deployed
    in the region of oceans, rivers for underwater surveillance. Multi-media WSN-It
    is a network consists of sensors nodes that have ability to store, process and
    access multi-media data such as video data, audio files and pictures. Mobile WSN-
    In this network, sensor nodes have the ability to move from one place to other.
    The application of such networks is military surveillance, monitoring of area,
    tracking of target, monitoring under water [1]. In WSNs, sensors are integrated
    with a radio transceiver and a set of electronics components which helps in transmission
    of data from source to destination. Sensor nodes have capability to organize themselves
    to create ad hoc, multi-hop network which helps in creating communication link
    between nodes. User can give commands to sensors; as a response of these commands
    sensors can transmit data to the user for example a particular limit of temperature
    is assign to the sensor with the help of embedded language if temperature exceeds
    from that assigned value than sensor provides information to the user [2]. 1.1
    Wireless Sensor Network in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is a crop
    management concept which allows farmers for managing spatial and temporal variability
    with in the agricultural field such as reduction of natural resources, irrigation
    management, production management, fertilizer management, intrusion attacks, and
    real time data monitoring [3]. The aim behind the adoption of sensors in precision
    agriculture is to enhance the overall production of crops. Sensors can help for
    measuring various parameters of agriculture land like humidity, soil moisture,
    climatic condition, intrusion detection, water level which facilitate that can
    lead to better production [4]. Further, sensor can collect the information regarding
    various parameters and process the collected information for better farming. The
    significant role of sensors in agricultural field is listed below (Fig. 1). Fig.

    Full size image 1.2.4 Citation Criteria For this review, the articles published
    in SCI listed journals are considered. To collect the good literature review,
    several search strings are designed which are mentioned in Sect. 2.3. But these
    search strings are not capable to distinguish articles published in SCI listed
    journals and non SCI listed journals. So, the separation between SCI and non SCI
    listed journals are done manually and all the articles published in non SCI listed
    journals and conferences are not included. The search strings also find number
    of articles based on wireless sensor networks, but these articles are not related
    to precision agriculture. These articles include new routing mechanisms, energy
    efficiency in WSNs, topology setup, enhanced WSNs protocols, latency etc. Such
    types of articles are discarded. The articles considered for this review are published
    in SCI listed journals. Table 1 shows the list of journals as well as number of
    articles taken from the individual journal. Table 1 Illustartes the categorization
    of articles with journals Full size table 2 Literature Survey This section of
    paper describes the literature survey of various research articles related to
    precision agriculture using wireless sensor network. This section includes various
    techniques, sensors, algorithms and sensor motes used for collecting information
    from agricultural fields. The literature survey on the usability of sensor nodes
    in PA is divided into three categories. These categories are (1) Monitoring of
    Crops (2) Irrigation Management of Crops (3) Environmental parameters for Crops
    2.1 Monitoring This subsection describes the works reported on monitoring of the
    crops. Sanchez et al. [6] proposed an integrated wireless sensor network as a
    solution for precision agriculture. This model can help to assimilate crop data
    acquisition, transmission of data from the end user and video-supervision task.
    The main objective this model is to secure the crops from intruders and identification
    of same in the agriculture field. The detection and identification of intruders
    are done with help of video surveillance. High consumption of energy and end to
    end delay problems are remain unsolved. The different hardware prototypes have
    been implemented for crop monitoring devices. The detection intruder is measured
    using infrared motion sensors and identification is consummated with the help
    of camera sensors. Zhang et al. [7] proposed a method to monitor vigor of the
    plant with the help of WSNs. In this work, the vigor of the plant is non-violently
    monitored through embedded and image processing technology. If unusual behaviour
    of a plant is identified during monitoring process, then warning message is sent
    to end users. With the help of wireless sensor nodes deployed in the field’s wastage
    of resources which are needed for cultivation of plant are minimised. Proposed
    method based on data fusion of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation helps in providing
    the well-organized way for monitoring the strength of plant in many phases of
    agriculture. Zou et al. [8] proposed an algorithm named as OASNDFA for achieving
    intelligent agricultural monitoring with minimum sensor nodes deploy in the field.
    The selection of location of nodes is difficult in hilly areas due graphical and
    weather conditions. This algorithm helps to find the suitable location of nodes.
    This algorithm works in three phases. The first phase considers the different
    relevant factor. In second phase, a mathematical model is designed with the help
    of relevant factors. The third phase consists of key points with maximum features.
    These features are computed through mathematical model. To address the vulnerable
    dynamic topology problem for monitoring the crops, Jiang et al. [9] proposed an
    algorithm based on tree topology, called dynamic converge cast tree algorithm
    (DCTA). This algorithm is employed within the monitoring system of WSN. The aim
    of the proposed algorithm is to obtain better data attainment for monitoring of
    growth of plant. The DCTA algorithm having three stages i.e. (a) routing which
    is based on dynamic routing (b) adaptable time slot scheduling (c) compilation
    and examination of data. This algorithm provides high data transmission between
    nodes. For real time monitoring of the agriculture filed, Kim et al. [10] proposed
    an WSNs architecture based on beacon mode with autonomous. This architecture provides
    the solutions for the problems like fire, intrusion attack, and lack of availability
    of resources. The proposed architecture is worked on the TinyOS platform and further,
    multiple beacon scheduling in the MAC layer with bop slots is considered. The
    dynamic address allocations and path recovery process for unexpected link is addressed
    on the network layer. The results staed that the proposed architecture having
    reliable transmission ratio for a real-time processing service like fire and emergency
    agriculture monitoring systems under heavy traffic environments. Intrusion attacks
    are one of the major issues faced by farmers. Because, intruders destroy the agriculture
    fields and leads to decrease in productivity. To address the same, Bapat et al.
    [11] proposed a wireless sensor network to protect farms from animal attacks.
    Sensor nodes equipped with PIR sensors, sound sensors, light flashers and RF module
    are deployed in agriculture field. Sensor nodes that are located near to boundaries
    of field detect animal entry and send information to the central base station.
    From the central base station, the information is sent to end users. To monitor
    the variability of nitrogen gas and biomass foe sugarcane crop, Portz et al. [12]
    proposed active crop sensor model based on WSNs. The results revealed that the
    proposed model is capable to indicate demand of nitrogen and biomass in sugarcane
    fields. The nitrogen sensor helps to detect the variability of biomass and nitrogen
    and preventing action can be taken for supplying the biomass and nitrogen into
    sugarcane crop. Reiser et al. [13] proposed WSNs based system for autonomous navigation
    of agriculture field. The proposed system comprises of location of nodes deployed
    in agriculture field and data attainment. The proposed system has advantages over
    the narrow transmission range of nodes. This system is effectively detected the
    faulty nodes. Smiljkovikj et al. [14] proposed an intelligent cloud based system
    named as Smartwine which monitors the wine production process using grapes. It
    works on sensor network platform having centralized server system which allows
    more than one users to use system simultaneously. The Smartwine system helps in
    decrease the cost of energy, water, resources and pesticides use for wine production.
    To monitor the agricultural production process, Diaz et al. [15] proposed a methodology
    which have seven phases that are (1) Study the condition of environment. (2) Design
    of sensor network architecture. (3) Role and Importance. (4) Implementation. (5)
    Simulation (6) Deployment. (7) Maintenance. The designed methodology represents
    the importance of wireless sensor in agricultural field and provides strong foundation
    for building applications with high productivity gain. To monitor the crops in
    green house and orchard, Zhu et al. [16] developed a monitoring system based on
    WSNs. The capabilities of the proposed system are evaluated using three different
    scenarios such as greenhouse, open farmland and orchard. The proposed system gives
    better reliable communication between sensors nodes deployed in agriculture fields.
    Further, it is also seen that rate of packet loss is significantly decreased.
    To attaining less management cost and high productivity in cultivation of crops,
    Srbinovska et al. [17] proposed WSNs based architecture for vegetable greenhouse.
    The developed system analyzes the various environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and light, for optimal conditions of crops. It is revealed that the proposed
    system would be able to improve the productivity and quality of crop. A review
    on infrastructure of WSNs for precision agriculture is presented in [18]. Further,
    in this work, a hybrid WSN model based on terrestrial WSNs and underground sensor
    network for precision agriculture is proposed. The objective of the proposed model
    is to reduce the human efforts for collecting agricultural information. It is
    seen that the proposed model provides information regarding agriculture fields
    more efficiently and accurately than existing sensor networks. To address approximate
    inference problem in agriculture field, Abouzar et al. proposed RSSI (received
    signal strength indicator) based-distributed Bayesian localization algorithm for
    message passing [19]. The proposed algorithm avoids communication overhead and
    minimizes computational complexity. El-kader et al. [20] proposed a precision
    farming solution model for potato crop [20]. In the proposed model, soil testing
    of land is done through sensor nodes whether the land is suitable for cultivation
    or not. This model also provides the facilities of better irrigation and fertilization
    scheduling to reduce natural resources. Further, it is noticed that APTEEN protocol
    is adopted for better routing paths. To monitor the parameters of soil, Georgieva
    et al. [21] designed a WSNs based monitoring model. The proposed monitoring model
    computes the different parameters of soil like temperature, humidity, conductivity
    and amount of acid. The arduino platform is used to integrate the different components
    of the proposed monitoring model. For providing better and qualitative connectivity
    and coverage of sensors in agriculture field, Kaiwartya et al. [22] designed a
    system for multi-metric quality measurement for deployed sensor nodes. In this
    work, seven metrics are designed for the sensor deployment and the optimal connectivity
    between the sensor nodes is measured. Lam et al. [23] developed a wireless sensor
    module for rural monitoring and precision agriculture applications. In their work,
    specification like received signal strength indicator (RSSI), packet reception
    ratio (PRR) of wireless sensor module was tested as compared with commercial products.
    The designed modules have capability to give optimal solution for real-world applications.
    Further, it can provide better applications for precision agriculture like reduce
    energy consumption of nodes, prediction of pest or disease and improved quality
    of crops. For better coverage of agriculture field, An et al. [24] proposed an
    effective technique for sensor deployment based on field information coverage.
    In this work, two polynomial-time algorithms are presented. The work of the first
    algorithm is to find the location of deployed sensors. Whereas, second is to identify
    the locations of relay nodes with minimum number of relay nodes in between source
    to destination. It is seen that the good trade-off between sensor nodes is obtained.
    To fruit recognition and disease detection, Lee et al. [25] designed a sensing
    system integrated with yield mapping system, sensors for detecting disease, devris
    detectors, an N detector for precision agriculture using ground and aerial based
    platforms. The proposed sensing system can measure the soil phosphorus detection,
    detection of nutrient in soil and grain insect detection with the help of NIR
    and RAMAN spectroscopy. To monitor the frost in vineyard, Valente et al. [26]
    proposed a collaborative system based on WSNs and robot. The aerial robot can
    be worked as dynamic node and it can be responsible for communication between
    agriculture field and base station. Further, in this work, UAV and WSN are combined
    for surveying fragmented crop fields. Zhang et al. [27] designed a remote monitoring
    system based on WSNs for collecting agricultural information. This monitoring
    system is based on ZigBee and GPRS wireless communication technologies. The agriculture
    data is collected through CC2430. The ARM9 processors are adopted to design base
    station. The proposed system is more feasible than other existing systems in terms
    of feasibility and it also conserve water content in agriculture field efficiently.
    Li et al. [28] proposed a monitoring system based on WSNs for greenhouse. The
    proposed system includes cluster of sensor nodes, base station and data centre.
    The JN5139 micro-processor is used for designing wireless nodes and further, ZigBee
    protocol is used for communication purpose. The proposed monitoring system is
    a low-cost, expandable and reliable model with better processing capability. Park
    el al. [29] designed an environmental monitoring system to prevent dew condensation
    in greenhouse. The proposed environmental system integrates the Bahrenburg formula
    to compute the dew point of leaves. Further, the dew condensation is prevented
    on the surface of crops which to prevent diseases infection. To monitors the environmental
    parameters, Carrascosa et al. [30] proposed an open source based hardware model
    for precision agriculture. The proposed model contains two main components i.e.
    hardware and software. The hardware component of the model is responsible to record
    environmental parameters, whereas, software component connect the device with
    data server. The characteristics of open source hardware model are low acquisition
    cost and less complexity for customization. Table 2 summarizes the work reported
    on monitoring of different crops. Table 2 Depicts the work reported on crop monitoring
    Full size table 2.2 Irrigation Management This subsection presents the literature
    works on irrigation management for the crops. To optimize the water content in
    agriculture field, Gutierrez et al. [31] proposed an automated irrigation system
    based on WSNs. The proposed irrigation system comprises of distributed wireless
    network of soil-moisture and temperature sensors. It is seen that the proposed
    system is feasible, cost effective and also reduce the amount of water content
    needed to the crops. To address the drought and tolerance issues of crops, Levy
    et al. [32] developed a method for irrigation management and enhancement of tolerance
    for the crops. It is observed that lack of water, drought, heat and salinity can
    affect the production of the crop. With the help of proposed method, all these
    factors are analyzed and it is concluded that required amount of the water is
    supplied through the proposed system to the crops. Further, it is noticed that
    micro-irrigation and drip irrigation systems helps farmer to conserve water. To
    measure the soil variability, Hedle et al. [33] adopted spatio-temporal modelling
    with high spatial resolution electromagnetic and digital elevation method data
    layers for quantify the variability of soil. Wireless sensor network with high
    temporal resolution dataset is used to mould the vibrant nature of soil moisture.
    The proposed approach is more accurate than a multiple linear regression modelling
    because it helps in providing best implementation of a variable rate irrigation
    system. For efficient use of irrigation system, Hellin et al. [34] developed an
    irrigation architecture based on WSNs for agriculture field. The proposed architecture
    helps in describing the design, optimization and development of an application
    to reduce the wastage of water. Sensor nodes which were deploy in fields are of
    good use they helps in reaching the required moisture condition to maintain water
    electrical conductivity level of the irrigation system at desired value through
    which there is a efficient management of water resources in agriculture field.
    To optimize agricultural irrigation, Nolz et al. [35] developed an irrigation
    model for monitoring the status of water in soil. In this work, two types of sensors
    are applied for measuring the potential of water in soil. These sensors are deployed
    under thin layer of soil to evaluate the status of water. It is noticed that the
    proposed irrigation model reduce the necessity of water to the crops effectively.
    A decision support system is developed for effective irrigation management in
    [36]. The proposed system comprises of sensor nodes, actuation network and fuzzy
    logic. The proposed method can reduce the wastage of water using fuzzy logic and
    actuation network. Further, it is observed that productivity of crop can be increased
    using this decision support system. Kim et al. [37] proposed an efficient water
    management system based on WSNs. In this work, the conventional irrigation system
    is replaced through an electronically controllable system for better irrigation
    management in agricultural fields. The proposed water management system is continuously
    monitored using GPS. Zhao et al. [38] designed an irrigation system based on soil
    water content and temporal stability. Further, in this work, water content and
    temporal stability is compared using VRI and URI to identify the location for
    deploying soil water sensors. In this work, temporal stability of soil moisture
    is evaluated regularly. It is seen that proposed irrigation system changes the
    overall similarity of soil moisture spatial patterns. It is also noticed that
    consumption of water is significantly reduced. To investigate the efficiency of
    linear move installed irrigation system, Chavez et al. [39] proposed a method
    for remote irrigation monitoring and control system (RIMCS). The proposed RIMCS
    system contains the pulsing nozzles and solenoids. The proposed system is also
    capable to vary the water rate. It is claimed that the proposed systems can monitor
    the flow of water, pressure of water, location and agriculture field. To control
    the irrigation in agriculture field, Maurya et al. [40] proposed a novel approach
    based on sensor technology. The sensor nodes are continuously sense soil temperature,
    moisture and humidity in agricultural field and transmits this information to
    base station. Further, in this work, region-based static clustering approach is
    used to provide efficient coverage over entire agricultural field. The proposed
    clustering approach uses the fuzzy logic technique to select best cluster head.
    This energy-efficient protocol is also compared with existing protocol like EEHC,
    DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR. To precisely monitor environmental conditions Sawant et
    al. [41] proposed a system. The proposed system helps in addresses the issues
    like standardized way of data discovery, access and sharing of data across various
    distributed sensor networks through the adaptation of a framework based on OGC
    standards for sensor SWE. The proposed system is a cost-effective, standardized
    sensing system which includes functionalities like sensor plug-n-play, remote
    monitoring, tools for crop water req. Estimation and nutrient management. A WSNs
    based irrigation software system is presented in [42]. The proposed system is
    named as WISC. The designed system provides real time monitoring of fields and
    remotes access to in-field information through WSN for irrigation purpose. For
    the proper irrigation in agriculture field, Coates et al. [43] proposed an irrigation
    model based on WSNs with valve control. The proposed model can sense the agriculture
    field for irrigation as well as also control the flow of water. Hence, in this
    work, manual control of irrigation valves is replaced through automatic control.
    To automate the irrigation process, Nikolidakis et al. [44] proposed an algorithm
    with collaboration of integrated system. This algorithm consists of advanced routing
    scheme i.e., ECHERP and provides efficient utilization of energy required for
    sensor motes. Nagarajan et al. [45] designed a sensor mote for sprinkler irrigation
    automation system. In the proposed work, humidity, temperature and PH sensors
    are used to control the water content of the agriculture field. The ZigBee communication
    technology is used for data transformation. Further, the GPRS system is adopted
    for data analyses and storing purpose. The proposed system is capable to perform
    real time monitoring and control water supply. An adaptable decision support system
    is proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [46]. The proposed system integrates sensors
    for monitoring soil, crop and climate in agriculture field. Further, this system
    is implemented in autonomous closed loop zone specific irrigation. This system
    is more effective in terms of agronomic performance as compared to traditional
    agricultural practices. Kim et al. [47] proposed a novel water monitoring system
    for reducing depletion of water resources. It is reported that fine-grained consumption
    of water resources can help farmers to pinpoint waste, and improve efficiency.
    The proposed water monitoring system can conserve the natural resources and also
    to reduce the amount of water needed by a crop. Masseroni et al. [48] designed
    a system for soil water monitoring and irrigation management. The proposed system
    is implemented using Arduino based open-hardware device. This system continuously
    measures the water level in the soil, especially in the root area. Further, this
    information is used to decide the irrigation timings. The proposed system reduces
    the water consumption significantly. An IOT based smart irrigation idea is presented
    in [49]. This irrigation system comprises of environmental sensors, web services
    and IOT devices. The proposal has deployed sampling algorithm successfully which
    will provide constraints for the sensor network. A model driven control strategy
    for irrigation in agriculture field is presented [50]. The aim of the proposed
    strategy is to provide right amount of water at right place in an agriculture
    field. Further, a predictive algorithm is incorporated in the proposed strategy
    for measuring the moisture content in soil. Table 3 presents the work reported
    in literature on different irrigation management system for precision agriculture.
    Table 3 Illustrates the work reported on irrigation system for achieving precision
    agriculture Full size table 2.3 Environmental Parameters This subsection describes
    the recent study reported on various environmental parameters like humidity, temperature,
    soil condition etc., to achieve precision agriculture. Rossel et al. [51] developed
    a soil sensing technique based on characterization of soil and environmental conditions.
    The objective of this technique is to improve the production of the crop and further,
    to reduce the environmental effects on crop. This technique measures and monitors
    the soil physical and biochemical attributes for better productivity. To compute
    and plot the spatial variability of soil, Bernardi et al. [52] developed a decision
    tool based on soil properties, yield and liming. The aim of this tool is to compute
    the fertilizer need and economic return of an alfalfa pasture. The vesper software
    is adopted to measure the spatial variability of soil and site-specific liming
    and fertilizer needed. Further, the information of fertility of soil is computed
    using spring software. It is revealed that it is an effective tool for mapping
    and evaluating the spatial variability of soil. Kuang et al. [53] developed a
    NIR spectroscopy based calibration model to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance
    mode. This model is adopted to examine the different spiking strategies and spiking
    ratios. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using 425 sample
    of soil. The results stated that the proposed model provides more correct and
    accurate information regarding soil OC, TN and MC. To measure the electrical conductivity
    of soil, Parrilla et al. [54] designed a system using electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) based apparent electrical conductivity technique for olive orchards. In
    this work, both wet and dry soil conditions are taken into consideration. Further,
    it is seen that to check the efficiency of proposed model, forty-eight soil samples
    are tested for soil texture and soil water content. It is stated that in both
    situation (wet and dry soil), proposed model gives the same information. The spatial
    variation of soil phosphorus(p), magnesium(mg), potassium(k) have been investigated
    using geostatistics, conventional statistics and a geographical information system
    in [55]. In this study, total five hundred thirty-seven soil samples are collected
    for this experiment. It is observed that this model provides useful information
    for agronomic and environmental management for crops. To design a low water cost
    WSNs, Bogena et al. [56] have tested the applicability of different water sensors
    like EC-5, EC-20 and TDR for measuring soil water content. The experiment is performed
    both in laboratory and field. It is seen that in laboratory, the performance of
    the water sensors are almost same. But, in field, there is significant difference
    between the performances of the different water sensors. Authors claimed that
    EC-5 water sensor gives better accurate results among all other sensors and it
    is best suitable sensor to design low water cost WSNs. To measure the climate
    change mitigation strategies for ecosystem and agriculture, Knadel et al. [57]
    presented a study on the self organic carbon parameter. In this study, two different
    agriculture fields are taken into consideration and mapped using Veris mobile
    sensor platform. Further, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain different field
    of spectra. The objective of this study is to identify either a single sensor
    or fusion of sensors can provide best predictive accuracy for SOC parameters.
    It is seen that the fusion of sensors is obtained best predictive accuracy for
    SOC parameter. Further, it is observed that low cost robust calibration model
    can be developed on the basis of Vires mobile platform. A soil property monitoring
    system based on WSNs is presented in [58]. The proposed system is deployed in
    the wheat field to measure the soil properties. It is seen that proposed system
    provides more than 95% real time information of soil parameters. Ritsema et al.
    [59] developed a stand-alone wireless embed network system for continuous monitoring
    of water contents at different depths. Further, this system is associated with
    web application to display the real time results for end users. To monitor the
    soil moisture dynamics from top depth, Majone et al. [60] presented a multi hop
    WSNs based monitoring system for orchards. In this work, sensors are deployed
    on different depth level i.e. 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80 cm. The proposed system is
    based on independent sensors that can provide both real time and historic data.
    It is revealed that distribution of soil moisture can affect the production of
    orchards. To find the low cost sensor and better frequency range for measuring
    moisture content, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil, Kizito et al.
    [61] evaluated ECH2O sensors family in the range of 5–150 MHz frequencies. The
    results concluded that ECH2O-TE sensor gives the better results at 70 MHz. The
    relationship and precision between volumetric soil water content and volumetric
    soil water content sensed are determined through four commercial soil moisture
    sensor systems in [62]. It is revealed that only the IM and RB systems are identified
    the high corelation between volumetric soil water content and volumetric soil
    water content sensed. Brocca et al. [63] assessed the reliability of soil moisture
    estimations through ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors. In their work, fourteen different
    sites of four different countries is taken into consideration. It is stated that
    AMSR-E sensor provides the high correlation between the observed and modelled
    data using LPRM algorithm. A review on the soil properties using remote sensing
    technique is presented in [64]. To characterize the underground wireless network
    and the basic problems for better communication in agricultural field, Vuran et
    al. [65] derived advance channel models. The proposed model helps in analyzing
    bit error rate for two different networks. The results obtain from field measurements
    used in evaluating parameters of soil and the effects of variation in moisture
    of soil. To measure the temperature of agriculture field, Badia-melis et al. [66]
    evaluate the behaviour of various sensors under the three temperature ranges that
    are 5 °C, 23 °C and 35 °C. Three wireless sensor network devices with different
    sensors are compared with four RIFD tags to get the information of behaviour of
    various sensors. Two alternative methods were used to adjust experimental data.
    For monitoring and modelling temperature variations inside silage stacks, Green
    et al. [67] designed a wireless mote which is deployed at different location.
    The proposed system helps in detection of temperature variation during decomposition
    of silage. To obtain real time information about environmental parameters of greenhouse,
    Jahnavi et al. [68] developed a smart wireless system. The designed system helps
    in giving optimal use of resources and water required for cultivation of crops.
    Microcontroller in designed system helps in transmitting and receiving data from
    sensor nodes to gateway node. Users can get real time information of greenhouse
    through web application where data is transmitted through gateway node. To control
    the eexchange of water and energy of heat between the agricultural field and atmosphere,
    Jackson et al. [69] designed a temperature and moisture sensor. The developed
    sensors are composed of micro machined MEMS cantilever beams which are equipped
    with water sensitive sensors. The variation in resistance of the sensor due to
    moisture depends on the cantilever beam thickness. For measuring temperature of
    agricultural field, Martinez et al. [70] proposed a cost-effective system named
    as LITAS. The designed system evaluates infrared thermometry and thermal imaging
    which supervised water stress level of the plant. The LITAS system tested in the
    field of sugar beet and the measurements of LITAS were compared to canopy temperature(TC)
    which is obtain from thermal images. Pierce et al. [71] deployed a two WSNs for
    agricultural process, one wireless sensor network is designed for regional-scale
    applications, such as weather stations and the second network is designed for
    on-farm applications such as monitoring of temperature for protecting agricultural
    field from frost. To monitor physiological condition of plants, Mahan et al. [72]
    proposed a smart cop IRT. The designed system is cost effective which can be easily
    deployed in large areas and helps in providing wireless operations that are more
    appropriate in various research and applications. To monitor climatic conditions
    such as temperature, humidity and amount of soil moisture. In agricultural field
    Mendez et al. [73] designed a Wi-Fi based network which is capable to intelligently
    monitor the condition of agricultural field in a designed manner. Table 4 summarizes
    the work reported on enviromental parameters to achieve precision agricluture.
    Table 4 Summarizes the work reported on environmental parameters of precision
    agriculture Full size table 3 WSNs Technologies in Precision Agriculture 3.1 Communication
    Technologies In wireless sensor communication various technologies are used to
    transmit the data from agriculture field to central point. The specification of
    these technologies is described in Table 5. Whereas, the WSNs communication technologies
    used in PA is given in Table 6. Table 5 Available communication technologies with
    specification for precision agriculture Full size table Table 6 Communication
    technology reported for precision agriculture in literature Full size table 1.
    ZigBee—ZigBee is low-cost, low-rate, and less-power consumer device as compared
    with other wireless technologies that helps in secure and efficient transmission
    of data from source to destination. By applying a wireless sensor network based
    on ZigBee to an agriculture field data regarding to the conditions of field is
    properly transmitted to the user at high data transmission rate [74]. 2. Bluetooth—Bluetooth
    is a small range, low-power consuming device for wireless sensor network which
    helps in transmit data from one user to other in a range of 100 meters. It operates
    on the frequency band of 2.4 GHz [75]. 3. Wi-Fi—wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) is IEEE
    standard 802.11b for wireless local area network which is operated in frequency
    band of 2.4 GHz deploy in a distributed way to cover the range of hundred meters.
    Wi-Fi is the most successful technology of wireless sensor networks few years
    ago Wi-Fi was only available on laptops but now a day’s Wi-Fi is easily available
    in cell phones, cameras, TV etc. [76]. 4. GPRS—general packet radio service (GPRS)
    provides fast speed of data transmission to the users. It uses the frequency range
    of 2.4 GHz. GPRS provides faster and long distance connection for data transmission.
    Range of GPRS is spread up to kilometres according to the coverage area of GPRS
    [77]. 5. WiMAX—worldwide inter-operability for microwave access (WiMAX) is an
    IEEE 802.16e standard used for a long distance communication technology. With
    the integration of WiMAX technology, the capacity of network can be raised up
    to 70 mbps [78]. 3.2 Sensors Used in PA Sensors provide huge contribution in various
    applications. In agriculture, sensors plays vital role for measuring various parameters
    of agricultural field. Tables 7, 8 show the different sensors that are used for
    precision agriculture. These tables also provide the details of temperature range
    and other capabilities of the sensors. Further, Table 9 illustrates the different
    sensor reported in the literature to monitor and measure the different parameters
    for achieving precision agriculture. Table 10 shows the list of different crops
    which are tested for precision agriculture using WSNs technology. Table 7 Sensor

    weather conditions Full size table Table 9 List of sensor reported for precision
    agriculture in literature work Full size table Table 10 List of crops reported
    for precision agriculture in literature work Full size table 4 Conclusion In this
    study, the adaptability of the WSN is explored in the field of precision agriculture.
    It is observed that there is the incremental growth to adopt the WSN in PA and
    having wide range of the applicability. It is reported that WSNs are widely used
    to monitor agricultural fields, optimize irrigation for the crops, measure temperature
    and soil properties. In this paper, seventy-eight articles are studied and arranged
    these articles into three different categories i.e. monitoring of the crops, irrigation
    management and environmental parameters management. Further, this review also
    discusses the different communication technologies of WSNs available for precision
    agriculture in literature. A list of different sensor used in PA is also given.
    The major contribution of this literature to scientific community is given below.
    RQ1) From literature, it is seen that number of techniques/tools are designed
    by various researchers for PA using WSNs. These tools are IMOTE2, Arduino, EZ430-RF2500,
    MDA300 sensor board, EZ43-RF2500, MDA300, Indriya, MICAZ, ZKOS, MSP430, PIC16F877,
    CVX toolbox, MOSEK, Veris mobile sensor platform, MDA320, MTS400. These tools
    integrate the different sensors on it and collect the information regarding various
    parameters of PA and this information is used for decision making. It is observed
    that Arduino platform is widely adopted as a platform to integrate different sensors
    due to low cost and ease to embed. It is also seen that some algorithms are also
    developed for effective monitoring and smart irrigation of crops. These algorithms
    include OASNDFA, DCTA, BOP, LAA, distributed localization algorithm, range based
    localization algorithms, polynomial-time algorithms for deployment of nodes, electromagnetic
    induction algorithm, MLR, PCR and PLSR methods. Some of new communication protocols
    are also reported in few research articles like APTEEN protocol, Fuzzy based energy
    efficient protocol, ECHERP. It is also revealed that the Tiny OS and Tiny OS 2.0
    are taken as operating system for sensors. RQ2) In precision agriculture, large
    numbers of sensors are adopted for collecting the real time information about
    the growth of crops as well as different environmental parameters like humidity,
    temperature, soil moisture etc. All these information is collected through randomly
    deployed sensor nodes. Further, this information is collected on a central point
    for processing purpose. The processed information is used in decision making and
    action is taken according the processed information. Table 9 shows the list of
    different sensors reported in literature. This table also illustrates the significance
    of each sensor and citation details of these sensors are also given. The working
    of few sensors is discussed as Sensor s8000 measures the PH parameter, HYDRA-PROBE
    II sensor measure conductivity, salinity, soil moisture, and temperature values.
    EC-10HS measure the moisture of soil, EC-5 sensor for measuring soil moisture,
    SHT-11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity, N-sensor for measuring the
    requirement of nitrogen to the crop, VH400 is a soil-moisture sensor which measure
    the amount of moisture present in soil, DS1822 sensor is used to measure the temperature,
    SEN-13322 sensors measure the volumetric content of water in the soil. It is found
    that PA cannot achieve without the help of these sensors. Table 8 illustrates
    the list of sensors used for measuring weather conditions. It is seen that in
    PA, most of works is reported on measuring the soil parameters. RQ3) Large numbers
    of crops are taken into consideration in literature to validate the applicability
    of the WSNs in agriculture. The aim to adopt the WSNs in agriculture is to monitor
    the crops, irrigation management and measure the different environmental parameters
    which are responsible for the growth and improved quality of the crops. Table
    10 demonstrates the list of crops which are considered for experimentation. It
    is found that eighteen different crops are taken by researchers to investigate
    the role of WSNs in agriculture. These crops include broccoli crop, cotton plant,
    orange orchards, orchid greenhouses, vinyl greenhouse, sugarcane field, grape
    farms, pepper vegetable greenhouse, potato crop, citrus and blueberry crop, maize
    field, wheat, peach orchards and many more. Further, it is observed that WSNs
    is widely used to monitor the growth of crops in green houses. RQ4) From literature,
    it is seen that five communication technologies are adopted in WSNs for PA. These
    communication technologies are described in Table 5. These are Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM and WiMAX. Out of these five techniques, only four techniques
    are used. Presently, WiMAX communication technology is not adopted in PA till
    date due to high cost and large size. Table 6 shows the various communication
    technologies cited in different research articles. It is concluded that most of
    researchers works with the ZigBee communication technology due to high transmission
    range and low cost and cited in twenty-seven research articles. The second most
    valuable communication technology is GSM/GPRS and it is cited in sixteen research
    articles. Apart from these, several points can be highlighted from this study.
    Seventy-eight SCI listed research articles are included in this study from thirty-five
    different journals. In PA, lot of works are reported on measuring soil parameters
    including soil moisture, PH value, soil temperature etc., for improving quality
    of crops. For effective monitoring and irrigation management, some algorithms
    are also presented by various researchers in the field of PA. Tiny OS and Tiny
    OS 2.0 are adopted as operating system for sensor nodes due to low complexity.
    It is noted that Arduino platform is widely adopted to integrate the different
    component of WSNs in PA. In PA, some work is also reported on communication protocols.
    Some of new communication protocols are developed for effective communication
    between different components of WSNs. This review also lightens on the communication
    technologies adopted in WSNs for PA. It is found that till date only four communication
    technologies is used. It is seen that widely adopted communication technology
    is ZigBee. A lot of crops have been investigated by using WSNs for precision agriculture.
    It is observed that vineyard crop is examined multiple times. EC-5 senor is widely
    used for measuring the soil moisture. Some works are also presented on the deployment
    of sensor nodes in agriculture filed. In few research articles, automatic irrigation
    model is also proposed and these models also reduce the human effort. Few of articles
    are reported on intrusion detection in the agriculture field. Hence, there is
    a scope of work in this direction. Lack of work is reported on the usability of
    fertilizers in the agriculture field. Abbreviations APTEEN: Adaptive periodic

  limitations: 'The paper primarily focuses on the use of WSNs for data collection
    and transmission in precision agriculture and does not delve into the specific
    algorithms or methodologies used for automated irrigation management.


    Additionally, the paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations
    of WSNs in precision agriculture, such as cost, scalability, and reliability issues.
    A more detailed discussion of these limitations would enhance the paper''s overall
    assessment of the applicability of WSNs in this domain.'

  analysis: "Variable rate nutrient application (VRNA) can provide to the field inorganic\
    \ fertilisers and manure by adjusting the mass flow rate and subsequently the\
    \ application rate of nutrients according to the specific needs of the crop locally\
    \ within the field. Inorganic fertiliser is either spread as liquid or solid granules,\
    \ while manure is spread as slurry or solid manure. VR liquid inorganic fertiliser\
    \ is spread using VR pesticide sprayer technology (mentioned later). \nVRNA is\
    \ executed by either applying a prescription map that was designed after receiving\
    \ data from the field using mainly canopy sensors that identify the status of\
    \ the crop and correlate it with nutrient needs or by combining the recording\
    \ and reacting procedure on-the-go, meaning simultaneously inorganic fertilizers\
    \ are distributed in the field using two main technologies, the spinner or centrifugal\
    \ spreaders that are based on a conveyor belt or chain that transfers the material\
    \ (granules) from the hopper until it falls on one or more spinning disks throwing\
    \ the particles into the field and the pneumatic spreaders that use airﬂow which\
    \ divides the granules over a piped spreading boom for uniform distribution [40,41].\
    \ In VRNA through spinner spreaders, the application rate is controlled by adjusting\
    \ the gate opening and/or changing the speed of the conveyor (and thus the input\
    \ rate of material). In pneumatic applicators, VRNA is executed by changing the\
    \ required slurry ﬂowrate based on an application map or real-time soil sensors,\
    \ combined with simultaneous measurements of the nitrogen content of the slurry,\
    \ the ground speed and working width of the vehicle [43,44]. Solid manure spreaders\
    \ work with an apron that pushes the manure towards a dispensing system [43,44].\n\
    As for slurry distribution in the field, the applicators work by either pressuring\
    \ the slurry tank (by changing the size of the gate that brings slurry to the\
    \ delivery system) or by pumping the slurry from the tank (by changing pump or\
    \ valve settings). VRNA is based on changing\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339  \n\
    26 of 28 \n\nthe required slurry ﬂowrate based on an application map or real-time\
    \ soil sensors, combined with simultaneous measurements of the nitrogen content\
    \ of the slurry, the ground speed and working width of the vehicle [43,44]. Solid\
    \ manure spreaders work with an apron that pushes the manure towards a dispensing\
    \ system [43,44].\nVariable rate nutrient application (VRNA) can reduce the fertilizer\
    \ quantities applied in modern agriculture by using technology to cover site-speciﬁc\
    \ nutrient needs. VRNA can be applied to all nutrient application, with nitrogen\
    \ being the most important to be regulated through these technologies as it is\
    \ the element that is mostly used for crop growth increase and covers the highest\
    \ percentage of fertilizers globally. Therefore, VRNA can signiﬁcantly contribute\
    \ in accurate nutrient management, which can be translated to reduction of GHG\
    \ emissions and especially nitrogen that is responsible for N2O release (the GHG\
    \ derived from agricultural activities with the highest global warming potential).\
    \ They can also affect positively farm productivity and income by increasing ﬁnal\
    \ yield especially in low productivity sections of a farm and by reducing the\
    \ fertilization costs that follows optimized application of nitrogen according\
    \ to the plants’ needs."

    \ change as its activities accounts for nearly 13.5% of the total global\nanthropogenic\
    \ Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions [1]. During the last decade, there is a trend\
    \ of GHG\nemissions reduction in the agricultural sector, but more effort on this\
    \ direction should be made to fulﬁl\nglobal climate commitments. The main contribution\
    \ of agriculture to GHG emissions is related to\ncropland soil, enteric fermentation\
    \ and manure management [2].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339; doi:10.3390/su9081339\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n2 of 28\nThe\
    \ application of precision agriculture (PA) practices, using the large reservoir\
    \ of Precision\nAgriculture Technologies (PATs) in agricultural ﬁeld operations\
    \ could positively contribute to GHG\nemission reduction due to: (i) the enhancement\
    \ of the ability of soils to operate as carbon stock\nreserve [2] by less tillage\
    \ [3] and reduced nitrogen fertilization [4,5]; (ii) the reduction of fuel\nconsumption\
    \ through less in-ﬁeld operations with the tractor (direct GHG decrease); and\
    \ (iii) the\nreduction of inputs for the agricultural ﬁeld operations (indirect\
    \ GHG decrease) [6]. On the other\nhand, these practices affect farm productivity\
    \ by optimizing agricultural inputs producing higher\nor equal yields with lower\
    \ cost than conventional practices. Therefore, GHG mitigation measures\nthat refer\
    \ to new technologies and techniques on all agricultural practices (precision/variable\
    \ rate\nsowing/planting, fertilizing, spraying and irrigation) can reduce signiﬁcantly\
    \ the amount of inputs\nthat are responsible for GHG contribution and could help\
    \ on the goal of minimum climate change\nimpact of agriculture, always taking\
    \ into account that crop production should be maintained or even\nincreased in\
    \ the challenge of ensuring food security and safety for human food consumption.\n\
    Current use of PA practices in the world and EU basis is in general unclear. There\
    \ was a strong\nuptake of PATs during the 1990s in North America, mainly because\
    \ of the rise of information\ntechnology and the fact that US and Canadian agriculture\
    \ had the appropriate characteristics to\npromote new technologies promising better\
    \ economic results. Those characteristics were: (i) the large\nfarm sizes; (ii)\
    \ the organised extension system mainly by the government and universities; (iii)\
    \ the\nfarmers/entrepreneurs willingness for progress and technology adoption;\
    \ (iv) the high income; (v) the\npossibility of ﬁnancing investment; and (vi)\
    \ the limited or absent subsidies in agricultural products [7,8].\nPA growth rate\
    \ ﬂattened during the ﬁrst years of 2000s, because the results (productivity increase,\n\
    inputs and fuel use reduction, ease of use, low maintenance, and compatibility\
    \ between brands) were\nnot as positive as expected by the agricultural community.\
    \ However, PATs are currently taking up\nagain, because technology problems have\
    \ been gradually resolved and more tangible economic results\nhave been shown\
    \ at farm level (e.g., proﬁt increase). In 2014, PA global market already amounted\n\
    to €2.3 billion, with an expected annual growth rate of 12% through 2020 with\
    \ the mature US and\nEuropean markets considered the most promising [9,10].\n\
    However, most practitioners do not have a clear perspective of the beneﬁts of\
    \ PATs in agricultural\nproduction and do not consider the environmental reimbursements\
    \ that their use could provide [11–14].\nThere is a need to produce evidence of\
    \ the actual impact of these technologies on GHG emissions,\nfarm productivity\
    \ and economics. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to identify and describe\n\
    the PATs that possess the capacity to have positive impact on GHG emissions produced\
    \ from the\nagricultural sector in combination with farm productivity and income\
    \ sustenance or improvement.\nIn the ﬁrst section, the main sources of GHG emissions\
    \ in the agricultural sector are described,\nwhile the second section analyses\
    \ the GHG mitigation practices. Subsequently, the typology of PATs is\npresented\
    \ to sort the PATs that have a potential direct positive impact on GHG emission\
    \ mitigation\ncombined with improved or at least stable farm productivity and\
    \ economics. Then, a list of the most\ninﬂuencing PATs is presented with a short\
    \ description of their technical characteristics and its GHG\nemissions impacts.\
    \ It should be noted that literature on PATs impact on GHG emissions is highly\n\
    limited and therefore the discussion on the mitigation capacity is mainly based\
    \ on the reduction\nof agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilisers, pesticides, fuel,\
    \ and water) that can be achieved using PATs.\nSubsequently, the farm productivity\
    \ and economic impacts of acquiring and using PATs are analysed\nand discussed.\
    \ Finally, a conclusion of the importance of PATs on both reducing GHG emissions\
    \ and\nmaintaining or increasing farm productivity and income is given.\n2. Main\
    \ Sources of Agricultural GHG Emissions\nThe major GHGs produced in the agricultural\
    \ sector are methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O)\nand carbon dioxide (CO2). CH4\
    \ is mainly produced from the anaerobic decomposition of organic\nmatter during\
    \ enteric fermentation and manure management, but also from paddy rice cultivation;\n\
    N2O arise from the microbial transformation of N in soils and manures (during\
    \ the application of\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n3 of 28\nmanure and synthetic\
    \ fertiliser to land) and via urine and dung deposited by grazing animals; and\n\
    CO2 arising from: (i) energy use pre-farm, on-farm and post-farm; and (ii) from\
    \ changes in above and\nbelow ground carbon stocks induced by land use and land\
    \ use change [15].\nThe agricultural sector contributes to the production of 25%\
    \ of CO2, 50% of CH4, and 70% of\nN2O emissions in a global basis summing up to\
    \ nearly 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic GHG\nemissions, as stated above\
    \ [1]. However, in OECD member countries, agriculture produces 8% of the\ntotal\
    \ GHG emissions with a decline between 2000 and 2010 by an average of 0.4% per\
    \ annum with\nsimultaneous agricultural production increase of 1.6% per annum,\
    \ which is interpreted into 1.97% of\nGHG emission intensity reduction. Therefore,\
    \ the developed country members of OECD are trying to\nachieve synchronized GHG\
    \ mitigation and productivity increase, which is the ideal situation and is\n\
    deﬁned as the “absolute decoupling” [16].\nThe larger agricultural economies generally\
    \ produce higher levels of GHG emissions, but they\ndo not follow the same pattern.\
    \ An explanation of this statement is that, for example, France and\nGermany together\
    \ accounted for around one third of the EU-28 agricultural GHG emissions, while\
    \ the\ncombination of the UK, Spain, Poland and Italy covered an additional third\
    \ of the total. To decrease\nEU agriculture impact on GHG emissions, the EU Roadmap\
    \ for moving to a low carbon economy\nrecommends a reduction target of agricultural\
    \ GHG emissions by 36–37% until 2030, and a more\nambitious one (42–49%) for 2050\
    \ in comparison to 1990 levels [17].\nN2O is the main GHG related to agricultural\
    \ soil emissions, essentially due to microbial\ntransformation of nitrogen in\
    \ the soil (the process of nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation to be analysed later\n\
    in this paper). This concerns nitrogen mineral fertilisers, manure spreading and\
    \ nitrogen from crop\nresidues incorporated into the soil or lixiviation of surplus\
    \ nitrogen. N2O has high Global Warming\nPotential (298 times higher than CO2)\
    \ and it should be minimized to reduce agricultural GHG emissions\nin total. An\
    \ example of favourable N2O emissions increase conditions is when soil temperature\
    \ is\nincreased and high moisture conditions exist during cooler months. Another\
    \ example would be the\nincrease of N2O from upland agricultural soils due to\
    \ CO2 concentration [18]. The application of\nmineral nitrogen in the form of\
    \ chemical fertilisers would also increase the N2O emissions.\nEnteric fermentation,\
    \ which is a natural part of the digestive process for ruminants, is the most\n\
    important CH4 emission producer. CH4 is also produced during manure storage (decomposition).\n\
    There are several studies targeting on CH4 measurements [19] and its mitigation\
    \ potential from rice\nﬁelds, mainly through water [20], fertiliser, and manure\
    \ management [21]. CH4 emissions increase\nwhen mulching and organic manure are\
    \ applied in soils [22]. On the other hand, midseason drainage\nof rice farms\
    \ can reduce CH4 emissions signiﬁcantly [23]. Aerobic soils may act as CH4 sinks\
    \ [19,24] or\nemission sources [25].\nAs for CO2, direct combustion of hydrocarbons\
    \ together with soil respiration and residual biomass\ndecomposition are the main\
    \ sources of emissions. However, the majority of the farm operations and\ninputs\
    \ (e.g., fertilisers, pesticides, and energy) also have embodied CO2 content.\
    \ Direct CO2 emissions\nproduced by agriculture as well as indirect CO2 emissions\
    \ from processing of inputs at farm level\nshowed that this gas can represent\
    \ between 10% and 20% of the total GHG emissions in agriculture [2].\n3. Greenhouse\
    \ Gases Mitigation Practices\nClimate change can be mitigated through the reduction\
    \ of GHG emissions, the enhancement of\nGHG removals and the avoidance or displacement\
    \ of emissions [24]. Mismanagement of carbon (C)\nand nitrogen (N) ﬂows in the\
    \ agricultural system is the reason for GHG overproduction. There are\nmethods\
    \ and technologies that reduce GHG emissions, such as the timely and accurate\
    \ application of\nnitrogen fertilization that reduces N2O [26,27]. Regarding enhancing\
    \ GHG removals, any agricultural\npractice that increases photosynthetic processes\
    \ or slows the return of stored C in organic biomass\ncan be considered as C sequestration\
    \ method [28]. In addition, GHG emissions can be avoided or\ndisplaced by the\
    \ conversion of residual agricultural biomass into biofuel of any type [29,30],\
    \ where in\nreality this energy source replace fossil fuels of the same energy\
    \ content.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n4 of 28\nHowever, the mechanisms that\
    \ reduce one GHG can sometimes affect another GHG in a negative\nway through different\
    \ mechanisms resulting in combined effects that are unknown [31,32]. For instance,\n\
    no-tillage practices, which can potentially reduce GHG emissions by 20.6–23.7%\
    \ compared to\nconventional tillage [33], may have unanticipated and unwanted\
    \ effects on other sources or sinks of\nGHG. If, for example, soil water conservation\
    \ associated with no-till were to provide more moisture for\nnitrifying and denitrifying\
    \ bacteria as well as plants, then production of N2O might increase, offsetting\n\
    some or all of the mitigation potential of carbon storage [34].\nSmith et al.\
    \ (2008) [24] listed the GHG emissions mitigation measures in seven categories\n\
    that include different practices: (i) cropland management (nutrient management,\
    \ tillage/residue\nmanagement, water management, rise management, agroforestry,\
    \ set-aside, and land-use change);\n(ii) grazing land management/pasture improvement\
    \ (grazing intensity, increased productivity\nthrough fertilisation, nutrient\
    \ management, ﬁre management, and species introduction including\nlegumes); (iii)\
    \ management of organic soils (avoid drainage of wetlands); (iv) restoration of\
    \ degraded\nlands (erosion control, organic amendments, and nutrient amendments);\
    \ (v) livestock management\n(improved feeding practices, speciﬁc agents and dietary\
    \ additives, longer term structural and\nmanagement changes and animal breeding);\
    \ (vi) manure/biosolid management (improved storage\nand handling, anaerobic digestion,\
    \ and more efﬁcient use as nutrient source); and (vii) bioenergy\nproduction (energy\
    \ crops, solid, liquid, biogas, and residues).\nPA for crop farming is included\
    \ in the ﬁrst category with a special interest on nutrient management\nand water\
    \ management. Agricultural GHG emission mitigation should be focused on increasing\
    \ the\nefﬁciency of agriculture to reduce future land conversion, and also on\
    \ reducing N2O emissions from soil\nN management [35]. Eory and Moran (2012) [35]\
    \ considered four mitigation measures connected with\nPA (improved timing of mineral\
    \ nitrogen (N) application, improved timing of organic N application,\nfull allowance\
    \ of manure N supply and avoiding N excess). All of them showed considerable GHG\n\
    abatement potential with “Improved timing of mineral N application” reaching 0.3\
    \ tCO2-eq/ha.\nA report from the UK Government [36] analysing agricultural emissions\
    \ in the UK reported that,\nto reduce national GHG emissions by 3 MtCO2-eq by\
    \ 2020 compared to 2007, the most promising\nmethod is nutrient management (it\
    \ can reach 1.4 MtCO2-eq), followed by the use of plants with\nimproved nitrogen\
    \ use efﬁciency (potential of 0.8 MtCO2-eq) and improved land and soil management\n\
    (up to 0.45 MtCO2-eq). This work shows the potential of PA practices that are\
    \ directly connected with\nnutrient, land and soil management.\nThe European Commission\
    \ Climate Action also proposes GHG mitigation measures related\nto farming practices,\
    \ such as seeding/planting, harvesting, irrigation and fertilisation of existing\n\
    crops, use of different varieties, diversify crops, implement management practices\
    \ [37]. EU seeks\nfor sustainable agricultural schemes through the new Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP). Natural\nresources are depleting and agriculture\
    \ has to improve its environmental performance. Sustainable\nmanagement of natural\
    \ resources and climate action represent one of the three main objectives of\n\
    the CAP [38]. Improved sustainability will be achieved ﬁrstly by covering certain\
    \ environmental\nrequirements and obligations in order to receive full CAP funding.\
    \ Secondly, from 2015 onwards, the\nCAP introduced a new policy instrument, the\
    \ Green Direct Payment, that is granted only when there is\nsimultaneous crop\
    \ diversiﬁcation, ecological focus areas and permanent grassland, with environmental\n\
    beneﬁts on biodiversity, water and soil quality, carbon sequestration and landscapes.\
    \ It represents 30%\nof the direct payment budget and it is compulsory. Finally,\
    \ rural development is vital for achieving the\nenvironmental objectives of the\
    \ CAP and combating climate change, as at least 30% of the budget of\neach rural\
    \ development programme must be reserved for targeted measures on this direction.\
    \ All these\npolicy instruments are accompanied by related training measures and\
    \ other support from the Farm\nAdvisory System, insights gained from the Innovation\
    \ Partnership and applied research, which would\nhelp farmers to implement appropriate\
    \ solutions for their speciﬁc situations. Proposed solutions on\nthe farm level\
    \ are the adjustment of farm operations timing; the improvement of the effectiveness\n\
    of pest and disease control through better monitoring, diversiﬁed crop rotations,\
    \ or integrated pest\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n5 of 28\nmanagement methods;\
    \ the use of water more efﬁciently by reducing water losses; improving irrigation\n\
    practices; recycling or storing water; and the improvement of soil management\
    \ by increasing water\nretention to conserve soil moisture.\nPATs could participate\
    \ in the achievement of agricultural sustainability as they increase the\nefﬁciency\
    \ of most agricultural practices by reducing or redistributing inputs to address\
    \ the real\nrequirements of the crop. It is anticipated that the new CAP will\
    \ promote further PATs as one of the\nmethods to increase or maintain productivity\
    \ with simultaneous reduction of environmental impacts,\nand in speciﬁc GHG emissions.\n\
    4. Typology of Precision Agriculture Technologies\nIn the literature, there are\
    \ only three attempts to provide a typology of PATs. One of the\nmost prominent\
    \ studies on PA [12] classiﬁes PATs in three main categories: Hardware and sensors\n\
    (i.e., positioning and guidance, crop sensing for water stress, nutrients and\
    \ yield sensing, environmental\nsensing, seed bed preparation, and fertiliser\
    \ placement in the soil proﬁle); Data Analysis and Decision\nSupport Systems (i.e.,\
    \ protocols and standards for ﬁeld data layers production, methods for data analysis\n\
    for delineation of management zones, and easy-to-use software); and Commodity\
    \ and whole-farm focus\n(i.e., development of DSS to apply commercially in farms\
    \ including environmental impact assessment,\nand apply PA at farm level and not\
    \ at ﬁeld level). Zarco-Tejada et al. (2014) [14] categorised PATs for\ncrop and\
    \ livestock farming in a linear manner following the timeline of use of the technologies\
    \ ending\nup in three categories, namely Remote sensing; Guidance systems; and\
    \ Variable rate applications.\nFinally, Schwarz et al. (2011) [39] have provided\
    \ the most comprehensive typology of PATs\n(selected to be used in this work,\
    \ see Figure 1), divided into three main categories: Guidance systems\n(i.e.,\
    \ hard- and software that guide tractors and implements over a ﬁeld), which include\
    \ all forms of\nautomatic steering/guidance for tractors and self-propelled agricultural\
    \ machinery, such as driver\nassistance, machine guidance, controlled trafﬁc farming;\
    \ Recording technologies (i.e., sensors mounted\non ground-based stations, rolling,\
    \ airborne or satellite platforms, and gathering spatial information),\nwhich\
    \ include soil mapping, soil moisture mapping, canopy mapping, yield mapping,\
    \ etc.; and Reacting\ntechnologies (i.e., implements, hard- and software that\
    \ together can vary the placement of agricultural\ninputs in the ﬁeld), which\
    \ include technologies such as variable rate irrigation and weeding and\nvariable\
    \ rate application of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides.\nGuidance technologies\
    \ can be used for any agricultural practice application (including traditional\n\
    practices) focusing on precise machinery movement within and between ﬁelds with\
    \ tangible results\nin reduced overlapping causing lower input use (seeds, fertilisers,\
    \ and pesticides) in parallel with\ndecreased self-propelled machinery fuel consumption.\
    \ Recording technologies are required in order\nto receive information from the\
    \ ﬁeld (before, during and after the crop period) and after processing,\nextract\
    \ the data useful for any kind of PA application. Reacting technologies are supposed\
    \ to use the\ndata produced by the recording systems and minimize all inputs (seeds,\
    \ fertilisers, pesticides, and\nwater) in the optimum quantity required by the\
    \ crop to grow. The right combination of these three\ncategories is expected to\
    \ increase or at least maintain yield with the advantage of higher quality and\n\
    minimum environmental impact.\nAll three categories of PATs require the use of\
    \ Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs),\nas shown in the ﬁgure. Recording\
    \ technologies and GNSSs remain supportive in the PA process and\nthey will not\
    \ be analysed in the next section of this paper. Hence, reacting technologies\
    \ and guidance\nsystems were selected to be analysed and their potential to reduce\
    \ GHG emissions and improve farm\nproductivity and income was assessed.\nSustainability\

    \ that was designed after receiving\ndata from the ﬁeld using mainly canopy sensors\
    \ that identify the status of the crop and correlate\nit with nutrient needs or\
    \ by combining the recording and reacting procedure on-the-go, meaning\nsimultaneously\
    \ inorganic fertilizers are distributed in the ﬁeld using two main technologies,\
    \ the spinner\nor centrifugal spreaders that are based on a conveyer belt or chain\
    \ that transfers the material (granules)\nfrom the hopper until it falls on one\
    \ or more spinning disks throwing the particles into the ﬁeld and\nthe pneumatic\
    \ spreaders that use airﬂow which divides the granules over a piped spreading\
    \ boom for\nuniform distribution [40,41]. In VRNA through spinner spreaders, the\
    \ application rate is controlled\nby adjusting the gate opening and/or changing\
    \ the speed of the conveyor (and thus the input rate of\nmaterial). In pneumatic\
    \ applicators, VRNA is executed by spreading the material using an adjustable\n\
    controlled air stream through a piped boom [42]. Liquid fertilizers (foliar or\
    \ soil fertilizers) are applied\nusing spraying machinery similarly to pesticide\
    \ application (see Section 5.5.1).\nAs for slurry distribution in the ﬁeld, the\
    \ applicators work by either pressuring the slurry\ntank (by changing the size\
    \ of the gate that brings slurry to the delivery system) or by pumping\nthe slurry\
    \ from the tank (by changing pump or valve settings). VRNA is based on changing\
    \ the\nrequired slurry ﬂowrate based on an application map or real-time soil sensors,\
    \ combined with\nsimultaneous measurements of the nitrogen content of the slurry,\
    \ the ground speed and working width\nof the vehicle [43,44]. Solid manure spreaders\
    \ work with an apron that pushes the manure towards\na dispensing system [43,44].\n\
    5.1.2. GHG Emissions Reduction Potential through VRNA\nPlants require macronutrients\
    \ to perform various metabolic processes. The primary macronutrients\nare Nitrogen\
    \ (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) covering the main needs of plants to\
    \ increase yield,\ngrowth and quality parameters, while the secondary macronutrients\
    \ (Ca, Mg, and S) play an auxiliary\nbut not irrelevant role [45]. Besides this\
    \ proven impact of macronutrients on plant behaviour, literature\nis limited on\
    \ the impact of each macronutrient on GHG emissions (direct and indirect), except\
    \ nitrogen\nthat have been analysed significantly. Nitrogen fertilisation is the\
    \ most significant activity producing\nGHG emissions in the agricultural sector,\
    \ as nitrogen inorganic fertilisers are the cause of CO2 and N2O\nemissions during\
    \ their production and N2O emissions after their application in the soil [15,35,46–48].\n\
    GHG Emissions from Nitrogen Fertiliser Production\nThe production of fertilisers\
    \ generates considerable GHG emissions being responsible for\napproximately 1.2%\
    \ of the total global GHG emissions [47]. In order to produce N fertilisers, it\
    \ is\nrequired to synthesize ammonia, where CO2 is produced from the use of fossil\
    \ energy sources (mainly\nnatural gas) as feedstock and fuel. Methane provides\
    \ 60% of the required H2 (together with 40% from\nwater steam) to react with atmospheric\
    \ N2 and produce ammonia. A portion of CH4 is used to heat\nthe process. On the\
    \ other hand, nitric acid production process is the source of N2O emissions [46].\n\
    Ammonium nitrate (AN-N), which is the base of nitrogen fertilisers, can be produced\
    \ at different levels\nof technology and the emitted GHGs are different in each\
    \ case.\nTechnology advancement has decreased total GHG emissions from 7.9 tCO2-eq/t\
    \ AN-N to a level\nbelow 3 tCO2-eq/t AN-N, which can be achieved by adopting de-N2O\
    \ catalyst systems that reduce\nN2O emissions from nitric acid production using\
    \ catalytic systems that break down N2O under high\ntemperature into harmless\
    \ nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These systems are being ﬁtted to many nitric\n\
    acid plants and virtually all operating plants in Europe had abatement systems\
    \ since the mid-2010s.\nAn example of the effect of de-N2O catalyst systems is\
    \ the respective GHG emissions from wheat\nproduction at the economic optimum\
    \ N fertilizer application rate that is signiﬁcantly reduced by about\n40%, from\
    \ 2.55 tCO2-eq/ha to 1.6 tCO2-eq/ha [46].\nTherefore, if variable rate nitrogen\
    \ fertilization is applied in combination with the ﬁtting of\nde-N2O catalytic\
    \ systems in the production line of N fertilizers, the result in the total GHG\
    \ emissions\nderived by N application is expected to be even more positive.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n8 of 28\nGHG Emissions from Nitrogen Fertiliser\
    \ Application\nLarge quantities of fertilisers are being applied in agriculture\
    \ forming one of the primary\nanthropogenic activity producing GHG emissions [48],\
    \ particularly in rice cultivation [49,50]. Inorganic\nor organic N within soil\
    \ is subject to various natural microbial conversion processes, some of which\n\
    may produce N2O. The main inorganic forms of N in the soil are ammonium (NH4+)\
    \ and nitrate\n(NO3−). Ammonium originates either directly from mineral fertilisers,\
    \ from the conversion of manure\nor crop residues or from urea fertilisers. Nitrate\
    \ is either directly applied as nitrate mineral fertiliser\nor results from the\
    \ microbial oxidation of ammonium. Nitrate is dissolved in the water of the soil\n\
    and cannot be stored in the soil over the long term. During the period of crop\
    \ growth, nitrate is taken\nup at high rates. However, at times of low or zero\
    \ crop demand, and under certain environmental\nconditions, nitrate can be lost\
    \ either to the air via denitriﬁcation or to water by leaching. Ammonium\nis not\
    \ mobile and most of it has to be converted into nitrate before crops can take\
    \ it up. Losses of\nammonium from the soil occur via volatilisation of ammonia\
    \ (NH3) [48].\nNitriﬁcation is the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate. This natural\
    \ process supplies energy\nto the nitrifying bacteria.\nDuring the oxidation of\
    \ ammonium to nitrite, N2O is produced as\na by-product. Denitriﬁcation means\
    \ the reduction of nitrate to di-nitrogen gas (N2). During this\nprocess N2O is\
    \ emitted to the atmosphere.\nThe quantity of N2O released from denitriﬁcation\n\
    depends on the environmental conditions—more or less N2O is produced instead of\
    \ N2. The more\nfavourable the conditions for denitriﬁcation (e.g., completely\
    \ water-saturated soil), the more N2 is\nproportionally produced. Changing the\
    \ conditions (e.g., from wet to dry soils) favours N2O release [48].\nAn example\
    \ of the effect of nitrogen fertilisation is the allocation of the total GHG emissions\
    \ from\nwheat when cultivated in the economic optimum N rate showing that almost\
    \ 90% of the total GHGs\nare associated with N fertilisers (CO2 and N2O from production\
    \ and N2O from ﬁeld nitriﬁcation and\ndenitriﬁcation) [46].\nA number of studies\
    \ have concluded that many farmers over apply nitrogen [51–53]. According to\n\
    Eurostat (2016) [54] in the period of 2005–2008 the average nitrogen surplus coming\
    \ from inorganic and\norganic fertilizers, manure and other nitrogen inputs, such\
    \ as seeds and planting material, biological\nﬁxation by leguminous crops and\
    \ free living organisms, atmospheric deposition of the EU-28 member\nstates was\
    \ 51 kg N/ha that is an indication of the amount of nitrogen fertilisation that\
    \ could be\ndiminished in EU agricultural production. It can be that there is\
    \ a trend of nitrogen surplus reduction\nas in the period 2009–2012 the EU-28\
    \ surplus was reduced to 48 kg N/ha.\nVR fertiliser application (including manure\
    \ spreading) allows for the optimum application of\nnitrogen according to the\
    \ crop needs, reducing the ﬁnal fertiliser (or manure) quantity and its associated\n\
    GHG emissions both CO2 (from fuel reduction due to timely fertilization and reduced\
    \ weight of the\nhopper) and N2O (from N fertiliser production and use). In the\
    \ case of manure CH4 can also be\ndecreased. GHG emissions can be further reduced\
    \ when N fertilisation is combined with precipitation\nprediction or appropriate\
    \ irrigation scheduling (where applicable).\nAlthough the potential exists, there\
    \ is limited data on the GHG mitigation potential of VRNA.\nHowever, there is\
    \ adequate work on the impact of reducing nitrogen ﬁeld applications on N2O\n\
    emissions. Bates et al. (2009) [55] identiﬁed an abatement potential with VRNA\
    \ of 5% reduction in\nthe baseline GHG emission rate that is assigned to mineral\
    \ fertiliser application without yield impact.\nThey also pointed out that there\
    \ is abatement by making effective allowance for manure and residual\nN with VR\
    \ technology and can reach another 5% GHG emission reduction to the baseline emission\n\
    rate for mineral fertiliser application. Millar et al. (2010) [52] found that\
    \ nitrogen fertilizer application\nrates correlate with N2O emissions. However,\
    \ the relationship between nitrogen application and N2O\nemissions is not necessarily\
    \ linear [56,57], but the relationship of N2O emissions to nitrogen application\n\
    rate increases proportionally with the application rate [27]. Another study estimated\
    \ that an average\nof 1.19% of total nitrogen added to soils is released as N2O\
    \ [58]. Babcock et al. (2004) [59] pointed out\nthat as cropped soils emit N2O\
    \ at a rate of 0.2–3% of their nitrogen inputs, when nitrogen inputs are\ndecreased,\
    \ N2O emissions could be reduced directly by approximately 1.25% of nitrogen inputs\
    \ saved.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n9 of 28\nSehy et al. (2003) [60] examined\
    \ the use of VRNA and GPS in ﬁeld nitrogen application and found out\nthat N2O\
    \ emissions decreased by up to 34% in low-yielding areas.\nGHG Emissions from\
    \ Variable Rate Application of other Macronutrients and Lime\nLiterature on the\
    \ impact of VR application of other macronutrients than N and lime on GHG\nemissions\
    \ is not available, but it could be stated that VR application can affect carbon\
    \ footprint\nindirectly because excess and/or deﬁcit of macronutrients may change\
    \ the overall growth and\nperformance of crops.\n5.1.3. Impacts of the Use of\
    \ VRNA on Productivity and Farm Economics\nProductivity and Farm Economics Impact\
    \ from Variable Rate Nitrogen Fertiliser Application\nFarm productivity is inﬂuenced\
    \ by nitrogen fertilization rates, as it is one of the most signiﬁcant\nparameters\
    \ for increasing yield, while nitrogen constitutes an essential factor of farm\
    \ economics.\nSogaard and Kierkegaard (1994) [61] described the relation between\
    \ nitrogen supply and plant yield\nwith a quadratic equation. The parabolic shape\
    \ reﬂects that each further added unit of nitrogen causes\nsmaller yield increase\
    \ of the crop. At a certain point, the beneﬁts of an added unit of nitrogen (i.e.,\
    \ extra\ncrop yield) barely outweigh the costs of this unit, and an economic optimum\
    \ is reached. This economic\noptimum is found at lower application rates than\
    \ the yield optimum. By fertilising each management\nzone near the economic optimum,\
    \ higher returns can be achieved. Thus, the highest returns for VRNA\nare expected\
    \ on ﬁelds with high and spatially variable nutrient requirements [62].\nExcessive\
    \ application of nitrogen fertilisation decreases ﬁnancial returns and increases\
    \ the\npotential for nitrogen leaching into the environment. Insufﬁcient application\
    \ can reduce yields and net\nfarm income [53]. A landowner who beneﬁts from fertiliser\
    \ savings and yield gains through VRNA\nwould not require additional incentives,\
    \ although in case of yield losses such motivations would be\nneeded. Additional\
    \ revenue gains from VRNA could be realized with decreased need for fuel, labour,\n\
    or other chemicals [63].\nSeveral authors have analysed the impact of VRNA on\
    \ farm productivity and economics. Tekin\n(2010) [64] estimated that VRNA can\
    \ increase wheat production between 1% and 10% offering\nsavings in nitrogen fertilisation\
    \ between 4% and 37%. He also made an economic analysis using\nthe prices of the\
    \ VR equipment, the fertilisers and the price of the wheat seed and found out\
    \ that\nthe investment cost over a 5-year depreciation period would vary between\
    \ 11.45 € and 115.39 € for\na 500 ha and 50 ha farm size. Koch et al. (2004) [65]\
    \ investigated a 18.5-ha furrow-irrigated site\nand a 58-ha center-pivot–irrigated\
    \ site of corn ﬁelds in northeastern Colorado, USA during 2001\nand 2002 concluding\
    \ that nitrogen VR fertilization showed always better results than conventional\n\
    application with nitrogen savings of 6–46%. According to ICF (2013) [63], VR fertilisation\
    \ was found to\nproduce economic beneﬁts through increased yields, improved crop\
    \ quality, and decreased fertiliser\napplications. This report states that 8%\
    \ increase in wheat yields (for 10% less nitrogen) and 5% increase\nin corn yield\
    \ (for 21% less nitrogen) was shown when GreenSeeker (https://agriculture.trimble.com/\n\
    precision-ag/products/greenseeker/) technology was used in Maryland, USA. In Virginia,\
    \ USA, using\nagain GreenSeeker technology in corn ﬁelds resulted in nearly 27\
    \ kg/ha less nitrogen application\nthan the conventional method with a nearly\
    \ equivalent yield. GreenSeeker technology costs between\n17,616 € and 19,378\
    \ €, depending on whether farmers already have electronic ﬂow control technology\n\
    on their fertiliser application equipment. Based on the GreenSeeker price, current\
    \ fertilisers prices and\nthe reduction mentioned above from the results from\
    \ Maryland, the capital cost per acre for small\nfarms was 77.5 €, for medium\
    \ farms 35.23 € and for large farms 19.37 €.\nHydroSense project (2013) [66] identiﬁed\
    \ a net beneﬁt of 113 €/ha/year when the simpler form of\nprecision farming was\
    \ used in cotton production by using N sensors to estimate uniform application\n\
    of fertiliser through pre-existing drip irrigation systems. A variable-rate irrigation\
    \ system applied in\nthe drip irrigation circuit resulted in a net beneﬁt of 310\
    \ €/ha/year, while the net beneﬁt climbs to\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n10\
    \ of 28\n480 €/ha/year when deploying the emerging real-time and VR technology\
    \ for N inputs even though\nthe farmer needs to make signiﬁcant investment on\
    \ new equipment. It should be noted that the VR\nfertigation technique (fertilization\
    \ + irrigation) can only be applied in crops that are irrigated using\ndrip irrigation\
    \ systems.\nAn experiment was conducted in four wheat ﬁelds in Oklahoma, USA in\
    \ 2000 and compared to\nuniform fertiliser application, in-season VR application\
    \ of granular fertiliser at 1 m2 spatial resolution\n(based on optical sensing)\
    \ increased revenue (grain revenue minus fertiliser cost) by 9.69 €/ha when\n\
    fertiliser was also applied before seeding (ﬁxed rate) and more than 24.66 €/ha\
    \ when fertiliser was\nonly applied in-season [62,67]. Mamo et al. (2003) [68]\
    \ executed an experiment for three years (1995,\n1997, 1999) in corn ﬁelds in\
    \ rotation with sybean in Minnesota, USA and found a proﬁt increase of\n7 to 20.25\
    \ €/ha for corn when using VR fertilizer application compared to uniform application\
    \ due to\nreduction in the use of fertiliser. Koch et al. (2004) [65] found an\
    \ increase of 25.6 to 38.6 €/ha in net\nreturns for VRNA on Colorado corn based\
    \ on site-speciﬁc management zones compared to uniform\napplication rates, both\
    \ in a farmer and custom applied scenario.\nNext to fertiliser costs also other\
    \ costs can be attributed to VR fertiliser application, such as soil\nsampling\
    \ or online sensing, delineation of management zones, ﬁxed or variable costs associated\
    \ with\nVR equipment (GPS receiver, on-board computer, software, VR system). However,\
    \ the cost of these\nequipment or services is not only associated with VR fertiliser\
    \ application and is interconnected to\nother PA applications. Large farm holding,\
    \ due to economics of scale, allow ﬁxed costs associated\nwith VR equipment to\
    \ be distributed over a larger area, and therefore decrease the expense of VR\n\
    equipment per hectare. VR application based on grid soil sampling results to the\
    \ lowest net return in\ncomparison to the use of VR equipment, primarily due to\
    \ increased fertiliser uses and soil sampling\ncosts [65].\nManaging manure as\
    \ fertiliser resource for crop production can increase the return for the\nproducer\
    \ and the overall production efﬁciency of an animal-crop farming system in much\
    \ the same\nway as granular fertiliser management [69]. Precision management of\
    \ manure has the potential\nto further improve farming system production efﬁciency\
    \ by applying the exact required manure\ninstead of inorganic fertilizers, thus\
    \ increasing the return to the farmer, as waste management becomes\ncheaper and\
    \ the pollution potential of animal waste is minimized [70]. As with VR granular\
    \ fertiliser\napplication, the key element to VR manure application is the existence\
    \ of an application map, which is\nlaborious and time consuming to generate when\
    \ acquired without sensor technology [71]. Although\nno literature is available\
    \ considering the economic return of VR manure application, many similarities\n\
    with VR granular (inorganic) fertiliser applications can be seen. The main difference\
    \ is that the applied\nproduct is much bulkier, heterogeneous and lower in nutrient\
    \ content and ﬁnancial value [70]. It should\nbe noted that some VR manure systems\
    \ can be retroﬁtted to the tankers that farmers already have [44],\nwhich removes\
    \ the need for large investments.\nProductivity and Farm Economics Impact from\
    \ Variable Rate Lime Application\nVariable rate (VR) lime (which is primarily\
    \ CaCO3) application can increase crop yields and\nthe economic return of the\
    \ farm [72]. Lime application increases the soil pH to a desired level and\nan\
    \ optimal pH level in the soil is important to achieve optimum yields and consistent\
    \ quality [73].\nIn addition, lime improves the uptake and availability of plant\
    \ nutrients and can also improve\nwater penetration.\nVR lime application can\
    \ lead to improved adjustment of soil acidity at a lower cost and with\na (slightly)\
    \ better yield response than uniform lime application [73]. Under-application\
    \ of lime can\ncause large yield losses. Over-application of lime can be as detrimental\
    \ as under-liming [72], as it\nis costly and can create problems with availability\
    \ of some nutrients (for example inhibiting P and\nZn, or leading to toxic levels\
    \ of Mn), disease pressure, reduced herbicide performance and herbicide\ndegradation\
    \ [72,73]. Over- and under-liming cannot be avoided if lime is applied uniformly\
    \ throughout\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n11 of 28\nthe ﬁeld. It should be noted\
    \ that VR liming appears to be only proﬁtable for high value crops, because\n\
    even small effects of liming on yield produce favourable economic results in these\
    \ crops [74].\nThe main cost in a VR lime application is the cost of grid sampling.\
    \ The actual amount of lime\nused depends on the soil variability, ﬁeld acidity,\
    \ environmental factors, the sampling method and the\nsampling resolution [72].\
    \ Weisz et al. (2003) [72] concluded that when performing grid sampling and\n\
    VR lime for 3 consecutive years in Piedmont no-till soybean ﬁelds, the net loss\
    \ is €11.44/ha compared\nto uniform lime application. However, when they performed\
    \ grid sampling only in year 1 and 3, and\nperformed the VR lime in each year\
    \ (with year 2 based on the PH map of year 1) this turns into a net\ngain of €4.28/ha\
    \ over 3 years. Similarly, using the pH map from year 1 to apply lime for 3 years\
    \ only\nin the areas were lime was initially required leads to a net gain of €6.44/ha\
    \ estimated.\nField studies have shown that VR application of lime, as opposed\
    \ to uniform application, increases\nsoil pH, reduces in-ﬁeld variability and\
    \ increases soybean yield but not corn yield [75]. In 75% of the\nstudies (4 in\
    \ total) reviewed by Lambert and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000) [76] investigating VR\
    \ lime,\na positive economic effect was found, while in 25%, the articles indicated\
    \ mixed results. The lime\napplication can be more effective in legumes than in\
    \ corn and wheat, as the response of the latter is\nlimited to pH 5–5.5, where\
    \ in legumes this can go up to pH 6 [72]. Kuang et al. (2014) [73] found that\n\
    VR approach in Danish spring barley can be compared to the traditional approach\
    \ pointing out that the\nconsumption of lime consumption was increased, but it\
    \ was followed by an increase in yield resulting\nin net proﬁt (€3.61/ha) for\
    \ the VR approach compared to the traditional approach. BonGiovanni and\nLowenberg-Deboer\
    \ (2000) [77] also found an increase of net proﬁt of €6.51/ha for Indiana corn\
    \ and\nsoybean production systems by the use of VR lime application technologies.\n\
    5.2. Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)\n5.2.1. Description of VRI Technologies\n\
    Variable rate irrigation (VRI) can either be executed using a retroﬁtted self-propelled\
    \ irrigation\nsystems or more recently micro-irrigation. The main types of self-propelled\
    \ irrigation systems are\ncentre pivot and linear move sprinkler systems that\
    \ apply water above the canopy of the irrigated\ncrop [78]. The most used self-propelled\
    \ irrigation systems are the Mid Elevation Spray Application\n(MESA) with irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency of 85%. New developments are the Low Energy (elevation) Precision\n\
    Application (LEPA) and Low Energy (elevation) Spray Application (LESA) with irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency\naround 97% [79].\nVRI systems are commercially available and can\
    \ easily be retroﬁtted onto moving sprinkler\nsystems. There are different methodologies\
    \ available to deliver varying irrigation amounts along\na lateral. One approach\
    \ is to use parallel sprinkler control [80,81] or multiple manifolds; each valved\n\
    separately [82,83]. Another is to regulate the ﬂow of water through each sprinkler\
    \ drop hose by\ncontrolling the “on/off” cycle of a hydraulic valve positioned\
    \ above the drop hose [84–86]. A third\ndesign changes the cross-sectional area\
    \ of a sprinkler nozzle by cycling a retractable pin in and out of\nthe nozzle\
    \ in a controlled manner [87]\nThe most common site-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation\
    \ systems in use today are speed control\nsystems [88]. However, zone (=boom section)\
    \ control systems can achieve the same effects provided\nby speed control, but\
    \ with greater ﬂexibility, and provide more management options. In Europe, both\n\
    centre pivot and linear move sprinkler systems are applied with a preference in\
    \ the latter, in contrast\nto USA where centre pivot is the most common.\nMicro-irrigation,\
    \ a high-tech type of VRI system (drip or trickle emitters, micro-sprinkling and\n\
    microspray, and subsurface irrigation), is used in areas with very scarce water\
    \ supply where high\nvalue crops are installed (orchards, vineyards), as they\
    \ increase crop yield, use more efﬁciently water,\nmaintain warmer soil temperature\
    \ and might result in less pesticide use [89]. This type of VRI is ideal\nfor\
    \ Mediterranean countries, where drip irrigation is already in extensive use due\
    \ to water scarcity\nand such systems reduce further irrigation water use.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 1339\n12 of 28\n5.2.2. GHG Emission Reduction Potential through VRI\n\
    The contribution of VRI to GHG emission abatement lies on the reduction of water,\
    \ leading\nto lower pumping energy needs and proper irrigation scheduling preventing\
    \ extreme soil water\navailability to boost N2O emissions.\nComputer simulation\
    \ studies comparing conventional and “optimized” advanced site-speciﬁc\nzone control\
    \ by centre pivot irrigation have reported water savings of 0–26% [88]. VRI systems\
    \ can\nprovide 8–20% reduction in irrigation water use [90]. LaRue and Evans (2012)\
    \ [91] using centre pivot\nspeed control determined that irrigation efﬁciency\
    \ (the ratio between irrigation water actually utilized\nby growing crops and\
    \ water diverted from a source) can be increased by more than 5%, while if speed\n\
    control is also combined with zone control then the irrigation efﬁciency can be\
    \ further improved by 14%.\nHydroSense project [66] applied VRI in three experimental\
    \ ﬁelds with cotton in Greece and showed\nthat variable irrigation in cotton cultivation\
    \ achieved 5 to 34% savings in water consumption with yield\nimpact that was rated\
    \ between −18% and +31%. As a result, water use efﬁciency showed variation\nbetween\
    \ −12% and +54%. It should be noted that negative results were only shown in one\
    \ ﬁeld that\ndid not affect the total positive impact of VRI. The GHG emissions\
    \ linked to soil water availability\ndepend very much on the soil type. Sandy\
    \ soils will generate substantial water savings, while heavy\nsoils will not (compared\
    \ to surface irrigation systems). Lower quantities of water irrigation require\n\
    lower pumping energy which, when powered by either fossil fuel motors or electricity,\
    \ indirectly\ninﬂuence GHG emissions.\nA review by Trost et al. (2013) [92] compared\
    \ N2O emissions from irrigated and non-irrigated\nﬁelds showing an increase of\
    \ N2O emissions (about 50% to 140%) under irrigation, in most cases\nstudies.\
    \ This shows that VRI may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence N2O emission from irrigated soils.\
    \ VR\nirrigation systems can also assist irrigation scheduling combined with meteorological\
    \ prediction\nmodels and fertilization schedules in order to keep soil water availability\
    \ in such levels to avoid\nprovoking more GHG emission production through N2O.\n\
    5.2.3. Impacts of VRI Use on Productivity and Farm Economics\nVRI systems have\
    \ been tested to identify their direct impact on water use reduction and indirect\n\
    impact on farm productivity and economics. Few hard ﬁgures are available about\
    \ the economic beneﬁts\nof VRI. LaRue and Evans (2012) [91] reported that speed\
    \ control in pivot irrigation systems is simply\nactivated by changing the control\
    \ unit of the system with a one-off cost of 1321–2202 €. However, zone\ncontrol\
    \ is a more complex system that can reach an investment of 10,570 € up to 24,663\
    \ €. Tomasiewicz\net al. (2013) [93] indicated that VRI modiﬁcation of centre\
    \ pivot with control system may cost between\n13,212 € and 35,233 €. They also\
    \ mentioned that, in 2013, 200 centre pivot systems (around 0.1% of all\ninstalled\
    \ US pivots) were VRI enabled. However, it may be expected that adoption will\
    \ be crop-value\nrelated: adoption will go faster in high-value crops. Threshold\
    \ prices can be calculated for speciﬁc\ncrops (e.g., for precision irrigation\
    \ in the Texas High Plains, it was calculated the threshold of cotton\nprice to\
    \ be set above 1.40 €/kg to make the use of precision irrigation proﬁtable) [94].\
    \ Hydrosence\nproject [66], calculated that VRI adoption in drip irrigation may\
    \ cost up to 40 €/ha.\nLambert and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000) [76] reported economic\
    \ beneﬁts by the use of VRI, due\nto higher corn yields and better water use efﬁciency.\
    \ However, these beneﬁts were not quantiﬁed.\nAs mentioned above, VRI systems\
    \ can add signiﬁcant costs to the farm, but additional beneﬁts have\nbeen identiﬁed\
    \ by the installation of such systems, such as possible yield increase, work load\
    \ reduction,\nwater use decrease and even pesticide use saving, especially in\
    \ climatic unfavourable years such as\nin big draughts [90,95,96]. For water use\
    \ reduction, Hedley and Yule (2009) [97] tested VRI scenarios\nin a 156-ha pastoral\
    \ farm and a 53-ha maize ﬁeld in New Zealand after modelling and mapping by\n\
    relating high resolution apparent electrical conductivity maps to soil available\
    \ water holding capacity\nat two ﬁeld sites. They showed signiﬁcant potential\
    \ water savings of 21.8 for the ﬁrst site and 26.3%\nfor the second, while these\
    \ potential water savings suggest that VRI will become more affordable\nas irrigation\
    \ costs increase. Daccache et al. (2015) [98] conducted an experiment with VRI\
    \ in lettuce\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n13 of 28\nopen ﬁeld production in\
    \ Cambridge, UK during 2012 and estimated the beneﬁt to the grower in the\nreduced\
    \ cost of water and energy to be typically around 30 €/ha to areas that are over-irrigated\
    \ in\nhumid climates. These authors also claim that the development and uptake\
    \ of PI would need to be\njustiﬁed more in terms of the wider beneﬁts to crop\
    \ quality and reduced environmental impacts.\nCurrently, no economic data about\
    \ VR micro-irrigation is available because VRI combined with\nmicro-irrigation\
    \ is still in its infancy.\n5.3. Machine Guidance (MG)\n5.3.1. Description of\
    \ MG Technologies\nMachine guidance refers to the applications of GNSS for steering\
    \ and guidance though two main\nsystems: driver assistance and machine auto-guidance.\
    \ Driver assistance helps the driver keep his line in\nthe ﬁeld through add-ons\
    \ that are not integrated in the tractor’s systems and can be simply installed.\n\
    The most common driver assistance system is the lightbar guidance system that\
    \ consists of a horizontal\nseries of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in a plastic\
    \ case in front of the operator, so he or she can see the\naccuracy indicator\
    \ display without taking their eyes off the ﬁeld. If the light is on the centreline\
    \ of\nthe lightbar, the machine is on target, while if a bar of light extends\
    \ to one side, the machine is off the\npath and needs to be corrected. Auto-guidance\
    \ is a more advanced navigation system that has the\nadditional beneﬁt of automatic\
    \ steering of the tractor, also called auto-steering. Machine auto-guidance\n\
    systems are integrated in the tractor’s hydraulics and can directly take over\
    \ steering operations. These\nmore advanced systems are coupled to on-board computers\
    \ that allow for headland steering, section\ncontrol and that accept drive-maps\
    \ (routing) and task maps to operate implements. Auto-guidance\nhelps farmers\
    \ in avoiding gaps and overlaps in multiple passes with the tractor, which is\
    \ mainly\ncaused by operator error or fatigue. It is the most adopted PAT because\
    \ the impact on the farm is\nmeasurable and accurate. However, farm size matters\
    \ for the technology to provide tangible results,\nespecially in terms of environmental\
    \ impact.\n5.3.2. GHG Emissions Reduction Potential through MG\nGuidance technologies\
    \ improve pass-to-pass efﬁciency, reduce overlapping and application\ngaps. Guidance\
    \ can be used for many ﬁeld operations such as seeding, tillage, planting, weeding,\n\
    and harvesting [99] and for enabling autonomous vehicles. Therefore, it is expected\
    \ that all main\nagricultural inputs (seeds, fertiliser and pesticides) will be\
    \ reduced\nGuidance technology saves as standalone fuel of the self-propelled\
    \ machine and inputs (fertilisers,\npesticides) even if implements used are conventional\
    \ type. In the case it is combined with VR\napplication of agricultural inputs,\
    \ they are also reduced further. An example is the work of Shockley et\nal. (2011)\
    \ [100] that modelled a commercial Kentucky corn and soybean farm under no-till\
    \ conditions\nwhere machine guidance during planting and fertiliser application\
    \ led to cost savings of approximately\n2.4%, 2.2% and 10.4% for seed, fertiliser\
    \ and tractor fuel, respectively, which is translated to GHG\nemission mitigation.\
    \ Guidance systems such as lightbar and auto-steering can reduce fuel consumption\n\
    by 6.32% [101].\nMachine guidance is based on high accuracy GNSS receivers and\
    \ can be used with all kind of\nVR application machinery. As GNSS increases the\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld applications, it will increase the\nreduction efﬁciency of\
    \ the technology itself. As machine guidance is indirectly interconnected with\
    \ the\nrecording technologies, this combination is expected to reduce GHGs.\n\
    5.3.3. Impacts of MG Use on Productivity and Farm Economics\nGuidance systems\
    \ such as lightbar and auto-steering can beneﬁt crop growers by reducing\nworking\
    \ hours as operators in the ﬁeld by 6.04% and reducing fuel consumption by 6.32%\
    \ [101].\nIn peanut digging operations, a study in Alabama during 2005–2007 growing\
    \ seasons revealed\naverage net returns between 83 and 612 €/ha for the use of\
    \ auto-steering [102]. More particularly, they\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\
    14 of 28\nidentiﬁed that increasing the peanut digger efﬁciency by accurate placement\
    \ over the target rows could\nminimize damaged pods and yield losses. Therefore,\
    \ they studied row deviation between manual\ndriving (90–180 mm) and RTK auto-steering\
    \ system (0 mm). Data showed that for every 20 mm row\ndeviation, expected yield\
    \ loss was 186 kg/ha. When RTK auto-steering system was used the expected\nadditional\
    \ net returns from row deviation of 90 mm was 83 to 356 €/ha and from row deviations\
    \ of\n180 mm was 285 to 612 €/ha.\nAn experiment was conducted in south-central\
    \ Alabama during 2003–2005 to evaluate how the\ndistance of cotton row from deep\
    \ tillage can affect cotton yield and economic performance and it\nwas shown that\
    \ as distance between the planted row and tillage pass increased cotton yields\
    \ were\nreduced by 24–52% and net revenues from cotton production by 38–83%. An\
    \ economic analysis\nof farms adopting auto-guidance systems showed that systems\
    \ with inaccuracies below 2.5 cm are\nmost proﬁtable for larger farms, while systems\
    \ with less than 10 cm inaccuracy are a better economic\nalternative for smaller\
    \ farms [103]. The accuracy level of these systems is based on the quality of\n\
    differential correction and internal data processing (as the accuracy improves,\
    \ the corresponding cost\nincreases).\nFarmers identify as the most frequently\
    \ mentioned disadvantage of machine guidance the up-front\ncost [104]. Machine\
    \ guidance has scalable cost according to the accuracy obtained from each system.\n\
    The cost starts from 1320 € if a GNSS device is already held by the farmer. Commercial\
    \ applicators\nthat require a system that combine recording of all operations\
    \ (to different customers) together with\nfull navigation can reach more than\
    \ 12,770 €. A fully automatic navigation system with operator\nengagement only\
    \ at ﬁeld ends could range from 5284–44,040 €. It is important to select between\
    \ simple\nswathing aids such as foam-marker systems that cost between 440 € and\
    \ 2642 € and machine guidance\nsystems. As a rule-of-thumb, a navigation system\
    \ could cost six times more than a foam-marker\nsystem, which means that justiﬁcation\
    \ for GNSS navigation over foam markers must be computed\nfrom the beneﬁt side\
    \ [104].\nMachine guidance can have a variety of indirect economic impacts that\
    \ are due to the accurate\napplication of different agricultural practices. For\
    \ example, it is complicated to estimate the economic\nimpact of sprayer skips,\
    \ as inﬂuence of weed control on crop yield varies by crop and weed population\n\
    and long-term weed seed-bank effects have to be evaluated and assessed. When a\
    \ ﬁeld is relatively\nweed-free, the skip impact to yield-loss might be minimal,\
    \ but in a heavily infested ﬁeld the yield\nmay drop to almost zero in the skipped\
    \ area. The most important about pesticide application\ngaps in economic terms\
    \ is the creation of a weed seed bank all through the ﬁeld that will lead\nto\
    \ management problems and greatly increased weed control costs in future years.\
    \ Another case is\nthe impact of application gaps in fertilizer application, because\
    \ skipping a part of the ﬁeld is more\ncostly in a high-value crop (fruits and\
    \ vegetables) than in a bulk commodity such as corn, soybeans, or\nwheat [104].\n\
    5.4. Controlled Trafﬁc Farming (CTF)\n5.4.1. Description of CTF Technology\nControlled\
    \ Trafﬁc Farming is a system which conﬁnes all machinery loads to the least possible\n\
    area of permanent trafﬁc lanes. It is based on machine guidance, but it keeps\
    \ record of each ﬁeld\nand application to follow the same route every year. CTF\
    \ allows optimised driving patterns, more\nefﬁcient operations (i.e., reduced\
    \ overlaps) and targeted input applications. It increases sustainability\nby reducing\
    \ soil compaction and allows farming intensiﬁcation as it prevents yield loss,\
    \ nutrient and\nwater efﬁciency reduction, soil degradation and alleviation costs.\n\
    5.4.2. GHG Emission Reduction Potential through CTF\nCTF can reduce GHGs emissions\
    \ as it affects the quantity of agricultural inputs used in ﬁeld\noperations (fuel,\
    \ fertilisers, and pesticides). A study on the potential impact of site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n15 of 28\nand controlled trafﬁc systems\
    \ implemented on larger farms in Denmark (300 ha and above) has stressed\nhow\
    \ a reduction of fuel costs by 25–27% in cereals can be traced back to a lesser\
    \ overlap, but also how\n3–5% savings in fertiliser and pesticide in cereals can\
    \ be obtained (in comparison to fertilizers and\npesticides application in a conventional\
    \ manner) [105]. In the same work, fuel reduction was mainly\ndue to ease of cultivation\
    \ (loose soil due to minimum compaction) and of course due to minimum\noverpassing.\
    \ Better soil structure means that conditions will be more favourable for the\
    \ absorption of\nGHG emissions that can be stored into the soil (e.g., CH4) and\
    \ for prevention of harmful gases being\nproduced through anaerobic conditions,\
    \ such as N2O and CH4. The greater number and larger size\nof pores in a non-trafﬁcked\
    \ soil means that more water inﬁltrates and is captured within the proﬁle.\nThis\
    \ means that not only there is less potential for run-off and erosion, but also\
    \ that there will be more\nplant available water that will probably increase yield.\
    \ Higher yields can be translated into increased\ncarbon stock in the crop itself,\
    \ but also will reduce GHG emission intensity as even if all agricultural\ninputs\
    \ remain constant their ration with yield will decrease.\nTullberg (2016) [106]\
    \ has analysed the impact of CTF in GHG emissions directly and indirectly,\nby\
    \ reducing energy inputs, facilitating zero tillage and increasing fertiliser\
    \ efﬁciency. Primarily,\nhe referred to an approximate reduction of tractor fuel\
    \ requirements of 40% and 70% while using\nuncontrolled trafﬁc zero tillage and\
    \ controlled trafﬁc zero tillage farming, respectively, in comparison\nto conventional\
    \ tillage. The CTF effect is a result of improved tractive efﬁciency and reduced\
    \ draft\nat planting, reduced rolling resistance at harvest and spraying operations,\
    \ and the total elimination\nof tillage. Then, he explained that there is no work\
    \ in literature about how CTF reduce herbicide\nrequirement, but he pointed out\
    \ that there is reduction due to more timely spraying from permanent\nlanes and\
    \ the overall mean reduction can reach 25%. Fertilizers were also referred, as\
    \ in CTF they are\nnot applied to permanent wheel tracks, which is translated\
    \ to fertilizer cost reduction of 10–15% for\nnarrow-spaced crops, while yield\
    \ increases by about the same amount. CTF was also mentioned to\nincrease nitrogen\
    \ efﬁciency (40–80%), due to reduced soil compaction and improved soil biological\n\
    activity when CTF is applied. In addition, as nitrogen fertilisers are applied\
    \ at seeding time in a moist\ncompacted seed zone with limited drainage, it is\
    \ expected that denitriﬁcation is increased and as\na consequence N2O will also\
    \ increase. However, CTF will minimise this problem because it reduces\nseed zone\
    \ compaction and waterlogging and allows the farmer to split fertilizer applications\
    \ with\ndenitriﬁcation reduction as a side effect. Finally, it was explained that\
    \ CTF increase soil carbon stock\nas it reduces soil disturbance and improves\
    \ the potential for cropping to mimic natural vegetation in\nmaximising dry matter\
    \ production (and water use) by double or cover cropping.\n5.4.3. Impacts of the\
    \ Use of CTF on Productivity and Farm Economics\nHeavy machinery passing on soil\
    \ causes damage mainly due to compaction especially in wet\nconditions. If trafﬁc\
    \ is reduced or stopped, soil becomes more friable, it requires little or no tillage\
    \ and\nits structure gets better year after year. CTF reduces compaction by conﬁning\
    \ wheels or tracks to the\nleast possible area of permanent trafﬁc lanes. CTF\
    \ is used to create and maintain healthy soils and crops\nin combination with\
    \ sustainable farm proﬁt. CTF typically releases 57–115 €/ha extra proﬁt including\n\
    the required investment, cost savings and increased yields [107]. Investment has\
    \ to do with the machine\nguidance installed in the agricultural machinery in\
    \ use (tractors, self-propelled sprayers, harvesters)\nand it was analysed in\
    \ machine guidance section. Cost savings include improved ﬁeld efﬁciency, less\n\
    tillage and signiﬁcant capital savings on machinery due to lower powered tractors\
    \ needed.\nField efﬁciency is increased by reducing agricultural inputs and simultaneously\
    \ increase yield.\nUsing CTF can decrease fertiliser use by 10–15% for narrow-spaced\
    \ crops and pesticide reduction can\nreach 25% [106]. Horsch company [108] pointed\
    \ out that fuel use for crop establishment with CTF is\nreduced by at least 35%,\
    \ while Jensen et al. (2012) [105] estimated that it may be possible to reduce\n\
    costs of fuel by 25–27% in cereals due to less overlap. Horsch company [108] also\
    \ mentioned that\ntime and energy for crop establishment can even be reduced by\
    \ 70%, while it was pointed out that\nCTF can increase yield about 15% more (averaged\
    \ across 15 crops) than randomly trafﬁcked soils as\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\
    16 of 28\na result of improved root growth that uses water and fertiliser more\
    \ efﬁciently. According to Chamen\n(2016) [109], CTF is focused on the reduction\
    \ of compaction, while the system in Australia already\nshows yield gains of 15%\
    \ in sandy soils and 5% in heavier soils. The same source pointed out that\na\
    \ 1400 ha wheat/oilseed rape rotation farm converted from minimum tillage farming\
    \ to CTF no-tillage\nwas found to increase yield by 4% in wheat and 7.5% in oilseed\
    \ rape [109].\nIn addition, machinery costs are reduced as lighter machines with\
    \ less power are needed. Some\nfarmers in Australia have cut their machinery costs\
    \ by as much as 75%, while their crop yields have\nrisen [109]. Horsch company\
    \ [108] explains that CTF planning can decrease the costs, because on the\none\
    \ hand existing equipment may be enough for the new farming system and on the\
    \ other farmers\nconverting to CTF can sell a lot of their equipment and invest\
    \ in lower powered tractors (15% more\nproﬁt and 20% reduction in machinery costs\
    \ have been recorded).\nGrain research and development corporation of Australia\
    \ [110] reported that the total cost for\nadopting CTF varies signiﬁcantly from\
    \ farm to farm due to farm’s equipment level, ranging between\n21,140 € and 52,850\
    \ €. A 1400 ha wheat/oilseed rape rotation farm that converted from minimum\n\
    tillage farming to CTF no tillage was examined, and it was found that farm proﬁt\
    \ was increased by\n8% and the return on capital investment was 14% [109]. It\
    \ was also shown that 290,000 € savings on\nmachinery investment was achieved.\
    \ The cost of UK consultants for providing farm survey to the\nfarmer, including\
    \ the present production constraints, the machinery and equipment requirements\
    \ to\napply CTF was estimated to 927 € plus expense and VAT. If the farmer requires\
    \ a full action plan to\ninstall CTF the service cost is increased to 1390 € plus\
    \ expense and VAT [109].\n5.5. Variable Rate Pesticide Application (VRPA)\n5.5.1.\
    \ Description of VRPA Technologies\nVariable rate pesticide application (VRPA)\
    \ technologies enable changes in the application rate to\nmatch actual or potential\
    \ pest stress in the ﬁeld and avoid application to undesired areas of the ﬁeld\
    \ or\nplant canopies [111]. They can also be used to apply fertiliser at variable\
    \ rates [112].\nThere are two types of VR pesticide application technology.\n\
    The map-based VR pesticide\napplication adjusts the application rate based on\
    \ a prescription map, using a GPS receiver to identify\nthe ﬁeld position and\
    \ the input concentration is changed as the applicator moves through the ﬁeld\
    \ [42].\nThe real-time sensor-based VR pesticide application changes the application\
    \ rate using the current\nsituation of pest stress or canopy characteristics that\
    \ is identiﬁed by the difference on colour, shape,\nsize, texture, reﬂectance,\
    \ and temperatures of pests that is detected by different sensor types (colour\n\
    cameras, photodetectors, laser scanners, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras,\
    \ thermal cameras,\nand ultrasonic sensors). The sensor input can also be used\
    \ to control the direction and rate of\nchemical application [111]. There are\
    \ also technologies of VR pesticide application that combine\nsensor-based and\
    \ map-based applicators to achieve higher precision (Greenseeker, Isaria, etc.).\
    \ VR\npesticide application technologies use other PATs (GNSS, machine guidance,\
    \ crop sensing, and leaf\nwetness sensors) to apply the optimum pesticide quantity\
    \ site-speciﬁcally. The common use of crop\nsensor technologies for both VR fertilizer\
    \ and pesticide application is possible and can reduce cost\nof use.\n5.5.2. GHG\
    \ Emission Reduction Potential through VRPA\nPesticide application using variable\
    \ rate technologies have the advantage of applying reduced\nquantities of pesticides,\
    \ not exceeding the application rate indicated for the diagnosed disease (e.g.,\n\
    fungicides), or enemy (e.g., insecticides) or weed type (e.g., herbicide).\nThis\
    \ means that the crop yield will not be affect negatively, as the enemy or rival\
    \ will be treated at\nlease as efﬁciently as before. At the same time, the reduction\
    \ of chemical application will affect the\nquality of the ﬁnal product that could\
    \ increase farm proﬁtability due to increase product prices.\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 1339\n17 of 28\nThe environmental beneﬁts from pesticide application reduction\
    \ are numerous as ground and\nwater contamination is reduced and the inﬂuence\
    \ on biodiversity becomes lower [113]. In addition,\nlimiting insecticide use\
    \ and precision application of pesticides to only infested spots, provide ﬂoral\n\
    resources and shelter habitats that can increase the abundance, diversity and\
    \ ﬁtness of natural enemies,\ndecrease pest damage, increase crop yield and the\
    \ farmer’s proﬁt [114]. There is signiﬁcant work\non the saved pesticide quantity\
    \ that ranges from 11 to 90% for herbicide use in different arable crop\ntypes\
    \ [113,115–117]. Other work recorded pesticide use reduction in perennial crops\
    \ between 28%\nand 70% [118–121]. VRPA can also cause reductions in insecticide\
    \ use by 13.4% in winter wheat [122],\nwhile spray overlap can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ decreased with impact on the total pesticide use [123].\nThe impact of the high\
    \ pesticide reduction shown from the literature is environmentally signiﬁcant,\n\
    but, in terms of GHG emission reduction, the contribution of this technology to\
    \ the total agricultural\neffect is slight. The reason is that in this case GHG\
    \ emissions are mitigated only during the industrial\nproduction of the pesticide.\
    \ Even if the index of GHG emission production for every kg of pesticide\nis very\
    \ high in comparison to other agricultural inputs (seed, fertilisers, and fuel),\
    \ the total applied\nquantity is very low, mirroring a low total impact on GHGs\
    \ [124].\n5.5.3. Impacts of the Use of VRPA on Productivity and Farm Economics\n\
    Beneﬁts of variable rate pesticide spraying are mainly associated with savings\
    \ on pesticide use.\nSince most research has been done in the area of herbicide\
    \ application (vide supra), the focus of this\nsection lies on the economic impact\
    \ of VR herbicide application.\nOriade et al. (1996) [125] suggested that weed\
    \ patchiness is the most important factor economically\njustifying the use of\
    \ site-speciﬁc weed control. Using simulation, they showed that economic and\n\
    environmental beneﬁts are almost zero at low weed pressures, particularly if weeds\
    \ are evenly\nspread. The beneﬁts were larger as weed populations and level of\
    \ patchiness increased. At high\nweed patchiness, return values of 17 €/ha to\
    \ 33 €/ha were found in corn and soybean. The authors\nconcluded that returns\
    \ from site-speciﬁc management of less than 14 €/ha are not sufﬁcient to warrant\n\
    the practice. The costs of information collection, time application effects, and\
    \ human capital were not\nconsidered in this model. Beside pesticide saving, more\
    \ savings are possible from shorter times per\nhectare for ﬁlling the tank and\
    \ carrying the spray mixture to the ﬁeld by reducing the volume that is\nneeded\
    \ per hectare [113].\nSwinton (2003) [126] states that research results on the\
    \ proﬁtability of site-speciﬁc weed\nmanagement are very variable, because certain\
    \ studies focus only on potential reduced cost from less\nherbicide spraying,\
    \ while ignoring the increased capital cost of VR application equipment and the\n\
    increased variable cost of information processing. Other studies do take these\
    \ last two factors into\naccount, which results in more realistic numbers on proﬁtability.\
    \ Timmermann et al. (2003) [113]\nfound that the monetary savings resulting from\
    \ the reduction in herbicide use varied between crops,\ndepending on the amount\
    \ of herbicides saved and the price of herbicide. In maize, winter wheat,\nwinter\
    \ barley and sugar beet, savings of, respectively, 42 €/ha, 32 €/ha, 27 €/ha,\
    \ and 20 €/ha were\nrealised. In this regard, savings also depend on the different\
    \ economic thresholds for pest control\nand the different competitive power of\
    \ the crops. Batte and Ehsani (2006) [123] estimated spray\nmaterial savings of\
    \ about 4 €/ha for a map-based spraying system compared to a self-propelled\n\
    sprayer without any form of GPS for guidance assistance or sprayer control. The\
    \ magnitude of input\nsavings further increased as waterways were added to the\
    \ ﬁeld. Those authors also calculated the\ncosts of the map-based spraying system,\
    \ being 2911 €, 3004 € and 3096 € per year in extra costs for\nsprayers with a\
    \ boom width of 18.3, 27.4 and 36.6 meter, respectively. Most of the costs are\
    \ related\nto the ﬁxed investment which diminishes per hectare as farm size increases.\
    \ They also conclude that\nthe beneﬁts increase proportionally to the cost of\
    \ the pesticide being applied, the number of annual\napplications, and the driver\
    \ error-rate of the non-precision spraying system.\nGerhards and Sökefeld (2003)\
    \ [127] evaluated the economic beneﬁts of a real-time, automatic,\nsite-speciﬁc\
    \ weed control system compared to conventional ﬁeld spraying. They found that,\
    \ although\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n18 of 28\nthe costs (ﬁxed + variable)\
    \ for the VR technology were larger (9.56 €/ha vs. 5.20 €/ha), the average\ncosts\
    \ for weed control were lower due to herbicide savings (32 €/ha vs. 68 €/ha in\
    \ winter wheat and\nwinter barley, 69 €/ha vs. 148 €/ha in sugar beet, and 96\
    \ €/ha vs. 103 €/ha in maize). Based on these\neconomic calculations, Dammer and\
    \ Wartenberg (2007) [117] comment that, if sensors were available\non the market,\
    \ it would be proﬁtable for farmers to invest in VR technologies.\nCosts of map-based\
    \ VRPA are attributed to mapping, data processing, decision making and\nsite-speciﬁc\
    \ application technology. Commercial mapping services typically charge 4.5–9.0\
    \ €/ha to\nmap ﬁeld boundaries including waterways and other physical features\
    \ [123]. Gerhards and Sökefeld\n(2003) [127] estimated the costs of a direct injection\
    \ system at 3.9 €/ha (in addition to the costs of the\nsprayer) for weed control\
    \ in sugar beet, maize, winter wheat and winter barley in a German study.\nBatte\
    \ and Ehsani (2006) [123] stated that the extra cost of a precision sprayer equipped\
    \ with individually\ncontrolled nozzles based on GNSS information would be about\
    \ 8000 €. However, Timmermann et al.\n(2003) [113] commented that several components\
    \ of VR technology, including GNSS, board computer\nand GIS, can also be used\
    \ for other precision farming activities such as planting, fertilisation and\n\
    harvest, and can therefore not be considered as a cost that is solely related\
    \ to VRPA.\nIn contrast to map-based VRPA, an additional step of generating an\
    \ application map with the\nhelp of GIS is not necessary. Therefore, there are\
    \ no additional costs for computers, GIS software or\nDGPS. However, the sensor\
    \ technology can be very expensive, although cheap sensors are available as\n\
    well. Gerhards and Sökefeld (2003) [127] estimated the cost of a camera system\
    \ for weed detection at\n40,000 €, whereas Dammer and Wartenberg (2007) [117]\
    \ used an optoelectronic weed sensor of about\n2000 €. The latter could however\
    \ not distinguish between crops and weeds and was therefore limited\nin its operations.\
    \ In a study on maize-based cropping systems, experts within Europe evaluated\
    \ that\nprecision spraying using GPS spray maps can result in a net proﬁt within\
    \ a time frame of 3–4 years [128].\n5.6. Variable Rate Planting/Seeding (VRP/VRS)\n\
    5.6.1. Description\nVariable rate planting/seeding (VRP/VRS) is the method of\
    \ varying the rate of plants or seeds\naccording to local soil potential. Regular\
    \ planters/seeders are based on the constant rate of plants or\nseeds through\
    \ a ground drive wheel, while VR systems is equipped with independent gear box\n\
    or hydraulic drive that is controlled according to the needs of the certain part\
    \ of the ﬁeld [42].\nMore advanced systems have independent planting/seeding elements\
    \ that can also differentiate\nthe application rate on-the-go per row [129]. A\
    \ prescription map is required. VRP/VRS eliminate\ndouble planting in headlands\
    \ and point rows and in very heterogeneous ﬁelds redistribute within\nﬁeld seeds\
    \ in the optimum quantity. VRP/VRS can perform better in heterogeneous ﬁelds because\n\
    seed rate differentiation will affect the yield in low crop performance zones\
    \ and the ﬁnal output will\nbe in favour of the farmer.\nAnother technology developed\
    \ in recent years is multi-hybrid planting/seeding. Machine\nmanufacturers have\
    \ started developing seeding machines that are able to seed two or more different\n\
    hybrids at the same time: one high demanding and high yielding hybrid which is\
    \ sown on the high\nperformance zones of a ﬁeld, while the other hybrid is a more\
    \ resilient, but less yielding hybrid, which\nis sown on the low performance zones\
    \ of the same ﬁeld. The input-side of the technology is similar\nto the input\
    \ used for VRA planters/seeders. The difference between the two technologies is\
    \ found\non the output side. Multi-hybrid planting/seeding needs two (or more)\
    \ separate seed hoppers and\nan adapted seed dispensing system.\n5.6.2. GHG Emission\
    \ Reduction Potential through VRP/VRS\nWhen applying VRP/VRS it is possible that\
    \ the total plant/seed quantity used in the ﬁeld will\nbe lower (less GHG emissions\
    \ coming from the production of the plant or the seed) or the same as\nin conventional\
    \ seeding. Nevertheless, an effect of VRP/VRS on GHG emissions can be expected\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n19 of 28\nthrough the increased yield [130]. Another\
    \ means of GHG reduction is the decreased fuel required for\ngenerating the same\
    \ amount of harvest, since through VRP/VRS more harvest can be produced on\na\
    \ given soil surface.\n5.6.3. Impacts of the Use of VRP/VRS on Productivity and\
    \ Farm Economics\nThe main beneﬁt from VRP/VRS is an increase in yield (vide infra).\
    \ The main factor driving the\neconomic performance of VRP/VRS is soil variability.\
    \ In very uniform ﬁelds, the return on investment\nof VRP/VRS will be low, while,\
    \ in heterogeneous ﬁelds with differentiated performance zones, the\nreturn on\
    \ investment will be much higher. In the early years of VRP/VRS development, its\
    \ economic\nimpact was unclear.\nVariable seeding rate of winter wheat can offer\
    \ increase in yield from 3% compared to uniform\nseeding [131]. Another research\
    \ showed that farmers using variable rate seeding have achieved\nan average winter\
    \ wheat yield beneﬁt of 4.6% over and above farmers drilling at a ﬂat rate. This\
    \ makes\nthe average winter wheat yield beneﬁt over the four years of study (2011–2014)\
    \ to be 6.45% [132].\nCorn yields can be increased by 6% using VRS [133]. Although\
    \ VRS dates back at the ﬁrst years of\nprecision agriculture movement, its importance\
    \ was recently acknowledged by farmers. Speciﬁcally,\n10–12% climb in acquisition\
    \ of VRS drills and planters was noticed in USA in 2007 [134].\nBullock et al.\
    \ (1998) [135] observed differences in economically optimal plant densities for\
    \ different\nﬁeld qualities: they estimated that areas of the ﬁeld with higher\
    \ yield potential could beneﬁt from\na higher plant density. At the time, they\
    \ concluded that VRS would be infeasible, because of the high\ncost associated\
    \ with characterizing site variability. Another work stated that the investments\
    \ necessary\nfor adopting variable rate corn seeding would only be economically\
    \ justiﬁable for farmers with some\nlow yield potential land, where signiﬁcant\
    \ seeds savings and yield gains can be made, but not for\nfarmers with a mix of\
    \ solely medium and high potential land [136]. Taylor and Staggenborg (2000) [137]\n\
    concluded that VRS was only economically feasible on their ﬁelds of study if less\
    \ expensive ways to\ngenerate the prescription map were available or if corn showed\
    \ a greater yield response to seeding\nrate. Shanahan et al. (2004) [138] stated\
    \ that “site-speciﬁc management of plant densities may be [ed:\neconomically]\
    \ feasible”, most likely due to technological advances. Dillon et al. (2009) [139]\
    \ performed\nsensitivity analysis with respect to alternative soils, seed price,\
    \ wheat price and cost of VRS technology\nto determine the economic feasibility\
    \ of VRS and concluded that the practice of VRS of wheat in\nFrance is economically\
    \ feasible. Hörbe et al. (2013) [130] performed two experiments that tested the\n\
    economic returns of VRS in maize according to a prescription map with three management\
    \ zones, i.e.\na low crop performance zone (LZ), receiving 31% less seeds/ha,\
    \ a medium crop performance zone\n(MZ), receiving the normal seeding rate, and\
    \ a high crop performance zone (HZ) receiving 13% more\nseeds/ha. This resulted\
    \ in a yield increase of 1.20 and 1.90 tons/ha in the LZ of the two experiments,\n\
    and 0.89 and 0.94 tons/ha in the HZ. In the second experiment, carried out one\
    \ year after the ﬁrst,\nin growing season 2010–2011, this resulted to a partial\
    \ net income (excluding extra costs for the VR\nseeder) that was around 7% higher\
    \ than in the same ﬁeld seeded with a ﬂat rate over the entire ﬁeld.\nIn total,\
    \ 71.5% of this higher net income was gained in the LZ, although the LZ area was\
    \ smaller than\nthe HZ area (22% vs. 28% of the total ﬁeld area, respectively).\n\
    A study of automatic section control systems in VR planters among 52 ﬁelds showed\
    \ a percentage\nof double-planted area to reach up to 15.5% and the savings from\
    \ the use of VR planters ranged from\n3.5 to 22.9 €/ha depending on the farming\
    \ operation and the ﬁeld type [140].\nNo independent scientiﬁc research on the\
    \ economic impact of multi-hybrid planting/seeding is\ncurrently available, because\
    \ this technology has been developed very recently.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\
    20 of 28\n5.7. Precision Physical Weeding Technology (PPW)\n5.7.1. Description\
    \ of PPW Technology\nPrecision physical weeding (PPW) technology is the method\
    \ of weed control through burning,\nmechanical weed control with knives, discs,\
    \ hoes or harrows with minimum crop damage and no\nchemical herbicide use. The\
    \ technology is still in its infancy, with some prototypes that use precise\n\
    guidance and detection systems being available.\nThe most promising approach for\
    \ weed detection is a continuous ground-based image analysis\nsystem that locate\
    \ crop row in the ﬁeld [141]. In this work, the design and development of an automatic\n\
    machine able to perform, at the same time, mechanical and thermal weed control\
    \ on maize was\nreported. Other detection system would be ultrasonic sensors that\
    \ detect plant density that when\nit is increased the harrow treats this part\
    \ more aggressively [142]. In this work, a system for online\nweed control was\
    \ developed. It automatically adjusts the tine angle of a harrow and creates different\n\
    levels of intensity (gentle to aggressive). A hybrid physical/chemical weeding\
    \ system is mentioned\nby Norremark (2010) [143]. A robotic physical weeding system\
    \ is applied in sugar beet that execute\nreal-time weed infestation survey and\
    \ apply four-row intra-row precision weed control implement\ncombined with four-row\
    \ precision spraying (10% of normal herbicide dose rate). It can also combine\n\
    an inter–row weed control implement that increases its efﬁciency.\n5.7.2. GHG\
    \ emission Reduction Potential through PPW\nPrecision physical weeding technology\
    \ might have an effect on reducing GHG emissions\nthrough the production of the\
    \ avoided pesticides. In the case of mechanical precision weeding,\nfuel consumption\
    \ will also be reduced (and the respective GHGs) because the tractor pulling the\n\
    weeding implement will confront lower draught forces coming from soil tilling\
    \ when the angle of the\nharrow tines will be less aggressive than with the conventional\
    \ tillers [142]. In the case of precision\nthermal weed control, the fuel for\
    \ weed burning is expected to be lowered reﬂecting in GHG emissions\nin comparison\
    \ to conventional weed burning implements that have continuous ﬂame covering all\
    \ ﬁeld\nsurface. However, if thermal weed control is applied in ﬁelds that the\
    \ conventional weeding is based\nin mechanical tillage then the GHGs from burning\
    \ weeds will contribute negatively in climate change.\nIn addition, when conventional\
    \ chemical weeding is substituted from precision thermal weeding, the\nGHG emissions\
    \ coming from pesticides reduction will be partially compensated from the emissions\n\
    emitted from weed burning. As in the case of VR pesticide application, the impact\
    \ on the avoided\nGHG emissions of the total agricultural system is expected to\
    \ be low.\n5.7.3. Impacts of PPW on Productivity and Farm Economics\nThe hybrid\
    \ mechanical/chemical system showed total estimated cost reduction for 10-year\n\
    depreciation and 5% interest rate was 12% (in particular 260 €/ha, while conventional\
    \ weeding\ncosts 297 €/ha) in a 80 ha ﬁeld size working 667 hours per year. When\
    \ the inter-row weed control\nimplement is added to the system, the cost reduction\
    \ can reach 24%. This is due to the reduction in\ntotal weed management costs\
    \ compared to the conventional [143]. Peruzzi et al. (2008) [144] worked\non physical\
    \ weed control in open ﬁeld tomatoes by applying a rolling harrow and a ﬂaming\
    \ machine\nin pre-transplanting together with precision hoeing in post-transplanting.\
    \ It was noticed that yield\nincreased by 15–20% due to better weed management\
    \ which resulted in 400–700 €/ha on top of the\nnormal harvest.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    Climate change is a fact, and anthropogenic activities are one of the parameters\
    \ accelerating the\nphenomenon. Through the years, agriculture did not receive\
    \ great attention in terms of GHG emission\nproduction, as yield increase was\
    \ the target. In the recent past, analysis of the impact of this sector on\nclimate\
    \ change has been executed and several mitigation measures were proposed.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 1339\n21 of 28\nPA has several positive impacts on agricultural systems\
    \ translated to increased farm productivity\nand income and recently there is\
    \ signiﬁcant interest on the possible GHG emission mitigation using\nPATs. However,\
    \ literature is limited on data regarding the effect of PA on climate change.\
    \ All categories\nof PATs (guidance, recording, and reacting) contribute to the\
    \ reduction of GHG emissions due to their\ninterconnections and it is difﬁcult\
    \ to separate them according to importance. Recording and GNSS\ntechnologies are\
    \ supportive in the PA process, while reacting technologies and guidance systems\
    \ have\na direct visible result on the agricultural system that are applied on.\
    \ Hence, these PATs were analysed\naccording to their potential to reduce GHG\
    \ emissions and improve farm productivity and income.\n•\nVariable rate nutrient\
    \ application (VRNA) technologies can reduce the fertilizer quantities applied\n\
    in modern agriculture by using technology to cover site-speciﬁc nutrient needs.\
    \ VRNA can be\napplied to all nutrient application, with nitrogen being the most\
    \ important to be regulated through\nthese technologies as it is the element that\
    \ is mostly used for crop growth increase and covers the\nhighest percentage of\
    \ fertilizers globally. Therefore, VRNA can signiﬁcantly contribute in accurate\n\
    nutrient management, which can be translated to reduction of GHG emissions and\
    \ especially\nnitrogen that is responsible for N2O release (the GHG derived from\
    \ agricultural activities with the\nhighest global warming potential). They can\
    \ also affect positively farm productivity and income\nby increasing ﬁnal yield\
    \ especially in low productivity sections of a farm and by reducing the\nfertilization\
    \ costs that follows optimized application of nitrogen according to the plants’\
    \ needs.\n•\nVariable rate irrigation (VRI) systems have the following GHG emission\
    \ reduction potential, as its\nimpact is dual: primarily, the decrease of irrigated\
    \ water reduces the energy for water pumping,\nand, secondly, the optimum irrigation\
    \ scheduling affect signiﬁcantly the release of GHG emissions\nderived from fertilisers\
    \ through the soil (mainly N2O). In terms of productivity, the impact is\nalso\
    \ signiﬁcant, particularly in dry areas, as irrigation scheduling kai dosage can\
    \ be optimized\nresulting in economic beneﬁts (lower pumping costs combined with\
    \ higher yields).\n•\nControlled Trafﬁc Farming (CTF) and machine guidance (MG)\
    \ limit the use of tractors to only the\nnecessary passes through the ﬁelds avoiding\
    \ overlapping with respective decrease in agricultural\ninputs and fuel (translated\
    \ into GHG emissions reduction and lower cost of production). Variable\nrate pesticide\
    \ application (VRPA) is also expected to have GHG reduction potential by reducing\n\
    the pesticide application and its industrial production. However, the actual environmental\
    \ effect\ncan be extremely signiﬁcant, but through lower chemical substances application\
    \ that contaminates\nall natural resources (water, air, and soil). The effect\
    \ on farm economics is also major, especially in\ncrops that receive many chemical\
    \ applications, such as herbicides and fungicides.\n•\nVariable rate planting/seeding\
    \ (VRP/VRS) and precision physical weeding (PPW) show lower,\nbut not irrelevant\
    \ GHG emission mitigation. VRP/VRS is mainly important for optimising\nplant density\
    \ in the ﬁeld that can increase farm productivity, while the reduction in seed/plant\n\
    population is associated with GHG emissions during their production. PPW reduces\
    \ pesticide\napplication and fuel used for ﬂame burning of weeds.\nIt is believed\
    \ that PA adoption can be increased signiﬁcantly if the PATs available in the\
    \ market\nwould combine more precise and robust sensors specialised for each activity\
    \ and the end-users\n(farmers) will receive quantiﬁed information of the farm\
    \ proﬁt augmentation and the positive\nsustainability impact, combined with reduced\
    \ investment cost for PAT purchase. Therefore, there\nis a necessity that more\
    \ research should be carried out on quantifying the impact of PATs on GHG\nemissions\
    \ reduction and the respective productivity and income inﬂuence, as there is strong\
    \ evidence\nof the contribution of PATs to climate change mitigation and the increase\
    \ of production efﬁciency (yield\nand economics). Speciﬁc attention should be\
    \ given to research of different macronutrients impact\n(direct and indirect)\
    \ on GHG emissions by regulating the status of each element in crops. Optimised\n\
    methods of application could maintain the amount of essential nutrients in desired\
    \ quantity that will\nprimarily reduce undesired yield loss that could be due\
    \ to unknown stresses coming from unbalanced\nnutrient combination, and secondly\
    \ will improve the carbon footprint of crops.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\

  analysis: 'The paper presents a system that utilizes fuzzy logic to create prescriptive
    maps to be used in controlling the speed of irrigation pivots. The proposed system
    uses satellite images as input for providing spatial variability to the decision-making
    process. For the given case studies, the intelligent system determined variations
    in the linear movement speed of the pivot according to satellite images, making
    it possible to estimate water stress in different planted areas. The approach
    uses three input variables (NDVI, upper layer soil moisture, and canopy temperature)
    to infer the speed at which the central pivot needs to move to improve the irrigation
    level within the crop area.


    The paper provides three verbatim quotes relevant to the point and review:


    **Verbatim quote 1:**

    “From the location selected for cultivation and the type of crop to be irrigated,
    in relation to the data linked to the type of plant, a crop coefficient will be
    used together with information from satellite images. In this case, NDVI reading,
    upper layer soil moisture, and canopy temperature values will be used.”


    This quote describes the inputs used by the fuzzy logic system for decision making.


    **Verbatim quote 2:**

    “Prescriptive maps for VRI with central pivots were successfully developed. However,
    a broader and commercial application will depend on the integration of data collection
    systems, management strategies, and hardware control. In other words, the fuzzy
    logic model performed as expected, providing excellent results. However, the reliability
    of data sources (NDVI, surface soil water, and canopy temperature) to develop
    a reliable prescription map is the scope of future study.”


    This quote discusses the limitations of the current system and suggests areas
    for future research.


    **Verbatim quote 3:**

    “The implemented fuzzy system obtained the result shown in Fig. 9, which illustrates
    different regions within the area, with different values for the pivot rotation
    speed. A thinner water layer is applied with higher speed and a higher application
    of water in the soil occurs with lower rotation speed (Valín, Cameira, Teodoro,
    & Pereira, 2012).”


    This quote explains how the fuzzy logic system determines the speed of the irrigation
    pivot based on the input data.'

    • Variable rate irrigation speed control was enhanced using spatial variability.
    • Increasing or decreasing the rotation speed of central pivot using fuzzy system.
    • Combining edaphoclimatic variables to fuzzy logic can solve problems in irrigation.
    • Expert system using remote sensing can manage the speed control for central
    pivot. Abstract Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is the capacity to spatially vary
    the depth of water application in a field to handle different types of soils,
    crops, and other conditions. Precise management zones must be developed to efficiently
    apply variable rate technologies. However, there is no universal method to determine
    management zones. Using speed control maps for the central pivot is one option.
    Thus, this study aims to develop an intelligent fuzzy inference system based on
    precision irrigation knowledge, i.e., a system that can create prescriptive maps
    to control the rotation speed of the central pivot. Satellite images are used
    in this study because remote sensing offers quick measurements and easy access
    to information on crops for large irrigation areas. Based on the VRI-prescribed
    map created using the intelligent decision-making system, the pivot can increase
    or decrease its speed, reaching the desired depth of application in a certain
    irrigation zone. Therefore, considering the spatial variability in the crop has
    made the strategy of speed control more realistic than traditional methods for
    crop management. The intelligent irrigation system pointed out areas with lower
    leaf development, indicating that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing
    the water layer applied to that area. The existence of well-divided zones could
    be observed; each zone provides a specific value for the speed that the pivot
    must develop for decreasing or increasing the application of the water layer to
    the crop area. Three quarters of the total crop area had spatial variations during
    water application. The set point built by the developed system pointed out zones
    with a decreased speed in the order of 50%. From the viewpoint of a traditional
    control, the relay from pivot percent timer should have been adjusted from 70%
    to 35% whenever the central pivot passed over that specific area. The proposed
    system obtained values of 37% and 47% to adjust the pivot percent timer. Therefore,
    it is possible to affirm that traditional control models used for central-pivot
    irrigators do not support the necessary precision to meet the demands of speed
    control determined by the developed VRI systems. Results indicate that data from
    the edaphoclimatic variables when well-fitted to the fuzzy logic can solve uncertainties
    and non-linearities of an irrigation system and establish a control model for
    high-precision irrigation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    system 1. Introduction The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
    Nations estimates that to meet food demands in 2050 agriculture production must
    at least double or triple in the next 40 years, and 80% of this increase must
    come from increasing the production. Considering the limited resources of our
    planet, reaching this goal will be challenging (FAO, 2016). The adoption of irrigated
    agriculture enables increased productivity and the production of several crops
    (Borghetti, Silva, Nocko, Loyola, & Chianca, 2017). However, with the growing
    limitation of water resources, the use of water in agriculture must be more efficient
    to maintain the current levels of productivity in conjunction with the expansion
    of irrigated areas. Decisions for irrigation management require taking into consideration
    inter-related economic, physical, and biological variables, which are frequently
    difficult to foresee and over which there is little or no control (Herrera, Ibeas,
    & de la Sen, 2013). The decade-long search for automated solutions to improve
    agricultural application for more efficient use (Evans and King, 2012, Gilley
    et al., 1983, Omary et al., 1997, Sadler et al., 1996) has resulted in the introduction
    of several solutions for agricultural inputs to conduct water application with
    spatial correction. Irrigation systems that operate using variable rate water
    application are required for a spatial water management to increase crop efficiency
    (Armindo, Botrel, & Garzella, 2011). Decision support systems for irrigation and
    water conservation are used intensely for minimizing water application and maximizing
    yield. However, the numerical optimization of irrigation systems is computer-intensive
    and often requires simplification and discretization of the model (Dogan et al.,
    2010, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). Furthermore, sensorial system and model integration
    do not reflect the natural flow of the environment (Voinov & Shugart, 2013), creating
    significant limitations in performance. Control systems also do not reflect or
    satisfy the requirements of the final users due to the lack of domain knowledge
    capture (McIntosh et al., 2011). The use of advanced control techniques is a promising
    possibility. Literature shows that these tools can significantly improve irrigation
    systems and efficient use of water resources (McCarthy et al., 2013, Romero et
    al., 2012). The final challenge of an environmental and agricultural support system
    is to overcome the uncertainty related to data quality and difficulties in remote
    sensing of large areas (Dutta et al., 2014, McCarthy et al., 2013). Moreover,
    the inter-related economic, physical, and biological variables are multi-attributed
    vaguely and in subjective terms. A neat approach to deal with such uncertain situations
    is found in the fuzzy set theory, which has now reached a mature state for expansion
    and application. Zadeh''s paper “Fuzzy Sets” was published in 1965; since then,
    the theory of fuzzy sets has been used for writing more realistic decision support
    models. Fuzzy logic can analyze the imprecise information and is efficient in
    decision-making for vague and uncertain phenomena (Kweon, 2012). Specialized systems
    that used fuzzy logic in its inception have been successfully applied to problems
    concerning decision, control, diagnose, and classification (Castillo & Melin,
    2008) because they are capable of managing intrinsic complex reasoning in an application
    area. In agriculture, the interface of these systems allows a natural and straightforward
    use, as a planning tool for the manager and farmer. In irrigation systems, the
    interaction between components is not always accurately defined. Fuzzy logic can
    be used in such systems for extracting inferences from an inaccurate input and
    for solving problems in this area (Thangavadivelu & Colvin, 1997). An irrigation
    system based on the fuzzy logic with simple rules is more attractive to most farmers
    (Bahat, Inbar, Yaniv, & Schneider, 2000) since these systems do not require a
    precise measurement or a precise model, which may be very complicated and require
    considerable funds, resources and development time. This study is based on the
    premise that irrigation problems do not require precise measures. The support
    system to the fuzzy decision is considered useful due to its interactive nature
    and flexible approach (Kumar and Rajkumar, 2014, Raju and Kumar, 2005); therefore,
    the integration of fuzzy logic and irrigation planning issues in the field is
    very effective. Herein, several control techniques for VRI have been presented,
    of which some use fuzzy inference and neural networks for setting the amount of
    water required for irrigation (Bing et al., 2015, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli,
    2015, Papadopoulos et al., 2011, Papageorgiou et al., 2016). Other techniques
    focus on determining when to irrigate and instruments that show spatial differences
    among sectors in the same crop area (Montalvo et al., 2013, Omid et al., 2010,
    Rafea et al., 2003). However, all the techniques mentioned do not present control
    maps for the central pivot, as proposed herein. The problem examined herein is
    part of the crop production domain, approaching the issue of necessary decision-making
    for precision irrigation. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop
    a fuzzy inference system that decides when to increase or decrease the speed of
    the central pivot by considering the spatial variability of the field and using
    little or imprecise information of the phenophase of the crop provided by satellite
    images. 2. Variable rate irrigation system (VRIS) An intelligent irrigation system
    was developed by following the structure shown in Fig. 1. The structure of the
    proposed system allows the elaboration of the management map in a systematic,
    autonomous, and automatized way to control the irrigation system. The commercial
    systems used more frequently by farmers still cannot draw such a control map using
    the proposed technique. Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download :

    vegetation index (NDVI) and canopy temperature Vegetation indexes generated from
    the data gathered by remote sensing constitute an important tool for monitoring
    natural or anthropogenic changes in the use and coverage of the land. These indexes
    have been used to estimate several vegetation patterns, such as leaf area index
    and green biomass quantity, as well as in the evaluation of soil use and the maintenance
    and recovery of degraded areas (Okin, 2007). Information from satellite images
    and values from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) reading, which
    is an essential parameter for irrigation maintenance, were used and adjusted according
    to local conditions. Irrigation management through the plant shows the complexity
    inherent to the visualization of the symptoms of water deficit, which are difficult
    to detect. In certain occasions, problems are discovered when it is too late,
    i.e., when their effects have already compromised the production and quality of
    the product. Usually, these symptoms are related to the color tone of leaves,
    leaf curling, and leaf angle. However, a correlation between NDVI values and the
    basal crop coefficient (Kc) (Hunsaker, Barnes, Clarke, Fitzgerald, & Pinter, 2005;
    and Kamble, Kilic, & Hubbard, 2013) can be established since a strong correlation
    exists between estimated Kc (KcNDVI) and observed Kc (Allen, Pereira, Raes, &
    Smith, 1998/FAO-56) in corn and soy crops for guiding irrigation times in the
    season. The use of canopy temperature and infrared thermometry is another way
    to relate to the development of the crop through remote sensing. A plant under
    water stress has decreased transpiration and would typically show a higher temperature
    than a plant that is not under stress (Bellvert, Zarco-Tejada, Girona, & Fereres,
    2014), a trait that could be used as a powerful tool to monitor and quantify water
    stress. Canopy temperature increases when solar radiation is absorbed (Idso &
    Baker, 1967), but it cools down when the latent energy or transpiration is used
    for evaporating water instead of cooling plant surfaces. Further, algorithms based
    on canopy temperature are strongly correlated with quantifiable results from crops
    (Colaizzi, O''Shaughnessy, Evett, & Howell, 2012), such as yield, water efficiency
    use, seasonal evapotranspiration, leaf water potential at noon, irrigation rates,
    and damage caused by herbicides. 2.2. Satellite imagery The Intelligent Environmental
    Knowledgeable system (i-ekbase)1 is an autonomous big data analytics engine running
    a CLOUD system. i-ekbase is an easy-to-use fully automated geographic information
    system (GIS). It primarily focuses on precision agricultural and biodiversity
    monitoring applications, automatically integrating data from various satellites
    with local weather data, farmers’ knowledge, and applying Machine Learning techniques
    to create a data-driven future for global agriculture (Dutta et al., 2014). Fig.
    2 illustrates the i-ekbase visual interactive system based on big data integration

    all-purpose precision agricultural monitoring on a mobile device, for greater
    benefit to global agriculture community, and for increasing agriculture business
    profitability. The system services provide weekly or daily large area-wise resource
    management map products, including normalized vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture,
    biomass, surface temperature, vegetation landscape maps for supporting remote
    digital scouting, large area-wise farm monitoring and decision support system,
    and rapid intervention of a management issue. Herein, we used the i-ekbase system
    for capturing timely remote sensing imagery on the study site using Landsat (with
    a spatial resolution of 15 m) and Sentinel (with a spatial resolution of 10 m)
    satellites. Data were captured for 12 months for developing the experimental system.
    Data that compose this image have over 14 thousand geo-referential points, which
    indicate a raster type structure, containing in each point or pixel that attributes
    for agricultural analysis. Given the size of the data, only a few lines are shown
    in Table 1. Different types of software are available on the market, which can

    the web tool i-ekbase (Table 1), the information is pre-processed to filter the
    data that are not required by the decision-making system. Thus, only canopy temperature,
    upper layer soil moisture, NDVI, and coordinates are considered (Table 2). Table

    29.58 Source: adapted from the i-ekbase system (2017). For applying this approach
    on a commercial scale, remote sensing data required to describe the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relation can be acquired from satellite images (Moran, Inoue, & Barnes, 1997)
    and airplanes (Fitzgerald et al., 2006, Wood et al., 2003). However, high costs,
    spatial resolution, data frequency and data availability (Pinter et al., 2003,
    Trout et al., 2008), as well as satellite cloudless images (Barker, Heeren, Neale,
    & Rudnick, 2018) are challenges for the correct execution of models based on remote
    sensing; these factors can limit the efficiency of VRI management in real time.
    Remote sensing data that accurately describe the soil–plant–atmosphere relationship
    was selected for the intelligent irrigation system at the crop location. In this
    stage, accurately choosing the best data is fundamental to ensure that the results
    are calculated correctly. A simple but promising approach uses culture coefficients
    from normalized differentiated variation indexes, combined with local climate
    data, to assume the amount of ETc (evapotranspiration) of variable crops almost
    at real time (Er-Raki et al., 2007, González-Dugo and Mateos, 2008, Hunsaker et
    al., 2005). With some consideration of the daily meteorological conditions, models
    based on remote sensing can be used in studies of water relations (Barker et al.,
    2018) in the soil–plant–atmosphere system and could become an easy-to-use and
    fast response tool. Canopy temperature is also an important parameter to manage
    irrigation and must be adjusted according to local crop conditions. From the location
    selected for cultivation and the type of crop to be irrigated, in relation to
    the data linked to the type of plant, a crop coefficient will be used together
    with information from satellite images. In this case, NDVI reading, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature values will be used. 2.3. Crop area The
    crop area is a farm at Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, latitude
    15°14′24.73′′S and longitude 54°0′53.29′′W. This area contains several crops,
    such as soy, cotton, and “safrinha” corn, irrigated by a central pivot. The delimited
    area is 140 ha, with a radius of 667 m (see Fig. 3). The area delimited by the
    red circle is irrigated with a central pivot, and the information used in this
    study is for a cultivation cycle of “safrinha” corn in 2015/2016. To irrigate
    “safrinha” corn means to provide minimum water conditions for the development
    of the crop. Corn is highly sensitive to drought. Therefore, the occurrence of
    a period of lower water intake by plants in critical moments for the development
    of the crop, from flowering to physiological maturation, can lead to the lower
    yield. For maximum yield, corn plantation needs approximately 650 mm of water
    (Bergamaschi et al., 2001) during its cycle, which varies from 110 to 140 days
    in hybrids with an average cycle. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    during growth. After analyzing the NDVI values contained in Fig. 4, the similarity
    among values attributed to crop coefficient (Kc) can be verified (Hunsaker et
    al., 2005; and Kamble et al., 2013). As the crop develops, the leaf area increases,
    which makes it possible to establish a NDVI relationship. Download : Download

    in a crop cycle. Source: Author''s archives. This process is also described by
    Hunsaker et al. (2005), with relations for calculating the basal crop coefficient
    (Kcb) for cotton as a function of NDVI. When each of the development phases of
    the crop is analyzed, two distinct areas are evident: one with little growth and
    another with average growth. From this differentiation, it is possible to build
    a water demand map as well as speed control maps. For the preliminary analysis,
    the daily average precipitation data made available by National Institute of Meteorology2
    (INMET) were used. Data were collected from April to September 2016 in the municipality
    of Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. Fig. 5 illustrates the obtained
    data. Finally, precipitation readings recorded during the development of the crop
    under study corroborate with the premise of water stress due to the lack of rain,
    which would indicate the possibility of complementing the water demand with irrigation.

    Monitoring System. 2.4. Fuzzy systems Over the last 20 years, fuzzy systems have
    attracted considerable attention and have met great applicability in the agricultural
    domain, helping farmers to make the right decisions for their crops (Papageorgiou
    et al., 2016). For example, Bahat et al. (2000) proposed a solution for an irrigation
    controller based on the fuzzy logic methodology with simple rules, making the
    system more attractive for farmers. Raj and Kumar (2005) observed that the integration
    of fuzzy logic and real-world irrigation planning problems are very useful, particularly
    with multiple specialists in a subjective data environment. Upon using fuzzy systems
    for decision-making concerning irrigation, Zhang, Fei, Wei, Congcong, and Yuewei
    (2011) reported that fuzzy logic does not require all the relevant information
    for solving the problem of water in irrigation. Bing, Huifeng, and Xia (2015)
    developed a fuzzy system of decision-making for solving uncertainties and non-linearity
    of the irrigation system, and the model showed high precision. The system of fuzzy
    inference proposed by Almeida, Vieira, Marques, Kiperstok, and Cardoso (2013),
    in turn, provided a conceptual approach based on the multi-criteria decision-making
    process. This approach relates water use to environmental factors, such as drought,
    water exploration index, water use, population density, and wastewater treatment
    index, resulting in warnings about future water supply. Irrigation based on the
    fuzzy inference system presents better results than traditional methods. The fuzzy
    system will be used to infer the variations in the linear movement speed of the
    pivot according to satellite images. An intelligent system was developed, manipulating
    various data-driven approaches to create a control map. Due to the nature of the
    management of the study area, fuzzy systems are used herein to aid irrigation
    decision-making. Because a farmer''s decisions are purely intuitive and knowledge-based
    gained over years of work, we chose not to describe the way the farm works explicitly.
    Another critical piece in the farmer''s routine was that the pivot utilized extensive
    amount of time to perform a full turn. However, the central pivot irrigation system
    should operate 21 h a day, with 3 h for maintenance because high electricity prices
    are charged by the utility. Three input variables were used (NDVI, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature) to infer the speed, which the central pivot
    has to reach to improve the irrigation level within the crop area, and to find
    an adequate speed for the pivot movement in relation to the amount of water coming
    out of the sprinklers. Futhermore, a decision unit or inference machine is implemented
    using the Mamdani method to conduct the rule-based inference operations with crisp
    input and crisp output. Mamdani fuzzy systems use fuzzy sets as a consequent rule;
    therefore, the inference method for a set of conjunctive rules for the rth rule
    will be given by the following condition: (1) Within the objective proposed for
    the developed system, once linguistic variables are applied to the output of fuzzy
    inference systems, it becomes fitter for modeling the human reflection process.
    By doing so, the interface of the system becomes more straightforward and natural.
    In the first stage of development, the water layer provided by the irrigation
    system is considered constant. The database that defines the association functions
    of sets used in the fuzzy rules is implemented according to Table 3 and Fig. 6.

    to each system input. Source: Author''s archives. Remote sensing data allow building
    the universe of discourse for each input variable and therefore change the database
    into linguistic variables, as shown in Table 3. Each input was previously limited
    to the discourse universe in question and associated to the grade of membership
    in each fuzzy set through specialized knowledge. Therefore, to obtain the grade
    of membership of a certain crisp input, one must search for this value in the
    fuzzy system knowledge. The fuzzification of the decision-making system in Fig.
    6 helps to visualize the corresponding membership functions, considering these
    intervals as the discourse universe of the variables. Triangular membership functions
    were chosen because they simplify the calculation of the fuzzy inference mechanism
    and couple to the fuzzy rules IF-THEN (Wang, 1997). Well distributed triangular
    membership functions change input data into fuzzy values (low, average, and high),
    as shown in Fig. 6a, as well as values for soil moist and NDVI (Fig. 6b and c,
    respectively). Fuzzy outputs, which represent the rotation speed of the central
    pivot, were built from five linguistic variables: very low (MB), low (B), normal
    (N), high (A), and very high (MA). All the sets were interpreted based on their
    membership functions, as shown in Fig. 7. Several defuzzification methods have
    been proposed (Dubois & Prade, 2000), of which CENTROID (area center or center
    of gravity) is more widely used. For this method, a clear value of the output
    variable is calculated by finding the variable for the center of gravity of the
    association function for the fuzzy value (Jang, Sun, & Mizutani, 1997) as follows:
    (2) where uout(ui) is the area of a grade of membership modified by the fuzzy
    inference result and ui is the position of the centroid of the individual membership
    functions. Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size

    defuzzification. Membership functions (Velocity). Source: Author''s archives.
    Finally, the fuzzy rule relating to rotation speed contains 27 rules, as summarized
    in Table 3. Therefore, the reading of the first line, for example, is IF NDVI
    = Low AND Canopy Temperature = Low AND Soil Moisture = Low THEN Rotation Speed = Low.
    This set of rules is based on basic knowledge of irrigation, according to the
    methodology adopted in Bernardo, Soares, and Mantovani (2006) and Silva and Azevedo
    (1998). The rules were elaborated with the connective “AND” and are based on the
    premise that little leaf growth is due to water deficit in the soil (Boyer, 1968,
    Hsiao, 1973, Wright, 1977) along with high canopy temperature, which indicates
    low evapotranspiration, in other words, plants under water stress. Values of moisture
    close to the soil given by the web tool are local readings of spots with fewer
    leaves, making it possible to estimate its value. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Control maps for pivot rotation speed For mapping the speed control system herein,
    eight crop areas were stipulated with a level of ambiguity regarding the impact
    of the variable application rate (Feinerman & Voet, 2000), given that an increase
    in the flexibility of input application through field subdivision in a higher
    number of management unities did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the total
    (optimal) water use. The images showing different growth stages of the plantation
    were analyzed. The development stage [Kc-Development] was the one that presented
    the highest water stress in different planted areas, as shown in Table 5. Furthermore,
    performing the analysis of critical point was essential to demonstrate the applicability
    of fuzzy systems to create the control maps. Table 5. Analysis of the best dates

    The information extracted after pre-processing remote sensing data was NDVI, canopy
    temperature, and upper layer soil moisture. These values are the input data set
    for the fuzzy system, which is capable of inferring percentages for the central
    pivot rotation speed motion. The case study corresponds to the sampling of two
    readings obtained from different dates of the crop cycle: the first on June 15,
    2016 and the second on June 28, 2016. 3.2. Case study on June 15th, 2016 The input
    set for the intelligent fuzzy system is the analyzed and processed data on canopy
    temperature, moisture close to the soil, and NDVI (see Table 2) illustrated in
    Fig. 8a–c. The input, as shown in Fig. 8, was organized according to the linguistic
    variables of the fuzzy system and separated by tones for better visualization.
    Due to the nature of the central pivot speed control equipment, the output given
    by the fuzzy system was in percentage values. The per centimeter, which was responsible
    for rotational speed control, used only the reference percentage of rotation in
    relation to the time of 60 s. Thus, for the values of 50% (represented in orange
    in Fig. 9), the control made the pivot stay in operation for 30 s and off for
    30 s. The intelligent system obtained the result shown in Fig. 9, which illustrates
    different regions within the area, with different values for the pivot rotation
    speed. Download : Download high-res image (934KB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 9. Output data for the fuzzy inference system: rotation speed of the central
    pivot. Source: Author''s archives. Analysis of the input data identified the existence
    of two broad areas with lower leaf development, which could indicate a lack of
    water for development. After processing input data, the intelligent irrigation
    system showed these areas of lower leaf development in a more intense red tone.
    This indicates that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water
    layer in that specific location, because the rotation speed of the pivot determines
    the level of the water layer applied. A thinner water layer is applied with higher
    speed and a higher application of water in the soil occurs with lower rotation
    speed (Valín, Cameira, Teodoro, & Pereira, 2012). The expected result was the
    creation of control maps; in this case, it was possible to determine the reference
    speed values for eight initially programmed zones, as shown in Fig. 10. Moreover,
    areas that present different colors in Fig. 9 are shown in the control map result,
    which illustrates the existence of well-divided zones. In each one, a specific
    value is observed for the speed that the pivot must reach to increase or decrease
    the water layer in the crop area. Download : Download high-res image (181KB) Download

    for interpretation. The intelligent system of irrigation obtained the result shown
    in Fig. 12, which illustrates different regions within the crop area with different
    values of pivot rotation. A higher rotation speed implies the application of a
    thinner water layer, and a lower rotation speed leads to more water application
    in the soil, given that the application flow is kept constant in the sprinklers.

    and canopy temperature are essential for the decision-making process of the intelligent
    irrigation system. The large areas with a lower leaf development could indicate
    a lack of water for development. In the case of the output of the intelligent
    irrigation system, more intense red areas indicate that the pivot must reduce
    its speed. In this study, the reference values of the rotation speed of the pivot
    for the eight initially programmed zones of irrigation were determined, as shown
    in Fig. 13. In this result, the areas with different colors in Fig. 12 are the
    result of the control map constructed and are shown in Fig. 13. Irrigation zones
    were well divided, which makes it is possible to see an absolute value for the
    rotation speed of each pivot, increasing and decreasing the water layer applied
    to the cultivation area. The result shown in Fig. 13b corresponds to reference
    values to be sent to the pivot controller. Download : Download high-res image

    fuzzy system for irrigation control is original and innovative. No similar discussion
    in the scientific literature about speed control maps of the central pivot was
    found. Furthermore, there is no information available on commercial systems that
    can autonomously build this type of map. Experiments demonstrated the potential
    effectiveness of the pivot operation based on the differences between velocities
    by management zones. The system follows the definition of VRI; once the speed
    changes, there are changes in the amount of supplied water. In this context, fuzzy
    logic can be applied widely in agricultural areas; therefore, a decision support
    system can be build that has the knowledge of precision irrigation. The implementation
    of fuzzy logic decision support system was successful to develop prescription
    maps for VRI with central pivots. However, a broader and commercial application
    will depend on the integration of data collection systems, management strategies,
    and hardware control. In other words, the fuzzy logic model performed as expected,
    providing excellent results. However, the reliability of data sources (NDVI, surface
    soil water, and canopy temperature) to develop a reliable prescription map is
    the scope of future study. The future study will focus on the field implementations
    and determine whether any additional data (different types of data, high-quality
    data, and/or more frequent data) will be required for developing the map. In this
    analysis, the rotation speed control extracted through inference does not consider
    the volume of the water layer to be applied. The interpretation given by the fuzzy
    system is as follows: where there is variation in the plant growth, there will
    be variation in water demand. To solve this, more data should be collected to
    validate the system for various scenarios in near future. The results were favorable
    to the continuity of studies on precision irrigation and application of the fuzzy
    logic for creating central pivots irrigation systems maps. Future research should
    implement this decision support system into field trials to evaluate its ability
    to reduce irrigation pumping and/or improve crop yield. Contributorship statement

  limitations: The study utilized satellite imagery for data collection, which may
    be limited by factors such as cloud cover and data frequency. Additionally, the
    pivot's speed control equipment only operated based on a percentage of the rotation
    speed, which may affect the accuracy of the applied water layer. The paper also
    suggests that further research is necessary to validate the system for various

  title: Fuzzy control system for variable rate irrigation using remote sensing
  verbatim_quote1: From the location selected for cultivation and the type of crop
    to be irrigated, in relation to the data linked to the type of plant, a crop coefficient
    will be used together with information from satellite images. In this case, NDVI
    reading, upper layer soil moisture, and canopy temperature values will be used.
  verbatim_quote2: Prescriptive maps for VRI with central pivots were successfully
    developed. However, a broader and commercial application will depend on the integration
    of data collection systems, management strategies, and hardware control. In other
    words, the fuzzy logic model performed as expected, providing excellent results.
    However, the reliability of data sources (NDVI, surface soil water, and canopy
    temperature) to develop a reliable prescription map is the scope of future study.
  verbatim_quote3: The implemented fuzzy system obtained the result shown in Fig.
    9, which illustrates different regions within the area, with different values
    for the pivot rotation speed. A thinner water layer is applied with higher speed
    and a higher application of water in the soil occurs with lower rotation speed
    (Valín, Cameira, Teodoro, & Pereira, 2012).

    system is demonstrated that fully automates the delivery of irrigation and calculates
    the water requirement from satellite images. The system optimizes water delivery
    for 140 cells located across four hectares of land based on two independent objectives
    (e.g., maximizing yield and increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting
    irrigation scheduling to the local spatial–temporal variability of the vegetation
    across the growing season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that
    issues commands to 693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis
    of satellite images. The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m ×15 m cells
    and each cell can be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially.
    After two years of operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted
    in a 26% yield increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water
    use efficiency. This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation
    and advanced irrigation analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase
    the yield on existing agricultural lands. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Digitization of the physical world is
    fundamentally changing the industries fueled by sensor networks, automation, and
    robotization [1]. Sensor-based decision support or automated infrastructure control
    can minimize manual intervention. In agriculture, data driven decisions can enable
    a sustainable use of water, land utilization, and chemicals control through optimized
    analytics [2]. Platforms that fuse sensor network data with automatic control
    can lead to dynamic operation that adapts to the environment in real-time as new
    data becomes available to the system. One important application in agriculture
    is irrigation, which can be controlled by sensor networks and automate the operation
    of the water delivery systems. Despite continuous advancement in control systems,
    irrigation is mostly a manual process using traditional practices. Many of the
    high value crops in California, such as grapes, are drip irrigated with water
    usually applied uniformly across larger parcels or blocks of land. This often
    results in nonoptimized delivery of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. For example,
    intrafield soil water holding capacity can fluctuate significantly, often translating
    into as much as fivefold yield differences across less than a few meter distance
    [3]. To overcome such variability, management zones can be defined, where each
    zone may have similar yield or vigor characteristics (for grapes) and can be managed
    accordingly. Minimizing yield variability [4] through differential management
    [5] has been proposed in the past. Variable rate management in vineyards has been
    proposed both in USA [6] and in Australia [7] but only relying on post-harvest
    analysis. Management zones have been delineated based on soil [8], vegetation
    index [9], or using fuzzy logic clustering techniques [10]. While defining management
    zones is a well-established technique, active control of variable rate management
    is still not fully developed. In the past, sensor networks have been deployed
    in vineyard settings [11] at various levels of sophistication. Most of the application
    attempted a better monitoring of the micro environmental conditions in the vineyards
    thereby providing a more granular feedback to vineyard workers [12]. Here, we
    present a large-scale demonstration of a variable rate drip irrigation system
    that takes advantage of a close loop control system to deliver the right amount
    of water through an automated system. Using this new variable drip irrigation
    technology, the applied water amount can be optimized dynamically. Ultimately,
    it is envisioned that such a system can be designed to deliver the optimum amount
    of water to each plant. Delivery of water to each management zone requires timely
    analytics to determine irrigation requirements, to transmit the irrigation schedule
    to a control computer, and to automate control of the drip irrigation infrastructure
    to dispense the optimum amount of water. In this paper, we show that a variable
    rate automatic irrigation system coupled with satellite derived irrigation scheduling
    analytics can result in: 1) increased yield uniformity and 2) reversal of the
    yield trends by increasing the yield on the originally low yield areas and limiting
    the yield on the originally high yield areas. The advantage of a variable rate
    irrigation system is the increased yield on existing farm land without the need
    to convert additional land to agricultural use. The efficient use of technology
    not only can increase the yield on existing farm land but also promises to manage
    more efficiently resources like water and fertilizer. To the best of our knowledge,
    this paper constitutes the first and largest closed loop drip irrigation system
    that directly couples remote observations with an automated dense sensor network
    that is operated from the cloud. Not only the drip irrigation in our approach
    is fully automated but at the same time this system results in significant water
    savings while improving yield. SECTION II. Sensor Network A. System Architecture
    The experiment is conducted on a 20-year-old, 12.4 hectare, drip irrigated Cabernet
    Sauvignon vineyard near Galt, CA, USA. A four hectare section of the vineyard
    containing the full range of yields, as reported by the 2012 yield map, is selected
    for the closed loop irrigation system. The irrigation system is changed from a
    single drip line to a double drip-line variable irrigation system with centrally
    controlled irrigation sensor network. The control system allows differential irrigation
    along segments of 15 m. A 15 m ×15 m area defined as “the irrigation control cell”
    is the basic unit of control where the water delivery within that area can be
    independently controlled (Fig. 1). The experimental area, called “Precision,”
    is composed of 140 of such independent cells where cells are grouped in two sections
    “Yield maximizing section” and “Water efficiency section.” These two differently
    managed sections have different objective functions: 1) maximize the yield and
    2) increase water use efficiency. The area is monitored using satellite imagery
    that constitutes the input for irrigation requirement analytics. Besides monitoring
    the area, the closed loop system runs the analytics to determine the irrigation
    water requirement and controls the irrigation infrastructure to dispense the water.
    The analytics output is transmitted to a sensor network that dispense the water
    accordingly. The irrigation schedule is sent weekly to the irrigation system,
    where the computer splits the schedule for 6 or 7 days irrigation and issues commands
    to the management zones. The outcome of the differential irrigation is monitored
    by the next satellite imagery that will indicate if expected change occurred and
    the irrigation water schedule is readjusted based on the new satellite images.
    An adjacent area, called “Conventional” area, having similar yield characteristics
    and soil composition as the Precision area in 2012, is uniformly irrigated to
    serve as a reference area. The closed loop irrigation system is automatically
    operated with minimal human input. We note that domain expertise related to adjustment
    in grape sugar content is required to be added to the irrigation schedule calculations.
    Additional data layers like high resolution drone or thermal images of the vineyard
    can be added to the analytics for monitoring canopy stresses that may not be detectable
    from satellite images. Fig. 1. (a) Schematic architecture of the closed control
    loop irrigation system driven by satellite imagery. (b) Precision irrigation area
    composed of water efficiency and yield maximizing sections. Show All B. Variable
    Rate Irrigation Infrastructure For the variable rate infrastructure, the original
    single drip irrigation line is divided into a double drip line system consisting
    of a water supply line and an irrigation line and segmented into 15 m sections
    [Fig. 2(a)]. The supply line is always filled with water and is connected to the
    main water supply. The irrigation line can be filled once the solenoid valve is
    opened and the water is allowed to flow into that segment. The irrigation line
    has emitters installed that will let water drip and irrigate the soil. The supply
    and irrigation line are connected at each 15 m through a control node that allows
    water to be diverted from the supply line to the irrigation line. The control
    nodes consist of a solenoid valve, a controller, and a check valve. The controller
    issues the command to open/close the solenoid valve and allows water to flow into
    the segment, while the check valve impedes water to fill the previous management
    segment. There is a power and communication line that runs along the supply line
    and connects each control node to a central control point. The controller nodes
    are installed at the edge of an area that establishes a one-to-one correspondence
    between the information extracted from a parcel of land (via satellite imagery
    and/or ground-based sensors) and a management area. We chose a 15 m ×15 m control
    cell dimension, higher than the original Landsat [13] pixel resolution (30 m ×30
    m), which was used in this paper. The original 30 m ×30 m Landsat pixels are interpolated
    to 15 m ×15 m pixel size using pan sharpening and aligned exactly with the experimental
    15 m ×15 m cells [Fig. 2(b)]. We note that managing vineyard at higher resolution
    than the satellite images did not provide any benefit as discussed in Section
    IV, as there is an optimal size for the control cells. Fig. 2. (a) Double drip
    line composed of supply and irrigation lines connected through the control nodes
    that operate the solenoid valve. (b) Details of an irrigation control cell that
    groups 5 double drip lines and its spatial alignment with a Landsat satellite
    image pixel. Show All The control nodes are 15 m apart along each irrigation line
    segment (covering 10 vines) and the irrigation lines (and vine rows) are 3.3 m
    apart. Alternating, 4 or 5 control nodes are therefore lumped together to define
    each “irrigation control cell,” which covers on average an area of 15 m ×15 m
    [Fig. 2(a)]. Since the vine rows could not be perfectly aligned with satellite
    pixel resolution, the number of rows entering in a cell is varied between 4 and
    5 to create the digital footprint of satellite images on the irrigation system
    [Fig. 2(b)]. There are a total of 140 independent control cells, with 40 or 50
    vines in each of the cells distributed across the four hectare area with a total
    of 693 control nodes (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Photograph of the interior and controller
    box that operated the solenoid valve and the installed sensor network in the vineyard.
    Show All The irrigation schedule is managed by a central computer that issues
    the command to the local microcontroller that operates the solenoid valves to
    keep it open for the required amount of time. The amount of irrigation water dispensed
    is controlled by the time interval the solenoid valve is kept open and water drips
    through the drip emitters mounted on the irrigation line. Time synchronization
    between the local microcontroller and the central computer is carried out once
    per day. In addition to actuating (open/close) the solenoid valve, each node keeps
    track of the time the valve is open and reports back to the control computer which
    aggregates the data and runs background calculations to verify that the system
    operates as expected. C. Sensor Communication The experimental area is divided
    in 14 subnets where each subnet contains 4 or 5 rows of grape rows. Along each
    subnet there are ten irrigation control cells. Each subnet is controlled by a
    gateway that receives and transmits the data from the central computer to the
    40 or 50 control nodes [Fig. 4(a)] within that subnet. The central computer is
    distributing the irrigation schedule to the gateways and each gateway sends commands
    to individual control nodes under its command. The schematic of the message stack
    protocol for communicating is shown in Fig. 4(b). A command message is encapsulated
    in a queue stack. Each header contained a destination node address and a function
    code; the address field is 8 bits, the function code is 8 bits, and the check-sum
    is a 16 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) (see Fig. 4(b)-A). A specific example
    is shown in Fig. 4(b)-B, where the central computer communicates with a selected
    control node via a selected gateway. There are three required steps to get the
    message from the central computer to a selected control node and an additional
    three steps to send back an acknowledgment from the control node to the central
    computer. First, the central computer sends the message to a selected gateway.
    Second, the gateway, based on a “forwarding” function code, moves the first fixed
    length header to the trailer space in the message and transmits the new message
    (Fig. 4(b)-C) simultaneously to all nodes in the subnet. The node for which the
    message is intended will recognize its unique address in the message. Once the
    control node performs the requested operation (e.g., open valve), it rewrites
    the data section leaving the header and trailer intact. As the central computer
    expects a response, the control node prepares the stack to be sent back. The control
    node transmits the response message to the gateway. The gateway processes the
    message by moving the first trailer (before the CRC) to the header and transmits
    the new message to the central computer. The central computer, expecting a response,
    processes the result and acknowledges that the message is successfully delivered
    to the control node. The transmitted command can be the irrigation requirements
    (number of minutes that the irrigation line needs to be filled with water) or
    just open/close commands at the beginning and end of the day to bring all control
    nodes into the same state. Each subnet includes a flow meter that measures the
    water consumption for the whole subnet. In each subnet there are 40 or 50 control
    boxes that are connected by serial bus communication wires to each gateway. At
    the end of the rows, wires that crossed rows, are buried underground. The communication
    line did not exceeds 1500 m as this value is tested to constitute the upper limit
    for signal integrity using RS485 communications. Irrigation of the 140 control
    cells is enabled by daily continuous communication with all 693 control nodes,
    where each node is uniquely identified (addressed) by a source routing technique
    that specifies a specific gateway-node pair. Fig. 4. (a) Schematics of the communication
    network between the central computer and control nodes composed of 14 subnets
    and 140 irrigation control cells. (b) Data communication stack and communication
    protocols between the central computer and control nodes. Show All A cellular
    link connects the central computer to the cloud-based analytics, allowing downloading
    irrigation schedules and remote diagnostics. A message notification system is
    implemented that alerts valve’s malfunctioning or nonintended water usage. The
    power lines extend to all control nodes and is fanned out at the start of each
    row. The power distribution system is optimized to maintain 12 V along each line
    such that controllers located farthest from the gateway can open/close the solenoid
    valves under normal operating conditions. While the current implementation is
    based on wired control, a wireless communication method had been prototyped and
    tested as a next generation system. For the wireless option, the power harvesting
    from solar panels required for operation could not be achieved due to the dense
    canopy and panel placement limitations dictated by daily maintenance work on the
    farm. D. Irrigation Requirement Analytics Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery obtained
    from the U.S. Geological Survey [14] provides reflectance data in eight different
    spectral bands every 16 days (alternating by 8 days for each satellite). The vineyard
    investigated in this paper is on the overlapping section of path 43 row 34 and
    path 44 row 33 for Landsat 7 and 8, respectively, which provides a satellite observation
    every eight days. Two of these spectral bands, the red (0.64–0.67 micrometer)
    and the near infrared (0.77–0.90 micrometer) are sensitive to vineyard canopy
    development [15] and are used to determine the NDVI [16] NDVI= NIR−RED NIR+RED
    (1) View Source where RED and NIR are the red and near infrared intensity values
    for each pixel in the image. The NDVI value varies between 0 and 1. Its value
    changes as the canopy develops through the growing season and its spatial distribution
    across a vineyard reflects the variability in vigor and ultimately the water holding
    capacity of the soil. All satellite images are corrected for atmosphere induced
    scattering [17]. The amount of water delivered to each cell is then calculated
    from the NDVI and the water loss due to evapo-transpiration (ET0) using the Penman–Monteith
    equation [18]. The daily weather inputs (insolation, wind, temperature, and relative
    humidity) are obtained from the nearest California Irrigation Management Information
    System weather station (Fair Oaks, CA, USA) [19] to calculate the reference evapo-transpiration
    (ET0). The amount of water that is scheduled for irrigation ET cb (in mm day−1)
    is then calculated from the reference evapo-transpiration (ET0) [20] and adjusted
    for grapes using the basal crop coefficient ( k cb ) which serves as an aggregated
    coefficient of the physical and physiological characteristics of the plant [20].
    A management factor, f , is included that can adjust the water delivered to each
    of the irrigation control cell ET cb =f⋅ k cb ⋅ ET 0 . (2) View Source The basal
    crop coefficient, k cb , is calculated from the Mapping Evapo-Transpiration at
    High Resolution with Internalized Calibration model [21], [22] using the NDVI
    value for each cell. The basal crop coefficient can be obtained by subtracting
    the soil heat flux and sensible heat flux from the net radiation at the surface
    [22]. In case the Landsat data is obscured by clouds, the NDVI values are extrapolated
    using historical reflectance data from the same plot of the vineyard. The irrigation
    schedule for each cell is based on (2), with the value of management factor, f
    , varied from 0.5 for the first eight weeks of irrigation up to 0.75 during the
    rest of the season in 2013. In 2014, the management factor, f , is 0.5 for the
    first five weeks and then increased to 0.7 for the rest of the season. The management
    factor, f , is used to apply moderate water stress to the vines and improve fruit
    quality and to increase yield in low vigor area. The management factor is a parameter
    that can be changed and it can incorporate domain knowledge or management practices
    on the farm. The evapo-transpiration is calculated for the following week based
    on real-time weather data. The irrigation schedule for individual control cells
    is calculated using the NDVI value and ET cb taking into account the number of
    drippers for each zone and dripper specifications (i.e., 1.89 l h−1). Irrigation
    schedules are generated on a weekly basis for each zone and transmitted to the
    central control computer. Once a schedule is uploaded to the computer, it reads
    the zone number and number of hours per day that needs to enable the irrigation
    and issue a command to the control node containing the solenoid valve to open
    and allow water in the irrigation line for the required time interval. Once the
    required irrigation time passes, the central computer issue a command to close
    the solenoid valve. E. Variable Rate Management Zone Delineation Based on the
    2012 yield map, irrigation control cells that had a yield value below 20 tonnes
    hectare−1 and low NDVI value are grouped in two management zones: 1) the yield
    maximizing zones and 2) the water efficiency zones. The yield maximizing zones
    has low yield in 2012 and water is used to increase in that zone. The water efficiency
    area is targeted to minimize the water consumption. We note that there could be
    other objectives that can be implemented; e.g., reduce NDVI variability, reduce
    variability in grape quality, or minimize fertilizer use. Many objectives can
    be tied to delineate zones based on spectral indices like NDVI that is readily
    available even for farm where historical yield or soil data may not exist. F.
    Yield Analysis Methods Crop yield maps are used to establish grape production
    variability [23], [24]. Crop yield maps are measured in 2012, 2013, and 2014 using
    the Advanced Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, SA, Australia) yield monitor
    systems installed on three self-propelled, over-the-row, trunk-shaking mechanical
    GH9000 AIM harvesters (Ag Industrial Manufacturing, Lodi, CA, USA). The yield
    monitors included a differential global positioning system, a grape weighing unit
    and a data recording system. The grape weighing unit contains a load cell weight
    bridge and a belt speed sensor. Geo-referencing is realized by simultaneously
    logging the coordinates and synchronizing them with the weight measurements. The
    data is transferred to a computer and accessed using proprietary software from
    ATV. Belt scales are zeroed before each harvest and the system is calibrated against
    actual truck weights at the beginning of the harvest season and weekly thereafter.
    Calibration is validated by ensuring that weight error ranges are within 8% of
    the weight at the winery, but actual measurements are consistently within 3%–4%.
    Harvest data is transferred into a data processing module developed in R Studio
    (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA, USA) to convert mass flow units into tonnes hectare−1,
    to eliminate measurement points that are outliers, and to normalize measurements
    from different harvesters. Yield data with values larger than three standard deviations
    from the mean are removed. The data cleaning steps eliminates only 5% of the original
    data. After yield data cleaning, the data is further processed by a software package
    (VESPER Version 1.62) [25] for interpolation and kriging to 3 ×3 m resolution.
    The raster data sets are then transferred into a program (Manifold System, Manifold
    Net Ltd., Carson City, NV, USA), where a 3 m ×3 m geo-referenced grid is created.
    For this paper, the yield data is further aggregated to 15 m ×15 m geo-referenced
    cells that are within the study area by summing up all yield values within that
    cells. If yield data points are at the boundary of two adjacent cells, the weight
    is distributed equally between the cells. Spatial statistics are quantified using
    the Cambardella index (CI) [26] and the Mean Correlation Distance (MCD) [27] using
    variogram parameters extracted from VESPER software [25]. The utility of such
    studies has been demonstrated in the past [28]. Using an exponential variogram
    model, the nugget ( C 0 ) and sill ( C 0 +C ) of the yield data are calculated
    across data points spaced up to 100 m. The CI is defined as [26] CI= C 0 ( C 0
    +C) ∗100 (3) View Source and quantifies the extent across which correlation is
    preserved. A CI value below 25 means strong spatial dependence, CI between 25
    and 75 means a moderate spatial dependence, and CI above 75 means a weak spatial
    dependence. MCD represents the distance along which correlation is preserved.
    The MCV is defined as [27] MCD= 3 8 ( C C+ C 0 )a (4) View Source where a is the
    range for the variogram or the distance above which value no correlation is detected.
    The three variogram parameters are estimated for the 2012–2014 yield data acquired
    across the whole variable rate irrigation area, as well as yield increasing and
    water efficiency sections. For comparison, the same calculations are carried out
    for the reference area where year to year variations are small. SECTION III. Results
    Differential irrigation is implemented for each irrigation control cell. As an
    example, in 2013 the yield maximizing section had an overall lower NDVI value
    compared with the water efficiency section (consistent with the 2012 yield data).
    Irrigating only the yield maximizing section for the first five weeks (irrigation
    started on April 28, 2013) the NDVI quickly increased above the water efficiency
    area’s NDVI value. Once the NDVI reverses the trends it can be maintained across
    the whole growing season by providing more water to the yield maximizing zone.
    After the first five weeks, all irrigation control cells are irrigated based on
    the corresponding NDVI values acquired across the growing season. In 2014, the
    yield maximizing section were irrigated the first four weeks and then all cells
    were irrigated based on their corresponding NDVI value. The yield data for each
    individual irrigation control cell is shown in Fig. 5. The key results of the
    experiment are summarized in Table I, with the mean values and the coefficient
    of variation (CoV) (relative standard deviation) for each section and year. The
    mean yields in the reference and trial areas are similar, at 20.0 and 20.1 tonnes
    hectare−1 for 2012 when the entire vineyard is uniformly irrigated. Lower fruitfulness
    in 2013 resulted in lower yields compared to 2012. There is no significant improvement
    in yield in the trial area in 2013, i.e., the yield maximizing and water efficiency
    sections, which is expected given the growth cycle of grapes. However, a substantial
    improvement in water efficiency is observed in 2014: 22% for the water efficiency
    section and 5% for the yield maximizing section. In 2014, yield increased 26%
    and 5% in the yield and water maximizing sections, respectively. Also, water use
    efficiency increased by 10% for the water efficiency section, with the water efficiency
    for the yield maximizing section remaining the same as the reference section.
    TABLE I Yield, Irrigation Water, and Water Efficiency Analysis for the Yield Maximizing,
    Water Efficiency, and Reference Section of the Vineyard Fig. 5. Top: Yield data
    for a uniformly irrigated test area in 2012 and a variable rate irrigated test
    area in 2013 and 2014. For 2013 and 2014, the yield maximizing section is outlined
    on the top images. Bottom: The yield for the control adjacent area. Show All The
    CoV for 2013 (Table I) decreased significantly indicating that uniformity of yield
    distribution is improved more than 50% after the first year (as change in CoV
    coefficient). After increasing the uniformity, the second year experiment demonstrated
    that yield trends can be reversed compared to 2012 yield map. In the yield maximizing
    section where yield is lower in 2012 became high yield areas in 2014 and the high
    yield area (water efficiency section) in 2012 became low yield in 2014 compared
    with plot average values. This reversal in yield is possible after only two years
    using the water as the only parameter that is varied across the trial area. The
    change in yield trends in 2014 resulted also in an increase of the CoV that is
    expected considering yield trend reversal. Table II summarizes the CI and MCD
    values across the three years of yield data. The CI indicates that there is a
    strong spatial dependence of yield across the variable rate irrigated area and
    the correlation is preserved for all three years even if the yield has significant
    spatial changes. The same conclusion is also supported by the MCD that shows a
    long range correlation with a significant increased value in 2014. Both the Cambardella
    and MCD values remain very similar for the reference area across the three years
    of this paper. Variable rate irrigation can change the spatial coherence of yield
    data on the small scale. TABLE II Spatial Statistics for the Yield and Water Efficiency
    Section The two-year study on yield and water use efficiency raises two questions.
    First, why are the yield enhancements small in the first year and significantly
    larger in the second year? The answer is that grape vines undergo an 18 months
    growing cycle between bud initiation and harvest [29]. Inflorescence induction
    and differentiation occurring 18 months prior to harvest are the key factors that
    govern grape yield potential. Thus, temperature and sunshine as well as stress
    conditions 18 months prior greatly affect the number of clusters per vine as well
    as the number of berries per cluster and thus yield [30]. Proper irrigation during
    bud formation minimizes water stress and its impact is expected to appear at harvest
    of the second year; which indeed resulted in a 26% increase in the yield in our
    experiment. The yield increase of 2% in the first year can be attributed to larger
    berry sizes. The second question is why the water efficiency dropped in the second
    year from 22% to 10%. Due to water availability constraints in the second year,
    the start of the irrigation in the reference area is delayed by one month compared
    to the trial area. SECTION IV. Economic Analysis Adoption of the variable rate
    irrigation technology required new irrigation infrastructure and irrigation analytics
    calculation. The first aspect is the change of existing uniform drip irrigation
    system with a variable rate irrigation system. The practicality of adopting the
    variable rate technology is influenced by two factors: 1) investment cost and
    2) the time for return on investment (ROI). With regards to ROI, the variable
    rate drip line system is best suited for high variability areas where differential
    management can improve low yield cells while managing water efficiently. The cost
    of a variable rate drip line irrigation system as presented herein depends on
    the spatial extent of the irrigation control cells. The smaller the control cells,
    the higher the infrastructure costs will be. Clearly, the size of the irrigation
    control cell should address yield or soil variability and this will drive the
    number of control nodes, solenoid valves, etc. Current estimates for implementing
    the variable rate drip line system at 30 m resolution can approach approximately
    a one-time cost of $5000 per hectare (assuming large scale fabrication of the
    components). If the system is fully packaged, installation costs should be similar
    to today’s system. In Fig. 6, the expected yield improvements are calculated as
    a function of control cell size (i.e., for the yield variability of the vineyard
    as shown in Fig. 5). Two assumptions are made in this calculation: 1) in regions
    with lower than average yield, the yield can be increased to the average yield
    of the field using variable rate irrigation and 2) the maximum yield improvement
    for the entire field (in the limit of very small control cell sizes) is 20%. We
    note that 20% is a realistic but potentially conservative assumption given that
    we have already shown 26% yield improvements. Fig. 6(a) shows that for very small
    control cells, the benefit of the technology saturates (approaching the assumed
    20% maximum yield improvement). For very large control cells, variable rate irrigation
    becomes ineffective compared to uniform irrigation, which shows that the spatial
    resolution of the management zone is just too coarse to successfully mitigate
    the variability. In terms of the cost benefits, an average price of 500pertonofgrapesisassumed,withapotential
    1200 profit per acre due to 20% increase in yield. The profit obtained should
    cover the cost of required new equipment (conversion of single drip line to a
    double drip line system) and the cost of required electronic components. Fig.
    6. Expected yield increase and ROI as a function of the control cell’s size. The
    optimum cell size is ~30m where the maximum benefits are expected. Show All Estimates
    of the ROI at larger manufacturing volumes as a function of the control zone size
    are shown in Fig. 6(b) with an optimum control cell size of around 30 m ×30 m
    where the ROI is approximately two years for grapes. Table III quantifies the
    cost of control electronics as a function of the number of fabricated units where
    larger volume decreases the unit price for the control nodes. Cost analysis for
    four distinctive crops indicates the number of years required to recover the investment
    (Table III-B). We note that all the calculations are made for crops that command
    high market prices. The ROI for deploying such a variable rate drip line system
    for strawberries, tomatoes, almonds, and grapes is 0.5, 0.8, 1.6, and 2.5 years,
    respectively, where the control zone is set at 30 m (the spatial resolution of
    Landsat imagery). These calculations may change if private satellite imagery needs
    to be purchased or if the deployed infrastructure will not remain in place for
    at least five years. Adoption of variable rate irrigation technology can have
    significant impact in regions such as the Indian subcontinent, most of Africa,
    Australia, and Western USA where water extraction often exceeds groundwater recharging
    rates [31]. TABLE III (a) Economic Analysis of Variable Rate Technology Cost as
    Function of Number of Controlled Units Fabricated. (b) Return of Investment for
    Different Crops as Function of Number of Control Units Used for Variable Rate
    Irrigation The second important aspect that needs to be implemented to scale-up
    variable rate irrigation is the data analytics platform that can ingest large
    scale geospatial data [32] and create real-time irrigation requirement. Such platforms
    should automatically combine real-time weather with remotely sensed data and automate
    and parallelize the analytics that determine the irrigation requirement. Only
    considered for the continental U.S., the required data sets can be several Terabytes
    of data each week. Near real-time irrigation prescriptions are virtually impossible
    using conventional (sequential) data processing techniques due to computational
    constraints. By way of comparison, a “big” data platform such as a highly distributed
    file system and processing environment leveraging the MapReduce framework [33]
    splits these large data files into small manageable 64 kB units, which can then
    be processed in parallel, thereby enabling computation “in the” data. For example,
    to scale the irrigation forecasting solution on a global scale we are using more
    than 32 servers, each with its own multicore processing unit and several local
    hard discs, where the irrigation analytics can be readily accelerated by a factor
    of 600 or more. With this system, irrigation requirements can be calculated in
    near real-time and scaled world-wide and adjusted for unexpected events like excessive
    precipitation, abrupt changes in daily temperature, and air moisture levels. Current
    development in big data technology can enable large scale irrigation forecasting
    using geospatial data [34]. The incremental cost to analyze new satellite data
    or weather data, in a big data framework, is minimal compared with manual analysis
    where data download, spatial alignment of data, and running analytics require
    significant manpower. Automation and machine to machine communication, as demonstrated
    in this paper, facilitate variable rate irrigation and provide consistency across
    growing season. SECTION V. Discussion The above results highlight the benefit
    of the closed loop variable rate irrigation approach where irrigation is fully
    automated. The variable rate drip line system presented here has the advantage
    of being flexible to deliver water differentially across a spatial area with high
    temporal resolution. For example, multiple irrigation periods during each day
    (to maintain constant soil moisture and avoid water pooling) can be readily implemented
    to maintain constant soil moisture or minimize water usage by applying the right
    amount of water at the right time. With proper management zone selection, yield
    can be significantly improved or water can be saved. The yield maximizing area
    responded directly to the targeted irrigation and it can be safely assumed that
    this is the main reason for the improved yield values. The improvements in water
    efficiency between 10%–20%, demonstrate that similar yields can be obtained using
    significantly less water. This can be a substantial benefit if the technology
    is adopted across a large geographical region. If applied to all grape producing
    region in California, which used 2 billion m3 irrigation water in 2010 (DWR 2014,
    USDA 2010), 15% improvements amounts to 300 million m3 reduction in water usage.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper validates that: 1) variability can be minimized
    across a vineyard and 2) low yield areas can be turned into high yield areas using
    only differential irrigation. Two different objectives, increased yield and preserved
    water, can be achieved simultaneously in a vineyard by controlling water delivery
    on a spatial checkboard pattern. We demonstrated that management zone delineation
    can be defined based on NDVI and yield data and those management zones are a good
    representation of the variability. This paper demonstrates that with real-time
    control on the irrigation, the vigor of the canopy can be improved in a few weeks
    at the beginning of the season and reverse yield patterns after only 2 years of
    variable rate irrigation. These changes can be achieved on irrigation control
    cells as low as 15 m × 15m. The double drip line system developed for this paper
    can be easily reconfigured to adjust to any management zones that may affect variability
    in the field. In locations where soil and management practices vary across the
    vineyard, dynamic management zones can be defined by clustering the irrigation
    control cell to reflect the new management zones. Management zone boundaries can
    be changed dynamically during the growing season by just logically clustering
    irrigation control cells differently, without changing physical infrastructure.
    This proof of concept experiment carried out in a vineyard demonstrates the advantage
    to automate and customize irrigation for control zones of as little as 40 vines
    that can result in a 26% improvement in yield and an average 16% increase in water
    use efficiency. Large scale deployment of variable rate irrigation driven by digital
    data can enable efficient water use in regions where water is scarce and expensive,
    as well as during drought, while maintaining and improving currently achievable
    crop yields. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

  limitations: The paper does not provide a detailed economic analysis of the system,
    which would be useful for potential adopters to assess the cost-effectiveness
    of the technology. Additionally, the study was conducted on a single vineyard,
    so it is not clear how the results would generalize to other crops or growing
    conditions.

    \ of water resources is one of the major methods of water conservation.\nThere\
    \ are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the irrigation needs of diﬀerent agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ because of their\nspatial variability. Therefore, a decision support system\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) by\ncenter pivot was developed. This\
    \ system can process multi-spectral images taken by unmanned\naerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and obtain the vegetation index (VI). The crop evapotranspiration model\n\
    (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were obtained from their established\
    \ relationships with the\nVIs. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system were constituted\
    \ with ETc, CWSI and precipitation.\nTo provide guidance for users, the duty-cycle\
    \ control map was outputted using ambiguity resolution.\nThe control command contained\
    \ in the map adjusted the duty cycle of the solenoid valve, and then\nchanged\
    \ the irrigation amount. A water stress experiment was designed to verify the\
    \ rationality of\nthe DSS-VRI. The results showed that the more severe water stress\
    \ is, the more irrigation is obtained,\nconsistent with the expected results.\
    \ Meanwhile, a user-friendly software interface was developed to\nimplement the\
    \ DSS-VRI function.\nKeywords: decision support system (DSS); variable rate irrigation\

    1. Introduction\nChina is a country with a water shortage, especially in its northwest\
    \ regions. The shortage of\nwater resources restricts agricultural development\
    \ in many provinces, while the need for food has\ndramatically increased with\
    \ the growth of the population. Agriculture is facing more serious challenges\n\
    and requires eﬀective ways for water-saving irrigation. Variable rate irrigation\
    \ (VRI) is distinguished\nfrom traditional precision irrigation and provides such\
    \ a solution. Previous VRI research has focused\non quantitative decision-making\
    \ models, partition management, decision support systems (DSS) and\nvariable outputs\
    \ [1]. There among, the quantitative decision-making model and partition management\n\
    are key parts of VRI, variable output plays the role of executor, and DSS connected\
    \ all parts of VRI.\nThe DSS has been discussed as a popular topic in the VRI\
    \ system. Navarro [2] developed\na DSS for estimating weekly irrigation needs\
    \ on the basis of soil measurements and climatic variables\nwhich were gathered\
    \ by several autonomous nodes deployed in farmland. Nain [3] used a DSS to\ngenerate\
    \ suitable decision outputs for irrigation and fertilization in hilly regions.\
    \ Miller [4] developed\na DSS, which uses the Natural Resources Conservation Service\
    \ Gridded Soil Survey Geographic\nDatabase to estimate water capacity available\
    \ for root zone, and determines irrigation amount based\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19132880\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880\n\
    2 of 15\non the estimates.\nBesides, AgroClimate is a DSS tool for improving the\
    \ eﬃciency of irrigation\nwater usage (http://mz.agroclimate.org/) with its irrigation\
    \ decision made on the basis of daily crop\nevapotranspiration calculated by the\
    \ Hargreaves equation and crop coeﬃcients [5]. Most DSSs are\ngenerally designed\
    \ for speciﬁc crops or farmlands; it is diﬃcult to apply them in other crops or\
    \ the\nsame crop planted in diﬀerent districts. In view of this, Yang [6] developed\
    \ a decision support system\nfor ﬂexible irrigation scheduling (DSS-FIS), in which\
    \ users can modify its input parameters through\na software interface to adapt\
    \ it to various environments.\nThe use of DSSs for irrigation ties in implementing\
    \ a reliable decision method and using decision\ndata sources. Weather forecast\
    \ information can be a way to estimate the water requirements of the\ncrops [7].\
    \ However, this method is unilateral, since it ignores the impact of crop characteristics\
    \ and\nspatial variability. Some studies have used sensors and the global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) to collect\ninformation about speciﬁc soil and plant conditions\
    \ for irrigation scheduling. Sui [8] built a wireless\nsensor network to monitor\
    \ soil water content and collect weather data. O’Shaughnessy [9] used\ninfrared\
    \ temperature (IRT) sensor nodes mounted on masts at the edge of each concentric\
    \ treatment\narea to measure crop canopy temperature. Morari [10] used time domain\
    \ transmissometry (TDT)\nsensors to measure soil moisture content. Since these\
    \ sensors are immobile, the irrigation decision\naccuracy depends on the number\
    \ of sensors in the large-scale planting area or on the truss of the\nsprinkle\
    \ irrigation machine, and large-scale deployment of these sensors is not economical\
    \ for a moving\nsprinkler irrigation system. Also, the sensors mounted in the\
    \ ﬁeld are harmful to the farmland\nsoil ecosystem.\nIn recent years, irrigation\
    \ scheduling could be obtained from some schemes based on various\nremote sensing\
    \ imagery platforms. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of good real-time\n\
    performance and wide coverage on cropland, and makes up for the defects of immobile\
    \ sensors.\nThe development of aerospace technology makes it possible for irrigation\
    \ scheduling to use remote\nsensing imagery platforms, with unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and satellites as common tools.\nHowever, satellites can be inhibited\
    \ by clouds and/or may not be in orbital position during crop\ndevelopment stages\
    \ [11]. Zhang [12] suggested that canopy temperature from UAV thermal infrared\n\
    images could be a way to evaluate the crop water stress state. The thermal infrared\
    \ sensors currently\nmounted are mostly lightweight and uncooled thermal infrared\
    \ cameras. Compared to multispectral\nremote-sensing systems, thermal imagery\
    \ has the advantage of higher reliability, but the multispectral\nremote-sensing\
    \ system has better performance in terms of information acquisition stability\
    \ and mosaic\ntechnology maturity. Meanwhile, canopy temperature measured by thermal\
    \ infrared camera is easily\naﬀected by air temperature and human activity [13].\
    \ Recently, many studies use UAV spectral images\nto mark crop water status through\
    \ the optimization of the vegetation index (VI) and crop water stress\nindex (CWSI)\
    \ model [14]. The VI-CWSI model, as the main index of the DSS, is usually used\
    \ as\nevidence for irrigation dispatching. Zhang [15] used high-resolution UAV\
    \ multispectral imagery to\nmap maize water stress status. The crop evapotranspiration\
    \ model (ETc) is also used as evidence for\nirrigation dispatching. Calera [16]\
    \ reviewed the crop evapotranspiration model (ETc) on optical remote\nsensing\
    \ for the assessment of crop water requirements, and demonstrated that ET can\
    \ be a reliable\nindicator for irrigation assessment. This approach is based on\
    \ the Food and Agriculture Organization’s\n(FAO) method for estimating crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ in which reference evapotranspiration values\nare multiplied by crop coeﬃcients\
    \ (Kc).\nThe coeﬃcient may be derived from multispectral VI.\nSome approaches\
    \ have employed signals in the thermal band obtained from remote sensors as inputs\n\
    for energy balance equations that are solved to estimate ETc [17]. The multispectral\
    \ VI approach for\nestimating crop evapotranspiration requires fewer inputs and\
    \ theoretical background knowledge,\nand is thus simpler than the energy balance\
    \ equations approach. In this paper, multispectral VIs were\nused to calculate\
    \ crop coeﬃcients.\nWater stressed crops manifest symptoms such as leaf wilting,\
    \ stunted growth, and leaf area\nreduction [18]. VI can be used to monitor surface\
    \ vegetation conditions. The structure indices\nbased on visible, near infrared\
    \ and red-edge bands are more widely used, such as the normalized\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 2880\n3 of 15\ndiﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index\n(EVI), simple ratio (SR) and green\
    \ normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI), and visible\natmospherically\
    \ resistant index (VARI). The NDVI is the most often used, partly due to its “ratio”\n\
    properties, which enable the NDVI to cancel out a large proportion of the noise\
    \ caused by changing\nsun angles, topography, clouds or shadow, and atmospheric\
    \ conditions [19]. The SAVI was established\nto improve the sensitivity of the\
    \ NDVI to soil backgrounds [14]. The EVI has thus been considered\na modiﬁed NDVI\
    \ with improved sensitivity to high biomass regions and improved vegetation\n\
    monitoring capability through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and\
    \ a reduction in\natmospheric inﬂuences [19]. The SR can monitor changes in vegetation\
    \ cover and works best when\nvegetation is densely covered [20]. The GNDVI is\
    \ sensitive to crop pigment changes [21]. The VARI can\nreduce the eﬀects of illumination\
    \ and atmospheric conditions [22]. This paper measured reﬂectance\nindices within\
    \ multispectral ranges (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, SR, GNDVI, VARI) to indicate canopy changes\n\
    due to water stress.\nThe DSS has been used in many cases. The constraints of\
    \ some kinds of DSSs widely used\nin agricultural applications have not been eliminated.\
    \ Firstly, the output of the DSS is the input\ninformation of the control system.\
    \ The actual amount of irrigation is based on the crop’s water\nrequirement, which\
    \ is not the only factor in practical irrigation scheduling. The DSS should be\n\
    combined with a VRI control system. Common methods of control systems include\
    \ zone control and\nspeed control [23]. Speed control varies the moving speed\
    \ of the center pivot to accomplish the desired\nirrigation depth, while the duty-cycle\
    \ control changes the on-oﬀ time of individual sprinklers or groups\nof sprinklers\
    \ to achieve the desired irrigation depth. Generally, the VRI control system provides\n\
    opportunities to apply water to management zones by diﬀerent moving rates or diﬀerent\
    \ solenoid\nvalve duty-cycles. Secondly, the CWSI/Kc inversion model (VI-Kc/VI-CWSI)\
    \ is built for speciﬁc districts\nand crops. Diﬀerent crops have diﬀerent optimization\
    \ VI-Kc/VI-CWSI model [24,25]. Diﬀerent districts\nwith the same crop also have\
    \ diﬀerent VI-Kc/VI-CWSI [26]. The DSS based on the ﬁxed model is\nunsuitable\
    \ for other applications. Third, the irrigation amount is the result of a multifactorial\
    \ decision.\nActually, precise measurement of the irrigation requirement is complicated,\
    \ whose implementation\nneeds a lot of funds and time.\nThe concept of a fuzzy\
    \ system has been used for a realistic decision support model. For the\nirrigation\
    \ mission, the interaction between the crop water requirement and irrigation amount\
    \ is not\nalways accurately deﬁned. Therefore, the fuzzy model can be a viable\
    \ alternative [27]. The fuzzy\nsystem has the characteristics of simple rules\
    \ and wide applicability [28], and can analyze the inaccurate\ninformation and\
    \ receive irrigation guidance from complex farming sites [29]. So it is easier\
    \ for users to\naccept DSSs based on fuzzy logic.\nThis study developed a DSS\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) that serviced a center-pivot\nirrigation\
    \ system. The function of the DSS integrated image processing and data analysis\
    \ for UAV\nremote sensing. By using the DSS, users can easily process the image\
    \ and obtain a duty-cycle control\nmap of variable irrigation. The speciﬁc objectives\
    \ of this research were:\n(i) To develop a widely applicable DSS-VRI, which mainly\
    \ embodies the user to change some\nconditional parameters and to construct a\
    \ partial decision model to work in diﬀerent cases.\n(ii) To achieve expected\
    \ irrigation amounts in diﬀerent management areas, by using the duty-cycle\ncontrol\
    \ map generated from the DSS-VRI, which combines the UAV multispectral remote\
    \ sensing\nsystem and fuzzy inference system.\n2. System Description and Operation\n\
    In this study, a DSS-VRI was designed to make an irrigation scheduling map. The\
    \ main structure\nof the DSS-VRI is shown in Figure 1.\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880\n\

    \ at exhibiting the feasibility of the DSS-VRI to properly manage farmland \n\
    irrigation. The system is based on the prediction of the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ and rainfall to obtain \nfuzzy crop water consumption and replenishment. The\
    \ crop water stress index (CWSI) was selected \nto represent the state of water\
    \ stress. CWSI = 0 indicates no water stress, while CWSI = 1 indicates the \n\
    most severe stress. The evapotranspiration, rainfall and CWSI were used as three\
    \ input variables for \nthe fuzzy system to infer the duty-cycle for the central\
    \ pivot to be reached in order to change the \nirrigation level within the crop\
    \ area. The duty cycle is the ratio of the‘on’time to the‘on-off’ period for \n\
    solenoid valve. Lower duty cycle represents the less amount of water application.\
    \ \nFuzzy logic can express qualitative knowledge and experience unclear boundaries.\
    \ It uses the \nconcept of membership function to distinguish fuzzy sets, handle\

    \ Model Selected\nThis work aimed at exhibiting the feasibility of the DSS-VRI\
    \ to properly manage farmland\nirrigation. The system is based on the prediction\
    \ of the crop evapotranspiration and rainfall to obtain\nfuzzy crop water consumption\
    \ and replenishment. The crop water stress index (CWSI) was selected\nto represent\
    \ the state of water stress. CWSI = 0 indicates no water stress, while CWSI =\
    \ 1 indicates\nthe most severe stress. The evapotranspiration, rainfall and CWSI\
    \ were used as three input variables\nfor the fuzzy system to infer the duty-cycle\
    \ for the central pivot to be reached in order to change the\nirrigation level\
    \ within the crop area. The duty cycle is the ratio of the ‘on’ time to the ‘on-oﬀ’\
    \ period for\nsolenoid valve. Lower duty cycle represents the less amount of water\
    \ application.\nFuzzy logic can express qualitative knowledge and experience unclear\
    \ boundaries. It uses the\nconcept of membership function to distinguish fuzzy\
    \ sets, handle fuzzy relations, and simulate human\nbrains to implement rule-based\
    \ reasoning. Irrigation problems do not need a high accuracy for\nwater requirement\
    \ measurement. The integration of fuzzy logic with irrigation planning issues\

    Note: “Low” is interpreted as less rainfall or evapotranspiration in the coming\
    \ week, “average” and “Normal” as\nnormal rainfall and evapotranspiration in the\
    \ next week, “High” as rainy or high evapotranspiration in the coming\nweek, F\
    \ as crop water stress in the current state. S as mild water stress, and ES as\
    \ most severe stress.\nThese rules were represented with logical operator ‘&’.\
    \ For example, the ﬁrst rule is expressed as\n‘(ETc==Low) & (Precipitation==Low)\
    \ & (CWSI==F)=>(Duty-cycle=ML)’, and is interpreted as less\nrainfall and less\
    \ evapotranspiration in the coming week, low crop water stress in the current\
    \ state,\nso implies lower duty cycle. The duty cycle is the ratio of the ‘on’\
    \ time to the ‘on-oﬀ’ period. Lower\nduty cycles represent lower amounts of water\
    \ application.\n2.3. DSS-VRI Software Design and Operation\nA software was designed\
    \ to implement the proposed methodology. The application system was\nprogrammed\
    \ in Python (python 3.6.2). The DSS-VRI software generally needs about ﬁve minutes\n\
    to get duty-cycle control map, depending on the input data scale. The user interface\
    \ was designed\nand organized into several frames. Figure 4a gives the data input\
    \ interface, which allow the users\nto input multispectral image and to set some\
    \ basic parameters, including geographic coordinates\nand Moving rate of sprinkler\
    \ irrigation machine, parameters of zone management, application depth\nunder\
    \ the 100% moving rate, saving path of duty-cycle control command. Among all parameters,\n\
    geographic coordinates can be used to ﬁnd the center position of the machine in\
    \ remote sensing image.\nZone management parameters are used to set the number\
    \ of electromagnetic valve groups and the\ndistance between the sprinkler center\
    \ and each management group boundary. Moving speed is related\nto the maximum\
    \ crop water requirement. The relationship can be expressed as ‘the more crop\
    \ water\nis required, the slower the speed is’. After all parameter values are\
    \ entered, the user can click the\n“Update” button to get band information and\
    \ header ﬁle of the image. The interface for calculation of\nCWSI, ETc and precipitation\
    \ is shown in Figure 4b. Users can select the VI-Kc model and VI-CWSI\nmodel,\
    \ and enter weather forecast data of the next week to calculate ET0 and rainfall.\
    \ Figure 4c shows\nthe irrigation duty-cycle control map and NDVI map interface.\
    \ Users click the “Irrigation map” and\n“Spectral map” button to get a variable\
    \ irrigation duty-cycle control map and a NDVI map, respectively.\nThe NDVI map\
    \ has the information interaction function, which can display VIs and ETc of the\
    \ mouse\nlocation. Figure 4d shows the local data analysis interface, which can\
    \ assist users to observe local\nvariation of VI by using 3D-bar plot. Figure\
    \ 4d presents NDVI examples, including the coordinates,\nNDVI value and spatial\
    \ distribution. Users click the “User manual” button to get help page and\n“Control\

  limitations: The paper is focused on the description of a decision support system
    prototype for variable rate irrigation. It doesn't provide a thorough description
    of methods to accurately measure the irrigation requirement, which is mentioned
    to be one of the main weaknesses of the system. Also, the paper mentions that
    neglecting the impact of crop characteristics and spatial variability in some
    previous works may have led to irrigation dispatching errors, but does not give
    specific details or references about such works. Results and conclusions are only
    supported by a single case study without any quantitative data, which limits the
    ability to generalize and validate the approach. Furthermore, the paper does not
    describe how the system handles missing data or outliers in the input data.

    remote sensing data through establishing a two-dimensional coordinate system,

    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\

    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\
    \ canopy structure (height and Leaf Area Index);\n(iv) crop status; (v) canopy\
    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\
    \ photo to grayscale image, and then conversion to false colors. The upper part\
    \ of the image\n(darker soil color) corresponds to the most drained part of the\
    \ ﬁeld during the winter season, which\nwas then excluded from measurements. Results\
    \ of the experiment are published by Alvino et al. [83],\nreporting the effect\
    \ of shallow water tables on peach trees grafted on three peach seedlings.\nThere\

    \ weight. The small systems were deﬁned\nas an UAV of a maximum weight of 25 kg.\
    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\

    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\

    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

    content Highlights • Novel site-specific water production functions (WPFs) were
    developed and tested. • New zoning procedures for variable rate irrigation were
    established. • The k-NN WPF accurately predicted cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. • Sector zoning was predicted to enhance cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. Abstract Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority issue
    since available fresh water resources are limited. Water production functions
    (WPFs), mathematical relationships between applied water and crop yield, are useful
    tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield reduction due to
    deficit irrigation. This study aimed at (i) designing and evaluating site-specific
    WPFs (using k nearest neighbors (k-NN), multiple linear regression, and neural
    networks), (ii) simulating yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone
    control VRI center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs, (iii) using the
    best WPF to investigate different cotton irrigation and zoning strategies using
    integer linear programming, and (iv) comparing soil-based and WPF-based zones
    for sector control VRI systems. A two-year cotton irrigation experiment (2013–2014)
    was implemented to study irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship across different
    soil types. The site-specific k-NN WPFs showed the highest performance with root
    mean square error equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
    The result indicated that variable rate irrigation with limited sector control
    capability could enhance cotton lint yield under supplemental irrigation when
    field-level spatial soil heterogeneity is significant. The temporal changes in
    climate and rainfall patterns, however, had a great impact on cotton response
    to irrigation in west Tennessee, a moderately humid region with short season environment.

    1.1. Variable rate irrigation The demand for food and fiber is increasing as the
    world’s population grows. Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority
    issue since available fresh water resources are limited. Row crop supplemental
    irrigation is rapidly expanding in the moderately humid region of west Tennessee
    because of a trend of stabilizing yields by irrigation and high commodity prices.
    However, the soils of west Tennessee exhibit high spatial and temporal variability
    of soil characteristics that relate to moisture availability for crop production
    at the field-level. It has been shown in a variety of studies that soil characteristics
    such as soil water holding capacity and depth of soil significantly affects crop
    yield, hence irrigation strategies should be adjusted in regard to the soil type
    (Duncan, 2012). Consequently, variable rate irrigation (VRI) is recommended as
    the appropriate irrigation scenario to address field-level spatiotemporal heterogeneity
    and thus how, when, and where to irrigate (Duncan, 2012). VRI is expected to improve
    water-use efficiency, increase productivity, save fuel and decrease nutrient leaching
    (Pan et al., 2013). Several authors have stressed the potential water conservation
    that has been observed using VRI systems (Evans et al., 1996, Duke et al., 1997,
    Sadler et al., 2005, Hedley and Yule, 2009). For instance, Hedley and Yule (2009)
    compared VRI and conventional uniform irrigation methods and found that 9–19%
    of irrigation water was saved, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching. The state-of-the-art
    zone control VRI systems, allow farmers to adjust irrigation applications across
    fields, by pulsing individual sprinklers or banks of sprinklers on and off. The
    sector control VRI systems cut pie shape zones simply by adjusting the revolution
    speed of the center pivot between given pairs of angles. Pan et al. (2013) analyzed
    soil water status through spatial and temporal data and suggested this method
    as a means to assess the potential of VRI and to schedule irrigation. Recently,
    Haghverdi et al. (2015b) used integer linear programing (ILP) to find the optimum
    number and spatial arrangement of irrigation management zones for center pivot
    systems with limited sector control capability. They used soil properties to delineate
    management zones, yet suggested to investigate crop response to water amount across
    different soil types as a means to provide crop-specific irrigation management
    zones. In practice, the level of irrigation management being followed by the majority
    of producers is relatively low, while experience with successful zone control
    VRI management is rare among producers and service providers. Initially, the larger
    price tag, accompanied with the fear of complexity that is associated with using
    zone control VRI, are the two main stumbling blocks experienced by farmers. The
    sector control VRI systems require less capital investment and the operation/maintenance
    is also easier than that of zone control VRI. Most of the center pivots that farmers
    use today are equipped to allow a limited number of pie shape sectors to be made,
    without any additional control panel upgrades. The knowledge and full use of this
    capability is the perfect and most appropriate step in bridging the gap between
    current practice and cutting-edge zone control technology (Haghverdi et al., 2015b).
    Currently, it is not easy to quantify the potential production benefits of zone
    control and sector control VRI systems over conventional uniform irrigation systems
    in a given field, further contributing to producers’ present hesitancy and reluctance,
    with regards to investing in VRI systems. However, before the benefits of VRI
    can be achieved, it is necessary to identify the spatial heterogeneity of soil
    within a given field and delineate homogenous management zones wherein identical
    inputs of water can be applied. In practice, the number of zones depends on the
    target input, available equipment and the crop(s) planted. However, a corollary
    expectation is that varying the inputs within the management zones will facilitate
    optimal yields. This desire leads to the development of water production functions
    (WPF) where crop yield is mathematically related to the amount of irrigation water.
    1.2. Water production functions The term production function (PF) may be assigned
    to any mathematical relationship between crop yield and input components such
    as water, fertilizers and energy (De Juan et al., 1996). In practice, almost all
    the derived PFs require crop water use as an independent variable. PFs predict
    total dry matter (or marketable product of each crop) as a dependent variable,
    while the independent variables are transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET) or
    the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). The PFs are categorized into
    crop water production functions (CWPFs) and water production functions (WPF) that
    use ET and IW as independent variables, respectively. IW may consist of different
    components such as the crop water requirement, pre-planting irrigation, leaching
    requirement, and rainfall (Igbadun et al., 2007). Recently, some studies have
    aimed to revisit and rebuild the concept of PF including the development of a
    WPF for water logging stress on corn (Kuang et al., 2012) and a rice water – fertilizer
    PF (Ai-hua et al., 2012). Tong and Guo (2013) included an estimation of uncertainty
    in CWPF along with the optimal allocation of water resources in an irrigation
    area. Saseendran et al. (2014) established location-specific CWPFs using long-term
    averaged data for corn in Colorado. They used the RZWQM2 model (Ahuja et al.,
    2000) and historical weather data to develop average corn CWPFs across years and
    locations. Sadler et al. (2002) applied WPFs at field level and observed significant
    differences in corn response to irrigation within and across soil map units. Holan
    et al. (2008) formulated spatially dependent WPFs that later were used by Stone
    and Sadler (2015) who reported high accuracies for the spatial modeling of corn
    yield. Wang et al. (2007) derived cotton and wheat water-salinity PFs. Dinar et
    al. (1986) derived cotton CWPF under saline conditions in California to improve
    irrigation management. Classical PFs are useful tools for irrigation management
    and economic analysis of yield reduction due to deficit irrigation, but there
    are some shortcomings associated with them. The behavior of complex ecological
    systems is non-linear, but most PFs are based on easily built linear regression-based
    equations and are thus not particularly powerful representations of these systems
    (Dai et al., 2011, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). However, recent studies have investigated
    the use of more robust and non-linear techniques to predict yield and model complex
    systems, particularly powerful empirical algorithms derived from machine learning
    data mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al., 2010, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). Data mining
    could be defined as the process of capturing important and useful information
    from large data sets (Mucherino et al., 2009). An extensive review on data mining
    methods and their application in agricultural related studies was gathered by
    Huang et al. (2010). Machine learning algorithms were employed to some extent
    for predicting yield of different crops. Fortin et al. (2010) used artificial
    neural networks (ANNs) for predicting potato tuber growth as well as its in-field
    variations in Canada. They reported that if enough data is input to an ANN model,
    one can precisely model site-specific tuber growth. Dai et al. (2011) adopted
    ANN and multi-linear regression models to simulate the response of sunflower yield
    to soil moisture and salinity. This resulted in ANN models having higher precision
    than regression for modeling relationships between crop yield and soil moisture
    and salinity at different crop growth periods (Dai et al., 2011). Haghverdi et
    al. (2014b) derived some novel WPFs and compared data mining-based methods with
    traditional regression procedures. They utilized ANN and decision tree modeling
    algorithms to derive water salinity PFs for spring wheat and found the results
    promising. 1.3. Site-specific water production functions & variable rate irrigation
    Traditional irrigation/agronomic work tries to address the irrigation related
    questions by means of small plot trials over multiple sites and across several
    years. This is probably the best way to collect the necessary data in controlled
    environments following the statistical principles behind design of experiments.
    However, there are some shortcomings. Given the time consuming and labor intensive
    nature of field experiments, this approach becomes unrealistic for the near future
    (Drummond et al., 2003). In addition, this method relies on scaling and transforming
    small plot research findings to operational management of farmers’ fields. In
    reality, each field has its own spatial and temporal heterogeneity of main attributes
    and this complexity requires site-specific irrigation management solutions. An
    alternative option is to simulate the behavior of the fields using mechanistic
    crop growth models. However, the drawback of these models is that they are time-consuming
    and expensive to develop because of the numerous inputs that need to be collected
    to run them (Drummond et al., 2003). Precision agriculture (PA) enables farmers
    to collect numerous site-specific data. Empirical analysis of these data may be
    the key to aid farmers in their occupational practice. PA is successful if accurate
    and detailed information about crop response to specific conditions is provided
    (Drummond et al., 2003). Quantifying crop response to water is the first step
    toward optimizing irrigation, and is therefore a critical issue for farmers, governmental
    agencies and consulting companies. Given the time consuming and expensive nature
    of irrigation studies, developing computer tools and models are very helpful in
    providing a comprehensive understanding of irrigation-yield relationship for different
    crops across different soil types. Robust algorithms are needed for identifying
    site-specific crop yield responses to environmental and management parameters
    and helping to find either optimum practices or alternative scenarios. The increased
    cost and complexity of variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems compared to conventional
    systems are the main obstacles barring widespread adaptation by farmers. VRI related
    research projects have mainly focused on (i) designing sprinklers to spatially
    vary irrigation rates and (ii) developing software/hardware for guiding the VRI
    system (Pan et al., 2013). There thus remains by necessity, novel models and techniques
    that simplify irrigation zone delineation, and provide an estimation of attainable
    production benefits of VRI systems, the main goal of this study. The objectives
    of this study are to: (i) Use multiple data mining techniques to design customized
    site-specific WPFs for cotton. (ii) Determine the best site-specific WPF for cotton.
    (iii) Simulate yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone control VRI
    center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs. (iv) Formulate an optimization
    problem for sector control VRI systems using integer linear programing and water
    production functions to maximize yield. (v) Compare the spatial arrangement of
    the optimum soil-based and WPF-based irrigation management zones for sector control
    VRI center pivot systems. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Field of study A 73-ha
    cotton field that contained two center pivots for irrigation within which the
    resident farmer practiced uniform nitrogen (N) application and variable rate potassium
    and phosphorus application was selected as the study area (Fig. 1). The field
    is located in southwestern Dyer County in west Tennessee within a moderately humid
    region along the Mississippi river. The fields are Mississippi river terrace alluvial
    deposits that have produced Robinsonville loam and fine sandy loam, Commerce silty
    clay loam, and Crevasse sandy loam soils (Fig. 1). The mean monthly growing season
    precipitation and temperature is 97 mm month−1 and 21 °C from May to November,
    respectively. Soil sampling and modeling of the fields different soil constituents,
    particularly soil available water content, showed substantial spatial heterogeneity
    and as much as a four-fold increase in the variability of available soil water
    content within the effective root zone across the field (Haghverdi et al., 2015c).
    Given the spatial variability of these soil properties, this field was an ideal
    site for a study of the spatial optimization of a VRI system. Download : Download

    Dyer County, Tennessee, USA. 2.2. Irrigation experiment A two-year experiment
    (2013–2014) was implemented to study the irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship
    across the different soil types. The field was no-tillage planted to cotton (‘PHY375’
    variety) on the 30th of May, 2013, and to cotton (‘Stoneville 4946’ variety) on
    the 5th of May, 2014. Crop pest management was implemented following state extension
    recommendations. In the first year, the field was harvested on December 2–3, 2013
    and in the 2nd year it was harvested on October 18–20, 2014. There is some overlap
    between the two center pivots that cover the majority of the field (Fig. 2). Irrigation
    scheduling was carried out by the producer since the optimum practical goal was
    to enhance knowledge and expertise of the farmer over the course of the experiment.
    We provided sufficient information for the farmer to irrigate appropriately using
    a wireless network of soil sensors installed throughout the field of study, as
    well as an on-site weather station to estimate ET. Additionally, the Management
    of Irrigation Systems in Tennessee (MOIST) program (http://bioengr.ag.utk.edu/weather/)
    was employed to assist the farmer with irrigation scheduling. MOIST is an irrigation
    decision support tool that delivers irrigation recommendations that consider both
    ET and soil water status. We simulated spatial variability in water application
    across different soil types (Fig. 2) by programing the pivots and partially swapping
    the sprinklers. The pivot’s control panels were Valley Select2 module (Valmont
    Industries, Inc) that were programmable up to 9 sectors, thus allowing one to
    vary the location, frequency, and amount of irrigation across the field by changing
    the travel speed of the irrigation system. Consequently, the sprinklers were swapped
    to apply approximately 50% more/less irrigation water (IW) than the farmer’s decision.
    The IW on sector zones was between 25% and 30% higher/lower than the IW that was
    set by the farmer. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download

    the study area (b). This figure is adapted from Haghverdi et al. (2015c). 2.3.
    Input attributes and data preparation Table 1 summarizes the data used in this
    study to derive the WPFs. The field was sampled on March 21 and 22, 2014 where
    400 undisturbed core soil samples from 100 sampling locations at 4 different depths
    were collected to measure soil texture, soil water content, and bulk density.
    Then, the soil water retention curves were predicted for samples using pseudo-continuous
    pedotransfer functions (Haghverdi et al., 2014a) and interpolated to generate
    high-resolution maps. In addition, soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    was collected using a Veris 3100 (Veris Technologies, Salina, KS) instrument.
    More information on proximal soil data collection/sensing and modeling is provided
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). The cotton lint yield maps were obtained from the
    yield monitors. A quality assessment of the raw cotton lint yield data was conducted
    to remove outliers and bad data. The study field was gridded into 5-m × 5-m cells
    or pixels (25 m2 area per cell) and for each cell, all attributes in Table 1 (inputs
    and outputs) were obtained. Ordinary kriging was used for interpolation. Empirical
    semivariograms were calculated using the Geostatistical Analyst toolbox in ArcGIS
    10.2.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California) considering 12 lags and an omnidirectional
    stable model. A total of 16,000 cells were prepared after removing cells with
    missing/bad data. Since neither pivot was shut off in the overlap zone, the water
    applied in that zone was considered to be the summation of the applied water by
    the both pivots. Table 1. Input/output attributes for deriving site-specific water

    for four layers (i.e. 0–25 cm, 25–50 cm, 50–75 cm, 75–100 cm) covering crop effective
    root zone. c The farmer practiced variable rate P and K, but nitrogen was applied
    uniformly. In many situations, there are only a few major driving forces that
    govern a system. As the number of input predictors increases, the likelihood of
    redundancy or high correlation between variables increases with more than one
    attribute capable of explaining the behavior of the system. Principal component
    analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that is used to reduce the dimensionality
    or the number of high correlations in a given data set. PCA finds hidden patterns
    within a data set and extracts the important information from the raw data and
    replaces it with a group of new input predictors called principle components.
    Principal components are orthogonal to each other and each of them is a linear
    combination of the original input attributes. (Mathworks, 2014, Abdi and Williams,
    2010). In this study, we used Matlab 2015a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.) to
    perform PCA. The Hotelling’s T2, a statistical measure of the multivariate distance
    of each observation from the center of the data set, was calculated to find the
    most important PCs. Prior to establishing WPFs, the data set was randomly divided
    into 10 almost equal-size subsets. The modeling was repeated 10 times where each
    time one subset was assigned to the test phase and the rest of them were used
    to develop the WPFs. 2.4. Modeling and simulation 2.4.1. Establishing site-specific
    water production functions Multiple linear regression water production function,
    MLR WPF Fig. 3 illustrates the three methods that were developed to establish
    site-specific WPFs. Traditionally linear regression is used to derive WPFs that
    typically result in a curvilinear representation of water-yield relationship.
    We followed the recommendations of Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and used k-means cluster
    analysis to divide the data into 4 homogenous soil property sub-groups. Then,
    for each sub-group, a separate MLR-WPF was developed considering IW, IW2 and IW
    × PCs as input predictors. The ten most important PCs were used as input for clustering.

    Fig. 3. The three workflow processes used in this study to develop customized
    site-specific water production functions (WPF) to predict cotton yields for 2
    center pivots in a 73 ha field in west Tennessee; k-NN: k nearest neighbors, PCA:
    principle component analysis, ANN: artificial neural networks. K nearest neighbors
    water production function, k-NN WPF The k-NN is a non-parametric lazy learning
    algorithm that processes all of the data when prediction of the response(s) for
    a new observation is required. The k-NN was considered to be among the top ten
    techniques used for data mining (Wu et al., 2008), but in general has been applied
    less than other data mining techniques in agricultural studies (Mucherino et al.,
    2009). The k-NN considers a distance function, such as the Euclidean distance,
    to find so-called closer observations with higher similarity. Then, it combines
    the response of the k nearest surrounding observations to predict the response
    for new observations. Fig. 3 provides a visual step-by-step guide to deriving
    the site-specific k-NN WPFs, where first the raw inputs (Table 1) were converted
    to PCs. Then, the first 10 PCs and the IW were converted to input predictors with
    a zero mean and a standard deviation of one, and then the ranges of input predictors
    were tuned following the method recommended by Nemes et al. (2006). In order to
    predict yield for a target cell of the test data set at a specific irrigation
    level (I∗), the following steps were taken. First, distance from the target cell
    to every cell in the development data set was computed as the summation of the
    differences among their input predictors: (1) where di is the distance between
    ith cell in the development data set and the target cell, Δaij is the difference
    between jth attribute of the two cells and N = 11 is the number of the input attributes.
    Second, a reference data set was created consisting of those cells in the development
    data set that had irrigation levels within a 20-mm range from the target irrigation
    level (i.e. I∗). Third, the k nearest cells to the target cell were selected from
    the reference data set. Fourth, a distance-dependent weight was assigned to each
    k nearest cell (Nemes et al., 2006): (2) where k is the number of selected nearest
    cells, p is the design parameter and wi is the weight of ith cell. Finally, the
    cotton yield for the target cell (Yp) was predicted as the weighted average of
    the yield values for the k nearest cells: (3) A cross-validation procedure was
    designed to identify the optimum k and p values. The parameter k was varied from
    1 to 10 and p was changed from 0.5 to 3 with 0.5 increments. For each combination
    of k and p parameters, a bagging technique was implemented to compute the output
    of the k-NN-WPF (Breiman, 1996). In other words, the output was the aggregation
    of the output of multiple WPFs which were established on different realizations
    of the reference dataset using sampling with replacement. Haghverdi et al. (2015a)
    recommended that the number of ensemble values be 40. The modeling was done using
    Matlab R2014a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.). Artificial neural network water
    production function, ANN WPF The past performance of artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) suggests that they have potential to establish reasonable WPFs (Haghverdi
    et al., 2014b). A three-layer perceptron model was selected for this study. SPSS
    Modeler 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) automatically computed the best number of
    neurons to be used in the hidden layer to derive ANN WPFs. The first 10 PCs and
    IW were chosen as input predictors. The bagging technique was implemented to enhance
    model stability. The number of ensembles was chosen to be 40. Thirty percent of
    the training data were assigned to cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. 2.4.2.
    Simulating irrigation and zoning strategies The WPF with highest performance was
    selected to simulate irrigation and zoning strategies. Note that both modeling
    and simulation phases were done separately for 2013 and 2014 data. The seasonal
    irrigation level was changed from 0 to 150 mm with 10-mm increments. The optimum
    cotton lint yield maps were delineated for the three irrigation strategies including
    (i) uniform irrigation, (ii) VRI with limited sector control capability and (iii)
    a hypothetical situation in which each cell (5 × 5 m2) to be irrigated individually
    at optimum level. We adopted and modified the integer linear programing (ILP)
    optimization process developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) to find the optimum
    arrangement of management zones to maximize cotton lint yield for VRI systems
    with limited sector control capability. Each center pivot irrigation system was
    considered to consist of 360 sectors each 1 deg wide. A total of 12,241 possible
    zones were obtained by all combinations of 1 deg sectors into sectors from 1 to
    360 deg long (Table 2). Then, the optimum irrigation level to maximize cotton
    lint yield was predicted for each zone by means of k-NN WPF separately for each
    cropping season. The optimization process was formulated as follows: (4) subject
    to (5) (6) (7) where xi is the decision variable for zone i, y is the optimum
    yield per unit area predicted by k-NN WPF within zone i, n is the total number
    of the zones, l is the length of each zone in degrees, cij is a coefficient equal
    to 1 if angle j is covered by zone i otherwise equal to 0, Pmax is the maximum
    number of desired zones. Table 2. All of the sector zones that could be delineated
    underneath a center pivot systems. This Table is adapted from Haghverdi et al.

    359–1 … 359–359 a X–Y: start angle-end angle. The objective function (4) maximizes
    cotton lint yields across the zones. Restriction (5) guarantees that each degree
    is covered only by one zone and the optimum zoning scheme covers the entire area
    underneath the center pivots. Constraint (6) keeps the total number of the zones
    less than the maximum user-defined number. Constraint (7) ensures that the length
    of the sectors is greater than the minimum user-defined (i.e. 5 degree in this
    study). If a sector was selected, the decision variable of the model, xi, was
    equal to 1 otherwise 0. 2.5. Evaluation procedure The performance of the WPFs
    was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE)
    and the correlation coefficient (r): (8) (9) (10) where Ei, and Mi are the estimated
    and the measured cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively; n is the number of
    actual cells in test/validation set; Em and Mm are the mean of estimated and the
    mean of actual cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively. 3. Results 3.1. Principal
    component analysis PCA was performed to combine and summarize the variability
    in the input attributes in Table 1 (Fig. 4). A cumulative Hotelling’s T2 was plotted
    against the number of PCs where about 96% of the inputs were explained by considering
    10 PCs, but adding more PCs did not improve nor explain most of the variability.
    Our goal was to explain at least 95% of the variability in our data set using
    selected PCs. Consequently, we used only the first 10 PCs in our WPFs. However,
    to provide an overall insight regarding performance of the PCA approach in this
    study, we only discussed the coefficient of the first two PCs in detail. Download

    c) indicated soil texture and water content within the effective root zone followed
    by soil structure had the highest influence on PC1. On PC2, percent of clay and
    water content at FC and PWP of the shallow soil played the major role. ECa, irrigation
    and fertilizer produced medium coefficients for both PCs. The PC1 map to a great
    extent showed the expected pattern of soil physical and hydraulic properties across
    field (Fig. 4b). The PC1 negative values corresponds to soils with lower water
    holding capacity and available water content which were formed by three regions
    at the mid-east, mid-south and north west of the field. The PC1 is plotted against
    PC2 when ECa data were used to color code the points (Fig. 4, panel d). There
    was a clear distinction between (i) points with lower ECa (corresponding to coarse
    soil with lower available water content) which were skewed and clustered towards
    upper left corner of the figure and (ii) points with higher ECa (corresponding
    to fine-textured soil with higher water holding capacity) which were skewed towards
    upper right corner of the plot. The transition section at the middle of the plot
    represented soil with medium ECa, corresponding to moderate available water content.
    3.2. Performance of WPFs Fig. 5 presents the performance of k-NN WPFs (i.e. the
    average RMSE as well as the standard deviation of RMSE values among 10 subsets
    of data used for model evaluation) for a range of design parameters, i.e. p and
    k. The trend was identical for both cropping seasons; the error started to decline
    as number of nearest neighbors increased, reached a minimum at k = 5, and started
    to increase again. There was almost no difference in performance of WPFs with
    different p values and k less than 4, but the WPFs with lower p values exhibited
    a higher increase in RMSE for k greater than 4. In general, the standard deviation
    of RMSE values among 10 subsets consistently decreased with increasing k from
    1 to 10 regardless of p values. The optimum parameters for k and p were equal
    to 4 and 1.5, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download

    among 10 test subsets, right side panels: standard deviation of RMSE values among
    10 test subsets. Table 3 summarizes the performance evaluation statistics for
    the WPFs. Fig. 6 illustrates the estimated versus measured lint yield for both
    cropping seasons using all three WPFs. The k-NN exhibited the highest performance
    and accuracy for both 2013 and 2014 with RMSE equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194
    Mg ha−1, respectively, which was in agreement with well scattered cloud of points
    around 1:1 line (Fig. 6). The ANN (MLR) exhibited 60% (73%) and 52% (65%) increase
    in RMSE compared to the corresponding k-NN WPFs in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons,
    respectively. The ANN WPFs had a better performance (i.e. lower RMSE values and
    higher r) than MLR WPFs for both cropping seasons. The low MBE errors showed there
    was no systematic under/over estimation for any of the WPFs. However, both ANN
    and MLR exhibited partial over-estimation tendency for plots with yield smaller
    than 0.40 Mg ha−1 and 0.60 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively.
    All WPFs showed a slightly better performance in 2014 in comparison with 2013
    considering the correlation coefficient and normal RMSE (i.e. RMSE divided by
    range of yield variation) as the criteria. For instance, ANN WPF had normal RMSE
    equal to 14% and 13% and r equal to 0.65 and 0.78 for 2013 and 2014 lint yield
    data, respectively. Table 3. The performance results (r = correlation coefficient,

    regression), that were used in this study to produce water production functions
    (WPF) and predict cotton lint yields. 3.3. Irrigation and zoning scenarios Fig.
    7 (panels a and b) shows the cotton lint yield predicted by k-NN WPF for different
    irrigation scenarios (i.e. uniform irrigation and irrigating each cell individually
    at optimum level) over the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons. Yield was lower in
    2013 than in 2014 for all irrigation levels. The predicted yield was slightly
    different between pivots, yet followed the same general trend across irrigation
    levels. We attribute this to differences in soil spatial distribution underneath
    the pivots. Given uniform irrigation scenarios, in 2013 the highest predicted
    yield was (for 110 mm seasonal IW) 1.09 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 and 0.98 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1
    for the east and west pivots, respectively. In 2013 as IW increased, there was
    a small overall increase in yield up to the maximum level (i.e. IW = 110 mm) but
    it declined after that for higher IW amounts. If each cell was irrigated at optimum
    level, yield was improved to 1.19 ± 0.05 Mg ha−1 and 1.11 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 underneath
    east and west pivots, respectively. In 2014, there were two peaks at 20 and 120
    mm IWs. There was a sharp increase in predicted yield for small irrigation amount
    compared to rainfed situation in 2014, then it decreased and leveled off for most
    of the intermediate irrigation levels and increased again at IW = 120 mm yet continuously
    decreased after that. The highest predicted yields (IW = 20 mm) were 1.52 ± 0.12
    Mg ha−1 and 1.62 ± 0.12 Mg ha−1, underneath the east and west pivots, respectively.
    When yield in each cell was optimized with a distinct level of IW, the predicted
    yield increased to 1.71 ± 0.10 Mg ha−1 and 1.80 ± 0.09 Mg ha−1 underneath the
    east and west pivots, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (422KB)

    in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons was produced using site-specific k-NN (k-nearest
    neighbor) water production functions (WPF) in relation to multiple uniform and
    variable rate irrigation (VRI) scenarios for 2 center pivots in a 73 ha field
    in west Tennessee. Panels a and b: the dash lines with circles and triangles represent
    predicted yield under uniform irrigation for the east and west pivots, respectively.
    Individual circles and triangles above the line represent estimated yield for
    cell-based VRI scenario. Panels c and d: The dash lines with circles and triangles
    represent predicted yield for sector control VRI for the east and west pivots,
    respectively. Bars are associated with right-side y axis and represent average
    irrigation applied by each pivot. Fig. 7 (panels c and d) depicts the average
    irrigation and yield for optimum arrangement of the sectors. Yield was always
    higher in 2014 than in 2013. In both years there was a constant increase in yield
    by adding to the number of sectors, yet the highest boost occurred when pivot
    area was divided into two sectors. The yield was higher under the east pivot than
    under west pivot in 2013, but the opposite was true in 2014. In 2013, as number
    of zones increased, there was a slight reduction in optimum level of IW underneath
    the west pivot, but it remained almost constant across a different number of zones
    for the east pivot. In 2014, as the number of zones increased, higher IW was predicted
    to get the optimum yield underneath west pivot and same was true under the east
    pivot but less pronounced. Compared to rainfed agriculture, for the east pivot,
    the best uniform supplemental irrigation strategy was predicted to boost the yield
    up to 41% and 47% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. Sector control
    VRI added about 4% to the expected yield in both years. For the west pivot, compared
    to rainfed, the best uniform supplemental irrigation scenario improved the yield
    as much as 25% and 40% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. The sector
    control VRI added 4% in 2013 and 7% in 2014 to the expected yield boost. Fig.
    8 illustrates the thematic yield maps predicted by k-NN WPFs for the rainfed condition
    along with multiple irrigation strategies (i.e. best uniform irrigation, cutting
    4 sectors, and irrigating each cell individually at optimum level) for the both
    pivots and cropping seasons. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) suggested four sectors as
    optimum to minimize soil spatial variation underneath the pivots. To compare the
    zoning results across the studies, we selected 4 sectors here too. By visual assessment
    of the yield maps, the biggest change occurred from rainfed to uniform irrigation
    followed by the change from sector control VRI to irrigating each cell individually.
    In 2014, the spatial yield pattern for the rainfed scenario is similar to soil
    texture maps and high resolution soil available water maps for the field of study
    illustrated and modeled by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). They showed that coarse-textured
    regions with low available water content were located in the middle, eastern and
    southwestern parts of the eastern pivot as well as in northern and northwestern
    of the western pivot. In 2013, however, it is hard to match the yield pattern
    for the rainfed scenario against soil spatial distribution, yet yield patterns
    under uniform irrigation were somewhat similar to spatial pattern of soil physical
    and hydraulic properties within the effective root zone. For both pivots and cropping
    seasons, yield predicted under sector control VRI scenario exhibited lower minimum
    but higher maximum than that for the corresponding uniform irrigation maps. Moving
    from sector control VRI into the hypothetical scenario of irrigating each 25 m2
    cell individually, yield improvement mostly occurred for cells with low expected
    yield. In other words, the maximum predicted yield remained almost unchanged but
    minimum predicted yield was substantially improved. Download : Download high-res

    16 different irrigation scenarios. On the lower right part of each map the designation
    13-W-R for example is 13 for the 2013 cropping season, W for the west center pivot,
    and R for rainfed fields. The columns are ordered by irrigation status for each
    pivot as uniform irrigation (U), sector control pie shape VRI (P), and individual
    cell (M). Fig. 9 shows the spatial arrangement of the optimum sectors from this
    study and the previous study by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). In this study, k-NN
    WPF along with ILP optimization were used to find optimum zones when the objective
    was to maximize cotton lint yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) found the best spatial
    arrangement of sector zones using ILP optimization and soil related attributes
    without considering the irrigation-yield relationships. They used soil available
    water content, soil ECa, yield data and Landsat 8 panchromatic satellite data
    when the objective was to minimize soil spatial variation within each zone. The
    spatial arrangement of optimum pie shape sectors to maximize lint yield changed
    from 2013 to 2014 for the both pivots. The 2013 zones for the east pivot were
    somewhat similar to zones by AWC and ECa data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study.
    In 2014 for the east pivot, three sectors were located on the coarse-textured
    region with low soil available water content, while a big sector covered rest
    of the pivot. There were some similarities between 2014 zones for the west pivot
    and zoning by ECa and AWC data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. In 2013, sectors
    in northern part of the west pivot were somewhat similar to sectors from AWC data
    from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. The spatial arrangement of optimum zones
    using yield data (by Haghverdi et al., 2015b) was different than the configuration
    of zones in our study. Download : Download high-res image (613KB) Download : Download

    production functions The k-NN performed better than MLR and ANN in predicting
    cotton yield. It seems even dividing the field into more homogenous regions did
    not reduce the complexity enough to get the same level of accuracy by MLR WPFs
    as achieved by k-NN WPF. The ANN WPF showed a better performance than MLR, although
    we used the entire data set to train the ANN models. This is in line with the
    results reported by Haghverdi et al., 2014b, Drummond et al., 2003 who found ANN
    a better option than MLR models to predict yield. However, ANN in our study was
    not able to provide the same level of performance as k-NN WPF, meaning ANN could
    not entirely handle the huge amount of data and complex relationships between
    input and outputs. The efficiency of k-NN in our study is in line with the promising
    results reported in the literature: to model soil hydraulic properties (e.g. Nemes
    et al., 2006, Haghverdi et al., 2015a), to estimate cultivar coefficient of crop
    models (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2009) and for prediction of daily weather data
    (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2008). In general, linear techniques are not suitable
    to model the spatial variability of crop yields (Sudduth et al., 1996), yet the
    k-NN WPF designed in our study performed satisfactory because it acts as a smart
    search engine to selects only a few similar data points for prediction. This approach
    helps k-NN WPF to take advantage of numerous data points (cells) provided by the
    yield monitoring systems without necessarily having a good approximation of the
    non-linear relationships between inputs and yield for all cells across the field
    of study. The k-NN WPF makes use of similarities to distinguish patterns instead
    of fitting coefficients and this approach could be favorable whenever the form
    of relationships between input and output of a system is not known in advance
    (Nemes et al., 2006). One should note that, k-NN WPF introduced in this study
    only provides a pseudo-continuous prediction of yield over a range of applied
    irrigation. In other words, it gives trustable results only in the neighborhood
    of measured IWs. Hence, its application for continuous prediction of yield-water
    relationship is only suggested if IW is applied at multiple levels such that the
    available data sufficiently cover the desired prediction range. We had substantial
    spatial variation of soil properties in the study field. Long-term analysis of
    yield maps for different crops revealed that the spatial variability of soil attributes
    can seriously impact crop yields (Haghverdi, 2015). Guo et al. (2012) tried to
    mathematically explain the spatial and temporal variation of cotton yield on the
    Southern High Plains of Texas by means of ECa, soil brightness, and topography
    data. They observed that these attributes together could explain up to 70.1% of
    the variability in cotton yield. Guo et al. (2012) mentioned soil texture as one
    of the greatest factor affecting cotton yield. They found a relatively stable
    spatial pattern of yield over time although yield and soil properties had stronger
    relationship in dry years than wet seasons. The results of this study showed a
    considerable impact of the spatial and temporal pattern of rainfall pattern on
    the spatial distribution of cotton yield. We realized that rainfall pattern can
    mask/change the effect of supplemental irrigation practices on yield. Receiving
    high amounts of rainfall with random temporal patterns over growing seasons is
    expected in western TN. There were 712 mm and 633 mm of rainfall over the 2013
    and 2014 growing seasons, respectively. The total seasonally applied irrigation
    water by the farmer for the east and west pivots was 133-mm and 93 mm in 2013
    and 65 mm and 50 mm in 2014, respectively. This meant that irrigation was less
    than 20% of precipitation in 2013 and less than 10% of precipitation in 2014.
    Wong and Asseng (2006) introduced interactions of seasonal rainfall, plant available
    soil water storage capacity, and N fertilizer applications as dominant factors
    causing spatiotemporal wheat yield variation. In 2013, wet soil and colder temperatures
    forced the farmer to postpone planting cotton. Furthermore, heavy rainfall throughout
    the growing season caused excessive vegetative growth and larger number of bolls
    on soils with higher available water content. We believe that planting delay caused
    an inability in cotton to accumulate adequate heat-units and delayed its maturity
    leading to a reduction in yield, especially over soils with higher water holding
    capacity, where there was not enough time for all of the bolls to open by harvesting
    time. This trend affected the yield response to irrigation which in turn caused
    slightly higher error in corresponding WPFs. Bajwa and Vories (2007) demonstrated
    that excessive irrigation in wet weather conditions decreased cotton lint yield
    in Arkansas. That is why the quantity of optimum ET required to maximize cotton
    lint yield is directly proportional to length of cropping seasons; in longer seasons,
    higher irrigation is expected to produce the highest cotton lint yield (Orgaz
    et al., 1992). The performance of site-specific WPFs may differ under different
    conditions, hence they should be tested for different crops, climatic conditions
    and the spatial variation of soils. All attributes affecting crop available water
    need to be considered for deriving site-specific WPFs. For instance, there are
    some studies reporting the positive correlation of yield with topographic attributes
    (e.g. Andales et al., 2007, Green et al., 2007). The field of study was fairly
    flat, thus we assume that coarse resolution topography and slope have negligible
    influence on cotton lint yield. However, if topography and slope impact the spatial
    distribution of water within a field they should be considered in the development
    of site-specific WPFs. 4.2. Zoning and irrigation strategies The majority of the
    farmers in west Tennessee practice uniform irrigation despite spatial variability
    in soil properties that exists in their fields. Site-specific WPFs can help them
    to move towards optimum uniform irrigation strategies for different crops and
    climatic condition. Rainfall was abundant over the course of this experiment,
    but some dry periods did occur and supplemental irrigation was crucial to fulfilling
    ET demand, especially for coarse soils with lower AWC. Thus, there was a positive
    cotton lint yield response to irrigation predicted by the use of k-NN WPFs under
    both center pivots when compared to rainfed yields. In 2013, delayed planting
    affected heat unit accumulation/distribution and maturity which in turn suppressed
    the yield across the field, while yield reduction in soils with higher available
    water was more pronounced. This was shown in WPFs prediction as a general slight
    increase in yield as IW increased. Adding more water reduced the drought stress
    for soils with lower AWC but increased overall yield until a peak point. Analysis
    of yield data showed that even for coarse-textured soils with low WHC, cotton
    yield reduction occurred due to over irrigation. That is why, a yield reduction
    was predicted by k-NN-WPF for IWs of more than 120 mm. In 2014, the overall yield-irrigation
    relationship across the field was somewhat different than that for 2013, yet closer
    to what we expected to see in most of the years. As in 2013, there was a peak
    at a high irrigation level (IW = 110 mm) which is attributed to the optimum level
    of IW for soil with lower AWC. Unlike 2013, however, in 2014 there was also a
    second peak for lower IWs which turned out to be the best uniform cotton irrigation
    strategy according to k-NN WPF predictions. This was recognized as the point of
    optimum IW level for soils with higher AWC suggesting that in a more typical year
    like 2014 (a year without delayed planting), lower irrigation for fine-textured
    soils produced higher yields that compensated for the yield reduction over water-stressed
    coarse-textured soils in different regions of the field. More years of data are
    needed to confirm this as a long-term trend. Given the spatial variability of
    soil attributes in the field, west Tennessee farmers are likely to depart from
    uniform irrigation scenarios to some type of VRI. Sector control VRI is an easier
    and less expensive irrigation strategy for those who possess center pivot irrigation
    systems. As previously stated, zone delineation for irrigation management is complex.
    Site-specific WPFs could be beneficial to support such conversion from uniform
    to sector control VRI systems, because they are useful for delineating crop-specific
    irrigation zones and for identifying the optimum irrigation strategy for each
    sector. A field is likely to have sectors with variation in soil attributes where
    real time irrigation scheduling becomes challenging. The site-specific WPFs would
    provide insights into the right soil to follow within each section to maximize
    yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) focused on soil properties to delineate irrigation
    management zones. We added crop yields to the optimization process by using site-specific
    WPFs. While there were some similarities between zones in this study and zones
    developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b), the differences were more substantial both
    between years and methods. To a great extent, this difference reflected the inherent
    spatiotemporal variation associated with crop growth and yield which in turn governed
    the spatial configuration of optimum crop-based zones. According to Basso et al.
    (2009), bias in the evaluation of homogenous management zones may occur due to
    the impact of weather patterns on both crop growth and the interactions with soil
    types. We showed that the year-to-year temporal variation in rainfall patterns
    influences cotton yield-irrigation-soil relationships in west Tennessee. Farmer
    irrigation management techniques also influence the crop-based zoning result,
    because for each cropping season, the k-NN WPF only combines the available observations
    to make a new predication in that year. Therefore, it is important to look at
    the zoning system in this study as an iterative process which helps farmers to
    improve their irrigation decisions. The more a farmer improves their irrigation
    management, the better k-NN WPF predictions reflect a field’s yield potential.
    Consequently, longer experimentation is needed to see how our crop-based zoning
    strategy works across years and how different it would be from the soil-based
    zoning strategies introduced by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). Based on the k-NN WPF
    predictions, irrigating each cell individually at optimum levels would have caused
    a moderate increase in yield in 2014 and a slight increase in 2013 compared to
    the best uniform irrigation strategy. In reality, this provided a cap for the
    potential yield boost expected from a site-specific VRI. Even in 2014, the expected
    boost in yield may not be high enough to compensate for the infrastructure and
    management expenses needed to convert to a VRI system. Obviously, the benefits
    of sector control and zone control VRIs is both site and crop specific and depends
    on a variety of factors including the magnitude of soil spatial heterogeneity
    throughout the field, weather conditions, and the efficiency of real time irrigation
    scheduling (Daccache et al., 2015). 5. Conclusion Design-based statistics were
    dominant for much of the last century when contemporary constraints on data collection
    and processing prevented on-farm experimentation (Pringle et al., 2010). Nowadays,
    however, most of the farmers in US are collecting numerous site-specific data
    useful for on-site experimentation. However, the available data often have different
    spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, the observations may be spatially
    and temporally autocorrelated while also carrying inherent error and uncertainties.
    Therefore, in order to convert these data to useful information, robust algorithms
    and models are needed. We designed and evaluated site-specific WPFs. The results
    confirmed that site-specific WPFs may be powerful after-the-fact tools that are
    used by farmers to enhance future site-specific irrigation management. We used
    site-specific WPFs to evaluate different irrigation and zoning strategies. Currently,
    implementation and management of VRI systems demands high capital costs (Evans
    et al., 2013), hence it is crucial to assess the potential yield gain of zone
    control VRI over uniform and sector control VRI scenarios for each crop and a
    specific site. Our results showed that crop-based zoning using WPFs produces different
    zones based on the annual climatic conditions and farmer management practices.
    We believe a long-term data record is required that will capture different climatic
    and irrigation management scenarios that lead to stable zones. A practical option
    is to start with soil-based zoning for sector control VRI systems as proposed
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and then use site-specific k-NN-WPF to improve both
    zoning and within zone irrigation decisions in an iterative process. For the study
    site and over the course of the experiment, the expected yield improvement by
    a zone control VRI system was not substantially higher than that of sector control
    VRI. Note that results will probably differ under drier conditions when greater
    yields are likely to occur under a zone control VRI compared to a sector control
    VRI. Consider that there are fundamental differences in characteristics and applications
    of the traditional CWPF/WPF and proposed site-specific WPFs in this study. Classical
    PFs are mostly derived from multiyear experiments that use research plots at different
    locations. The main goal of classical PFs is to eventually apply the established
    functions for similar places and/or for the same place in the future. Contrary
    to these studies, the site-specific WPFs that we propose are not designed to be
    used in other fields or even on the same field in different years. These WPFs
    may provide insight, but are not ready for real-time VRI scheduling and addressing
    related concerns such as runoff and deep percolation issues. The site-specific
    WPFs developed here are after-the-fact tools to simulate different irrigation
    scenarios for a given-field over a specific cropping season. They are tools to
    help farmers to monitor their irrigation management and provide a unique opportunity
    that has only become possible due to recent advances and the spread of precision
    farming equipment such as yield monitors and VRI systems. Acknowledgments This

    related to agriculture fertilizer and pesticide management (De Vlaming et al.,
    2004; Goodson et al., 2006; Schroeder et al., 2002). Site-specific variable rate
    application of agricultural inputs (e.g., water, fertilizer, and pesticide) has

    region of southern California are still unclear. The first steps toward the adoption
    of variable rate technologies are to find the most relevant information that can

    \ \nAbstract: The present article contains a study about utilizing the Digital\
    \ \nTwins concept in the field of contemporary agricultural production. Through\
    \ \nthis study, an exemplary architecture has been developed regarding the \n\
    conversion of a conventional greenhouse to a digital greenhouse. A digital \n\
    greenhouse modus operandi features a great number of advantages compared \nwith\
    \ the traditional workflow in a conventional greenhouse. The purpose of \nthe\
    \ work is to propose tools for assisting the possible reduction of the \nconsumption\
    \ of the used resources for the crops. This requires the application \nof automation\
    \ of tools for cultivation such as Controlled Environment \nAgriculture (CEA).\
    \ The article shows that the Digital Twins concept can \nimmensely contribute\
    \ towards controlling the agricultural environment and \nat the same time improve\
    \ performance and quality while reducing the \nconsumption of resources for a\
    \ variety of crops. The proposed workflow \nstarts by identifying the parameters\
    \ that need to be taken into account and \nfinally proposes several cyber and\
    \ physical tools for setting up a Digital Twin \nfor the case of a greenhouse.\
    \ The objective of this study was the development \nof a DT architecture that\
    \ would be able to optimize productivity in the context \nof CEA applications.\
    \ \n \nKeywords: Digital Twin, Cyber-Physical Systems, Simulation, Smart \nAgriculture,\
    \ Greenhouse, 4th Industrial Revolution \n \nIntroduction  \nCurrently, there\
    \ is a need to increase productivity and \nreduce the resources being consumed.\
    \ According to the \ndata and statistics, it is estimated that by 2050 the world\
    \ \npopulation will reach over 9.6 billion people. Today the \npopulation is estimated\
    \ at 7.9 billion according to the \nUN's average estimate. Agricultural production\
    \ must \nincrease food production compared to today to ensure the \nnutrition\
    \ demands of this population are met. However, \nthere are many obstacles to this\
    \ effort. Thus, arises the \nneed for applying new, state-of-the-art innovative\
    \ \ntechnologies in agricultural production systems. In this \ncontext, Digital\
    \ Twin (DT) technology comes to the \nforefront. DTs in agriculture can offer\
    \ productivity \noptimization by balancing production and resource \nconsumption\
    \ by using their prediction/forecasting ability. \nThis will be achieved through\
    \ the construction of a Digital \nTwin \narchitecture \nfor \nControlled \nEnvironment\
    \ \nAgriculture (CEA) which will optimize the following \ncrucial elements depicted\
    \ in Fig. 1. \nAccording to Asseng and Cowan calculations \n(Asseng et al., 2020;\
    \ Cowan et al., 2022), the wheat \nharvest using CEA is about 700±40 and 1940±230\
    \ \ntons/hectare/year \nwhereas \nit \nwas \nonly \n3.2 \ntons/hectare/year with\
    \ traditional open field harvest. In \naddition, according to Nicole's finding\
    \ (Nicole et al., \n2016), lettuce quality is improved by growing it in plant\
    \ \nfactories, and the improvement is observed both in the \ncolor and nutritive\
    \ value offered when consumed. \n \n \n \nFig. 1: Digital Twin architecture for\
    \ Controlled Environment \nAgriculture (CEA) \nAntreas Kantaros and Dimitrios\
    \ Piromalis / American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences 2022, 15 (4):\
    \ 230.238 \nDOI: 10.3844/ajeassp.2022.230.238 \n \n231 \nHowever, the aforementioned\
    \ optimization procedure \nhas certain drawbacks. As the applied automation percentage\
    \ \nincreases, energy consumption increases as well, elevating \noperating costs.\
    \ Graamans et al. (2018), found that by \ncomparing the production of 1 kg of\
    \ lettuce in a greenhouse \nor plant, 70, 111, 182, and 211 kWh are required in\
    \ \ngreenhouses and 247 kWh in plants in the Netherlands, while \nin the United\
    \ Arab Emirates and Swe-den energy \nconsumption is twice as high as in the Netherlands\
    \ (in terms \nof building total energy). These data came from the study of \n\
    2 greenhouses in Sweden, one with additional artificial \nlighting and the other\
    \ without. Based on the above data, it is \nobvious that the production benefits\
    \ come into conflict with \nthe energy consumption that creates a need for optimized\
    \ \nchoices in applying CEA systems. This is where Digital \nTwin technology can\
    \ offer a potential solution. According to \nKritzinger et al. (2018); Negri et\
    \ al. (2017), DT \"utilizes \nsensible data, mathematical models and real-time\
    \ data \nprocessing to predict and optimize physical asset behavior in \neach\
    \ phase of the life cycle, in real-time.\" \nDigital Twins \nDigital twins are\
    \ virtual representations of real-time \ndata on an object or system using simulations,\
    \ engineer \nlearning, and logical reasoning to aid in decision-making \n(Piromalis\
    \ and Kantaros, 2022; Kantaros et al., 2021; \nTsaramirsis et al., 2022; Singh\
    \ et al., 2021). The operation \nof the Digital Twin is achieved through the precise\
    \ \nrepresentation of a physical object through the designed \nvirtual model.\
    \ The physical twin, for example, will \ncontain some media (e.g., sensors) for\
    \ data collection. \nThen the data are transferred to a corresponding \nprocessing\
    \ system to be applied to the digital twin. This is \nused for the subsequent\
    \ data in processing so that it is \npossible to study problems and performance\
    \ issues to \nimprove the physical object or system. Mainly the data are \ncollected\
    \ to re-apply the corresponding actions to be done \non the original physical\
    \ object. The application of Digital \nTwins in production enables the user to\
    \ decrease the \ndowntime of the equipment and at the same time increase \nproductivity\
    \ (Tao et al., 2019; Parrott and Warshaw, \n2017; Erol et al., 2020; Barricelli\
    \ et al., 2019; Liu et al., \n2021; He and Bai, 2021). \nAt the highest level,\
    \ a digital twin is an architectural \ncompilation powered by a combination of\
    \ cutting-edge \ntechnologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), Cloud \nComputing,\
    \ Edge Computing, Fog Computing, Artificial \nIntelligence, Robotics, Machine\
    \ Learning, and Big Data \nAnalytics. A Digital Twin is designed by collecting\
    \ data and \ncreating computational models for testing. This may include \nan\
    \ interface between the digital model and a real physical \nobject for sending\
    \ and receiving real-time feedback and data. \nBy combining all the necessary\
    \ digital technologies in a \ncoherent platform, a virtual representation of agricultural\
    \ \nproduction will be created consisting of natural elements, \nprocesses, systems,\
    \ resources, etc., (Lu et al., 2020; \nGrieves, 2016; Batty, 2018; Markets and\
    \ Markets, 2020; \nTao et al., 2019). \nSimulation Applications for Agriculture\
    \ \nIn agricultural production, the fundamental resources \nthat determine crop\
    \ production are water, nitrogen, \nenergy, and crop disease-tackling measures.\
    \ In addition, \ndata such as weather, soil characteristics, field hydrology,\
    \ \ncrop characteristics, sowing, and other factors should also \nbe taken into\
    \ account. For the compilation of a Digital Twin \nin agriculture and specifically\
    \ for a greenhouse, simulation \napplications are needed for the digital display\
    \ of the \ngreenhouse. Simulation applications use tailored models for \nbetter\
    \ management of specific physical object parameters to \nmake the best possible\
    \ production decisions. \nIn this context, applications from the literature were\
    \ \nsought that will offer improvement in the way crops are \nmanaged and in monitoring\
    \ the condition of crops, and for \nthe reduction of crop treatments. A crucial\
    \ factor that \nconcerns all growers is the consumption of resources. The \nconsumption\
    \ of resources used for plant production is high \nwater consumption, heating,\
    \ and ventilation. The goal of \ngrowers is to reduce this consumption as much\
    \ as possible. \nTable 1 depicts some suggested applications/systems \nfor the\
    \ Digital Twin Greenhouse that can help manage \nenergy, water, and crop health.\
    \  \nEnergy Plus \nEnergy Plus is a simulation application for engineers, \narchitects,\
    \ and researchers designed to model energy i.e., \nenergy such as heating, cooling,\
    \ ventilation, lighting, and \npower receivers during loading, and also model\
    \ the use of \nwater. Energy Plus applies detailed building physics to the \n\
    transfer of air, moisture, and heat, including radiation transfer \nand heat (convection\
    \ and conduction) transfer separately to \nsupport the modeling of radiation systems\
    \ and the calculation \nof thermal comfort measurements. It calculates light,\
    \ shading, \nand visual comfort measurements. Flexible configuration \nis supported\
    \ at the level of HVAC system components, \ninstallation cooling, and heating\
    \ as well as including a \nlarge set of HVAC component models and installations.\
    \ It \nsimulates hourly time steps to quickly manipulate system \ndynamics and\

    \ \n \n232 \nTRNSYS \nTRNSYS offers a flexible graphical-based software \nenvironment,\
    \ used to simulate the behavior of transient \nsystems. It offers, like other\
    \ similar systems, evaluation of \nthe efficiency of thermal and electrical systems,\
    \ but also can \nbe used for modeling other dynamic systems, such as the \nflow\
    \ circulation or biological processes. TRNSYS consists \nof two parts. The first\
    \ is a Camera (called a kernel) that reads \nand processes the input file, repeatedly\
    \ solves the system, \ndetermines convergence, and plots the system variables.\
    \ The \nkernel also provides utilities that (among other things) \ndetermine the\
    \ thermophysical properties, invert arrays, \nperform linear regressions and interrupt\
    \ external data files. \nThe second part of TRNSYS is an extensive data library,\
    \ \nwhich models the performance of one part of the system. \nThe application\
    \ library offers approximately 150 models \nranging from pumps to multi-zone buildings,\
    \ wind \nturbines to electrolytes, weather data processors to \neconomical routines,\
    \ and basic HVAC equipment to \nemerging cutting-edge technologies (TRNSYS, 2022).\
    \ \nDSSAT (Decision Support System for \nAgrotechnology Transfer) \nThe Rural\
    \ Technology Transfer Decision Support \nSystem (DSSAT) is an application that\
    \ offers crop \nsimulation models and tools for their more efficient use. The\
    \ \ntools offer database management for soil, weather, crop \nmanagement, experimental\
    \ data, utilities, and application \nprograms. Application models simulate growth\
    \ and yield as \na function of soil-plant-atmosphere dynamics. Includes farm \n\
    management and accuracy, regional assessments of the \nimpact of climate variability\
    \ and climate change, genetic \nmodeling and reproduction selection, water use,\
    \ greenhouse \ngas emissions, and long-term viability through soil organic \n\
    carbon and nitrogen balances. Crop models require daily \nweather data, soil surface,\
    \ and profile information, and \ndetailed crop management as data. At the end\
    \ of each day, \nthe water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon balances of the \n\
    plants and the soil are updated, as well as the stage of \ngermination and reproductive\
    \ development of the crop. For \napplications, DSSAT combines crop, soil, and\
    \ weather \ndatabases with crop models and implementation programs \nto simulate\
    \ multiannual results of crop management \nstrategies (DSSAT, 2022). \nCropX \n\
    CropX application is a system that offers automation and \ncrop management with\
    \ advanced analysis technologies for \nagriculture. The system offers management\
    \ of irrigation, and \nfertilization with accurate forecasts, offering the best\
    \ possible \nresult. It processes data from the soil for an even better \npicture\
    \ of the crop and the atmosphere that surrounds the \ncrop. Thus, the system will\
    \ be able to adapt the strategies of \noptimal cultivation. It then offers an\
    \ adapted variable rate \nirrigation system based on changing soil and weather\
    \ \nconditions. It constantly adapts the specific needs of the crop \nto its development\
    \ stage (CropX, 2022). \nClimate Field View \nThe Climate Field View application\
    \ helps in making \ndecisions from crop data to maximize the yield of each \n\
    cultivated acre. The system collects, stores, and visualizes \ncritical data.\
    \ In this way, it will be possible to monitor and \nmeasure the decisions made\
    \ regarding the cultivation to \nimprove the yield and maximize the profit (Climate\
    \ Field \nView, 2022). \nAPSIM \nThe \nAgricultural \nProduction \nSystems \n\
    Simulator \n(APSIM) is internationally recognized as an extremely \nadvanced platform\
    \ for modeling and simulation of systems \ncontaining a platform that enables\
    \ the simulation of systems \nwith a variety of plant, animal, soil, climate,\
    \ and management \ninteractions. APSIM is constantly evolving, with new features\
    \ \nbeing added to APSIM Next Generation. Its development and \nmaintenance are\
    \ based on strict standards of software science \nand engineering (APSIM, 2022).\
    \ \nCropSyst \nCropSyst is a multi-year multi-crop crop simulation \nmodel developed\
    \ by a team at the Department of Biological \nSystems Engineering at Washington\
    \ State University. The \nmodel is used to study the impact of pruning system\
    \ \nmanagement on productivity (Stöckle et al., 2003). \nDigital Twin Architecture\
    \ Design and Compilation \nfor a Greenhouse \nDigital Twin's architecture development\
    \ work to \noptimize productivity is conducted through the development \nof a\
    \ controlled greenhouse environment. A greenhouse is an \nenclosed space, covered\
    \ with a permeable (transparent or \nopaque) material, which allows sunlight to\
    \ enter to heat the \ngreenhouse during the day. In general, a greenhouse is \n\
    necessary for the modification of climatic conditions internally \nin contrast\
    \ to the external environment, to plant plants, and \nproduction of plant products\
    \ regardless of the external \nclimatic conditions. In case of an unwanted temperature\
    \ rise, \nventilation is necessary, while for cold nights or days, a \nheating\
    \ system is necessary to maintain the desired \ntemperature for plant growth (Howard\
    \ et al., 2021;         \nVerdouw et al., 2021; Pylianidis et al., 2021; Tekinerdogan\
    \ \nand Verdouw, 2020; Monteiro et al., 2018; Howard et al., \n2020a; Mukhtar\
    \ et al., 2022; Borowski, 2021; Howard et al., \n2020b; Yang et al., 2022). The\
    \ necessary prerequisites for the \ncreation of a greenhouse are depicted in Fig.\
    \ 2. \nThe additional equipment required consists of the \nautomation infrastructure\
    \ elements of the greenhouse which \nAntreas Kantaros and Dimitrios Piromalis\

    \ \nDOI: 10.3844/ajeassp.2022.230.238 \n \n233 \ninclude systems of heating, ventilation,\
    \ humidity, automatic \ncontrol of the climatic conditions, and irrigation. \n\
    Construction of DT \nFor the proper compilation of the architecture for \ncreating\
    \ a greenhouse DT, the following elements \ndepicted in Fig. 3 must be included.\
    \ \nIn this context, Chaux's methodology based on virtual \nsimulation technology\
    \ is used for indicative development \nof the DT greenhouse architecture (Chaux\
    \ et al., 2021; \nTraoré, 2021). It proposes a strategy to modernize production\
    \ \nwith DT systems including the following elements depicted \nin Table 2. According\
    \ to Chaux’s methodology, ’The data \nnecessary for the optimization must be available\
    \ in the \ncloud and the user must download them in his/her local \ndevice. The\
    \ optimization occurs in the local device and \nthe optimal crop treatment and\
    \ climate control strategy \nare communicated to the controller for its implementation\
    \ \nthrough a gateway (Chaux et al., 2021). \nFramework. \nThis stage includes\
    \ the design of subsequent stages \nin which the developing architecture will\
    \ operate with \nspecific functions' definitions. This categorization \nincludes\
    \ the following parts with corresponding \nfunctions, i.e.: \n \n1. Greenhouse\
    \ \n \nA natural element that needs the help of DT to \noptimize production and\
    \ where after the training the \nselected strategies will be verified. \n \n2.\
    \ Controller \n \nIt is a set of measuring instrument layers, actuators, \nsensors,\
    \ monitors, and controllers for the greenhouse. \nWhich are important for the\
    \ collection of data to be used \nin DT. Then the controller exchanges data with\
    \ the \nnetwork portal to make the corresponding appropriate \ndecisions for the\
    \ crop. \n \n3. Portal \n \nIt is the software that will be used for the connection\
    \ \nbetween different network environments, i.e., at work, it \nis the connection\
    \ between the physical and digital \ncomponents. Its function is to transfer data\
    \ to storage for \nlater use. \n \n4. Storage \n \nThe data used by the simulation\
    \ (current and \nhistorical) requires space to be stored as well as for \ndecisions\
    \ made. So that the data can be processed at any \ntime and there is a record\
    \ of successful decisions to be used \nin the physical element. It is a very important\
    \ part of DT tests. \n \n5. Intelligence Layer \n \nThe Intelligence Layer organizes\
    \ and provides smart \nservices. It is the main element used to direct the service.\
    \ \nIt is responsible for the evaluation and then the selection \nof the best\

    \ sequence \n \nPhysical-Cyber Interface \nThe interaction of the cyber-physical\
    \ and physical \nsystem is an intelligent system, is a computer system \nthrough\
    \ which the mechanism developed by computer-\nbased algorithms is applied. Physical\
    \ data is collected and \ncomputer components are integrated to operate a process\
    \ \nsafely and efficiently. CPS grasps the majority of \nbeneficial elements that\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT) can \noffer, in its basic architecture. Thus, CPS\
    \ can achieve a \nhigh combination and coordination between physical and \ncomputational\
    \ components. \nAfter defining the workflow, its operation consists of \nthe following:\
    \ \n \n• \nThe controller-level data received is transmitted \nthrough the network\
    \ gateway continuously to the \nstorage level \n• \nIn case of success of the\
    \ strategic optimization, the \ncorresponding data is sent to the local device,\
    \ i.e., to \nthe controller, so that the stream of optimization tasks \ncan be\
    \ applied at the level of intelligence \n \nImplementation \nIn this stage, all\
    \ the aforementioned steps are \nimplemented, including the actual coding compilation\
    \ and its \napplication i.e., in the Arduino microcontroller and a \nplatform\
    \ such as Node-RED (Node-RED, 2022). Node-RED \nis a programming tool for combining\
    \ hardware devices, APIs \n(Application Programming Interface), and online services\
    \ \nfor such purposes. In this context, it provides a browser-\nbased editor that\
    \ enables the simultaneous wiring of program \nflows using a wide range of nodes\
    \ in the offered palette that \ncan be deployed in a single click. \nConclusion\
    \ \nAgricultural production systems should innovate \ntowards increasing production\
    \ while utilizing fewer \nresources to assure food security. Digital twins and\
    \ \ncontrolled environment agriculture may prove to be \nessential mechanisms\
    \ for maximizing output and ensuring \nthe world's food security.  \nThe present\
    \ work presents a step-by-step approach to the \ndevelopment of architecture regarding\
    \ a Digital Twin-\nassisted controlled greenhouse. The goal was achieved by \n\
    creating an architecture that makes use of simulation \nsoftware (such as DTs)\
    \ and allows for the optimization of \nclimate control techniques connected to\
    \ crop microclimate \ncontrol. The proposed tools and actions show that it is\
    \ \npossible to implement such a practice in an already existing \ngreenhouse.\
    \ Achieving a controlled environment in \nagriculture with the help of Digital\
    \ Twins can be considered \nan essential tool to achieve productivity optimization\
    \ to \nreduce the consumption of resources as well as to immensely \ncontribute\
    \ towards the seamless food supply of the planet \n(Symeonaki et al., 2021a; 2021b;\
    \ 2019a,b; Aversa et al., \n2016a,b; Petrescu and Petrescu, 2019; Petrescu et\
    \ al., 2017). \nSuch practices propose a new innovative approach for \nvertical\
    \ integration and optimization of greenhouse \nprocesses to achieve elevated energy\
    \ efficiency and \nproduction outputs without compromising the quality of \nthe\
    \ offered products or sustainability. In this context, the \ndeveloped Digital\
    \ Twins will be able to forecast how the \nphysical twin will perform under constantly\
    \ changing \noperational conditions.  \nFuture work can be identified as the proposed\
    \ \narchitecture's constant evolution due to the introduction of \nnew software\
    \ and hardware tools that will allow swifter \ndevelopment and integration of\
    \ such practices. In this \ncontext, to confirm the capacity of the suggested\
    \ DT \narchitecture to maximize productivity, a case study must be \nimplemented\
    \ to validate the productivity increase. \nAntreas Kantaros and Dimitrios Piromalis\

    Location: Aarhus, Denmark SECTION I. Introduction The increasing shortage of water
    resources, due to the impact of climate and land use changes, is threatening the
    agricultural sector that needs to implement more efficient water use strategies
    [1] . Novel methods and creative technologies to increase crop water productivity
    are urgently claimed through a wise choice of irrigation systems and more sagacious
    water management (e.g., deficit irrigation). Technology-based solutions are envisaged
    to finely determine crop water requirements and to schedule irrigation, with the
    aim of achieving sustainable production targets. Indeed, regardless of the strategy
    engaged, the advantages of irrigation scheduling (e.g., planning watering rotation
    to minimize stress and maximize yield), can be reached only by supplying the exact
    amount of water required by the crop. In recent years, modeling and implementation
    techniques for precision irrigation have demonstrated the potential of saving
    large amount of water. In this sense, a variety of decision support tools have
    been developed and reported in reviews on precision irrigation (see [2] , [3]
    and [4] ). Nevertheless, the issue of integrating remote sensing applications,
    crop monitoring tools, and water requirement modeling in one platform for irrigation
    purposes has more rarely been addressed [5] . However, guiding farmers towards
    more efficient water use is challenging. To properly manage the irrigation requirements
    of crops, several sources of information (plant, soil, atmosphere) need to be
    harmonized and delivered through user-friendly tools. Determining proper crop
    water requirements and choosing farm-specific irrigation scheduling warrant sound
    knowledge of the physiological response of the crop to water deficit and the careful
    assessment of soil moisture and evaporative demand. Recent advances in sensoring,
    monitoring and data transfer have become available to help applying precision
    irrigation and obtaining substantial water saving. Precision irrigation implies
    the collection, the analysis and the sharing of a considerable amount of data,
    through online platforms and decision support systems. To face this challenge,
    Agricolus offers a cloud ecosystem of applications, including forecasting models
    and decision support system for irrigation, applicable to crops and fruit trees
    and capable to operate in different environments. Agricolus ecosystem is designed
    to integrate data and information from various sources: modelling, crop data,
    innovative low-cost sensors, IoT weather data, remotely sensed indices, in order
    to combine research outcomes and the most innovative technologies, aimed at the
    optimization of irrigation practices. To support farmers, agronomists, agri-food
    processors and other agricultural operators in optimizing agronomic practices,
    the most modern technologies of data collection, analysis, and visualization are
    combined in a user-friendly interface. Distributed in-field sensor-based irrigation
    systems offer a potential solution to support site-specific irrigation management
    that allows producers to maximize their productivity, while saving water. Technical
    solutions to improve irrigation uniformity, reduce leaching, and increase water
    supply effectiveness should match the local context. Appropriate solutions need
    to implement upgraded management methods and operation tools [5] . An example
    is represented by the implementation of irrigation scheduling systems based on
    crop water demand. In this sense, the importance of improved tutoring of farmers
    is emphasized. In order to develop cost-effective irrigation strategies, it is
    necessary to monitor combined soil-based and crop-based indicators of crop water
    status at the farm level. The required agricultural information can be derived
    from remotely sensed data. Recent advances in new sensors for remote sensing provide
    many spatial-explicit indices of crop water stress, while integrating satellite
    data with water balance models may bring new tools in order to save water and
    maintain crop yields. As an example, Sentinel-2 and multispectral instruments
    can be useful for developing spatial-explicit vegetation indices and data in order
    to manage irrigation scheduling based on near real-time crop water needs [6] .
    Designing data processing systems and building decision support tools need, therefore,
    to be harmonized in the decision-making process for managing irrigation issues.
    Here we describe details of the design and tools of the Agricolus platform aimed
    at moving from a traditional approach to precision irrigation. SECTION II. Farm
    Management System Agricolus core is a cloud ecosystem of applications for precision
    agriculture. Agricolus’s technology comprises a set of software and hardware components,
    which have been already developed and tested on the market. The core of the farm
    management system allows the user to identify all the farm assets needed to customize
    the decision support system in any specific farming condition. WebGIS tools support
    farmers in localizing the farm centre and the spatial position of the fields (
    Fig. 1 ). For each field, it is possible to associate the crop, defining the crop
    cycle and the related data: variety, type of farming, main field operations. A
    specific section allows the user to describe the irrigation methods adopted and
    the farm irrigation system, defining also its hydraulic characteristics. Fig.
    1 Page of farm centers and field management in Agricolus cloud ecosystem, section
    fields. Show All Farm management systems can be connected with different devices:
    traditional agrometeorological stations and IoT sensor networks. Other than atmospheric
    weather data, also data on soil conditions (temperature, moisture and water tension)
    can be integrated. We choose FIWARE open source cloud platform that allows the
    integration of data from IoT devices and online services in the platform. We adopted
    the reference architecture of smart farm management system powered by FIWARE,
    based on a “system of systems” concept ( Fig. 2 ). The existence of a context
    information management layer breaks the silos of information associated with the
    several vertical smart solutions, information systems and connected devices, enabling
    an overall management of farm processes. Fig. 2 Agricolus Farm Management System
    relies on FIWARE powered Context Information (as described in FIWARE agritech
    system of system architecture). Show All The Orion Context Broker Generic Enabler
    can integrate information from services, sensors and other machines, as well as
    vertical smart solutions and information systems, breaking information silos.
    Data/API access control functions warrant that context data are only accessible
    by parties owning the right privileges. API management and business support functions
    enable auditing of the system and monetization on data access. Using FIWARE-NGSI
    v2 allows to standardize data models for the weather stations data and other sensors
    data; this enables the openness of the platform: when a new interesting sensor
    is delivered to the market it can be used in the FMS creating a specific NGSI
    Context Provider that adapt data models to a standard NGSI model defined in the
    platform. In addition, a weather forecast provider is integrated into the platform
    enabling the users to access the forecasting weather conditions for the coming
    five days. Moreover, the location of each sensor is spatially identified, allowing
    to perform geo-statistical analysis. Soil analysis can be defined in the platform,
    within the surveyed pedological conditions, at the field and sub-field level:
    the user needs to select the texture class or insert a set of soil traits to obtain
    a pedological map of the field. A section is dedicated to collect data from the
    monitoring activities, to record information from the field operations, and to
    document experience from fieldwork assignments. For the irrigation section, it
    is possible to indicate irrigation scheduling and volume, as well as to assess
    the total water consumption. Within the same interface, the user may access the
    remote sensing and the decision support system tools, which is described in the
    following sections: ○ remote sensing - analysis of remotely sensed data from different
    sources (UAV hyperspectral imagery, SAR and optical satellite data from Sentinel)
    to provide indices and maps to evaluate crop productivity (NDVI, GNDVI), water
    stress (NDMI), and other spatial-explicit data, addressing various agronomic issues;
    • ○ decision support system - dashboard for the visualization of the whole framework,
    including the information and elaborations related to field and farm centers with
    a holistic approach. To support farmers and advisers in accomplishing decision
    processes, the dashboard is structured in decisions to be taken with tools able
    to merge the field data, models and remote sensing indices. SECTION III. Remote
    Sensing Technologies for Water Stress Detection Agricolus platform is able to
    calculate NDMI from two different satellites: Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. The first
    satellite provides a 30-m spatial resolution index, calculated every 16 days,
    while the latter provides the index every 5 days, with a 10-m spatial resolution.
    In both cases, the platform supports continuous monitoring of crop water stress.
    NDMI absolute value allows recognizing symptoms of crop water stress with high
    spatial resolution. Remote sensing operates through optical sensors to detect
    the reflectance of the solar radiation at different wavelengths. Healthy and dense
    vegetation has a typical spectral signature. The spectral signature is influenced
    by the leaf structure and biochemistry, such as pigment concentration, water status,
    nitrogen content, and cellulose and lignin amounts [7] , [8] , [9] . Pigments
    are the main determinants of spectral responses of vegetation in the visible wavelengths
    (VIS) [10] . On the other hand, cellular structure and water content of leaves
    are the main determinants in the near-infrared wavelengths (NIR) and shortwave
    infrared wavelengths (SWIR) [9] . Different stress types determine specific spectral
    signatures of the vegetation: decrease in leaf pigments determines a decrease
    in radiation in the visible wavelength range, while canopy water stress determines
    a reduction in radiation in the shortwave infrared. On the other side, different
    vegetative stresses may cause a decrease of reflectance on the near-infrared wavelengths.
    In this view, different indices designed for canopy water stress detection based
    on SWIR are available. An index of plant moisture commonly used in scientific
    literature is the normalized difference between NIR and SWIR reflectance ( equation
    1 ): (NIR−SWIR) (NIR+SWIR) (1) View Source This index can be reported with different
    names [11] , such as Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) or Normalized
    Difference Water Index (NDWI). It is related to the canopy moisture. It is usually
    correlated with NDVI, being influenced by both vegetation vigor and water stress.
    As a consequence, low levels of NDMI indicate water stress and/or low canopy coverage
    of the field. There are two band wavelengths that can be used for vegetation moisture
    assessment: one corresponds to the wavelengths around 1400 nm, while the other
    corresponds to the wavelengths around 1900 nm. Commonly used satellites, such
    as Sentinel 2, provide both bands. The NDMI index is able to describe the areas
    of each field where water stress is most likely to happen, supporting decisions
    about irrigation at field level. To make the comparison between drought conditions
    possible in different vegetation coverages, the modified shortwave infrared perpendicular
    water stress index method has been designed by Feng et al. [12] . This method
    is based on the calculation of the equation (2) : MSPSI= 1 M 2 +1 − − − − − −
    √ (Rs+Mrd) (2) View Source where Rs is the sum of reflectance in the SWIR and
    RED wavelengths, and Rd is the difference. M and I should be calculated empirically
    in each case study. M represents the slope of the Rs - Rd baseline, along which
    the crop does not show symptoms of water stress. In the Agricolus remote sensing
    interface, the user can assess a set of spatial-explicit and multi-temporal indices
    ( Fig. 3 ). The Agricolus section on remotely sensed indices provides easy to
    interpret output (NDMI output varies between −1 at 1; at each value corresponds
    a specific agronomic situation, regardless of the crop) complementing the information
    given by the water balance model. Fig. 3 Example of Agricolus remote sensing interface
    defining the spatio-temporal variation of a set of indices related to the water
    stress. Show All SECTION IV. Model and Decision Support System for Irrigation
    Crop yield, fruit size, and fruit quality are highly dependent on technological
    contribution to modern irrigation. The efficient use of water is one of the most
    important challenges and opportunities that Agriculture 4.0 is trying to achieve
    [13] . To realize this purpose, Agricolus has developed a decision support system
    (DSS) for farmers, agronomists and researchers to properly assess the irrigation
    requirements of the crops and to assist water management at the field level. The
    DSS obtains all the available information in the farm management system: crop
    species and variety, soil physical-chemical characteristics, actual and predicted
    weather data and soil moisture to initialize a soil-crop model. Crop water requirements
    are calculated by a water balance model working with a daily time step. The modelling
    approach is based on the continuity equation applied to the soil layer explored
    by roots as described in FAO Irrigation and Drainage papers 56 and 66 [14] , [15]
    . Crop evapotranspiration losses are evaluated at field level (or continuous small
    groups of plants) with an algorithm that simulates the reference crop evapotranspiration
    ET0 and the real crop evapotranspiration ETR. ET0 is estimated with the Hargreaves-Samani
    equation [16] . ETR is obtained multiplying ET0 by a specific crop coefficient
    (kc, from FAO 56), function of the development (phenological stage) of the crop.
    Meteorological variables required by the model are daily minimum and maximum temperature
    and rainfall. These variables need to be provided at the field level by one or
    more agrometeorological stations or IoT sensors. Water balance model output, updated
    daily, includes the following information: crop water status and irrigation requirements,
    temporal patterns of soil moisture level compared to upper (soil optimal moisture
    status to be reached with irrigation) and lower (beginning of stress, irrigation
    is recommended) thresholds ( Fig. 4 ). Additional data output given by the model
    are: crop phenological phase, daily ET0, crop coefficient (kc), water stress coefficient
    (ks). To consider other components relying on the precise assessment of the crop
    water status, local microclimatic factors can be implemented in the calculation
    of irrigation requirements, for adjusting the water balance model. For example,
    the use of real-time information from soil parameters (soil moisture sensors)
    allows for adapting the DSS to specific local variation and delivering accurate
    irrigation advices. At present, about 900 farms are using the farm management
    system. A few larger organizations (farmer cooperatives, food processors, producer
    associations) are also involved in the practical deployment of the system. These
    farms and organizations are using the platform, providing on-field validation
    and insight into more advanced application of Agricolus. Fig. 4 Page of visualization
    and description of the water balance model for olive in Agricolus cloud ecosystem,
    section forecasting models. Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Agricolus provides
    an efficient and affordable technological system to support irrigation for crops
    and fruit trees, able to harmonize a water balance model and remotely sensed indices.
    In addition, the system is ready to be interoperable with soil and atmosphere
    sensor networks and automatic irrigation actuators. Field-specific water balance
    model and sensor data can be processed and integrated in the platform to deliver
    irrigation advice and automatically switch on the irrigation system. This will
    allow a continuous and reciprocal flow of information between the crop and the
    platform, guaranteeing the control of the system. As a further improvement, a
    specific control system will be able to control in real time the soil response
    to irrigation management. A promising approach in water management through decision
    support system is the integration of several technologies, which provide the user
    with an easy-to-use interface to evaluate all the important information needed
    to take smart decisions: ○ the FMS allows tracking of the farm data and all the
    irrigation logs; ○ the remote sensing tools support farmers in evaluating the
    field homogeneity and how to adapt the irrigation scheme to field variability;
    ○ the DSS supports farmers in daily decision making, using sensor data to evaluate
    the current status of the crop and define the irrigation needs. Agricolus is currently
    developing a spatial-aware decision support system that will integrate remote
    sensing data, soil maps and IoT sensors to spatially estimate the irrigation requirements
    and the plant water stress, providing input to variable rate irrigation systems.
    A spatial and temporal estimate of water stress is of pivotal importance also
    to support other precision farming features, such as the variable rate application
    of fertilizer and plant protection products, with the aim of assessing and overtaking
    the main limiting factors to crop yield. Combining advanced devices, DSS software
    packages, and agrometeorological models will ensure the early detection of crop
    water stress occurrence, and allow farm advisors and other specialists providing
    irrigation advice based on precision irrigation. Authors Figures References Citations

    INTRODUCTION\nPrecision \nagriculture \ncurrently \nplays \na significant role\
    \ in the spatial and temporal \nmanagement of the inputs involved in agricultural\

    \ in irrigated areas is called \nprecision irrigation (PI), whose objective is\
    \ to \ndevelop appropriate technologies to increase water \nproductivity in irrigated\
    \ agriculture through the \napplication of water in precise and accurate amounts\
    \ \nat the right time, according to the spatial and temporal \nvariability of\
    \ the irrigated areas (ABIOYE et al., \n2020; BWAMBALE et al., 2023; ABAGALE &\

    \ \nmaps of irrigation depths, based on the variability \nof soil attributes,\

    \ research on precision irrigation driven by climate change has developed a multitude\
    \ of strategies, methods \nand technologies to reduce water consumption in irrigation\
    \ projects and to adapt to the increasing occurrence of water scarcity, agricultural\
    \ \ndroughts and competition between agricultural and industrial sectors for the\
    \ use of water. In this context, the adoption of water-saving and \napplication\
    \ practices implies a multidisciplinary approach to accurately quantify the water\
    \ needs of crops under different water availability and \nmanagement practices.\
    \ Thus, this review article presented a review of technologies and new trends\
    \ in the context of precision irrigation, future \nperspectives and critically\

    RESUMO: Nas últimas décadas pesquisas voltadas à irrigação de precisão, impulsionadas\
    \ pelas mudanças climáticas, desenvolveram uma \ninfinidade de estratégias, métodos\
    \ e tecnologias para reduzir o consumo de água em projetos de irrigação, para\
    \ adaptação à crescente ocorrência \nde escassez de água, secas agrícolas e competição\
    \ entre os setores agrícolas e industriais pelo uso da água. Nesta conjuntura,\
    \ a adoção de \npráticas de economia e aplicação de água, implica em uma abordagem\
    \ multidisciplinar para a quantificação precisa das necessidades de água \ndas\
    \ culturas, sob diversas práticas de disponibilidade e manejo da água. Dessa forma,\

    \ focused on \nstrategies, methods, new technologies and trends \nthat are available\
    \ to farmers and professionals in \nthe context of precision irrigation with a\
    \ focus on \noptimizing water use.\nPrecision irrigation technologies and trends\n\
    Soil moisture sensors in agriculture\nIrrigation management via soil moisture\
    \ \nsensors has recently undergone several commercial \ninnovations, many of which\
    \ have been introduced \nby technology companies and independent research \ngroups\
    \ around the world (FERRAREZI et al., 2020). \nMany of these innovations are due\
    \ to a significant \ndecrease in the prices of monitoring equipment and \ndata\
    \ storage in digital agriculture. TIGLAO et al. \n(2020), who used a system of\
    \ wireless sensors that cost \nhalf the price of commercial systems, achieved\
    \ savings \nof 81% in water consumption applied in irrigation \nmanagement.\n\
    Although, the accessibility of sensors \nhas increased in recent years, their\
    \ operation still \nhas the same fundamentals based on physical, \nchemical \n\
    and \nmechanical \nmethods \nfor \nthe \ndetermination of information of interest,\
    \ which \ncan be obtained electrically, electromagnetically, \noptically, radiometrically,\
    \ mechanically, acoustically, \npneumatically or electrochemically, with the methods\
    \ \nof electrical resistance (Boyoucus), tensiometry, \nneutron moderation and\
    \ time domain reflectometry \n(TDR) being the most used to estimate the amount\
    \ of \nwater available in the soil (ZINKERNAGEL et al., \n2020).\nThe most common\
    \ and simple sensors that \nuse indirect (non-destructive) methods to measure\
    \ \nsoil moisture are resistive sensors that work by \nmonitoring the variation\
    \ in electrical resistance \nbetween two electrodes embedded in the soil. \nAdvantages\
    \ of their use include low acquisition cost, \nsimple sensor operation and easy\
    \ availability in the \nmarket; as a disadvantage, they do not have high \naccuracy\
    \ in soil moisture readings. Models such as \nFC-28 and SEN0114 are found on the\
    \ market. The \nother sensors are capacitive, such as the SHT10 \nand EC-5 models;\
    \ they work by measuring the \ndielectric constant of the soil by the time elapsed\
    \ \nafter emitting an electromagnetic pulse generated by \nmetal rods embedded\
    \ in the soil. These sensors have \nthe advantage of high accuracy in readings;\
    \ however, \ndue to the construction of their sophisticated and \nexpensive electronic\
    \ components, their acquisition \ncosts can be high (GASCH et al., 2017; GOMES\
    \ \net al., 2017; MATOS et al., 2017). Other models \nfound on the market include\
    \ Decagon 10HS, Meter \nTEROS-12 (also measures temperature and electrical \n\
    conductivity), Sentek Drill & Drop (measuring \nmoisture, temperature and salinity\
    \ every 10 cm) and \nWatermark 200SS (measures the tension of water \nheld in\
    \ the soil in kPa).\nDue to the wide variety of methods for \nobtaining data and\
    \ the very nature of construction of \nhumidity sensors, a series of usage characteristics\
    \ and \nrecommendations for each field condition can be specified \nin each specific\
    \ situation ZINKERNAGEL et al. (2020).\nOne of the biggest advantages of using\
    \ soil \nmoisture sensors is linked to irrigation management, \nsince monitoring\
    \ the amount of water in the soil is a \ndirect indication of the irrigation needs\
    \ of an agricultural \narea (HAMAMI & NASSEREDDINE, 2020).This \napplicability\
    \ can be observed in research carried out by \nO’SHAUGHNESSY et al. (2020) in\
    \ the state of Texas, \nUSA, studying the productivity of Sorgum bicolor L., in\
    \ \nwhich the productivity of irrigation water was quantified \nbased on three\
    \ different management methodologies, \nvia plant-based thermal patterns, via\
    \ soil-based \nneutron probe measurements, and a hybrid method \ncombining plant\
    \ and soil monitoring over a period \nof three consecutive years. The researchers\
    \ reported \nthat in the periods of joint use of monitoring methods \n(hybrid\
    \ method), there was a consistent increase in the \naccumulation of biomass, resulting\
    \ in both productivity \ngains per unit of area and water savings.\nEL-NAGGAR\
    \ et al. (2020), in an \nexperiment in New Zealand with bean and pea crops \n\
    under two irrigation management methods, via \nclimatological water balance and\
    \ via capacitive soil \nmoisture sensors (FDR) coupled with radiofrequency \n\
    data transmission systems (IoT), observed a difference \nin the volume of water\
    \ applied and at the beginning \nof irrigation operations, resulting in savings\
    \ between \n27–44% of the volume of water used in areas managed \nwith soil moisture\
    \ sensors. This result was attributed \nto the imprecision of the balance methodology\
    \ of \nwater in predicting the effects of poor soil drainage, \nPrecision irrigation\
    \ trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\n3\nespecially\
    \ resulting from the presence of a physical \nimpediment in the soil profile,\
    \ which underestimates \nthe real volume of water available to the plants.\nIn\
    \ addition to monitoring, the use of \nsensors also encompasses the use of automation\
    \ in \nirrigation systems, as can be seen in a study carried \nout by CONESA et\
    \ al. (2021), where the use of an \nautomatic irrigation system based on capacitance\
    \ \nsensors (FDR) showed better results in the efficiency \nof water use, resulting\
    \ in a decrease in the irrigation \ndepth compared to methods based on monitoring\
    \ the \nevapotranspiration of the water reference (ETo) and \nin the use of crop\
    \ coefficients (Kc) in the literature. \nJAISWAL & BALLAL (2020) used an automatic\
    \ \nsystem based on soil and climate sensors operating \nwith fuzzy logic to control\
    \ the flow of the irrigation \nsystem, achieving a smaller volume of water between\
    \ \n45% and 30%, respectively, as well as lower irrigation \ncosts, when compared\
    \ to the flood irrigation system.\nAccording to DOMÍNGUEZ-NIÑO et al. \n(2020),\
    \ the use of sensors in agriculture also allows a \nbetter understanding of the\
    \ real situation of humidity \nin different areas with plants in different stages\
    \ of \ngrowth, since monitoring via sensors takes place \ndirectly at the place\
    \ of interest and not in a generalized \nway, such as in climate monitoring, which\
    \ often \nconsiders irrigation sites based on a single stage of \nplant growth.\n\
    The automation of irrigation systems \nbased on soil sensors associated with the\
    \ use of IoT \ntechnologies can be observed in the research of \nBARKUNAN et al.\
    \ (2019) in which the soil moisture \nand climate monitoring sensors were connected\
    \ \nthrough a microcontroller capable of sending messages \nto the operator’s\
    \ smartphone, providing information \non the soil moisture conditions and the\
    \ beginning of \nthe irrigation period. This is possible through the use \nof\
    \ wireless communication devices that allow data \ntransfer between applications\
    \ without cables.\nThe use of a wireless sensor network \nis very important in\
    \ precision irrigation because, \naccording to irrigation management, extension\
    \ of \nthe area to be irrigated and producer preferences, it \nis necessary to\
    \ use spatially distributed sensor mesh \nto attend to data collection remotely\
    \ from several \nirrigated sectors, for example. Cabe points out that \nthe choice\
    \ of type of wireless device must consider the \nrange of the device. For example,\
    \ a Bluetooth device, \nmodel HC-06, with an SPP usage profile (Serial Port \n\
    Profile), has a maximum distance of 10 m between \nconnected devices, with a point-to-point\
    \ connection. \nAnother model, the XBee XB24-Z7WIT-004, of \nZigBee specification,\
    \ uses radiofrequency signals \nfor communication and low operating power, with\
    \ a \nrange limit of about 100 m, which allows point-to-\npoint and multipoint\
    \ connections, making it possible \nto form a mesh network of wireless devices.\n\
    Challenges in the application of sensors for soil \nmoisture monitoring\nOne of\
    \ the challenges for using FDR \nor TDR sensors in soil water monitoring is the\
    \ \nrelationship between factory calibration and sensor \ninstallation orientation\
    \ in the soil profile (vertical or \nhorizontal), which can cause systematic variations\
    \ in \nthe humidity readings.\nThis effect was observed by CHEN et al. \n(2019a),who\
    \ when comparing a capacity sensor and \nthree TDR sensors in three positions\
    \ on the ground, \nobserved a significant variation in the readings of \nwater\
    \ content in the soil under irrigation, concluding \nthat, in general, for sensors\
    \ with factory calibration, \nthe vertical orientation presents greater precision\
    \ when \ncompared to horizontal orientation, attributing this \nphenomenon to\
    \ the greater disruption in the soil that \nthe installation in the horizontal\
    \ position of the sensor \ncauses at the time of installation of the sensor. They\
    \ \nsuggested that irrigators should follow the positioning \nthat manufacturers\
    \ recommend for their equipment.\nHowever, SHARMA et al. (2017) pointed \nout\
    \ that, not infrequently, the calibration of sensors \nprovided by manufacturers\
    \ can overestimate the \nvolume of water in the soil and that, although they may\
    \ \nbe suitable for soils of similar texture, they often do \nnot consider factors\
    \ such as type, amount of organic \nmatter and apparent density of the soil, which\
    \ influence \nthe dielectric properties, making a local calibration \nnecessary\
    \ for better accuracy in the readings.\nFor the positioning of sensors in soil\
    \ \nlayers of different textures, KARGAS & SOULIS \n(2019) observed interesting\
    \ results, concluding \nthat for the correct management of irrigation in \nproductive\
    \ areas, it is necessary to use a different \nsensor for each soil layer or a\
    \ single sensor installed \nin the middle portion of the root system that is in\
    \ \ncontact with both layers simultaneously.\nSILVA et al. (2018), in a study\
    \ on banana, \nobserved that the ideal positioning of the sensors may \nnot be\
    \ constant throughout the development of the \nplant; that is, the most representative\
    \ position for the \nsensor to read the soil moisture may vary along with \nthe\
    \ phenological stage of the plant.\nOther factors such as salinity, soil textural\
    \ \nclass and temperature where the sensor is installed can \nalso affect the\
    \ accuracy of soil moisture monitoring, \nwhich may limit the use of these sensors\
    \ in areas \n4\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nwith higher temperatures,\
    \ such as semi-arid and \narid regions, or the use of reused water in irrigation\
    \ \n(CARDENAS-LAILHACAR & DUKES, 2015; \nINCROCCI et al., 2019; OATES et al.,\
    \ 2017).\nNaturally, the use of soil moisture sensors \nin agriculture results\
    \ in a large amount of data for \nanalysis. It is possible to observe a growing\
    \ trend \nin researches that use data science techniques to \ninterpret the readings\
    \ of these sensors based on \nartificial intelligence techniques.\nResearches\
    \ \nsuch \nas \nthe \none \nby \nGOLDSTEIN et al. (2017) trained several machine\
    \ \nlearning algorithms in the interpretation of a series \nof climatic and soil\
    \ data to propose assertive \nrecommendations for the management of irrigation\
    \ in \nthe field based on data storage in cloud computing.\nUsing more robust\
    \ computational techniques, \nsuch as “neural networks” it is possible to employ\
    \ a \nnetwork of sensors for the precise determination of \nsoil moisture, resulting\
    \ not only in more homogeneous \nirrigation in the areas but also in water and\
    \ electrical \nenergy savings through the best use of the pumping \nsystem (DURSUN\
    \ & ÖZDEN, 2016).\nThe use of mobile sensor systems, together \nwith graphical\
    \ software, to better understand the \ndetermination and monitoring of soil moisture\
    \ \ndistribution; although, in smaller quantities, also \nexpands the options\
    \ for new research areas and future \napplications at the field level (SHAN et\
    \ al., 2019).\nFinally, the development of the following \nnew \ntypes \nof \n\
    sensors \ndemonstrate \nindustrial \ninnovations to be used in future research:\
    \ mm-sized \nsoil moisture sensors (ZHOU et al., 2019), which \nhave the ability\
    \ to perform better monitoring of water \ndistribution in the soil profile; perforated\
    \ coaxial \ncylinder (CHEN et al., 2019c), capable of monitoring \nboth soil water\
    \ volume and temperature; thick film \nconductivity sensors (SOPHOCLEOUS et al.,\
    \ 2020), \ncapable of monitoring changes in soil structure through \nchanges in\
    \ conductivity and soil water content; and a \nFiber Bragg Grating sensor (ZHANG\
    \ et al., 2019), \ndeveloped for monitoring water pressure in the field.\nUse\
    \ of satellites and spectral sensors for precision \nirrigation\nAdvances in spectroscopy\
    \ have allowed \nthe execution of specific analyses of different types of \nmaterials\
    \ in a non-destructive and fast way, revealing \nvaluable information through\
    \ the energy reflection of \nthe targets (LILLESAND & KIEFER, 1994).\nSpectral\
    \ sensor technology has been used \nto efficiently generate information on a large\
    \ time–\nspace scale. Data collected in the field with point \nequipment can be,\
    \ in some cases, more accurate, \nwhile cost, speed and practicality are advantages\
    \ \nof spectral sensors coupled to satellites or UAVs to \ncapture information\
    \ spatially distributed over large \nareas. The remote data analyzed allow considerations\
    \ \nabout photosynthesis, physiological disturbances, \nphenology and water interactions\
    \ in real time, which \nare fundamental for water planning and management \n(KARTHIKEYAN\
    \ et al., 2020).\nSatellites and sensors\nThere are currently several satellites\
    \ in \noperation that perform this type of work remotely: \nMODIS, Landsat 7,\
    \ Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A. \nThe great acceptance of this technology is because\
    \ \nthey are free products, with good spatiotemporal \nresolution and radiometric\
    \ quality and with ease of \ndata integration with APIs.\nThe data generated by\
    \ satellites can be useful \nin several applications at the irrigation level.\
    \ VANINO \net al. (2018) combined meteorological data with data \ncaptured by\
    \ the sensors of the Sentinel 2A satellite to \nestimate the leaf area index and\
    \ surface albedo to use \nthis information to calculate the evapotranspiration\
    \ \nof tomato crops and validate it through comparison \nwith evapotranspiration\
    \ data obtained by the soil–\nwater balance. The results of this research showed\
    \ the \nsatisfactory suitability of the Sentinel 2A satellite to \ndetermine water\
    \ demand. SHADMAN et al. (2017) \nused thermal band data from the Landsat 8 satellite\
    \ \nto estimate water stress in sugarcane plants through \nthe crop water stress\
    \ index (CWSI). According to the \nauthor, the data capacity of the satellite\
    \ sensors was \npositive and sufficient to carry out monitoring via \nremote sensing\
    \ of the water stress of sugarcane without \nthe need for auxiliary soil data.\n\
    MARINO et al. (2014) evaluated spectral \ndifferences in tomato leaves located\
    \ in 3 irrigated \nregions, classifying them as high (H), medium (M) \nand low\
    \ (L) in terms of water use and efficiency; \nNETO et al. (2017) evaluated the\
    \ spectral reflectance \nin the visible (VIS) and near-infrared region (NIR) \n\
    of sunflower leaves in water deficit to obtain \nmodels capable of estimating\
    \ the status of water \nand chlorophyll. CHEMURA et al. (2017) used \ninformation\
    \ from VIS and NIR to create a machine \nlearning model using the random forest\
    \ algorithm \nto predict the water content in the plant in the coffee \ncrop.\
    \ All studies were conclusive and showed \nvariations in spectral identity in\
    \ relation to variations \nin water content in plants.\nIn precision irrigation,\
    \ indices generated \nfrom orbital satellites have been mainly used to: \nPrecision\

    5\n(a) monitor irrigation systems in macro-regions; (b) \nadapt local crop coefficients\
    \ for a better calculation of \nplant evapotranspiration; and (c) estimate vegetative\
    \ \nmetrics such as plant density, coverage fraction (fc) \nand leaf area index\
    \ (FRENCH et al., 2020).\nAccording to CHEN et al. (2018), many \nstudies focus\
    \ only on mapping the extent of irrigated \nareas without considering important\
    \ information \nthat could also be extracted with the use of remote \nsensing,\
    \ such as the amount of water with drawn from \nthe system and the frequency and\
    \ time of irrigation.\nDifferent levels of decision can be used in \nirrigated\
    \ macro-regions using satellite systems, since \nit is possible to track the temporal\
    \ growth of crops, \nderiving this information in basal coefficients that \nallow\
    \ a better estimate of regional evapotranspiration. \nThus, GONZÁLEZ-DUGO et al.\
    \ (2013) developed a \nmethodology called MINARET (monitoring irrigated \nagriculture\
    \ ET), which uses Landsat data capable \nof constantly monitoring the water consumption\
    \ of \ndifferent irrigated crops. MASELLI et al. (2020) used \nmeteorological\
    \ data together with Sentinel 2A data to \nestimate evapotranspiration in monitoring\
    \ irrigated \nareas in the Italian semi-arid region.\nObtaining evapotranspiration\
    \ values with \ngreater precision is a fundamental factor, as it is a key \nparameter\
    \ in the water and energy balance equation. \nFAO bulletin 56 states that crop\
    \ evapotranspiration \n(ETc) can be calculated by multiplying the reference \n\
    evapotranspiration (ETo) and a specific crop \ncoefficient (Kc) (ALLEN et al.,\
    \ 1998).\nAlthough, \nthe \ncoefficients \nprovided \nby the FAO are general,\
    \ throughout the growing \nseason, there are variations in crop characteristics,\
    \ \nso the parameter is intrinsically linked to species, \nvariety, plant population\
    \ density, phenology, water \navailability, climate and other factors. Therefore,\
    \ a \nstandard Kc may not well represent some localities, \ncausing less reliable\
    \ estimates and directly impacting \ngood water use (MOKHTARIA et al., 2018).\
    \ In \nrecent years, several works have contributed to more \naccurate irrigation,\
    \ developing methods to estimate \nKc or Kcb (basal crop coefficient) and considering\
    \ \nvegetation indices, which are considered great \nphenological thermometers,\
    \ called Kc-VI (ALAM et \nal., 2018; CAMPOS et al., 2017). Still, more recently,\
    \ \nPEREIRA et al. (2021) published a newsletter \n(Updates and forward to the\
    \ FAO56 crop water \nrequirements method - Case studies using ground \nand remote\
    \ sensing data; applications to update and \nupgrade the FAO56 method) with updates\
    \ of these \ncoefficients through a collection of several studies, \nwith the\
    \ use of new tools, such as remote sensing and \nIoT, which bring more precision\
    \ to the calculation \nof the water needs of crops, which are important \nadvances\
    \ for precision irrigation.\nFRENCH et al. (2020), using data from \nLandsat and\
    \ Sentinel mission satellites, determined \na Kc-VI used to calculate wheat evapotranspiration.\
    \ \nThe experiment was carried out in the American \nsouthwest, and it was concluded\
    \ that the best values \nof Kc and ETc were obtained in the middle of the \nseason\
    \ until the end of senescence, while at a time \npoint sooner than 60 days after\
    \ planting, a high and \noverestimated ETc was observed due to the low \ncoverage\
    \ canopy at the time, which contributed to the \nlow reflectivity of the plants.\n\
    Electromagnetic \napproach \napplied \nto \nthe \ndetermination of the spatial\
    \ variability of the water \nstatus of plants in the field based on UAVs\nFour\
    \ components must be considered \nbefore selecting the appropriate UAV for IP\
    \ (GAGO \net al., 2015): experimental design, type of data to be \nobtained, data\
    \ acquisition, and data processing and \nresults. In addition to UAVs, sensors\
    \ are essential for \nthe quality of the images obtained. Decision-making \nregarding\
    \ the type of camera to be used depends \ndirectly on the project objective. The\
    \ cameras \nembedded in UAVs most used in the IP concept \naiming intelligent\
    \ management of water are thermal, \nmultispectral, hyperspectral, RGB and near\
    \ infrared \n(NIR) cameras.\nTo monitor biotic and abiotic stress, \nthermal (1\
    \ band) and hyperspectral (100–250 bands) \ncameras are recommended, while multispectral\
    \ (6–12 \nbands) and RGB cameras (3 bands) are indicated for \ngrowth and biomass\
    \ assessment (ADÃO et al., 2017). \nHigh-resolution RGB cameras are traditionally\
    \ used \nin agroforestry applications; however, they lack the \nprecision and\
    \ spectral range to trace the material \ncharacteristics that hyperspectral and\
    \ multispectral \ncameras can provide.\nSUSIČ et al. (2018) demonstrated the \n\
    potential of using hyperspectral images ranging from \n400 to 2500 nm to assess\
    \ the water deficit status in tomato \nplants. ZARCO-TEJADA et al. (2012) used\
    \ UAV-based \nhyperspectral and thermal cameras to assess water stress \nlevels\
    \ in citrus crops and confirmed a link between PRI \nand canopy temperature. Recently,\
    \ LOGGENBERG \net al. (2018) used hyperspectral technology combined \nwith machine\
    \ learning to discriminate between water-\nstressed and non-stressed vines.\n\
    Hyperspectral imaging cameras generally \ncapture more detail in spatial and spectral\
    \ ranges \ncompared to other cameras. LOGGENBERG et al. \n6\nCiência Rural, v.53,\
    \ n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\n(2018) observed that the main limiting factor in\
    \ the \napplication of hyperspectral data is the inherent issue \nof dimensionality,\
    \ which results in reduced precision. \nIn addition, hyperspectral cameras are\
    \ very expensive \nand complex (ELVANIDI et al., 2018), which limits \ntheir expeditious\
    \ and wide application, especially in \ncommercial agriculture.\nMultispectral\
    \ cameras are composed \nof multiple sensors with high-quality filters that \n\
    can simultaneously capture images using different \nwave frequencies. They can\
    \ record both the light \nspectrum that is visible to the human eye and the \n\
    non-visible spectrum; thus, these cameras allow for \nmuch more accurate measurements\
    \ of plant health \nand phenological status than conventional cameras \n(RGB)\
    \ (KHANAL et al., 2017).\nMultispectral and hyperspectral cameras \ndo not have\
    \ a resolution comparable to traditional \nRGB cameras, which causes some initial\
    \ frustration \nfor users new to the spectral area accustomed to \ntraditional\
    \ high-resolution images. The resolution of \nRGB cameras is in the range of 20–120\
    \ MB, while \nmultispectral and hyperspectral cameras have a \nresolution between\
    \ 0.2–3 MB.\nAccording to POBLETE et al. (2017), \nplant water status is not accurately\
    \ predicted using \nmultispectral imaging between the 500 and 800 nm \nspectral\
    \ bands due to the lack of sensitivity to water \ncontent; however, wavelengths\
    \ greater than 800 nm \nare best for this purpose.\nRALLO et al. (2014) observed\
    \ that \nsatisfactory estimation of leaf water potential at leaf \nand canopy\
    \ levels can be obtained using vegetation \nindices based on the NIR shortwave\
    \ infrared domain, \nwith specific optimization of the “central bands.”\nRecently,\
    \ some researchers have developed \nartificial neural network (ANN) models derived\
    \ from \nmultispectral images to predict the spatial variability \nof water potential\
    \ in agricultural crops. ROMERO et \nal. (2018) classified the water status of\
    \ the vine based \non 10 vegetation indices (VI) using bands of Red, \nGreen,\
    \ Red-Edge, and NIR wavelengths and found \nthat there were no significant relationships\
    \ between \nindividual VIs, with values of correlation lower than \n0.3 for almost\
    \ all the studied indices.\nThere is a very specific spectral band \ncalled RedEdge,\
    \ which lies between red and \ninfrared, has excellent correlation with chlorophyll\
    \ \nfluorescence and effectively differentiates between \nhealthy and senescent\
    \ vegetation (MATESE & DI \nGENNARO, 2018). There is already a range of \nspecific\
    \ multispectral cameras for use embedded in \nUAVs (MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018).\
    \ Among \nthem, Tetracam, Airinov and Micasense camera \nmanufacturers can be\
    \ highlighted.\nTetracam’s modular cameras can be \nmounted in different arrangements,\
    \ depending \non which bands you want to capture and which \nbandwidths. Airinov’sagro\
    \ Sensor has 4 bands and \nhas been used by the famous eBee AG, the version of\
    \ \nthe fixed-wing UAV for agricultural applications in \nSwitzerland Sensefly\
    \ (MATESE & DI GENNARO, \n2018). The American Micasense manufactures \nthe RedEdge\
    \ sensor, a multispectral camera that \nsimultaneously captures 5 different narrow-width\
    \ \nbands and a more recent dual camera that captures 10 \nspectral bands. In\
    \ addition to the RGB bands of the \nvisible spectrum, the camera also captures\
    \ the NIR in \nthe non-visible spectrum and the RedEdge, a spectral \nband that\
    \ is positioned exactly on the threshold \nbetween the visible and the non-visible.\
    \ In addition to \nincreasing the sensitivity of certain indices, it is with \n\
    this spectral band that certain diseases and crop pests \ncan be identified (DEVIA\
    \ et al., 2019).\nDEVIA et al. (2019) studied biomass \nproduction in rice crops\
    \ using multispectral imaging. \nThe authors presented a method for biomass \n\
    estimation using near-infrared (NIR) images captured \nat different crop scales.\
    \ The approach estimated the \nbiomass of large areas of the crop with an average\
    \ \ncorrelation of 0.76 in relation to the traditional manual \ndestructive method.\n\
    KITIĆ et al. (2019) proposed a low-\ncost portable active multispectral optical\
    \ device \nfor accurate detection of plant stress and to \nperform field mapping\
    \ called Plant-O-Meter. The \ndevice has an integrated multispectral source \n\
    that comprises light in four more indicative \nwavelengths (850, 630, 535 and\
    \ 465 nm) and allows \nthe simultaneous illumination of the entire plant. \nSequential\
    \ illumination and detection provide fast \nreflectance measurements, which are\
    \ transmitted \nby wireless to Android-powered devices for data \nprocessing and\
    \ storage. The device was tested under \nlaboratory conditions by comparing Plant-O-Meter\
    \ \nmeasurements with imaging results from a SPECIM \nhyperspectral camera and\
    \ a GreenSeeker handheld \ndevice under field conditions. The comparison \nrevealed\
    \ comparable performance, showing a strong \ncorrelation in both the hyperspectral\
    \ (R2 = 0.997) \nand portable GreenSeeker (R2 = 0.954) from the \nlaboratory measurements\
    \ and R2 = 0.886 for the field \nexperiments), indicating that the device exhibited\
    \ \nstrong potential for accurate stress measurements.\nThe scientific articles\
    \ reviewed in this \nresearch, referring to the use of different spectral \nPrecision\

    \ cameras used by the \nscientific community for the rapid detection of water\
    \ \nstress in culture.\nArtificial intelligence in precision agriculture\nDue\
    \ to climatic uncertainties, the growing \ndemand for food and the rapid expansion\
    \ of the \npopulation, the agricultural sector is increasingly \ndependent on\
    \ the use of new technologies to obtain \nhigher yields in a sustainable way with\
    \ each harvest. In \nthis context, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly\
    \ \ndeveloping \napplications \nin \nagriculture \naiming \nproductivity gains\
    \ in a precise and effective way, \navoiding the waste of resources (SHAIKH et\
    \ al., 2022).\nIn recent decades, researchers have strived \nto allow computers\
    \ to extract enough information \nfrom raw data to model the real world. To achieve\
    \ \nthis, many have turned to machine learning \nalgorithms to capture a large\
    \ amount of information \nand automatically discover the representations \nneeded\
    \ to detect or classify input patterns and solve \nthe various problems and needs\
    \ of the agricultural \nsector (KHALIL & ABDULLAEV, 2021). Machine \nlearning\
    \ algorithms are computation models with \nparticular properties such as learning,\
    \ generalizing, \ngrouping or organizing data. They consist of \ndistributed structures\
    \ formed by a large number \nof very simplified processing units connected to\
    \ \neach other. Intelligent behavior occurs through the \ninteractions of the\
    \ neural network processing units \n(CANZIANI et al., 2016). The first neural\
    \ networks \nto achieve widespread repercussions were based \non unsupervised\
    \ pre-training. However, it was the \nrediscovery of convolutional neural networks\
    \ (CNN) \n(LECUN et al., 1998) that made this topic one of the \nmain topics in\
    \ machine learning, parallel processing \ntechnologies in GPUs (Graphal Processor\
    \ Unit) and \nlarge databases that allowed these networks to be used \nfully.\
    \ With the good performance being demonstrated \nby such models, other areas of\
    \ knowledge besides \nthe area of computing have been using these models \nfor\
    \ different purposes, as in the area of agricultural \nsciences since the 1990s\
    \ with the pioneering work \nof MCQUEEN et al. (1995), in which the authors \n\
    investigated the use of machine learning techniques \nexisting at the time for\
    \ some problems in agriculture \nand horticulture and presented a case study to\
    \ infer \nmanagement rules for some invasive plants. Recent \nresearch has used\
    \ PCN-type networks (pulse-coupled \nnetworks) for the separation of wheat grains\
    \ and to \nevaluate the physical characteristics of the soil and \nthe growth\
    \ of the cultures, concluding after field \nexperiments that the developed model\
    \ assisted in \nchoosing the crop that best suited the evaluated soil \n(SHAIKH\
    \ et al., 2022).\nWorks that involve not only agronomic data \nbut also other\
    \ technologies, such as satellite images, \nhave been developed, such as the classification\
    \ of \nmanagement areas using satellite images (KHALIL \n& ABDULLAEV, 2021). In\
    \ the context of the use of \nneural networks for agriculture and with the advent\
    \ \nof cheaper computing resources combined with the \nnew sensors that are being\
    \ developed, proposals that \nincreasingly use cutting-edge technological resources\
    \ \nare noted (SOBAYO et al., 2018).\nAs a tool to aid strategic decision making,\
    \ \nsmart agriculture has emerged as a new scientific \narea that employs, among\
    \ other technologies, \nmachine learning algorithms to assess and monitor \nthe\
    \ conditions of growing areas, such as soil and \nweather conditions, leading\
    \ to more accurate results \n(LIAKOS et al., 2018).\nBACHOUR \net \nal. \n(2015)\
    \ \nused \na \nmethodology that combines wavelet mult-iresolution \nanalysis with\
    \ the MVRVM algorithm (multivariate \nrelevance vector machine) to predict 16\
    \ days of \nETo. More recently, deep learning (DL) is a machine \nlearning technique\
    \ that has shown good results in \nsolving agricultural problems. KAMILARIS &\
    \ \nPRENAFETA-BOLDÚ (2018) presented a review \nof 40 relevant studies in the\
    \ area and found that, in \naddition to improvements in the performance of \n\
    classification/prediction problems, DL also reduced \nresource engineering in\
    \ many of the works.\nFor crop management, for example, yield \npredictions can\
    \ be made from satellite images, as \npresented by KHALIL & ABDULLAEV (2021).\
    \ In \nthis research, the authors concluded that it is possible \nto predict wheat\
    \ yield from image processing with \nsupervised Kohonen networks. Another beneficial\
    \ \nactivity is pest and disease control, where the \nspraying of pesticides is\
    \ now directed only to the \naffected plants, reducing financial and environmental\
    \ \ncosts (JIAO et al., 2022).\nIn water and soil management, important \npractices\
    \ have been developed not only to increase crop \nproductivity but also to use\
    \ these resources efficiently. \nPATIL & DEKA (2016) used the extreme learning\
    \ \nalgorithm to estimate the weekly evapotranspiration \nof a crop in India.\
    \ In soil management, GU et al. \n(2021) presented a new method for estimating\
    \ \nsoil moisture based on ANN models. ANN shave \nalso been the subject of scientific\
    \ investigations in \nthe field of irrigation engineering to estimate the \nlocalized\

    \ & ALAZBA (2017), the use of neural \nnetworks presents a powerful tool for estimating\
    \ the \nload loss caused by initial connectors when compared \nto the use of empirical\
    \ models. KADHEM et al. \n(2017) used a neural network to predict wind speed \n\
    data with chronological and seasonal characteristics. \nThe authors concluded\
    \ that the neural network \nwas able to portray variations in wind speed with\
    \ \ngood performance during the different seasons \nof the year. LIU et al. (2018)\
    \ developed a wind \nspeed prediction model based on WPD (wavelet \npacket decomposition),\
    \ CNN (convolutional neural \nnetwork) and CNNLSTM (convolutional long short-\n\
    term memory network). To verify the prediction \nperformance of the proposed model,\
    \ it was compared \nwith 8 neural models widely used by the scientific \ncommunity.\
    \ The authors concluded that the proposed \nmodel is robust and effective in predicting\
    \ wind speed \ntime series.\nDefinition of management zones in precision \nirrigation\n\
    One way to manage physical, chemical \nand/or biological variations within a growing\
    \ area is \nthrough the delineation of management zones (ZM). \nManagement zones\
    \ are sub-areas within a cultivation \narea that have similar characteristics\
    \ but differ to a \ncertain degree from the others in such a way that a \nparticular\
    \ agronomic management is justified to be \nadopted in each of them (KITCHEN et\
    \ al., 2005).\nFor management zones to be determined, \nit is necessary to obtain\
    \ data from the area of \ninterest, which can be of various types, such as crop\
    \ \nproductivity, soil physical and chemical properties, \ntopography, vegetation\
    \ indices, and aerial images. \nFrom these individual or combined data, thematic\
    \ \nmaps are created, and this spatial information is then \ninterpreted. In this\
    \ context, BAZZI et al. (2018) used \nsoil property data to define management\
    \ zones, such as \nsoil texture and apparent electrical conductivity. YAO \net\
    \ al. (2014) used soil physicochemical properties and \ncrop yield data and determined\
    \ management zones.\nGenerally, \nirrigation \nis \ncarried \nout \nuniformly\
    \ in a cultivated area, regardless of the \nspatial characteristics of that area.\
    \ In the field, the \nwater content in the soil is not homogeneous due \nto its\
    \ spatial variability, which ranges from crop \ndevelopment, difference in relief\
    \ and variation of soil \nhydraulic properties and rainfall distribution. Thus,\
    \ \nthe proper use of irrigation in each management zone \nreduces the volume\
    \ of water used in the irrigation \nsystem, as there is an increase in efficiency\
    \ that \nprovides growth in productivity, reducing nutrient \nleaching and water\
    \ waste. Management zones are used \nto optimize irrigated areas, where a heterogeneous\
    \ area \nis separated into homogeneous zones and irrigation \nmanagement will\
    \ be the same in these regions (LIANG \net al., 2016; PEREA et al., 2017).\nFor\
    \ XIANG et al. (2007), cluster analyses \nand empirical analyses are the categories\
    \ in which \nmost of the methods used to define management \nzones are inserted.\
    \ Since the empirical methods are \nsimpler, based on specialized knowledge and\
    \ on the \ndistribution of productivity in the production areas, \nin this way,\
    \ it is possible to divide a heterogeneous \narea into homogeneous sub-areas.\
    \ However, cluster \nanalysis is a more complex, less subjective method \nthat\
    \ uses multiple variables during the establishment \nof management zones. In cluster\
    \ analysis methods, \ndata points in a cropping area are divided into \ndifferent\
    \ classes, where the similarities between the \npoints are evaluated to define\
    \ the classes, and with \nthat, the management zones are defined (GAVIOLI et \n\
    al., 2019; LI et al., 2007).\nTo define management zones, several \nfactors and\
    \ data are often used; in this case, a \nmultivariate analysis was used to define\
    \ the zones. \nOLDONI et al. (2019) also used geostatistical and \nmultivariate\
    \ analyses to determine management \nzones in a peach orchard, with a clustering\
    \ approach \non both soil (soil texture, water content, organic \nmatter content)\
    \ and plant (amount of fruit per tree, \naverage fruit weight, total soluble solute\
    \ content) for \ndifferentiated management.\nAnother form of multivariate geospatial\
    \ \nanalysis is kriging factor analysis, a data interpolation \nmethod that identifies\
    \ variability and was used in \nthe study by BEVINGTON et al. (2019), where soil\
    \ \nproperties and hydraulic parameters were measured \nto define management zones\
    \ using kriging factor \nanalysis and the fuzzy-c means algorithm. CHEN et \n\
    al. (2019b) used an RGB camera attached to a UAV \nto determine the plant cover\
    \ and vigor of the peanut \nand cotton canopy through the green–red vegetation\
    \ \nindex to determine management zones in Italy, used \nas indicators of irrigation\
    \ uniformity, which they also \nserved as an indication for the application of\
    \ variable \nrate irrigation (VRI) in a pivot system. In the research \nby SCHENATTO\
    \ et al. (2017), management zones \nwere also created using the fuzzy-c means\
    \ algorithm, \nfocusing on soil characteristics, such as elevation, \nslope, density,\
    \ organic matter, clay and sand contents, \nand plant attributes, such as yield.\n\
    In the study by ANASTASIOU et al. \n(2019), multivariate geostatistical techniques\
    \ were \nPrecision irrigation trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural,\
    \ v.53, n.8, 2023.\n9\nalso used to unite the multitemporal data from a \nmultiband\
    \ radiometer and a geophysical sensor and \nthus delimit the management zones\
    \ of a vineyard, \nconsidering the electrical conductivity of the soil \nand canopy\
    \ area. OHANA-LEVI et al. (2019) used \na weighted multivariate spatial clustering\
    \ model \nto determine irrigation management zones in a \nvineyard. Management\
    \ zones were determined using \na multivariate k-means cluster, and machine learning\
    \ \nand spatial statistics were also used to analyze the \nvariables, which comprised\
    \ soil properties, terrain \ncharacteristics and environmental impact.\nAnother\
    \ tool used to collect data and define \nmanagement zones is the proximal sensing\
    \ of the \nsoil, based on electromagnetic induction techniques, \nradiometry and\
    \ fluorimetry (CASTANEDO, 2013). \nIn the research by CASTRIGNANÒ et al. (2017),\
    \ \nproximal and remote sensors were used in a tomato \ngrowing area, and there\
    \ was integration with \nmultivariate geostatistical data to define management\
    \ \nzones based on the electrical conductivity of the soil, \nwhich was measured\
    \ at different frequencies, sensor \npolarizations and depths. Likewise, MOUAZEN\
    \ et \nal. (2014) used a soil sensor to measure electrical \nconductivity, soil\
    \ water holding capacity, available \nwater, organic matter, density, clay content\
    \ and \norganic carbon, establishing a multi-sensor and data \nfusion approach\
    \ to delineating management zones for \nsite-specific irrigation, best addressed\
    \ in section 1 of \nthis review.\nTo define management zones, low-cost \nremote\
    \ sensing data are viable options (section 2 of \nthis review), where spatiotemporal\
    \ information on \nthe biological and physical parameters of vegetation \nare\
    \ used (FONTANET et al., 2018). FONTANET et \nal. (2020) used remote sensing to\
    \ define management \nzones in a corn planting area, analyzing normalized \ndifference\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI) time series by \nremote sensing, soil moisture sensors,\
    \ and root zone \nsimulation predictions. GOBBO et al. (2019) also \nused NDVI\
    \ in defining management zones in corn \nplantations and combined it with soil\
    \ texture data to \ncreate irrigation management zones.\nIn the research by GEORGI\
    \ et al. (2017), \nremote sensing was used together with an automatic \ndelineation\
    \ algorithm. An automatic segmentation \nalgorithm \nwas \ndeveloped \nusing \n\
    multispectral \nsatellite data, which is a cheaper method for defining \nmanagement\
    \ zones.\nWe emphasized that the creation of \nmanagement zones for irrigation\
    \ is not strictly \nassociated with the application of water at a varied rate\
    \ \nbut rather in specific fields or areas and not exclusively \non a lateral\
    \ line of an irrigation system. The creation of \nthese zones can help in the\
    \ sizing of localized irrigation \nsystems, enabling the differentiation of water\
    \ needs by \nsector, such as ZM, which differs from SS-VRI (site-\nspecific variable\
    \ rate sprinkler).\nAnother point to consider is the limitations \nof the use\
    \ of remote sensing to create ZM. \nFONTANET et al. (2020) suggested the integration\
    \ \nof spatial and temporal information, since there are \nsoil and/or plant attributes\
    \ with spatial differences \nthat also change over time; that is, they are not\
    \ static. \nFor example, the NDVI must be combined with a \nmeasurement of available\
    \ soil water to dynamically \ndelineate both space and time ZM for irrigation.\n\
    Irrigation systems with variable water application rates\nIrrigated agriculture\
    \ is one of the \nagricultural activities with the highest consumption \nof fresh\
    \ water in the world. In this sense, precision \nirrigation is an important tool\
    \ for the development \nof profitable and sustainable agriculture (DU et al.,\
    \ \n2015; MATEOS & ARAUS, 2016). \nThus, as discussed in the previous section,\
    \ \nthe creation of irrigation management zones is \nessential to increase the\
    \ efficiency of the application \nand use of water in the field. Within this tool,\
    \ Site-\nspecific Variable Rate Irrigation (SS-VRI) is a \nmanagement method that\
    \ consists of applying water \naccording to spatial variability due to characteristics,\
    \ \nsuch as soil and culture; and therefore, through \nrational application, it\
    \ is possible to increase water \nconservation and productivity, in addition to\
    \ reducing \nthe leaching rate of nutrients and agrochemicals and \noptimizing\
    \ inputs (DU et al., 2015; MATEOS & \nARAUS, 2016).\nSS-VRI differs from conventional\
    \ sprinkler \nsystems and requires variable rate sprinklers, which \nare based\
    \ mainly on pulse modulation, angle of \ndeparture and arrival points, and sprinkler\
    \ head \n(SADLER et al., 2005).The main research covers \nlinear and center pivot\
    \ sprinkler systems due to the \nlevel of automation and coverage of the cultivation\
    \ \narea through a single side tube (ADEYEMI et al., \n2017). However, this type\
    \ of management has \nalready been studied for other types of irrigation \nmethods,\
    \ such as drip, considering the challenges of \ndirectionality and the invariable\
    \ rate of lateral lines \n(LINKER, 2020). Therefore, the main commercial \nequipment\
    \ developed thus far is linked to central \npivot and linear mechanized sprinkler\
    \ irrigation.\nThe greatest success of implementing VRI \nin center pivot systems,\
    \ and the focus of this review, \nis that it allows: first, the control of the\
    \ travel speed \n10\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nof the center\
    \ pivot, allowing the variation of water \napplication/infiltration depth by sector,\
    \ and second, \ncontrolling the variation of water application by zone; \nthat\
    \ is, it allows the differentiation of irrigation rates \nalong the lateral pipeline\
    \ (ANDRADE et al., 2020; \nO’SHAUGHNESSY et al., 2019; SUI & YAN, 2017).\nSOBENKO\
    \ et al. (2018) developed a \nsprinkler with flow adjustment through the cross\
    \ \nsection based on an iris mechanism controlled by \na stepper motor using a\
    \ deterministic model for \nflow prediction, but the idealized nozzle discharge\
    \ \ncoefficient (0.60) was below the average values \n(0.90–0.92) observed in\
    \ conventional fixed nozzles.\nThe management of SS-VRI can be carried \nout efficiently\
    \ in several ways, such as monitoring the \nsoil moisture content, a subject discussed\
    \ in greater \ndepth in sections 1 and 4. For this, the positioning \nand number\
    \ of sensors should be chosen with care so \nthat the generated data are representative\
    \ of the area \nunder cultivation. Through analyses of variance and \ntemporal\
    \ stability of soil water content monitored by a \nneutron probe, BARKER et al.\
    \ (2017) concluded that \nfor management zones divided to minimize variations\
    \ \nwithin the zones, the number of sensors may be \nmore important than their\
    \ position in the area. In \naddition, due to the high cost of a number of sensors,\
    \ \na partnership between modeling and monitoring soil \nwater is proposed. In\
    \ a similar study focusing on the \nplacement of soil sensors, ZHAO et al. (2017)\
    \ stated \nthat the clay percentile of management zones should \nbe considered\
    \ for the placement of sensors.\nThe use of spectral images obtained \nvia satellite\
    \ or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) \nhas been used in the management of variable-rate\
    \ \nirrigation systems. The principle of this use is based on \nunderstanding\
    \ the spectral response of the leaf, which \nis applied at the canopy level and\
    \ is used to establish \nmanagement zones (HANK et al., 2018). MENDES et \nal.\
    \ (2019), using images obtained from satellites, carried \nout the mapping of\
    \ areas considering the variability for \nthe application of variable-rate irrigation\
    \ depths via the \ncentral pivot system. With the same objective, SHI et \nal.\
    \ (2019), with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAVs), obtained multispectral\
    \ images of the vegetation \nand used vegetation indices to determine the spatial\
    \ \nvariability and constitution of homogeneous areas. \nSimilar work was developed\
    \ by BHATTI et al. (2020), in \nwhich the comparison of multispectral images obtained\
    \ \nby UAV and satellites was performed to evaluate the \nresponse of crops to\
    \ variable irrigation based on canopy \ntemperature and surface energy balance\
    \ modeling. More \nexamples of the use of images in precision irrigation are \n\
    mentioned in sections 2 and 3.\nDespite all the benefits, the uptake of \nSS-VRI\
    \ systems has grown slowly. The main \njustifications for this are that this type\
    \ of management \nrequires qualified technical assistance, and the \nacquisition\
    \ of the necessary equipment still has a high \ncost, requiring a careful analysis\
    \ of the economic \nviability of production (ABIOYE et al., 2020). To \nassist\
    \ in these matters, simulation models are viable \noptions for assessing the response\
    \ of crops to different \nirrigation management methods.\nMCCARTHY et al. (2014)\
    \ used a model \ncalled VARIwise based on the predictive control \nmodel methodology\
    \ to evaluate the performance of \ncotton cultures grown on a center pivot with\
    \ variable \napplication rate irrigation compared to conventional \nsystems. In\
    \ most results, simulations of precision \nirrigation performance had superior\
    \ results. In a \nsimilar research, THORP (2019) carried out a long-\nterm evaluation\
    \ through simulations using the same \ncrop under soil variability parameters\
    \ to analyze the \nadvantages of the system. However, modeling applied \nto precision\
    \ irrigation can be complex because it deals \nwith the dynamics of water in soil.\
    \ The following \ntopic discusses in-depth examples of models and \napplications\
    \ of modeling in irrigated agriculture. \nModeling agricultural crops and their\
    \ interaction \nwith the prescription of variable water depths in \nprecision\
    \ irrigation\nExtreme drought events have increased \nin intensity in recent decades\
    \ and predictions from \nagrometeorological modeling indicate that climate \n\
    extremes of drought will become more frequent and \nprolonged due to a set of\
    \ factors, among which global \nwarming stands out (IPCC, 2018).\nAgriculture\
    \ is one of the human activities \nmost dependent on climatic conditions, especially\
    \ \ntraditional rainfed crops, so the development \nof studies to evaluate the\
    \ effects of these on \nagricultural production is important. However, \ncarrying\
    \ out field experiments becomes limiting due \nto a series of factors, such as\
    \ manpower, available \ntime and financial resources. An alternative or \ncomplementary\
    \ solution is the use of agricultural \nmodeling to forecast the development of\
    \ agricultural \ncrops in new climate scenarios.\nCrop simulation models are based\
    \ on \nbiophysical processes to make estimates such as \ngrowth, development and\
    \ production, based on \nphysiological characteristics of the crop in question\
    \ \nand environmental variables (MONTEITH, 1996). \nUnderstanding these models\
    \ becomes the conceptual \nbasis for modeling agricultural crops.\nPrecision irrigation\
    \ trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\n11\nMechanistic\
    \ models, based on the physics \nand physiological processes of plants, become\
    \ allies \nin the development of teaching, research and crop \nmanagement. Among\
    \ them, the DSSAT (Decision \nSupport System for Agrotechnology Transfer) presents\
    \ \na set of models developed for several important crops, \nsuch as corn and\
    \ soybean (JONES et al., 2003).\nIn a review of the opportunities and \napproaches\
    \ for modeling spatial variations of water \nat the field level, TENREIRO et al.\
    \ (2020) pointed \nout that, among the irrigation methods, there are \nthree ways\
    \ to simulate irrigation applications in crop \nmodels: a) determination of a\
    \ calendar by the user; \nb) an irrigation program based on the water capacity\
    \ \nof the soil, applying constant or variable rates; and c) \nthrough a schedule\
    \ based on multiple criteria, such as \nthe phenological stage of the crop, water\
    \ content in the \nsoil, restrictions on the availability of water and type \n\
    of cultural management. These methodologies have \nthe potential to calculate\
    \ the varied rate of irrigation \nto be provided to plants, “when,” “where” and\
    \ “how \nmuch” they need, resulting in the optimization of \nthe use of this water\
    \ resource (HAGHVERDI et al., \n2016), thus validating the three ways to simulate\
    \ \nfield-level irrigation applications in the models.\nIn the literature, the\
    \ prescription of \nvariable irrigation depths follows two methodologies: \na)\
    \ make individual use of crop simulation models or \nhydrological models, which\
    \ focus on the movement \nof water in the soil and b) make combined use of \n\
    these two models.\nThe DSSAT model, because it is a \nsimulation of cultivation,\
    \ is advantageous in the study \nof irrigation management scenarios, as presented\
    \ by \nMALIK & DECHMI (2019) in a study carried out \nin Spain with different\
    \ cultures. They evaluated \ntwo scenarios, one based on irrigation applied by\
    \ \nproducers and another on irrigation adjusted to \nthe water demand of the\
    \ crop, with crop and soil \ndata collected for model calibration and validation.\
    \ \nThe authors reported up to a 27% reduction in the \napplication of irrigation\
    \ depths. Similar researches are \npresented by CAMARGO & KEMANIAN (2016), \n\
    PEREZ-ORTOLA et al. (2015) and XIANGXIANG \net al. (2013).\nAnother well-established\
    \ model is APSIM, \nwhich also focuses on modeling agricultural crops and \nassesses\
    \ the impacts of different crop management \npractices, including irrigation (AMARASINGHA\
    \ et \nal., 2015; DUTTA et al., 2020).\nPEREA et al. (2017), for example, carried\
    \ \nout an integrative modeling coupling a deterministic \nmodel of water application\
    \ with the Aquacrop model, \nsimulating the impacts of heterogeneous irrigation\
    \ \ncaused by wind drift and pressure variation in the \nirrigation system. They\
    \ concluded that variable-rate \nirrigation was the best method in all scenarios\
    \ of \npressure variation in the system to save water and \nincrease onion yield.\n\
    ROY et al. (2019) also proposed the \nintegration of crop and hydrological models\
    \ using \nHYDRUS-2D software and DSSAT to identify the \nmost appropriate irrigation\
    \ management to maximize \nwater use efficiency through precision irrigation using\
    \ \nretention technology of subsurface water, together \nwith a computational\
    \ procedure of evolutionary multi-\nobjective optimization to link the two models.\
    \ The \nauthors concluded that the optimization procedure \nreduced water use\
    \ and increased corn yield prediction \nby 6-fold compared to non-optimized and\
    \ randomized \nirrigation management without subsurface water \nretention membrane.\
    \ For the combination of models, \nanother proposal developed by GARCÍA-VILA \n\
    & FERERES (2012), in which they combined the \nAquaCrop model with an economic\
    \ optimization \nmodel, identified irrigation strategies and predicted \ntheir\
    \ impact on income. in which the simulated \nresults indicated that the best strategy\
    \ under water \nrestrictions combined the planting of crops with low \nwater use\
    \ in part of the area as a way of making more \nwater available for the most profitable\
    \ crops and with \nthe greatest water need.\nIn this review, several premises\
    \ involving \nprecision irrigation were addressed, from the use of \nsoil sensors,\
    \ remote sensing, artificial intelligence, \nmanagement zones for irrigation,\
    \ and variable-\nrate irrigation to agricultural modeling in view of \noptimizing\
    \ the use of water resources. However, there \nare other techniques and technologies\
    \ used in RI that \nhelp in the efficient use of both water and energy \nresources,\
    \ such as the use of wastewater (IBEKWE \net al., 2018; SHANNAG et al., 2021;\
    \ VERGINE et \nal., 2016), solar panels to reduce energy costs with \nwater pumping\
    \ and automation in irrigation systems \n(GRANT et al., 2022; SINGH et al., 2021)\
    \ and \nthe use of microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) to \nmitigate damage caused\
    \ by water deficit (ASHWIN \net al., 2022).\nCONCLUSION\nThis review of trends\
    \ and prospects for \nprecision irrigation for irrigation monitoring and \nmanagement\
    \ is based on relevant past and current \nresearch work that has contributed to\
    \ achieving \ngreater water savings in agriculture. It is hoped that \n12\nCiência\

    \ overview of \nresearch trends and generated new ideas for readers \non implementation\
    \ and execution approaches \nto choosing the best smart irrigation strategy, \n\
    paying attention to the fact that the combination of \nmonitoring methods via\
    \ soil, plant and climate is \nthe most assertive strategy to increase the energy\
    \ \nefficiency of water use in irrigated fields. However, \nit results in a large\
    \ volume of data to be analyzed, \nmaking it necessary to use algorithms based\
    \ on \nartificial intelligence, which promotes a fast and \nefficient monitoring\
    \ system of the collected data, \naiming the assertive recommendation of irrigation\
    \ at \na variable rate in the area irrigated to save water and \nenergy so as\

    Sensor Network (WSN) broadly utilized as a part of building decision support system
    for monitoring and controlling different environmental parameter. One of the most
    fascinating fields having an expanding need of decision support system is agriculture.
    The superiority of WSN in agriculture is due to several reasons like high performance,
    increasing the production while decreasing cost, low-power consumption and collected
    distributed data. In this paper, the proposed Automated Irrigation System (AIS)
    is useful to sense temperature, sunlight, humidity, pH and groundwater in the
    field and take decision of water requirements based on results. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction WSN
    framework comprises of vast number of sensor nodes that are thickly deploying
    in the interested region [1], [2]. It made out of four sections: power supply,
    communication, processing unit and sensors. Sensors sense the information and
    communication unit gets the data from the CPU and after that transmit it to the
    outside world, Power source system supplies energy to sensor nodes and microprocessor
    in processing unit control sensors, execute communication protocols and signal
    processing set of computer instructions on the collected sensor data. The sensor
    nodes has been designed using low power sensing devices, embedded processors,
    communication kits, and power equipment. Sensor nodes communicate with each other
    and with base station using a wireless communication channel [6]. WSN used in
    various application areas like health, military, home and also in commercial application
    like managing amount or quantity of items, supervising product quality, and supervising
    disaster areas [2], , , , [6]. Fig. 1. Applications of wireless sensor network
    Show All 1.1 Agriculture with WSN Indian economic mainly depends on the agriculture
    [7]. Therefore, irrigation is an important part in agriculture to supply water
    to cultivated areas. In the past people use traditional water resource like canal
    [9] and rainfall for irrigation. This technique leads to decrease the productivity
    due to under irrigation and over irrigation conditions. Therefore, there is a
    need to replace the conventional resource with automatic irrigation technology
    [8]. AIS perform irrigation task with no or minimum human intervention [10]. WSN
    can be used for real time monitoring and controlling the soil [8] and environmental
    parameter in AIS like soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, pH, groundwater,
    salinity level, humidity, light intensity, wind speed, wind direction. The low
    cost of WSN makes it easy for the farmer to implement AIS in their farm. This
    process saves the labor, time money, water resources and electricity [10]. All
    the information can be stored on a server where the system uses this data to alert
    the farmer by sending a SMS [10] on mobile phones [11]. SECTION II. Related Work
    Y. Kim et al., [12] proposed a design of decision support software named Wireless
    in-field sensing and Control (WISC) that give control of irrigation by different
    menu using graphical user interface. WISC software consists of four design factors.
    These are: Control panel dialog used for configure data interface for the irrigation
    control system. A graphical dialog used for remote supervising of WSN. A GPS based
    irrigation control provides real time supervising and control of irrigation operation.
    A nozzle on and off control system is implement to save the system from damage
    at the time of high pressure of water. If there is change in the location and
    crop according to season or climate change, the software is able to adapt the
    change due to its user-friendly graphical user interface. G. Vellidis et al. [13]
    developed a smart sensor array prototype for measuring parameters like moisture
    and temperature of soil for irrigation scheduling in cotton crop. The small sensor
    array comprises of multiple sensor nodes that installed in the field and a receiver
    that is located at center, connected to a laptop computer. The optimum amounts
    of water that can be apply to field determined by smart sensor array. The smart
    sensor array is useful with the VRI (variable-rate irrigation) system to optimize
    irrigation application. VRI is a control system that can be enables a central
    pivot irrigation system to deliver water in a field according to the need. F.
    J Pierce et al, 2007 [14] proposed region and on farm sensors network that provide
    real time monitoring and control of farming operations. Regional network designed
    for weather applications and on farm network for temperature monitoring for frost
    protection. For the transmission of data, the regional network uses master-repeater-slave
    topology and on farm network uses star topology. Susan A. O''Shaughnessy et al.
    [15] develops dynamic prescription maps to control irrigation of cotton. Prescription
    map is a set of instructions that controls a variable rate irrigation system.
    These instructions derive from plant feedback method using temperature-scaling
    algorithm and evaluate water stress of specific plot a CWSI (crop water stress
    index) integrated. Feedback control method used to schedule irrigation that provides
    higher irrigation treatment. During excessive amount of water, the water distribute
    in the field by increasing the stress threshold. During the irrigation season
    to fulfill the variable crop water requirements, a VRI system provides dynamic
    irrigation control instructions. Zhang Ruirui et al. [16] proposed energy efficient
    WSN system. This system worked in cotton field with a drip irrigation system.
    This system consists of sensor nodes that are battery powered, solar powered WSN-GPRS
    gateway and data manage server. The system collects soil moisture information
    and compress data using compression algorithm based on range quad tree that provides
    less transmission power of packets, reduces the redundant data, saves the energy
    of nodes and reduces radio power cost. The WSN-GPRS gateway receives packets and
    transmits to data management center, which is computer running WSN data management
    software where the data can be stored and analyzed or accessed by users. A power
    saving mode provides good flexibility to the network. The results show that by
    using this system, collection of soil moisture information can be achieved at
    large scale. Zhen Li et al. [17] represent a WSN based soil property monitoring
    system that implement in wheat field. The system consists of two tiers namely
    an in-field wireless sensor network (LWSN) is used to collect real time data like
    soil volumetric water content, temperature and bulk electrical conductivity. Second,
    a long range cellular communication network (LRCN) that is used to transmit the
    field data to remote database on an online server for data storage and the user
    create queries to use data. The system service quality intended based on the rate
    of average packet delivery and rate of valid data. During the test period for
    each sensor node both of them are above 95%. Jianfa Xia et al. [18] Design an
    environment monitoring system based on WSN for agriculture. This system gathers
    data like temperature, humidity etc. and transmits all data to the remote server
    via GPRS. A web based sub system is incorporated with Google maps and an alarm
    subsystem that provide SMS alarm service to the farmer. When the value of the
    parameter exceeds the threshold value, automatically alarmed the farmer by the
    system with SMS or voice format in mobile phones. The results show that system
    provides real time and perfect service for specific agriculture. Shining Li et
    al. [19] design precision agriculture monitoring system by real deployment of
    WSN based greenhouse that is implementing to take in current precision agriculture.
    Precision agriculture monitoring system (PAMS) is an smart system that can be
    used to examine agricultural environment of the crops and give services to the
    farmers by managing and monitoring growth period. The environmental information
    is useful for the farmer that can be provided by PAMS. Susan A. O''Shaughnessy
    et al. [20] design a prototype with a narrow field of view of wireless infrared
    sensor module to evaluate the performance of IRT sensor by comparing temperature
    data of an entity with blackbody calibrator in a forbidden temperature room at
    ambient temperature. Temperature data is collect at every 12s and stored at every
    minute. To increase the level of interaction between host applications and sensors,
    gathered data arranged in the application format. Various tests performed to achieve
    the correctness of wireless IRT and lessen qualms by checking errors in: Calibration,
    spot temperature comparison and continuous temperature comparison. The root mean
    square error value between the wireless IRT sensor reading and blackbody is intended
    for the greater part of sensors to indicate the detector''s temperature compensation
    algorithm is working well and communication range of IRT is improved by using
    RF module with external antenna and also improves the reliability of data communication
    by placing repeaters in WSN. Stefanos A. Nikolidakis et al. [21] proposed an incorporated
    system for automated irrigation for WSN. Wireless sensor nodes sense humidity,
    temperature, duration of sunshine and speed of the air and send to base station.
    System uses this data to observe the status of the soil moisture content and analyze
    irrigation operations in detail for decision-making process. All the collected
    information compared with the historical data. If the value of these parameters
    decreased than the historical data then it means that crop required less amount
    of water and if the value of the parameter increased than it means the crop requires
    more amount of water. Thus, by using the threshold value, system makes decision
    whether a crop required water or not. This proposed system consists of two subsystems
    such as wireless sensor network that collect data from the field and a subsystem,
    which involves the decision-making system. All the sensors are organizing in the
    form of the cluster, and choose cluster head, which minimize the total energy
    consumption. The focus is on the utilization of WSN to gather data via sensor
    nodes and to drive the data to the base station. Then the sensed data is used
    by AIS to irrigate the fields. This protocol offer energy efficiency and prolong
    the network lifetime. The simulation outcomes illustrate that network lifetime
    improves 1825 min using ECHERP protocol at 110 rounds and it provides energy efficiency
    using less amount of water. SECTION III. Proposed Methodology In our proposed
    system, we design AIS using WSN. We deploy sensor nodes in the field. Sensor nodes
    sense the soil temperature, sunlight, pH, relative humidity and groundwater parameters
    and different types of soil and crops at one time. Then sensor nodes send the
    sensed data to base station, where the data can be analyzes and meaningful data
    can save in the database and this data can be uses by the AIS to take decision
    about irrigation that whether a crop required water or not and how much amount
    of water required to the field. AIS analyze that different crops require different
    amounts of water based on different types of soils at one time. In this paper,
    we consider five crops and based on these crops measurement values show results
    that at one time different crops requires different amount of water by considering
    different soils. These crops are: Onion Crop Sugarcane Crop Cabbage Crop Tomato
    Crop Wheat Crop We also measure how much temperature, sunlight, pH, relative and
    groundwater level required to each crop and based on these values how much water
    required to a crop and also check whether there is a need to irrigate the field
    or not. 3.3 Characteristics of Proposed Methodology Easy to access. Low cost.
    Produce high productivity yield. Easy to understand. Reduce water consumption.
    Each crop requires different millimeter (mm) amount of water based on different
    parameters. These are describe in table 1 Table 1: Water required by each crop
    SECTION IV. Results 4.1 Performance Analysis We simulate the performance of proposed
    protocol in MATLAB by using different parameters like Soil temperature, relative
    humidity, sunlight, pH, and groundwater. Also in this paper, we compare LEACH
    Protocol with proposed protocol by calculating first node dead and last node dead
    at different initial energies of nodes. As we know efficiency of network can be
    improved by increasing its lifetime. Lifetime of network can be measured by the
    time until last node dies. Simulation results for first node dead at different
    initial energies for both LEACH protocol and proposed protocol are shown in Table
    2 and calculated last node dead at different initial energies is shown in Table
    3. Figure 4.1 and 4.2 shows the analytical graph of comparison of simulation values
    of lifetime of first node dead and lifetime of last node dead of both protocols.
    So when we compare the Proposed protocol to LEACH protocol we get that the first
    node of the LEACH protocol dead on 117 round whereas in proposed protocol the
    first node dead on 159 round when initial energy is 0.1. At initial energy 0.9
    the first node dead in proposed protocol on 1658 round but in LEACH protocol first
    node dead on 1433 round. Similarly for last node dead simulation results show
    that last node of proposed protocol dead on 6398 round and in LEACH protocol last
    node dead on 2966 round at initial energy 0.9. Thus, the simulation results show
    that proposed protocol is more efficient than LEACH protocol in each case. Fig.
    2. Lifetime of first node dead Show All Fig. 3. Lifetime of last node dead Show
    All Table 2: Lifetime of first node dead Table 3: Lifetime of last node dead 4.2
    Required Water Values Based on Different Parameters Values We have taken different
    parameters values as soil moisture, Sunlight and pH values, Humidity, and groundwater
    level and based on the values AIS make decision, as different type of crop required
    different amount of water. When the value of one of this parameter changes, the
    water requirements of a crop automatically change. In result, we consider: First
    crop as onion crop Second crop as sugarcane crop Third crop as cabbage crop Fourth
    crop as tomato crop Fifth crop as wheat crop. Table 4: Quantity of required water
    for each crop based on groundwater Table 5: Quantity of required water for each
    crop based on ph Table 6: Quantity of required water for each crop based on humidity
    Table 7: Quantity of required water for each crop based on sunlight Table 8: Quantity
    of required water for each crop based on temperature From the above different
    parameter and values show, that each crop requires different amount of water based
    on different parameters values. This amount of water change when there is a change
    occurs in parameters values. For example: When we have a value of temperature
    is 17 the onion crop requires 438 mm water and sugarcane crop requires 1417 mm
    water and cabbage crop requires 472 mm water and tomato crop requires 423 mm water
    and wheat crop requires 646mm water. SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Work The
    proposed AIS allow cultivation in places having shortage of water. AIS will reduce
    the wastage of water and save crop from unconditional seasons like rainfall condition
    and over-irrigated, less irrigated conditions. The irrigation system can be adjust
    to a multiplicity of precise crops needs and requires least maintenance. This
    will lead to increase in productivity of crop. In the future we improve our work
    by making reliable and energy efficient irrigation system for monitoring whole
    farm at a time using all parameter values such as soil temperature, soil humidity,
    air temperature, air humidity, duration of sunshine, salinity level, solar radiation,
    wind speed, wind direction, pressure, pH rainfall that return high value of the
    crop at low cost. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

  analysis: The paper offers a comprehensive overview of advanced irrigation techniques,
    with a focus on self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems and their potential
    for site-specific variable rate irrigation (SS-VRI). It highlights the ability
    of these systems to adjust water application depths spatially across a field,
    enabling the optimization of irrigation based on varying soil, crop, and other
    conditions. Although the paper primarily focuses on water management, it acknowledges
    the potential for integrating agrochemical applications through chemigation using
    these systems.

    Abstract Available supplies of water for irrigation and other uses are becoming
    more limited around the world, and this trend is accelerating. Emerging computerized
    precision irrigation technologies will enable growers to apply water and agrochemicals
    more precisely and site-specifically to match the status and needs of soil and
    plants as determined by the analysis of data from a variety of sensor networks,
    wireless communications systems and decision support systems. Speed control and
    zone control options for site-specific variable rate irritation (SS-VRI) system
    are currently available, with speed control the most common. Site-specific variable
    rate sprinkler irrigation systems are wonderful research tools that can provide
    maximum amounts of information from relatively small areas. A self-propelled SS-VRI
    sprinkler system has been developed for agricultural research applications and
    5 of these systems are now in use. This fully functional research machine has
    been used from 2005 to 2012 and has been very reliable. These SS-VRI systems offer
    many benefits for research and they have tremendous potential for a greater use
    in sprinkler irrigation systems worldwide for both in research and general practice
    to conserve water, fertilizer and energy. Keywords Precision agriculture Decision

    is facing a series of major challenges in providing sufficient food, fiber, and
    fuel to support a growing global population while our water resources, environmental
    health, and available arable land decline and climate changes. In agricultural
    ecosystems, physical and biological processes such as cycling of carbon, water,
    and nutrients are linked with social and economic processes. To achieve sustainability,
    it is essential that we understand how these processes interact, and their impacts
    on the environment through space and time. Innovative approaches will be needed
    to address these issues and maintain a safe and abundant food supply as the agronomic,
    economic and social problems facing production agriculture gain in complexity.
    Irrigation can be fundamentally characterized as a temporal adaptation to seasonal
    and annual variation in rainfall (Turral et al. 2010). Irrigation has shaped the
    economies of many semi-arid and arid areas around the world over many centuries.
    It has stabilized rural communities, increased income and provided many new opportunities
    for economic growth. These practices have enabled human habitation, at times quite
    dense populations, where it otherwise could not exist (Postel 1999). In short,
    irrigated crop production underpins large sections of current society and lifestyles
    throughout the world. Irrigated agricultural activities support diverse components
    of the world’s food chain and provide much of the fruit, vegetables and cereals
    consumed by humans plus the grain fed to animals that are used eventually as human
    food. It also provides much of the feed to sustain animals used for work in many
    parts of the world, and these lands provide considerable sources of food and foraging
    areas for migratory and local birds as well as other wildlife. Irrigated land
    constitutes approximately 18 % of the world’s total cultivated farmland, but currently
    produces more than 40 % of its food and fiber. However, irrigation of lands accounts
    for over 70 % of fresh water consumed in the world, and is also a major user of
    energy for farming operations and pumping. Nevertheless, output from irrigated
    agriculture will have to increase dramatically in the next few decades to help
    meet the projected world food requirements and to maintain food security and irrigation
    will necessarily continue to be a major part of world’s future agricultural production.
    The importance of water and its uneven geographical distribution has made its
    acquisition and use a matter of great contention between various users and nations.
    Population growth, rising standards of living and competing uses are forcing major
    changes in how fresh water is allocated. Agricultural water resources are also
    coming under increasing pressure from environmental and other social issues, including
    declining water tables in many areas, industrial and municipal pollution and escalating
    energy costs. In addition, there is also a persistent loss of arable land to soil
    salination, soil erosion and urbanization, which collectively emphasize the need
    to maximize total irrigated food productivity wherever possible. Thus, current
    water use patterns and practices may not be sustainable in many regions of the
    world. Reduced availability of water and energy for irrigated agriculture will
    require much greater levels of crop and water management than currently in use;
    but this will be difficult, if not impossible, without advanced irrigation methods.
    Higher levels of irrigation management and systems that enable greater efficiency
    of water use can potentially reduce operating costs as well as conserve energy,
    nutrients and water use. The potential to conserve water depends on the capabilities
    of the irrigation system and the commitment of the operator to implement timely
    water-saving practices and technologies (Schütze and Schmitz 2009). 2 Advanced
    Irrigation Systems There are basically three types of irrigation systems: surface
    (which flows by gravity), and pressurized micro and sprinkler systems. Surface
    (also called gravity) irrigation introduces water at the highest elevation point
    in a field and the water flows over the soil surface by gravity. Pressurized irrigation
    systems that include several types of microirrigation and sprinkler systems where
    water is conveyed by pressurized pipes or tubing to a point in the field where
    it is applied by various devices. In addition, pressurized systems commonly function
    as site-specific application methods for fertilizers and other agrochemicals (chemigation),
    which require appropriate management to avoid environmental contamination. Technology
    levels in all three types of systems vary widely, and they all have advantages
    and disadvantages (Hoffman et al. 2007). The design of a water application system
    will determine the maximum potential performance level, whereas management dictates
    the actual benefits realized and the magnitude of any positive or negative ecological
    impacts. Thus, the amount of water that can be conserved by advanced irrigation
    systems and practices depends on the ability of a particular type of irrigation
    system to implement various improved management strategies. Management skills
    are gained through education and technical assistance, but they are maintained
    by the irrigator’s commitment and economic incentives. 3 Microirrigation Methods
    Microirrigation includes drip and microsprinklers. It is a flexible set of technologies
    that can potentially be used on almost every crop, soil type and climatic zone
    if justified economically. It is characterized by the applications of water in
    small amounts using frequent irrigations (i.e. daily). It is also sometimes referred
    to as localized irrigation and can provide numerous crop production and water
    conservation benefits that address many of the water quality and supply challenges
    facing modern irrigated agriculture. Microirrigation acreage is increasing steadily
    worldwide and is fully expected to continue its rapid growth in the foreseeable
    future (Lamm et al. 2007). Novel applications for microirrigation systems, such
    as the reuse of municipal wastewater in turf areas, are providing new opportunities
    for growth. These systems can be laid on the soil surface or buried, and can be
    permanent or temporary installations. They can be used on gardens as well as in
    fields from 0.5 to more than 50 ha. Because of the relatively high capital cost
    of these advanced systems and the need for high levels of management, modern microirrigation
    technologies are typically permanent installations on small blocks of land (e.g.
    <10 ha) of intensively-managed, high-value specialty crops (e.g. vegetables, grapes,
    nuts, fruits and berries). Microirrigation could also become more common in perennial
    forage crops (i.e. alfalfa) and annual row crops such as maize using widely-spaced,
    buried drip lines in areas with limited water supplies or high water costs. Greenhouse
    culture is largely irrigated by microirrigation methods. Year around greenhouse
    production of fresh vegetables, cut flowers and other high-value crops is rapidly
    expanding with some of the largest increases occurring around the Mediterranean
    Basin. All the major factors affecting plant growth can be controlled and managed
    precisely in these conditions, including the environment, water, nutrients, pests
    and diseases. Thus, these growing systems provide the ultimate opportunities for
    the application of many PA concepts. Microirrigation systems are well suited for
    automated adaptive control with real-time sensor feedback and decision making
    capabilities. However, site-specific water management often occurs by default
    as a function of the scales of underlying environmental variability. Microirrigation
    systems are generally designed and installed in small blocks to match the needs
    of particular crop varieties or variations in soil texture and topography across
    a farm. Thus, additional site-specific irrigation within blocks may not be warranted,
    although it is technically possible. A low-cost microirrigation method called
    pitcher or clay pot irrigation (Siyal et al. 2009) is used on some small fields
    (e.g. <0.5 ha) in several areas in northern Africa and Middle East. This labor
    intensive method uses unglazed, porous clay pots which are buried in the ground
    up to their neck to irrigate individual plants (i.e. fruit and nut trees) that
    are typically spaced 1 m or more apart. There may be more than one pitcher per
    plant, which are filled manually with water on at least a daily basis. Water seeps
    out through the unglazed walls of the pitcher to irrigate the crop. The above
    discussion suggests that purposely designed pressurized microirrigation and sprinkler
    methods are the most suitable for advanced forms of site-specific irrigation.
    Of these, most of the following discussion will be directed towards self-propelled,
    continuous move sprinkler irrigation systems, which cover much larger areas than
    microirrigation methods and their use is rapidly expanding (Sadler et al. 2005;
    Evans and King 2012). 4 Self-Propelled Sprinkler Irrigation Systems Self-propelled
    sprinkler irrigation systems such as centre pivots and linear (also called lateral)
    move systems have allowed large scale agricultural development of marginal lands
    that were unsuitable for surface irrigation including areas with light sandy soil
    and a large variation in topography within the same field. These adaptable systems
    have experienced tremendous growth around the world over the past 50 years due
    to their: (1) potential for efficient and uniform water application; (2) high
    degree of automation requiring less labor than most other irrigation methods;
    (3) coverage of large areas; and (4) ability to apply water and labeled agrichemicals
    (chemigation) economically and safely over a wide range of soil, crop and topographic
    conditions. Similar to microirrigation, these systems apply limited amounts of
    water during each irrigation event and require frequent applications. A single
    machine can irrigate fields ranging from about 5 ha to over 200 ha. These large
    machines basically consist of a pipeline (lateral) mounted on motorized structures
    (towers) with large rubber tires. The section between the two towers is called
    a span, which can vary from about 30 to 70 m in length. Sprinkling devices are
    mounted on or below the pipe. Maximum application depths of water applied are
    controlled by varying the speed of machine travel. Field-scale water applications
    by these systems can be quite uniform. A center pivot machine basically rotates
    around a ‘pivot’ at one end, usually in the centre of the field. These continuously
    moving systems can irrigate areas ranging from part circle segments to whole circles.
    Various optional accessories are also available to irrigate portions of field
    corners. Self-propelled linear move sprinkler systems look and perform almost
    identically to centre pivot systems except that they move in straight lines to
    irrigate square- or rectangular-shaped fields. Linear move systems require a global
    positioning system (GPS) or other methods for physical guidance, and they require
    considerably greater management and manual oversight than centre pivot systems.
    Center pivot and linear move sprinkler systems are designed and generally operated
    so as to replace the average water used by the crop over the past few days as
    uniformly as possible across the field. Irrigations are frequent and apply relatively
    low amounts of water so that soil water is ideally maintained at relatively constant
    levels. Application rates and base uniformity are primarily established by the
    sprinkler nozzle package, but the depth of water applied per irrigation with self-propelled
    center pivots and linear move sprinkler systems is generally controlled by the
    travel speed of the machine. Traditionally, irrigation system design and management
    has strived for maximum uniformity of water applications over the entire irrigated
    field. However, agricultural fields are never physically or biologically uniform
    and substantial agronomic and environmental differences can occur. The effects
    of different spatial and temporal sources of variation on management can be additive,
    and the stochastic variation of several interrelated factors across a field can
    affect crop growth, yields and crop quality. Often, the underlying causes of crop
    performance variation are often not well understood, and they can vary substantially
    from field to field and year to year. Some sources of variation such as pest problems
    may have both temporal and spatial considerations. The high frequency of the irrigations
    under these machines potentially reduces the magnitude of variability in soil
    water content in the field. However, stochastic spatial and temporal variability
    of a number of other interrelated factors (e.g., variations in soil properties,
    topography, runoff, within field runoff (also called runon), pests, tillage, fertilization,
    uneven incident precipitation and hail, pesticide carryover effects, and herbicide
    drift from adjacent fields) across a field can still affect crop growth during
    the growing season and from one season to the next. These factors can influence
    management decisions over time, which may also introduce additional in-field variability
    to crop production. Consequently, the center pivot industry is beginning to market
    irrigation systems that can adjust for at least some of this spatial and temporal
    variability, which is typically referred to as site-specific variable rate irrigation
    (SS-VRI). Manufacturers are just starting to offer site-specific controls for
    linear move sprinkler systems. Kranz et al. (2012) has summarized characteristics
    of some of the various currently available commercial site-specific control systems
    and panels. SS-VRI can be defined as the ability to vary water application depths
    spatially across a field to address specific soil, crop and/or other conditions.
    It is included in the spectrum of precision agriculture technologies because advanced
    SS-VRI methods can potentially impose treatments in ways that optimize plant responses
    for each unit of water applied in different areas of the same field. It can also
    include site-specific applications of water-soluble agrochemicals including fertilizers.
    Irrigation management can amplify the negative effects of different sources of
    variation with a field or it can help to minimize these effects depending on the
    grower’s objectives. Site-specific irrigation management strategies can be justified
    to account for variation under non-uniform growing conditions. Reducing areas
    of excess water applications within a field will decrease the potential for runoff,
    limit the movement of nutrients and agrochemicals below the plant root zone and
    create conditions for improving crop yield and quality. Spatial and temporal variation
    can influence irrigation management decisions, and site-specific managers attempt
    to characterize the major sources of variation throughout the growing season.
    However, growers cannot practically manage for all of the many sources of variability.
    Therefore, they tend to group the most critical properties into relatively homogeneous
    management zones within a field as much as possible. Thus, different PA technologies
    may be managed simultaneously at different scales in the same field. For example,
    the smallest zone that a large scale farmer (e.g. >20 ha fields) prefers to manage
    for irrigation is probably in the order of about 5 ha even though other PA technologies
    (e.g. planting and spraying) will often be managed at much smaller scales (e.g.
    0.1 ha). These factors can also accelerate localized leaching of soil nutrients
    and other agrichemicals past the root zone. Field variability can result in excessive
    energy use for pumping, affect irrigation system design initially, and, later,
    management decisions. Furthermore, some management decisions may introduce additional
    sources of within-field variability. Self-propelled center pivot and linear move
    sprinkler irrigation systems are particularly amenable to site-specific approaches
    because of their current levels of automation and large area coverage with a single
    lateral pipe. The definition of sprinklers in these applications includes the
    use of LEPA, bubblers, sprayers, spinners and other related spray techniques to
    apply water. These devices are usually on drop tubes in or just above the crop
    canopy. Impact type sprinklers are generally not included because the methods
    used to vary applied depths of water (e.g., pulse modulation) on commercial systems
    are not compatible in practice. The ability to vary water application along the
    main lateral of a center-pivot system based on position in the field allows the
    field manager to address specific soil and/or slope conditions and avoid areas
    of over- or under irrigation, depending on preset management criteria. By aligning
    irrigation water application with variable water requirements in the field, total
    water use may be reduced, decreasing deep percolation and surface runoff. Reducing
    excess water applications will decrease the potential to move nutrients past the
    plant root zone (Sadler et al. 2000, 2005; King et al. 2009), and fungal disease
    pressure should also decrease. Site-specific application technologies can be used
    to treat small areas of a field with simple on/off sprinkler controls in single
    span-wide treatment areas or to treat the whole field by controlling all spans.
    Thus, site-specific irrigation can potentially provide water conservation benefits
    in cases of overirrigation, erroneous irrigation scheduling, in-season precipitation
    harvesting, or inefficiencies associated with particular crop production practices
    (e.g., potatoes). Some examples of water conservation strategies under full ET
    conditions (minimal water stress throughout season) where site-specific applications
    are potentially able to reduce total water applied include: A major cause of excessive
    water applications can occur when dry areas appear in a center-pivot irrigated
    field; irrigators tend to run the irrigation systems longer and more often to
    ensure adequate water across the whole field. These poor management practices
    result in much of the area being over-irrigated, and large amounts of water are
    wasted to compensate for suspected drought in relatively small areas. Site-specifically
    varying water applications can assist in addressing the management decisions that
    lead to localized, within-field drought and help conserve water, but they do not
    address the root causes. Water can also be conserved by applying less water to
    hillsides to reduce within-field runoff to low areas, to improve yields by eliminating
    water ponding in low areas, or to purposefully manage wet areas to reduce the
    extent of waterlogging problems. Water application amounts are generally high
    for the first span from the pivot point to the first tower even though application
    rates are low because it moves much more slowly than the outer towers. This area
    is typically either overwatered by as much as 20 %, because the available nozzle
    selections do not allow for the correct application of water, or too dry since
    the nozzles are very small and prone to plugging. The often-wetted foliage in
    this area also has higher incidences of fungal diseases. One option is to turn
    off every other sprinkler along the first span for one or two rotations, and then
    turn on the sprinklers that are off and turn off the sprinklers that are on for
    one or two rotations. Another approach to eliminate both the overwatering and
    plugging problems within the first span area is to use relatively large nozzle
    sizes and site-specifically pulse the sprinklers on and off, applying the desired
    amount over time. Reduce or eliminate irrigation in wet areas in a field that
    develop from precipitation runoff, subsurface flow, high water table, springs,
    or unavoidable irrigation runoff. Manage soil water deficits on a spatial basis
    to maximize the opportunity to capture in-season precipitation in humid climates
    for subsequent use as crop evapotranspiration. The development of control and
    management technologies that can spatially and temporally direct the amount and
    frequency of appropriate agrochemical applications by site-specific self-propelled
    irrigation systems could also be very powerful tools that could increase productivity
    while reducing total water applications and minimizing adverse water quality impacts.
    Evans and King (2012) conducted an analysis of several published simulation studies
    comparing conventional and SS-VRI management and reported water savings of 0–26
    %. Ironically for well-watered crop production, water savings from site-specific
    irrigation may be greatest in humid climates by spatially optimizing use of non-uniform
    growing season precipitation. In arid and semi-arid climates, the greatest potential
    water savings could come from highly managed deficit irrigation strategies (managed
    drought stress). 5 Site-Specific Sprinkler Irrigation Technologies Recent innovations
    in low-voltage sensor and wireless radio frequency (RF) data communications combined
    with advances in Internet technologies offer tremendous opportunities for development
    and application of real-time management systems for agriculture. These have enabled
    implementation of advanced state-of-the-art water conservation measures with self-propelled
    sprinkler systems such as SS-VRI for economically viable, broad scale crop production
    with full or limited water supplies. SS-VRI technologies use many of the same
    management tools as other precision agriculture technologies, and make it possible
    to vary water and agrochemical (chemigation) applications to meet the specific
    needs of a crop in each unique zone within a field. However, site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation technologies and strategies are not a silver bullet for conserving
    water and energy; and they must also be integrated with other state-of-the-art
    farming technologies for maximum potential benefit (Sadler et al. 2005). Basically,
    any water application device used on self-propelled sprinkler systems can be utilized
    for site-specific management of water and agrichemicals applied by the irrigation
    system. Water application methods commonly used on self-propelled sprinkler irrigation
    systems are high elevation sprinkler (usually impact style) head applications
    mounted on the top of the main pipe and medium elevation spray application heads
    (MESA), low elevation spray application heads (LESA) and low energy precision
    application (LEPA) methods. MESA is the most common method used on self-propelled
    irrigation systems in northern Great Plains region. Early work on LEPA was directed
    towards achieving relatively uniform application depths (Lyle and Bordovsky 1981,
    1983, 1995; Bordovsky et al. 2003). Schneider (2000) reported that LEPA could
    potentially achieve application efficiencies greater than 95 % and that MESA was
    about 85 % depending on management. Application depths on self-propelled sprinkler
    systems are generally controlled by the speed of the machine. However, this is
    not sufficient under site-specific conditions where variable amounts are needed
    along the length of the machine. It is possible to control every sprinkler individually,
    but the management level may increase to the point that the system is not practical
    because growers probably cannot manage areas less than 0.4–0.5 ha within a field
    in other cultural aspects of their operation. However, individual sprinkler control
    would allow more accurate site-specific applications to irregularly shaped areas.
    Increasing the number of sprinklers per bank would decrease cost, but the control
    system would lose some ability to adequately match pre-selected treatment areas.
    Controlling sprinkler heads in groups 10–15 m wide is generally a practical compromise
    to match operational limits (Evans et al. 2000; Sadler et al. 2000). Types of
    SS-VRI Sprinkler Irrigation Systems. In the past few years some commercial companies
    began marketing center pivot control panels with an option to change center pivot
    travel speed in increments ranging from 1 to 10° as the machine rotates around
    the field. This tactic effectively changes application depths in each defined
    radial sector of the field, and no additional hardware is needed compared to a
    standard machine (some may need a GPS). This practice is commonly referred to
    as speed or sector control. It could also be referred to as variable depth irrigation,
    although some erroneously refer to it as variable rate irrigation. Nevertheless,
    field variability seldom occurs in long, narrow triangular-shaped parcels and
    adjusting machine speed may not always be a sufficient level of control because
    soil and crop conditions often vary substantially in the radial direction. Consequently,
    center pivot manufacturers are also offering site-specific variable rate irrigation
    systems that can differentially apply water site-specifically to irregularly shaped
    areas or management zones. This is referred to as zone control. Specialized equipment
    such as control, panels, many valves, supplemental wiring and a GPS are required
    to control the irrigation in each management zone. Most zone control SS-VRI systems
    vary water application depths by various forms of pulse modulation (on–off cycling
    of spray-type sprinkler heads) for a given machine speed. Valves are located on
    every sprinkler head or groups of heads. Water is then applied to each zone by
    controlling water output amounts from each group of heads along the length of
    the machine depending on their location in the field. Zone control has a larger
    potential for achieving efficient management of water and energy than speed control,
    and is the general focus of this paper. The most common site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation systems in use today are speed control systems, and it is anticipated
    that much of the short term growth will likely occur with these types of systems.
    Speed control technologies are probably being used close to their technical capacity
    to improve water productivity at this time. However, zone control systems can
    achieve the same effects provided by speed control, but with greater flexibility
    and provide more management options (Evans et al. 2012, 2013). Site-specific control
    systems manage water application amounts by controlling individual or grouped
    sprinkler nozzle assemblies. These technologies can be used to treat predefined
    large areas in a whole field or a range of small areas within a field with simple
    on/off sprinkler controls. Small area (e.g., 0.5–10 ha) site-specific systems
    can be used to address issues in well defined, localized problem areas where the
    cost of a full precision irrigation control system may not be justified such as
    under the first span from the pivot point to avoid overirrigation or minimize
    foliar disease incidence in that area. These technologies can also be used to
    treat diverse areas of varying sizes within a large field by variably controlling
    groups of sprinkler heads across all spans as the machine moves. SS-VRI Systems
    for Agricultural Research. There is little doubt that SS-VRI systems are wonderful
    research tools. They can be used to adjust water applications for artificial variability
    (e.g., research treatments) on top of natural variability within a field. For
    example, these systems could serve as an efficient, replicated screening method
    to identify drought and heat tolerance of various genotypes at a number of different
    locations to advance crop breeding efforts. SS-VRI systems could also be established
    to impose a range of abiotic stresses (deficit irrigation) using a line source
    sprinkler concept to develop water production functions (yields vs. range of available
    water). Another use would be to evaluate the effects of various degrees of potential
    climate change in different area on various cropping systems by simulating changing
    rainfall patterns and other conditions. SS-VRI research systems can be used to
    develop and test sensor networks that measure crop response to abiotic (e.g.,
    water deficits) and biotic (e.g., insect and disease) stresses for improved management.
    Data from these types of experiments would also be quite beneficial in developing
    and testing various models and strategies for automatic control of commercial
    SS-VRI systems. A case study of a SS-VRI system currently being used for agricultural
    research is presented below. 6 Case Study of SS-VRI Systems for Agricultural Research
    An example of research using SS-VRI system for research is a project conducted
    on a 4 ha field at the Montana State University (MSU) Eastern Agricultural Research
    Center) farm (near Sidney, MT (47.73º N, 104.15º W) over five years from 2005
    through 2009. The site-specific irrigation control system was designed to implement
    research comparing tillage method (strip till vs clean, conventional till) by
    irrigation method (LEPA vs MESA) in a two year, irrigated crop rotation of sugar
    beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and malting barley (Hordeum vulgare). The soil was classified
    as a relatively heavy Savage clay loam (fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls)
    with 21 % sand, 46 % silt, and 33 % clay. Average field slope was about 0.5 %
    to the east. The research was laid out in fifteen east–west strips parallel to
    the bi-directional travel of the linear move irrigation system (Fig. 1). Fourteen
    of these strips were used for research, but all fifteen were capable of site-specific
    irrigation. Each research strip was divided into four plots with two plots irrigated
    with MESA and two with LEPA for a total of 56 plots. Each 15 m by 24 m plot including
    buffers was planted either to sugar beet or malting barley, which alternated from
    year to year. Half of the plots were irrigated with MESA and the others with LEPA
    each year. There were 15 m alleys across the middle and ends of the block for
    turning farm equipment, and 1.2 m wide alleys between the sides of all plots.
    Fig. 1 Plot layout diagram of the field where the site-specific controls were
    implemented (Evans et al. 2010) Full size image All plots were irrigated with
    a Valley (Valmont Industries, Inc., Valley, NE) 244 m, 5 span, self-propelled
    linear move sprinkler irrigation system including the cart, which was installed
    in the spring of 2003. A diesel engine powered an electrical generator (480 V,
    3 phase) was located on the cart that provided electricity for the tower motors,
    cart motors, irrigation water pump, air compressor and control valves. A buried
    wire alignment system was used with antennas located in the middle of the machine.
    The linear move machine used a screened floating pump intake in a level ditch
    as its water supply. Nominal operating pressure was about 250 kPa. Two double
    direction boom backs were installed at each of the towers (although not at the
    cart) because the machine irrigated in both directions. Spans were 48.8 m in length
    except for the center span with the guidance system which was a 47.5 m span. The
    machine moved at about 2.1 m min−1 at the 100 % setting. A Valley CAMS Pro control
    panel (Valmont Industries, Valley, NE) was used to turn the machine on or off
    and control machine ground speed. A separate programmable logic controller (PLC)
    was designed and fabricated with the purpose of being able to irrigate every plot
    with either MESA or with LEPA. Individual, pneumatically activated solenoid valves
    were installed on every sprinkler head and controlled in banks of five MESA or
    thirteen LEPA heads. The PLC-based control system activated grouped networks of
    electric over air-activated control valves. Thirty 15-meter wide banks of sprinklers
    were controlled with this system (15 MESA banks, 15 LEPA banks.) Both the depth
    and method of irrigation were varied depending on the location of each plot in
    the field. When not being used, low-cost pneumatic cylinders lifted the LEPA heads
    above the MESA heads to avoid spray interference when the MESA is operating over
    a given plot width and length (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Photograph of the LEPA heads lifted
    above the crop canopy and avoiding interference with the MESA spray head water
    distribution patterns and LEPA heads in operation in the adjacent strip (Evans
    et al. 2010) Full size image The amount of water applied was adjusted by pulsing
    heads on and off (pulse modulation) to achieve a target depth based on a digital
    map stored in the PLC (or in a remote base computer) of depths for each nozzle
    location as the machine moved down the field. Water was applied to meet the calculated
    actual evapotranspiration of each crop using data from a nearby agricultural weather
    station reconciled with weekly neutron probe soil moisture readings. Equivalent
    depths of water were applied for both irrigation methods for the same crop. Distributed
    Sensor Systems and Control. A distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) was integrated
    into the existing site-specific linear move sprinkler irrigation system described
    above. Field conditions were monitored by six in-field sensor stations with Campbell
    CR200 dataloggers (Campbell Scientific, Inc, Logan, UT) distributed across the
    field based on a soil property map and monitored soil moisture, soil temperature,
    and air temperature. The CS616 water content reflectometers (Campbell Scientific,
    Inc, Logan, UT) were calibrated with a neutron probe and individually identified
    for their response ranges at each zone. All in-field sensory data were sampled
    on 10 s intervals. A nearby weather station monitors micrometeorological information
    on the field, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed,
    wind direction, and solar radiation. Communication signals from the sensor network,
    weather station and PLC irrigation controller to the base station were successfully
    interfaced using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication. Results. The
    overall focus of the project was to assess the environmental impacts of cultural
    practices and improved management of water, nutrient, and chemical applications
    as part of a multi-year team project involving several scientists from the location.
    Practical application of site-specific irrigation technologies with the variability
    of the research combined with natural variability is certainly more complicated
    and more challenging than general site-specific field irrigation. This project
    illustrates it is possible to effectively install and operate precision site-specific
    irrigation systems on self-propelled linear move and center pivot systems. The
    knowledge of soil variability within a field is fundamental to the development
    of site-specific management areas since different soils have different water holding
    capacities. The ability to vary water application along the main lateral of the
    linear move based on position in the field allows researchers as well as producers
    to address specific soil, crop, and/or special research conditions/treatments.
    By aligning irrigation water applications with variable water requirements in
    the field, total water use may be reduced, decreasing deep percolation and surface
    run off. Reducing excess water applications will decrease the potential to move
    nutrients past the plant root zone and fungal disease pressure should also decrease.
    Cropping systems that more efficiently utilize soil water have been shown to reduce
    costs and energy use as well as reduce water quality concerns. There is still
    a need to develop more efficient methods of site-specifically applying crop amendments
    (e.g., nutrients, pesticides) through self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems
    to reduce total amounts applied, improve profit margins and reduce adverse environmental
    impacts. References Bordovsky JP, Lascano RJ (2003) Variable rate irrigation using

  title: Advanced Technologies for Irrigated Cropping Systems
  verbatim_quote1: '"SS-VRI can be defined as the ability to vary water application
    depths spatially across a field to address specific soil, crop and/or other conditions.'
  verbatim_quote2: '"It is included in the spectrum of precision agriculture technologies
    because advanced SS-VRI methods can potentially impose treatments in ways that
    optimize plant responses for each unit of water applied in different areas of
    the same field.'
  verbatim_quote3: '"Site-specific irrigation management strategies can be justified
    to account for variation under non-uniform growing conditions.'

    \ for quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations of vegetation cover, vigor, and\
    \ growth dynamics, among other applications. These indices have been widely\n\
    implemented within RS applications using different airborne and satellite platforms\
    \ with recent advances using Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAV). Up to date, there\
    \ is no unified mathematical expression that defines all VIs due to the complexity\
    \ of different light\nspectra combinations, instrumentation, platforms, and resolutions\
    \ used. Therefore, customized algorithms have been developed\nand tested against\
    \ a variety of applications according to specific mathematical expressions that\
    \ combine visible light radiation,\nmainly green spectra region, from vegetation,\
    \ and nonvisible spectra to obtain proxy quantifications of the vegetation surface.\
    \ In\nthe real-world applications, optimization VIs are usually tailored to the\
    \ specific application requirements coupled with appropriate\nvalidation tools\
    \ and methodologies in the ground. The present study introduces the spectral characteristics\
    \ of vegetation and\nsummarizes the development of VIs and the advantages and\
    \ disadvantages from different indices developed. This paper reviews\nmore than\
    \ 100 VIs, discussing their specific applicability and representativeness according\
    \ to the vegetation of interest, environment,\nand implementation precision. Predictably,\
    \ research, and development of VIs, which are based on hyperspectral and UAV platforms,\n\
    would have a wide applicability in different areas.\n1. Introduction\nRemote sensed\
    \ information of growth, vigor, and their\ndynamics from terrestrial vegetation\
    \ can provide extremely\nuseful insights for applications in environmental monitoring,\n\
    biodiversity conservation, agriculture, forestry, urban green\ninfrastructures,\
    \ and other related fields. Specifically, these\ntypes of information applied\
    \ to agriculture provide not only\nan objective basis (depending on resolution)\
    \ for the macro-\nand micromanagement of agricultural production but also in\n\
    many occasions the necessary information for yield estima-\ntion of crops [1].\
    \ These latter applications have been devel-\noped to be a well-known discipline\
    \ category, precision agri-\nculture, which could be tracked back to three decades\
    \ ago [1].\nHowever, the applicability of remote sensing and its different\nVIs\
    \ extracted from these techniques usually relies heavily on\nthe instruments and\
    \ platforms to determine which solution\nis best to get a particular issue.\n\
    1.1. Remote Sensing Platform Considerations. In terms of\nplatforms, the advantages\
    \ of satellite based remote sensing\ninclude high spatial resolution, which makes\
    \ possible the\nextraction of long time data series of consistent and compa-\n\
    rable data, which can be cost effective [2]. Furthermore, some\nsatellite platforms\
    \ have free access to visible and multispectral\ndata, such as Landsat 7-8. However,\
    \ there are two main prob-\nlems with these platforms for precision agriculture\
    \ applica-\ntions, which are related to the per pixel resolution (30 m2 per\n\
    pixel for Landsat and 500 m2 for MODIS) and the orbit period\n(16 d for Landsat\
    \ and 26 d for SPOT). More recently, pixel\nresolution has been increased by newer\
    \ satellites, such as\nWorldView-2 and -3 (DigitalGlobe, Longmont, CO, USA).\n\
    WorldView-2 was the first commercial high resolution satel-\nlite to provide eight\
    \ spectral sensors in the visible to near\ninfrared range. Along with the four\
    \ typical multispectral\nbands: blue (450–510 nm), green (510–580 nm), red (630–\n\
    690 nm), and near infrared (NIR) (770–895 nm), each sensor\nHindawi\nJournal of\
    \ Sensors\nVolume 2017, Article ID 1353691, 17 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1353691\n\
    2\nJournal of Sensors\nis narrowly focused on a particular range of the electromag-\n\
    netic spectrum that is sensitive to a particular feature from\nthe ground or a\
    \ property of the atmosphere. However, images\nfrom this platform can be cost\
    \ prohibitive for long time data\nseries studies.\nThe second problem with satellite\
    \ based remote sensing\nis the revisitation time, which is 16 days in average,\
    \ which\nmakes the agricultural applications difficult, specifically those\nrelated\
    \ to water and nutrient management. Moreover, passive\nsensors cannot penetrate\
    \ clouds; therefore, there is no usable\ndata capture for overcast days.\nTo solve\
    \ these two main problems, airborne and more\nrecently UAV platforms can be used.\
    \ The former can also be\ncost prohibitive due to the requirement of expensive\
    \ aircrafts\nand pilots. The latter has become almost of ubiquitous use in\nthe\
    \ last five years with affordable aircrafts and camera pay-\nloads ranging from\
    \ visible, near and thermal infrared, and 3D\nLIDAR, which has been referred to\
    \ as Unmanned Aerial\nSystem (UAS). Among UAS platforms, there are mainly fixed\n\
    wing and multirotor options available. There is a compromise\nusing these UAS\
    \ platforms in relation to payload weight\nversus flying time. In general, longer\
    \ flying time achieved\nby fixed wing systems demands lighter weight payloads.\
    \ For\nexample, small high definition visible cameras weighting less\nthan 300\
    \ grams as payload of a fixed wing UAS allow it to\nfly for around two hours using\
    \ currently available battery-\npower [3]. On the contrary, battery-powered multirotor\
    \ UAS\nwith higher payload capacity have reduced fly time that at the\nmoment\
    \ is around 15- to 25-minute duration. Using these\nUAS, higher spatial and temporal\
    \ data resolution can be\nachieved, which makes possible precision agriculture\
    \ appli-\ncations to the submeter resolution per pixel. This allows\nresearch\
    \ and practical applications applied to growth and\nvigor dynamic assessment,\
    \ plant water status sensing for\nirrigation scheduling applications, and evapotranspiration\n\
    modelling, among others [4–9].\n1.2. Remote Sensing and Vegetation Indices. Remote\
    \ sensing\nof vegetation is mainly performed by obtaining the electro-\nmagnetic\
    \ wave reflectance information from canopies using\npassive sensors. It is well\
    \ known that the reflectance of light\nspectra from plants changes with plant\
    \ type, water content\nwithin tissues, and other intrinsic factors [10]. The reflectance\n\
    from vegetation to the electromagnetic spectrum (spectral\nreflectance or emission\
    \ characteristics of vegetation) is deter-\nmined by chemical and morphological\
    \ characteristics of the\nsurface of organs or leaves [3]. The main applications\
    \ for\nremote sensing of vegetation are based on the following light\nspectra:\
    \ (i) the ultraviolet region (UV), which goes from\n10 to 380 nm; (ii) the visible\
    \ spectra, which are composed\nof the blue (450–495 nm), green (495−570 nm), and\
    \ red\n(620–750 nm) wavelength regions; and (iii) the near and mid\ninfrared band\
    \ (850–1700 nm) [11, 12]. The emissivity rate of\nthe surface of leaves (equivalent\
    \ to the absorptivity in the\nthermal waveband) of a fully grown green plant without\
    \ any\nbiotic or abiotic stress is generally in the range of 0.96–0.99\nand is\
    \ more often between 0.97 and 0.98 [13]. On the contrary,\nfor dry plants, the\
    \ emissivity rate generally has a larger range\ngoing from 0.88 to 0.94 [13].\
    \ Vegetation emissivity in the near\nand mid infrared regions has been widely\
    \ studied within plant\ncanopies. Indices extracted from this light spectra range\
    \ can\nbe attributed to a range of characteristics beyond growth and\nvigor quantification\
    \ of plants related to water content, pig-\nments, sugar and carbohydrate content,\
    \ protein content, and\naromatics, among others [2, 14]. Different applications\
    \ are\ndependent on the reflectivity peaks or overtones for specific\ncompounds\
    \ within the visible and near/mid infrared regions\nof light spectra [14, 15].\
    \ Plant reflectivity in the thermal infra-\nred spectral range (8–14 \U0001D707\
    m) follows the blackbody radiation\nlaw [16], which allows interpreting plant\
    \ emission as directly\nrelated to plant temperature. Hence, indices obtained\
    \ from\nthis spectra range can be used as a proxy to assess stomata\ndynamics\
    \ that regulates transpiration rate of plants. There-\nfore, the later indices\
    \ can be used as indicator of plant water\nstatus [17–19] and abiotic/biotic stress\
    \ levels [20, 21].\nThe latter considerations demonstrate that the quantita-\n\
    tive interpretation of remote sensing information from vege-\ntation is a complex\
    \ task. Many studies have limited this inter-\npretation by extracting vegetation\
    \ information using individ-\nual light spectra bands or a group of single bands\
    \ for data\nanalysis. Thus, researchers often combine the data from near\ninfrared\
    \ (0.7–1.1 m) and red (0.6–0.7 m) bands in different\nways according to their\
    \ specific objectives [2]. These types\nof combinations present many disadvantages\
    \ (e.g., lack of\nsensitivity) by using single or limited group of bands to detect,\n\
    for example, vegetation biomass. These limitations are par-\nticularly evident\
    \ when trying to apply these types of VI on\nheterogeneous canopies, such as horticultural\
    \ tree planta-\ntions. A mixed combination of soils, weeds, cover crops in the\n\
    interrow, and the plants of interest makes the discrimination\nregions of interest\
    \ and extraction of simple VI very difficult,\nspecifically, when the vegetation\
    \ of interest has different\nVIs due to spatial variability, or VIs corresponding\
    \ to other\nvegetation (weeds and cover crop), which can be similar to\nthose\
    \ of interest. The later will complicate imaging denoising\nand filtering processes.\
    \ Several image analysis techniques and\nalgorithms have been developed to go\
    \ around these issues,\nwhich will be described later. Even though there are many\n\
    considerations as described before, the construction of simple\nVI algorithm could\
    \ many times render simple and effective\ntools to measure vegetation status on\
    \ the surface of the Earth\n[6].\n2. Vegetation Indices and Validation Process\n\
    With the use of high resolution spectral instrumentation, the\nnumber of bands\
    \ obtained by remote sensing is increasing,\nand the bandwidth is getting narrower\
    \ [7]. One of the most\nused and implemented indices calculated from multispectral\n\
    information as normalized ratio between the red and near\ninfrared bands is the\
    \ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index\n(NDVI) [22]. A direct use of NDVI is\
    \ to characterize canopy\ngrowth or vigor; hence, many studies have compared it\
    \ with\nthe Leaf Area Index (LAI) [23], where LAI is defined as the\narea of single\
    \ sided leaves per area of soil [24].\nVegetation information from remote sensed\
    \ images is\nmainly interpreted by differences and changes of the green\nleaves\
    \ from plants and canopy spectral characteristics. The\nJournal of Sensors\n3\n\
    most common validation process is through direct or indirect\ncorrelations between\
    \ VIs obtained and the vegetation charac-\nteristics of interest measured in situ,\
    \ such as vegetation cover,\nLAI, biomass, growth, and vigor assessment. More\
    \ estab-\nlished methods are used to assess VIs using direct and geo-\nreferenced\
    \ methods by monitoring sentinel plants to be com-\npared with VIs obtained from\
    \ the same plants for calibration\npurposes.\nThe later process is known as allometric\
    \ measurements\nand requires destructive methods to scan specific area of total\n\
    leaves per plant or tree in the case of LAI [25]. Indirect vali-\ndation methods\
    \ are based on proximal instrumentation using\nthe same or similar spectral instrumentation\
    \ to assess georef-\nerenced sentinel plants at the same angle as the aerial plat-\n\
    forms. The latter method is useful to compare VIs obtained\nfrom satellite that\
    \ are sensitive to atmospheric effects and\nserve as a mean to obtain correction\
    \ factors. More recent indi-\nrect methods based on cover photography to estimate\
    \ canopy\ncover, LAI, porosity, and clumping index have used auto-\nmated analysis\
    \ methods.\nFor this purpose, upward looking cover photogrammetry\nat zero zenith\
    \ angle is taken with visible cameras to obtain\ncanopy architecture parameters\
    \ calculated using computer\nvision algorithms. An automated image acquisition\
    \ and cal-\nculation method was proposed by Fuentes et al. 2008 applied\nto Eucalyptus\
    \ trees [26] and it has been successfully applied\nfor other crops such as grapevines\
    \ compared to allometric\nmeasurements and to validate NDVI calculated from satellite\n\
    information (WorldView-2) [27], apple trees with increased\naccuracy by using\
    \ a variable light extinction coefficient (\U0001D458)\n[28], and cherry trees\
    \ improving the method by extracting\nnonleaf material such as branches for tall\
    \ trees [29, 30]. In\nlate 2015, a computer application (App) for smartphones\
    \ and\ntablet PCs called VitiCanopy was released for free use to\nassess canopy\
    \ architecture parameters using the cover pho-\ntography automated algorithms,\
    \ which can be applied to any\nother tree crop by changing to a specific \U0001D458\
    \ value [31, 32]. Other\nApps using RGB photogrammetry to assess LAI have been\n\
    later developed such as PoketLAI [33–35].\n2.1. Basic Vegetation Indices. Jordan\
    \ [36] proposed in 1969\none of the first VIs named Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI),\n\
    which is based on the principle that leaves absorb relatively\nmore red than infrared\
    \ light; RVI can be expressed mathe-\nmatically as\nRVI =\n\U0001D445\nNIR,\n\
    (1)\nwhere NIR is the near infrared band reflectance and \U0001D445 is\nred band\
    \ reflectance. According to the spectral characteristics\nof vegetation, bushy\
    \ plants have low reflectance on the red\nband and have shown a high correlation\
    \ with LAI, Leaf Dry\nBiomass Matter (LDBM), and chlorophyll content of leaves\n\
    [37]. The RVI is widely used for green biomass estimations\nand monitoring, specifically,\
    \ at high density vegetation cov-\nerage, since this index is very sensitive to\
    \ vegetation and has a\ngood correlation with plant biomass. However, when the\
    \ veg-\netation cover is sparse (less than 50% cover), RVI is sensitive\nto atmospheric\
    \ effects, and their representation of biomass is\nweak.\nThe Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (DVI) was proposed\nlater [38] and can be expressed as\nDVI = NIR − \U0001D445\
    .\n(2)\nThe DVI is very sensitive to changes in soil background; it\ncan be applied\
    \ to monitoring the vegetation ecological envi-\nronment. Thus, DVI is also called\
    \ Environmental Vegetation\nIndex (EVI).\nThe Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI)\
    \ [38] is a\nsimulation of the Green Vegetation Index (GVI) in \U0001D445, NIR\
    \ 2D\ndata. In the NIR − \U0001D445 coordinate system, the spectral response\n\
    from soil is presented as a slash (soil brighten line). The latter\neffect can\
    \ be explained as the soil presents a high spectral\nresponse in the NIR and \U0001D445\
    \ bands. The distance between the\npoint of reflectivity (\U0001D445, NIR) and\
    \ the soil line has been defined\nas the Perpendicular VI, which can be expressed\
    \ as follows:\nPVI = √(\U0001D70Csoil − \U0001D70Cveg)\n2\n\U0001D445 − (\U0001D70C\
    soil − \U0001D70Cveg)\n2\nNIR,\n(3)\nwhere \U0001D70Csoil is the soil reflectance;\
    \ \U0001D70Cveg is the vegetation\nreflectivity; PVI characterizes the vegetation\
    \ biomass in \U0001D70Cred\nthe soil background; the greater the distance, the\
    \ greater the\nbiomass.\nPVI can also be quantitatively expressed as\nPVI = (DNNIR\
    \ − \U0001D44F) cos \U0001D703 − DN\U0001D445 ∗ sin \U0001D703,\n(4)\nwhere DNNIR\
    \ and DN\U0001D445 are the radiation reflected luminance\nvalues from the NIR\
    \ and \U0001D445, respectively; \U0001D44F is the intercept\nof the soil baseline\
    \ and the vertical axis of NIR reflectivity;\nand \U0001D703 is the angle between\
    \ the horizontal axis of \U0001D445 reflectivity\nand soil baseline. PVI filters\
    \ out in this way the effects of\nsoil background in an efficient manner; PVI\
    \ also has less\nsensitivity to atmospheric effects and it is mainly used for\n\
    the inversion of surface vegetation parameter (grass yield,\nchlorophyll content),\
    \ the calculation of LAI, and vegetation\nidentification and classification [39,\
    \ 40]. However, PVI is\nsensitive to soil brightness and reflectivity, especially\
    \ in the\ncase of low vegetation coverage and needs to be adjusted for\nthis effect\
    \ [41].\nAs mentioned before, the Normalized Difference Vege-\ntation Index (NDVI)\
    \ is the most widely used as VI; it was\nproposed by Rouse Jr. et al. [42], which\
    \ can be expressed as\nNDVI = (\U0001D70CNIR − \U0001D70C\U0001D445)\n\U0001D70C\
    NIR\n+ \U0001D70C\U0001D445.\n(5)\nSince the index is calculated through a normalization\
    \ proce-\ndure, the range of NDVI values is between 0 and 1, having a\nsensitive\
    \ response to green vegetation even for low vegetation\ncovered areas. This index\
    \ is often used in research related to\nregional and global vegetation assessments\
    \ and was shown to\nbe related not only to canopy structure and LAI but also to\n\
    canopy photosynthesis [43, 44]. However, NDVI is sensitive\nto the effects of\
    \ soil brightness, soil color, atmosphere, cloud\nand cloud shadow, and leaf canopy\
    \ shadow and requires\nremote sensing calibration.\n4\nJournal of Sensors\n2.2.\
    \ Vegetation Indices considering Atmospheric Effects. Given\nthe limitations of\
    \ NDVI under atmospheric effects, Kaufman\nand Tanr´e [40] proposed the Atmospherically\
    \ Resistant Veg-\netation Index (ARVI). This index is based on the knowledge\n\
    that the atmosphere affects significantly \U0001D445 compared to the\nNIR. Thus,\
    \ Kaufman and Tanr´e modified the radiation value\nof \U0001D445 by the difference\
    \ between the blue (\U0001D435) and \U0001D445. Therefore,\nARVI can effectively\
    \ reduce the dependence of this VI to\natmospheric effects, which can be expressed\
    \ as\nARVI = (NIR − \U0001D445\U0001D435)\n(NIR + \U0001D445\U0001D435),\n\U0001D70C\
    ∗\n\U0001D45F\U0001D44F = \U0001D70C∗\n\U0001D70F − \U0001D6FE (\U0001D70C∗\n\U0001D44F\
    \ − \U0001D70C∗\n\U0001D70F ) ,\n(6)\nwhere \U0001D445\U0001D435 is the difference\
    \ between \U0001D435 and \U0001D445, is the reflectivity\nrelated to the molecular\
    \ scattering and gaseous absorption\nfor ozone corrections, and represents the\
    \ air conditioning\nparameters.\nThe ARVI is commonly used to eliminate the effects\
    \ of\natmospheric aerosols. The aerosols and ozone effects in the\natmosphere\
    \ still need to be eliminated by the 5S atmospheric\ntransport model [45]. However,\
    \ to implement the 5S atmo-\nspheric transmission model, actual atmospheric parameters\n\
    must be considered, which are difficult to obtain. If the ARVI\nindex is not calculated\
    \ using the 5S model, this index is not\nexpected to perform much better than\
    \ NDVI considering\natmospheric effects or large dust particles in the atmosphere.\n\
    Thus, Zhang et al. [46] proposed a new atmospheric effect\nresistant vegetation\
    \ index, namely, IAVI, that can eliminate\natmospheric interference without the\
    \ use of the 5S model.\nIAVI = {\U0001D70Cnir − [\U0001D70C\U0001D45F − \U0001D6FE\
    \ (\U0001D70C\U0001D44F − \U0001D70C\U0001D45F)]}\n{\U0001D70Cnir + [\U0001D70C\
    \U0001D45F − \U0001D6FE (\U0001D70C\U0001D44F − \U0001D70C\U0001D45F)]},\n(7)\n\
    where the range of \U0001D6FE values is between 0.65 and 1.12; a\nsignificant\
    \ value of \U0001D6FE is close to 1 for ARVI. After testing, the\nerror caused\
    \ in IAVI by the atmosphere effect is between 0.4%\nand 3.7%, which is less than\
    \ those found when using NDVI\nin the same conditions (14–31%).\n2.3. Adjusted-Soil\
    \ Vegetation Index. The distinction of veg-\netation from the soil background\
    \ was originally proposed\nby Richardson and Wiegand [47] by analyzing the soil\
    \ line,\nwhich can be considered as a linear relationship on the 2D\nplane of\
    \ the soil spectral reflectance values between the NIR\nand \U0001D445. Therefore,\
    \ it can be considered as a comprehensive\ndescription of a large number of soil\
    \ spectral information\nfrom a number of environments [48]. Many VIs that take\n\
    into account the effect of soil background have been based\non this principle.\
    \ In addition to PVI ((3)-(4)), the Soil Line\nAtmospheric Resistance Index (SLRA)\
    \ was developed based\non the improvement of the soil line principle. The SLRA\
    \ was\nthen combined with the Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegeta-\ntion Index (TSAVI)\
    \ to develop the Type Soil Atmospheric\nImpedance Vegetation Index (TSARVI) [49],\
    \ which will be\ndiscussed later.\nAs shown before, NDVI (5) is very sensitive\
    \ to back-\nground factors, such as the brightness and shade of the veg-\netation\
    \ canopies and soil background brightness. Researches\nhave shown that when the\
    \ background brightness is increased,\nNDVI also increases systematically. Given\
    \ the effect of soil\nbackground, \U0001D445 radiation increases significantly\
    \ when the veg-\netation cover is sparse; conversely NIR radiation is reduced\n\
    to make the relationship between vegetation and soil more\nsensible. Many VIs\
    \ have been developed to adjust to the soil\neffect.\nSince NDVI and PVI have\
    \ some deficiencies in describing\nthe spectral behavior of vegetation and soil\
    \ background,\nHuete [50] established the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI),\
    \ which can be expressed as follows:\nSAVI = (\U0001D70C\U0001D45B − \U0001D70C\
    \U0001D45F) (1 + \U0001D43F)\n(\U0001D70C\U0001D45B + \U0001D70C\U0001D45F + \U0001D43F\
    ) .\n(8)\nThe above model of a soil vegetation system was estab-\nlished to improve\
    \ the sensitivity of NDVI to soil backgrounds,\nwhere \U0001D43F is the soil conditioning\
    \ index, which improves the\nsensitivity of NDVI to soil background. The range\
    \ of \U0001D43F is from\n0 to 1. In practical applications, the values of \U0001D43F\
    \ are determined\naccording to the specific environmental conditions. When the\n\
    degree of vegetation coverage is high, \U0001D43F is close to 1, showing\nthat\
    \ the soil background has no effect on the extraction of\nvegetation information.\
    \ This kind of ideal conditions is rarely\nfound in natural environments and can\
    \ be applicable only in\nthe case of a large canopy density and coverage [40].\
    \ The value\nof \U0001D43F is around 0.5 under most common environmental condi-\n\
    tions. When \U0001D43F is close to 0, the value of SAVI is equal to NDVI.\nHowever,\
    \ \U0001D43F factor should vary inversely with the amount of\nvegetation present\
    \ to obtain the optimal adjustment for the\nsoil effect. Thus, a modified SAVI\
    \ (MSAVI) replaces \U0001D43F factor\nin the SAVI equation (8) with a variable\
    \ \U0001D43F function. In this\nway, MSAVI [51] reduces the influence of bare\
    \ soil on SAVI,\nwhich can be expressed as follows:\nMSAVI = 0.5 ∗ {2\U0001D445\
    800 + 1\n− SQRT [(2\U0001D445800 + 1)\n2 − 8 (\U0001D445800 − \U0001D445670)]}\
    \ .\n(9)\nThe SAVI is much less sensitive than the RVI (1) to\nchanges in the\
    \ background caused by soil color or surface\nsoil moisture content. Three new\
    \ versions of SAVI (SAVI2,\nSAVI3, and SAVI4) were developed based on the theoretical\n\
    considerations of the effects of wet and dry soils [41]. SAVI2,\nSAVI3, and SAVI4\
    \ reduce the effect of background soil\nbrightness, by taking into account the\
    \ effect of the variation\nof the solar incidence angle and changes in the soil\
    \ physical\nstructure.\nBased on the implementation of the MSAVI, Richardson\n\
    and Wiegand (1977) proposed a Modified Secondary Soil-\nAdjusted Vegetation Index\
    \ (MSAVI2) [47], which can be\nexpressed as\nMSAVI2\n= 0.5\n∗ [(2NIR + 1) − √(2NIR\
    \ + 1)2 − 8 (NIR − \U0001D445)] .\n(10)\nJournal of Sensors\n5\nMSAVI2 does not\
    \ rely on the soil line principle and has a\nsimpler algorithm; it is mainly used\
    \ in the analysis of plant\ngrowth, desertification research, grassland yield\
    \ estimation,\nLAI assessment, analysis of soil organic matter, drought\nmonitoring,\
    \ and the analysis of soil erosion [39].\nBaret et al. studied the sensitivity\
    \ of five VIs (NDVI, SAVI,\nTransformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI),\
    \ Mod-\nified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), and Global\nEnvironment\
    \ Monitoring Index (GEMI)) to the soil back-\nground. They simulated the performance\
    \ of the VIs for differ-\nent soil textures, moisture levels, and roughness by\
    \ using the\nScattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) model.\nThey determined\
    \ an optimum value of SAIL = 0.16 to reduce\nthe effects of soil background and\
    \ then proposed an Opti-\nmized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) [48] that\
    \ can\nbe expressed as follows:\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − \U0001D445)\n(NIR + \U0001D445\
    \ + \U0001D44B),\n(11)\nwhere SAIL is 0.16 and OSAVI does not depend on the soil\n\
    line and can eliminate the influence of the soil background\neffectively. However,\
    \ the applications of OSAVI are not\nextensive; it is mainly used for the calculation\
    \ of aboveground\nbiomass, leaf nitrogen content, and chlorophyll content,\namong\
    \ others [52].\n2.4. Tasseled Cap Transformation of Greenness Vegetation\nIndex\
    \ (GVI, YVI, and SBI). Kauth and Thomas studied the\nspectral pattern of the vegetation\
    \ growth process and called it\nthe “spike cap” pattern, including the soil background\
    \ reflec-\ntivity and brightness line. The Tasseled Cap Transformation is\na conversion\
    \ of the original bands of an image into a new set\nof bands with defined interpretations\
    \ that are useful for vege-\ntation mapping. A Tasseled Cap Transformation is\
    \ performed\nby taking “linear combinations” of the original image bands,\nwhich\
    \ is similar in concept to the multivariate data analysis\ntechnique called principal\
    \ components analysis (PCA) [53].\nThe Tasseled Cap can convert Landsat MSS, Landsat\
    \ TM,\nand Landsat 7 ETM data. For Landsat MSS data, furthermore,\nthe Tasseled\
    \ Cap performs orthogonal transformation on the\noriginal data, which converts\
    \ it into a 4D space. This con-\nversion includes the Soil Brightness Index (SBI)\
    \ (14), degree\nof Green Vegetation Index (GVI) (12), and the degree of\nYellow\
    \ Vegetation Index (YVI) (13). It also includes Nonsuch\nIndex (NSI) mainly for\
    \ noise reduction. The NSI is closely\nrelated to atmospheric effects. For the\
    \ Landsat 5 TM data,\nthe Tasseled Cap results consist of three factors: brightness,\n\
    greenness, and a third component related to soil. Among\nthem, the brightness\
    \ and the greenness are equivalent to SBI\nand GVI in the MSS Tasseled Cap. The\
    \ third component is\nrelated to soil characteristics and humidity. For Landsat\
    \ 7\nETM data, the Tasseled Cap Transformation generates six\nbands, namely, brightness,\
    \ greenness, humidity, the fourth\ncomponent (noise), a fifth component, and a\
    \ sixth compo-\nnent.\nGVI = −0.290MSS4 − 0.562MSS5 + 0.600MSS6\n+ 0.491MSS7,\n\
    (12)\nYVI = −0.829MSS4 − 0.522MSS5 + 0.039MSS6\n+ 0.149MSS7,\n(13)\nSBI = +0.433MSS4\
    \ − 0.632MSS5 + 0.586MSS6\n+ 0.264MSS7.\n(14)\nThe GVI, YVI, and SBI ignore the\
    \ interaction and effects of\nthe atmosphere, soil, and vegetation. SBI and GVI\
    \ can be used\nto evaluate the behavior of vegetation and bare soil [54]. The\n\
    GVI has a strong correlation with different vegetation covers.\nThus, GVI increases\
    \ the processing of atmospheric effects.\nJackson et al. (1980) proposed the Adjust\
    \ Soil Brightness\nIndex (ASBI) and Adjust Green Degree Vegetation Index\n(AGVI)\
    \ [55], which can be expressed as follows:\nASBI = 2.0YVI,\nAGVI = GVI − (1 +\
    \ 0.018GVI) YVI − NSI\n2 .\n(15)\nMisra and Wheeler (1977) performed PCA of Landsat\n\
    images and computed the multiple factors of these indexes.\nThis analysis was\
    \ the basis of the development of the Misra\nSoil Brightness Index (MSBI), Misra\
    \ Green Degree Vege-\ntation Index (MGVI), and Misra Yellow Degree Vegetation\n\
    Index (MYVI) [56], which can be expressed as follows:\nMSBI = 0.406MSS4 + 0.60MSS5\
    \ + 0.645MSS6\n+ 0.243MSS7,\nMGVI = −0.386MSS4 − 0.53MSS5 + 0.535MSS6\n+ 0.532MSS7,\n\
    MYVI = 0.723MSS4 − 0.597MSS5 + 0.206MSS6\n− 0.278MSS7.\n(16)\nSince NDVI has been\
    \ found to be affected only by soil\nbrightness, it presents a negative correlation\
    \ between NDVI\nand soil brightness. A positive correlation is found when only\n\
    atmospheric effects affect NDVI. Under natural conditions,\nthe soil and atmosphere\
    \ influence NDVI in a complex\nmanner, which interacts with the vegetation cover\
    \ influence.\nTherefore, atmosphere and vegetation have a collective effect\n\
    on NDVI based on the soil characteristics and exposure. Liu\nand Huete comprehensively\
    \ analyzed multiple soil types and\natmospheric enhanced VIs. They developed the\
    \ Atmosphere\nAntivegetation Index (ARVI) and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex\
    \ (SAVI) for a comprehensive analysis of vegetation in\nthese conditions. They\
    \ found that, as a result of the interaction\nbetween the soil and the atmosphere,\
    \ reducing one of them\nmay increase the other. They introduced a feedback mecha-\n\
    nism by building a parameter to simultaneously correct soil\n6\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    and atmospheric effects. This parameter is the Enhanced Veg-\netation Index (EVI)\
    \ [57] that can be expressed as follows:\nEVI =\n(TM4 − TM3) (1 + \U0001D43F)\n\
    TM4 − \U0001D4361TM3 + \U0001D4362TM + \U0001D43F,\nEVI = 2.5 ∗\n\U0001D70C∗\n\

    \ Vegetation Indices Based on UAS Remote Sensing in the\nVisible Spectra Region.\
    \ UAS remote sensing is a low altitude\nremote sensing technology (50–100 m),\
    \ which is less affected\nby atmospheric factors during the data acquisition process.\n\
    It has the advantages of affordability, simple operation, fast\nimaging speed,\
    \ and high spatial and temporal resolutions,\nwhich is unparalleled compared with\
    \ traditional [58] remote\nsensing technologies based on satellites. At present,\
    \ the UAS\nremote sensing technology plays a crucial role in the field of\naerial\
    \ remote sensing with increased interest in applying these\nplatforms on different\
    \ studies of vegetation assessment [59].\nThe practical applications of UAS are\
    \ mainly related to images\nacquisition in the visible bands (RGB) due to easy\
    \ access of\nubiquitous high resolution cameras at low price and weight.\nHowever,\
    \ due to rapid advances in technology, multispectral\nand infrared thermal cameras\
    \ are becoming increasingly\ncheaper and miniaturized.\nAs previously shown through\
    \ different VIs, most of them\nare based on the mixture of visible light bands\
    \ and NIR to\ngenerate algorithms and those based only on the visible light\n\
    spectra are not common. However, weightless high definition\ncameras are appearing\
    \ in the market that includes the NIR\nband, which will enhance the practical\
    \ applicability of UAS\nin the near future. These types of reflectance are commonly\n\
    measured using visible, multispectral, and hyperspectral\ncameras [5]. According\
    \ to Gago et al. (2015), NDVI is one\nof the most employed indices for UAS applications\
    \ and is\ndefined specifically as\nNDVI = (\U0001D445800 − \U0001D445680)\n(\U0001D445\
    800 + \U0001D445680),\n(18)\nwhere \U0001D445800 is the reflectance at 800 nm\
    \ and \U0001D445680 at 680 nm.\nDue to the high NIR reflectance of chlorophyll,\
    \ this index is\nused to detect plants greenness [60]. Some studies described\n\
    the use of UAS with multispectral cameras and high resolu-\ntion multispectral\
    \ satellites to estimate LAI (Leaf Area Index)\nthrough NDVI [27, 61].\nThe optimized\
    \ index transformed chlorophyll absorp-\ntion in reflectance Transformed Chlorophyll\
    \ Absorption in\nReflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index\n\
    (TCARI/OSAVI) was proposed as more sensitive VI to chlo-\nrophyll content. In\
    \ this way, avoiding other factors that could\naffect the reflectance values such\
    \ as canopy reflectance and\nsoil reflectance among others [5]. Another index\
    \ evaluated\nby Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013) was the PRInorm, which is an\nimprovement\
    \ of the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI).\nThis index considers xanthophyll\
    \ changes related to water\nstress but also generates a normalization considering\
    \ chloro-\nphyll content and canopy leaf area reduction which is mainly\naffected\
    \ by water stress [62]. However, by obtaining a quick\nand effective method to\
    \ extract vegetation information based\non UAS visible images, it will enhance\
    \ and popularize the\nscope of application of UAS immediately [63]. In this sense,\n\
    Wang et al. (2015) comprehensively considered the spectral\ncharacteristics of\
    \ healthy green vegetation and the spectral\ncharacteristics of typical features\
    \ of UAS imagery [63]. They\nuse green (\U0001D43A) band instead of the NIR band\
    \ to calculate\nNDVI, (\U0001D70Cred + \U0001D70Cblue) compared to \U0001D445\
    \ for NDVI, and the \U0001D43A\nband multiplied by 2 for (\U0001D70Cred + \U0001D70C\
    blue). Thus, a Visible-Band\nDifference Vegetation Index (VDVI) is created based\
    \ on the\nthree bands of visible light, which can be expressed as follows:\nVDVI\
    \ =\n(2 ∗ \U0001D70Cgreen − \U0001D70Cred − \U0001D70Cblue)\n(2 ∗ \U0001D70Cgreen\
    \ + \U0001D70Cred + \U0001D70Cblue)\n.\n(19)\nThe values of VDVI are within [−1,\
    \ 1] and the accuracy of\nthe vegetation extraction based on VDVI is higher than\
    \ other\nvisible light band-based VIs and \U0001D43A band. Furthermore, the\n\
    accuracy of VDVI has been reported to be over 90% [63].\n2.6. Vegetation Indices\
    \ Related to Vegetation Status. The\nNDVI, as shown previously, enhances the contrast\
    \ of the\nreflectivity of the NIR and \U0001D445 channels (5). Therefore, it is\n\
    a nonlinear extension of NIR and \U0001D445 ratios, resulting in the\nenhancement\
    \ of the lower part of these values (higher values\nare suppressed). Hence, NDVI\
    \ reaches saturation in this way\nmore easily. Thus, Gitelson [64] proposed the\
    \ Wide Dynamic\nRange Vegetation Index (WDRVI), which can be expressed\nas follows:\n\
    WDRVI = (\U0001D6FC\U0001D70Cnir − \U0001D70Cred)\n(\U0001D6FC\U0001D70Cnir +\
    \ \U0001D70Cred).\n(20)\nWDRVI enhances the dynamic range of NDVI by applying\n\
    a weighting parameter to the NIR reflectance. If \U0001D6FC equals 1,\nWDRVI is\
    \ equivalent to NDVI. If \U0001D6FC is equal to the ratio\n(\U0001D70Cred/\U0001D70C\
    NIR), WDRVI is zero. After validation procedures, a\ncoefficient value of 0.20\
    \ for appears to be generally effective\nfor the WDRVI calculations. According\
    \ to Gitelson (2004)\n[64], WDRVI offers a simple way to enhance the dynamic\n\
    range for high biomass environments (LAI > 2). However,\nwhen biomass is low (LAI\
    \ < 1), NDVI is still the best choice\nfor the plant classification.\nAccording\
    \ to the spectral reflectance of plant leaves\n(between 550 nm and 700 nm) it\
    \ can be considered constant\neven if the chlorophyll content of leaves is variable.\
    \ Based\non this relationship, Kim et al. (1994) measured the level of\nabsorption\
    \ at 670 nm and linked the reflection peak at 700 nm\nJournal of Sensors\n7\n\
    and 550 nm; the Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (CARI)\nwas then developed\
    \ [65] and can be expressed as\nCAR ∗ (\U0001D445700\n\U0001D445670\n) ,\nCAR\
    \ =\n\U000F5128\U000F5128\U000F5128\U000F5128(\U0001D44E ∗ 670 + \U0001D445670\
    \ + \U0001D44F)\U000F5128\U000F5128\U000F5128\U000F5128\n(\U0001D44E2 + 1)\n0.5\n\
    ,\n\U0001D44E = (\U0001D445700 − \U0001D445500)\n150\n,\n\U0001D44F = \U0001D445\
    550 − (\U0001D44E ∗ 550) .\n(21)\nLater, Daughtry et al. improved the CARI by\
    \ proposing a\nmodified CARI (MCARI) [66], which can be expressed as\nMCARI\n\
    = 1.5 ∗ [2.5 (\U0001D445800 − \U0001D445670) − 1.3 (\U0001D445800 − \U0001D445\
    550)]\n√(2\U0001D445800 + 1)2 − (6\U0001D445800 − 5\U0001D445670) − 0.5\n.\n(22)\n\
    The MCARI is more sensitive to leaf chlorophyll concentra-\ntions. Daughtry et\
    \ al. (2000) found that LAI, chlorophyll, and\nthe chlorophyll-LAI interaction\
    \ accounted for 60, 27, and 13%\nof the MCARI variation. Even though the MCARI\
    \ formula\nis not related to the NIR bands, good predictions were still\nfound.\n\
    In agriculture, crop growth is directly linked to water\nsupply and plant water\
    \ status. When the soil water supply\nis insufficient, plants will be under water\
    \ stress, which leads\nto reduced crop yield and even crop failures under extreme\n\
    drought conditions. So it is very important to evaluate the\ncrop water status\
    \ in a timely and accurate manner, which\nhas direct implications on crop growth,\
    \ yield, and quality of\nproduce [67]. In recent years, the development of infrared\n\
    thermal remote sensing technology made it possible to mea-\nsure canopy temperature\
    \ changes and dynamics from crop\npopulations. These changes are related to the\
    \ transpiration\nrate of plants and stomatal conductance. Hence, crop leaf and\n\
    canopy temperature have been used for the determination of\ncrop water status\
    \ [68]. In order to make the canopy temper-\nature measurements consistent, Idso\
    \ et al. (1981) established\nthe Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to monitor crop\
    \ water\nstatus [69].\nCWSI =\n(\U0001D447canopy − \U0001D447nws)\n(\U0001D447\
    dry − \U0001D447nws)\n,\n(23)\nwhere \U0001D447canopy is the temperature of fully\
    \ sunlit canopy leaves\n(∘C), \U0001D447nws is the temperature of fully sunlit\
    \ canopy leaves (∘C)\nwhen the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered); \U0001D447\
    dry is\nthe temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (∘C) when the\ncrop is severely\
    \ water stressed due to low soil water availabil-\nity. \U0001D447nws and \U0001D447\
    dry are the lower and upper baselines used to\nnormalize CWSI for the effects\
    \ of environmental conditions\n(air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind\nspeed) on \U0001D447canopy. The CWSI has two models, an empirical\n\
    model and a theoretical model; however, the theoretical\nmodel involves too many\
    \ parameters, and these parameters\nare not easy to obtain. Therefore, the theoretical\
    \ model is\nonly used for research purposes [70–72]. The empirical model\ncan\
    \ be obtained only by using crop canopy temperature, air\ntemperature, and air\
    \ saturation difference, so the empirical\nmodel has been further studied and\
    \ used in many crop\napplications [73].\nBesides the use of infrared thermal radiation\
    \ to detect\nplant water stress detection, the visible part of the spectrum\n\
    has also been useful for early water stress detection. This\ninvolves using indices\
    \ focused on bands at specific wave-\nlengths where photosynthetic pigments are\
    \ affected by water\nstress conditions such as chlorophyll. The Photochemical\n\
    Reflectance Index (PRI) has been used as a stress index of\nstress based on this\
    \ principle, with initial developments to\nbe applied to disease symptoms detection,\
    \ which can be\nexpressed as\nPRI = (\U0001D445531 − \U0001D445570)\n(\U0001D445\
    531 − \U0001D445570).\n(24)\nIt has been shown that the Light Use Efficiency (LUE)\
    \ is a\nkey variable to estimate Net Primary Productivity (NPP) [74,\n75]. When\
    \ obtaining reliable accuracy in LUE measurements,\nit is possible to study the\
    \ distribution of energy and global\nclimate change. The PRI is a normalized difference\
    \ VI of\nreflectivity at 531 nm and 570 nm and the reflectance of these\ntwo bands\
    \ is affected by the xanthophyll cycle and is closely\nrelated to LUE of leaves.\
    \ Therefore, PRI provides a good\nestimation of leaf LUE.\n2.7. Summary of Vegetation\
    \ Indices. A summary of the main\nVIs discussed in this paper can be found in\
    \ Table 1 with their\nrespective citations.\n3. Conclusions\nSimple VIs combining\
    \ visible and NIR bands have signif-\nicantly improved the sensitivity of the\
    \ detection of green\nvegetation. Different environments have their own variable\n\
    and complex characteristics, which needs to be accounted\nwhen using different\
    \ VIs. Therefore, each VI has its specific\nexpression of green vegetation, its\
    \ own suitability for specific\nuses, and some limiting factors. Therefore, for\
    \ practical\napplications, the choice of a specific VI needs to be made with\n\
    caution by comprehensively considering and analyzing the\nadvantages and limitations\
    \ of existing VIs and then combine\nthem to be applied in a specific environment.\
    \ In this way, the\nusage of VIs can be tailored to specific applications, instru-\n\
    mentation used, and platforms. With the development of\nhyperspectral and multispectral\
    \ remote sensing technology,\nnew VIs can be developed, which will broaden research\
    \ areas.\nIt is envisioned that these new developments will be readily\napplied\
    \ and adopted by UAS platforms and will become one\nof the most important research\
    \ areas in aerospace remote\nsensing in the near future.\n8\nJournal of Sensors\n\

  limitations: The paper does not provide a specific list of limitations of the paper
    types discussed. However, it does mention that the accuracy of irrigation management
    data can be affected by a number of factors, such as the type of sensor used,
    the installation location, and the environmental conditions. It is important to
    carefully consider the limitations of the data when using it to make irrigation
    management decisions.

  title: 'Significant Remote Sensing Vegetation Indices: A Review of Developments
    and Applications'
  verbatim_quote1: Soil moisture content is a key factor in determining irrigation
    needs. Soil moisture sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels and provide
    real-time data that can be used to adjust irrigation schedules. There are various
    types of soil moisture sensors, ranging from simple probes that measure soil moisture
    at a single point to more advanced systems that provide detailed information about
    soil moisture levels throughout a field.
  verbatim_quote2: Crop water use is another important factor in determining irrigation
    needs. Crop water use can be estimated using weather data, such as temperature,
    humidity, and wind speed, as well as crop specific information, such as growth
    stage, canopy size, and rooting depth. Crop water use models can be used to simulate
    crop water use and estimate irrigation needs based on these factors.

  analysis: "**Types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical\
    \ sources:**\n\nThermal RS can be used to provide spatial and temporal information\
    \ of both crop and soil surface temperature which can be utilized for various\
    \ irrigation management practices such as:\n\n- Crop water stress monitoring:\
    \ Amount of water utilized by the plant, which in turn can indicate crop stress.\
    \ It can be helpful in determining the right time and quantity of water to be\
    \ applied to the crop. \n- Evapotranspiration (ET) and drought stress monitoring:\
    \ ET is the transfer of water from the soil into the air through evaporation and\
    \ plant transpiration.\n- Soil texture mapping: Soil texture influences soil water\
    \ content. By examining the differences in land surface temperature under a relatively\
    \ homogeneous climatic condition, soil texture at a regional scale can be quantified.\n\
    - Residue cover and tillage mapping: Crop residues play an important role in soil\
    \ and water conservation. By examining the differences in soil surface temperature\
    \ between conventional and no-till systems, residue cover and tillage practices\
    \ can be mapped.\n- Crop maturity mapping: The ability to monitor crop maturity\
    \ is useful for determining the harvesting time, particularly when weather conditions\
    \ deteriorate and the entire area cannot be harvested in the time available.\n\
    - Crop yield mapping: An accurate and early estimate of crop yield is useful for\
    \ farmers for crop insurance and planning of harvest and storage requirements.\n\
    \n**Commonly available data sources for above applications are:**\n- Satellite\
    \ platforms (Landsat, Sentinel)\n- Aerial platforms (UAV, manned aircraft)\n-\
    \ Ground based sensors\n\n**Challenges and future research directions:**\n\n-\
    \ **Spatial and temporal resolution of acquired images:**\n  - Satellite-based\
    \ thermal sensors have limitations in spatial and temporal resolution for site-specific\
    \ agricultural applications, thus limiting their use in precision agriculture.\n\
    \  - Aerial platforms (manned/unmanned) have shown advantages over satellite images\
    \ due to their high spatial and temporal resolutions and flexibility for image\
    \ acquisition.\n- **Atmospheric effect:**\n  - Thermal radiation emitted from\
    \ the earth's surface is attenuated by scattering and atmospheric absorption,\
    \ thus it is important to account for atmospheric effects for accurate representation\
    \ of surface temperature using thermal sensors.\n- **Calibration and emissivity\
    \ adjustment:**\n  - The radiation measured by a thermal sensor is a function\
    \ of the surface emissivity of an object, transmission of the atmosphere, and\
    \ down-welling and up-welling thermal radiation.\n  - Calibration of thermal sensors\
    \ is thus critical to extract scientifically reliable surface temperatures of\
    \ objects.\n- **Atmospheric condition, viewing angle, altitude and timing for\
    \ image acquisition:**\n  - Relative humidity, altitude and viewing angle at which\
    \ images are acquired should be considered. \n  - The remote measurements of canopy\
    \ temperature were also shown to be influenced by viewing angle of thermal sensors,\
    \ thus the optimum altitude and timing for image acquisition should be determined.\n\
    - **Crop growth stage and crop species variation:**\n  - It is important to understand\
    \ how the stomatal response to the environment varies across crop species while\
    \ using canopy temperature as a proxy for plant water status.\n- **Data processing\
    \ time and data analytics:**\n  - The usefulness of RS for in-season soil and\
    \ crop monitoring depends on the turn-around time between image acquisition and\
    \ dissemination of image-derived products. \n  - There is a need for a system\
    \ that allows automatic processing of images as well as implements powerful data\
    \ analytics to differentiate, quantify and detect temporal and spatial patterns\
    \ of different crop and soil conditions.\n- **Future use of unmanned aircraft\
    \ in PA:**\n  - Due to the flexibility and low cost for image acquisition, use\
    \ of UAVs for crop and soil monitoring is anticipated to increase significantly\
    \ compared to the traditional satellite and manned-aircraft platforms.\n  - The\
    \ advancements in UAV technologies and pressures for greater precision in agricultural\
    \ applications are likely to provide a real impetus to address the issues and\
    \ increase the integration of thermal RS in agricultural decision-making."

    content Highlights • Applications of thermal remote sensing in precision agriculture
    are discussed. • Potential concerns with the use of thermal remote sensing are
    highlighted. • Standard workflow is needed to use it as a routing tool for crop
    and soil monitoring. Abstract Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes tools and technologies
    to identify in-field soil and crop variability for improving farming practices
    and optimizing agronomic inputs. Traditionally, optical remote sensing (RS) that
    utilizes visible light and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum has
    been used as an integral part of PA for crop and soil monitoring. Optical RS,
    however, is slow in differentiating stress levels in crops until visual symptoms
    become noticeable. Surface temperature is considered to be a rapid response variable
    that can indicate crop stresses prior to their visual symptoms. By measuring estimates
    of surface temperature, thermal RS has been found to be a promising tool for PA.
    Compared to optical RS, applications of thermal RS for PA have been limited. Until
    recently (i.e., before the advancement of low cost RS platforms such as unmanned
    aerial systems (UAVs)), the availability of high resolution thermal images was
    limited due to high acquisition costs. Given recent developments in UAVs, thermal
    images with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become available at a low
    cost, which has increased opportunities to understand in-field variability of
    crop and soil conditions useful for various agronomic decision-making. Before
    thermal RS is adopted as a routine tool for crop and environmental monitoring,
    there is a need to understand its current and potential applications as well as
    issues and concerns. This review focuses on current and potential applications
    of thermal RS in PA as well as some concerns relating to its application. The
    application areas of thermal RS in agriculture discussed here include irrigation
    scheduling, drought monitoring, crop disease detection, and mapping of soil properties,
    residues and tillage, field tiles, and crop maturity and yield. Some of the issues
    related to its application include spatial and temporal resolution, atmospheric
    conditions, and crop growth stages. Previous article in issue Next article in

    Introduction With rising concerns regarding agriculture’s role in surface and
    groundwater quality combined with increasing fertilizer prices and the need to
    meet an expected 50–70% increase in global food demand with limited resources,
    there is an immediate need to improve agricultural systems into highly resource-efficient
    systems that are both profitable and environmentally sustainable (Donner and Kucharik,
    2008, Zhang et al., 2015, Zillén et al., 2008). Agricultural systems can be made
    resource-efficient by integrating tools, technologies and information management
    systems that come under the precision agriculture PA concept. Precision agriculture
    (PA) is a site-specific form of agriculture that aims to optimize farm inputs,
    improve efficiency, and reduce environmental footprints by focusing on the right
    management practice at the right rate at the right time in the right place (Gebbers
    and Adamchuk, 2010). Unlike conventional farming practices in which fields receive
    blanket applications of farm inputs, with PA, fields receive varying rates of
    inputs based on soil type, landscape position and management history. Recent technological
    advancements, including global positioning system (GPS) for machine guidance,
    grain yield monitors, variable rate technologies (VRT), sensor networks and remote
    sensing (RS), have helped farmers to identify in-field variability of crop and
    soil conditions and implement site-specific farming practices. Varying the application
    of inputs with VRT can reduce inputs and labor costs, maximize productivity, and
    reduce the potential environmental impacts from over-application of farm inputs.
    However, the success of VRT requires accurate and reliable information on the
    location and magnitude of crop and soil health conditions, such as crop nutrient
    deficiencies, soil and plant water stress, and damage caused by insects, weeds,
    or diseases. While field sampling provides in-field variabilities on crop and
    soil health conditions, it is infeasible and costly due to current trend towards
    increasing farm size. Remote sensing is the most cost effective method for large
    scale monitoring and analyses in agriculture. To date, the dominant RS tools that
    agricultural sector has utilized are visible, near infrared (NIR), and short wave
    infrared (SWIR) sensors. Use of thermal sensors in agriculture is somewhat limited
    despite its wide application in the areas of medicine (Ring and Ammer, 2012),
    intelligence/military (Hinz and Stilla, 2006), and food processing (Vadivambal
    and Jayas, 2011). In recent years, due to the improvements in technologies as
    well as reduction in sensor costs, its use in PA has gained popularity. By providing
    temperature measurements of soil and crop surfaces, thermal RS has the potential
    to be used for various applications, including (1) monitoring of crop stresses,
    crop diseases and soil water stress, and (2) planning for irrigation scheduling
    and harvesting operations. The objectives of this paper are to review and summarize
    the current and potential applications of thermal RS in PA, and discuss some of
    the concerns and challenges related to its use. 2. Remote sensing in precision
    agriculture Remote sensing in PA is used for collecting and analyzing information
    about crop and soil characteristics using sensors mounted on satellites, aircrafts,
    or ground equipment. Sensors collect energy that is reflected (visible and NIR),
    emitted (thermal infrared (TIR)), or backscattered (microwave) from the surface
    or atmosphere in different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Applications
    of RS in PA are typically influenced by the type of platform (ground, air, or
    satellite), region of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible, infrared, and microwave),
    number and width of the spectral bands (panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral),
    spatial resolution (high, medium and low), temporal resolution (hourly, daily
    and weekly revisiting frequency), radiometric resolution (8, 12, and 16 bits),
    and the source of energy (passive or active sensors) used by sensors to collect
    the data (Metternicht, 2008). One of the most commonly exploited RS systems in
    the agricultural sector is optical RS. It utilizes visible, NIR, and SWIR sensors
    to create images of the earth’s surface by detecting the energy reflected by the
    surface of the target area (Prasad et al., 2011). Using visible and NIR images
    collected by satellite, traditional aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
    several studies (Hatfield and Prueger, 2010, Gitelson et al., 2003, Huete et al.,
    2002, Jordan, 1969) have examined vegetative conditions in agriculture. Several
    vegetation indices (VIs) have been developed based on the combination of different
    wavebands to estimate various plant parameters, e.g., leaf area, ground cover,
    biomass, leaf chlorophyll content, residue cover, etc. Although these VIs provide
    indications of vegetative cover conditions, they are relatively slow response
    variables that typically adjust only after notable crop damage occurs. In contrast,
    surface temperature detected by thermal sensors is found to be a rapid response
    variable for monitoring crop growth and stresses (Stark et al., 2014, Anderson
    et al., 2013). Thermal RS is a process of measuring the radiation emitted from
    an object’s surface and converting it into temperature without establishing direct
    contact with the object. All objects with a temperature above 0 K or −273 °C or
    −459 °F emit radiation, and the amount of radiation is a function of the emissivity
    of the surface and the surface temperature (Prakash, 2000). The higher the temperature
    of the body, the greater is the intensity of radiation emitted by the object.
    Thermal RS provides important measurements of energy fluxes and temperatures from
    the earth’s surface, which are integral to understanding landscape processes and
    responses (Quattrochi and Luvall, 1999, Weng, 2009). Thus, a series of satellite
    and airborne thermal sensors (Table 1) have been developed and used directly or
    indirectly for many agricultural applications. In general, the crop canopy surface
    temperature is a function of transpiration rate, and that, itself, is a function
    of atmospheric evaporative demand and crop available soil water status. Stress
    (i.e., water, weed, nutrient) in crops influences its canopy temperature, which
    can be measured during critical phenological stages for use in planning, management
    and optimization of agricultural inputs and activities. Table 1. Thermal infrared

    sensing and its application in agricultural sector Thermal RS can be used in many
    aspects of crop and soil monitoring in the agricultural sector, including estimating
    soil and crop water stress for irrigation scheduling, determining disease and
    pathogen infected crops, mapping soil texture, estimating of residue cover, locating
    tiles in fields, monitoring crop maturity for harvesting, and mapping crop yield.

    images in agriculture. Table 2 summarizes some of the studies of the application

    et al., 2004 3.1. Irrigation scheduling Irrigation is an essential part of agricultural
    production in regions where in-season rainfall is inadequate to meet crop water
    demand. Knowing where, when and how much to irrigate helps to minimize crop yield
    loss related to water stress, maximize yield response to other management practices,
    and optimize yield per unit of water applied (i.e., irrigation efficiency) which
    in turn can maximize farmer’s profit. The need for irrigation is determined primarily
    by four factors – availability of water in soil, crop water need, rainfall amount,
    and efficiency of the irrigation system (Rhoads and Yonts, 2000). There are number
    of approaches to quantify these factors, including measurement of soil moisture,
    plant-based temperature, and evapotranspiration. Studies have explored the possibility
    of using thermal images from various platforms (i.e., satellite, aerial and UAV)
    as a tool for measuring these variables (Shafian and Maas, 2015, Hillel, 2013,
    Soliman et al., 2013, Chávez et al., 2008, Carlson, 2007) (discussed below), and
    demonstrated that the timely availability of these data during critical crop phenological
    stages could optimize both frequency and timing of irrigation schedules. 3.1.1.
    Soil moisture detection Timely monitoring of soil moisture is critical because
    it serves as a solvent and carrier of nutrients for plant growth, regulates soil
    temperature, supports microbial activities, influences farm operations (e.g.,
    planting fertilization, irrigation), and acts as a nutrient itself (Ramachandra,
    2006). Studies have used thermal RS for detecting soil moisture to aid in irrigation
    scheduling (Shafian and Maas, 2015, Soliman et al., 2013, Carlson, 2007). The
    soil moisture index and triangle method are widely used approaches for measuring
    soil moisture using thermal images. The triangle method is based on an interpretation
    of the image (pixel) distribution in surface radiant temperature to fractional
    vegetation cover space. A triangle emerges because the range of surface radiant
    temperatures decrease as the vegetation cover increases; a vertex emerges showing
    the narrow range of surface radiant temperature over the dense vegetation (Carlson
    2007). Vegetation subject to water stress usually experiences an increase in its
    radiant temperature compared to vegetation that is well watered. Shafian and Maas
    (2015) developed the Perpendicular Soil Moisture Index (PSMI) using raw digital
    count data in the red, NIR, and thermal bands from Landsat satellite images, and
    demonstrated that PSMI is strongly correlated with observed soil moisture. Soliman
    et al. (2013) evaluated two sensors, an airborne thermal camera and a handheld
    thermal gun, to examine spatial variability in soil moisture in vineyards, and
    found that airborne thermal images performed better than data from the handheld
    thermal gun. Using high-resolution multi-spectral imagery (visual, near infrared,
    infrared/thermal) acquired by a UAV in combination with ground sampling, Hassan-Esfahani
    et al. (2015) demonstrated the application of thermal images in accurately estimating
    the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture in an Utah farm planted with
    alfalfa and oats. 3.1.2. Crop water stress monitoring Crop canopy temperature
    and stomatal conductance have long been known to be important proxies for monitoring
    crop water stress and thus potential tools for irrigation scheduling. Except for
    some plant species, such as citrus and olive (discussed in the Section 4.5), significant
    elevation of canopy temperature above air temperature usually indicates stomatal
    closure and water deficit stress (Hillel, 2013, Jones, 2004). Using thermal images,
    studies have monitored canopy temperature and stomatal conductance to identify
    crop water stress. Using canopy temperature, Jackson and coworkers (Jackson et
    al., 1981) proposed the concept of Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to detect crop
    water stress. It is defined as the difference between air (Ta) and canopy temperature
    (Tc), normalized for the evaporative demand as determined by the means of a lower
    limit (when the canopy transpires at its potential rate) and an upper limit (a
    non-transpiring canopy), as shown in the Eq. (1). (1) where UL and LL are the
    upper and lower limits, respectively. There are several formulations to determine
    CSWI, and they vary based on the approach used to determine UL and LL (Agam et
    al., 2013, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014). There are analytical (Berni et al., 2009a,
    Berni et al., 2009b, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014) and empirical (Cohen et al.,
    2005, Möller et al., 2007) approaches to determine UL and LL. These approaches
    have their own strengths and limitations (Agam et al., 2013), and have been used
    widely to determine crop water stress. Studies have estimated CWSI using thermal
    measurements acquired from various sources, including manually handled infrared
    thermometers (Jackson et al., 1981), sensors mounted on a mast or a crane (Wang
    and Gartung, 2010, Testi et al., 2008), manned aircraft (Gonzalez-Dugo et al.,
    2013, Berni et al., 2009a), or satellite (Barbagallo et al., 2009). Stoll and
    Jones (2007) explored the use of thermal imaging as a tool to distinguish different
    water stress treatments. The experiments involved grapevines that received two
    irrigation treatments: no irrigation and full irrigation. Images were taken from
    both sun-exposed and shaded leaves from both irrigated and non-irrigated vines.
    The study found canopies of non-irrigated vines to be significantly hotter than
    the fully irrigated vines. They observed a greater difference in temperature between
    the sunlit and shaded canopies, and a wider range of temperature variation in
    sunlit leaves compared to shaded leaves. The study recommended the measurement
    of shaded leaves’ temperature as a reliable indicator of leaf temperature and
    hence the stomatal conductance. Further, it demonstrated that the temperature
    differences between stressed and non-stressed plants could be very helpful for
    identifying water stress in plants, and thus useful for irrigation scheduling.
    Using UAV acquired thermal images, Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) estimated the CWSI
    to identify water stressed areas within a commercial orchard, and demonstrated
    that this approach is viable for precision irrigation management. 3.1.3. Evapotranspiration
    and drought stress monitoring Evapotranspiration (ET) transfers a large volume
    of water from soil, through evaporation, and vegetation, through transpiration,
    into the atmosphere. Reliable ET estimates thus are essential for improving crop
    water management at both field and regional scales. Under an ET-based irrigation
    scheduling approach, ET losses are replaced in the root zone to meet plant water
    requirements. Evapotranspiration is an energy-demanding process; higher ET rates
    decrease the surface temperature of leaves and plants. Numerous ET algorithms
    have been developed to utilize surface temperatures derived from thermal images
    from satellite based sensors (Maes and Steppe, 2012, Chávez et al., 2008, Gowda
    et al., 2008). While Maes and Steppe (2012) provided a review on the theoretical
    relation between surface temperature and ET/energy balance at leaf and crop scales,
    Gowda et al. (2008) provided a review of the numerous commonly used remote sensing
    based algorithms to estimate regional ET. In a study conducted by Barbagallo et
    al. (2009), satellite-based ET estimates compared well with ET flux recorded at
    field level. To determine whether ET algorithms originally derived using images
    from satellite platforms could be adapted to thermal images from other platforms,
    Chávez et al. (2008) applied ET algorithms to airborne thermal and multispectral
    images, and demonstrated their use in successful estimation of instantaneous ET
    and its extrapolation to daily ET for corn and soybean fields. Using thermal images,
    studies have also estimated empirical indices such as vegetation health index
    (VHI) and the evaporative stress index (ESI) that provide signals of emerging
    drought (Anderson et al., 2013). The ESI describes anomalies in the actual/reference
    ET ratio, and is derived based on leaf surface temperature (LST) and leaf area
    indices. The VHI shown in Eq. (i) is a composite of the vegetation condition index
    (VCI), computed from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Eq. (ii)),
    and (ii) the temperature condition index (TCI) (Eq. (iii)) computed from brightness
    temperature (TB) from thermal data. It can be used as a proxy for monitoring vegetation
    health, drought, moisture, and thermal conditions (Choi et al., 2013). (i) (ii)
    (iii) 3.2. Plant disease detection Plant disease results in major production and
    economic losses in agriculture. For example, in the U.S., it is estimated that
    crop losses due to plant pathogens result in about $33 billion in lost revenue
    every year (Pimentel et al., 2005). It is estimated that farmers may reduce this
    loss by approximately $11 million just by eliminating 20% of the soybean rust,
    a prevalent disease. Using thermal RS, studies have shown the possibility of assessing
    and monitoring the spatial and temporal patterns of crop diseases pre-symptomatically
    during various disease development phases (Table 3). Table 3. Examples of plant
    diseases identified by thermal sensors. Crop Disease/pathogen Geographic scale

    Impairments due to root pathogens (e.g., Rhizoctonia solani or Pythium spp.),
    systemic infections (e.g., Fusarium spp.) or foliar pathogens, such as leaf spots
    or rusts, often influence the transpiration rate and the water flow of the entire
    plant or plant organs (Mahlein, 2016). Chaerle et al. (2004) reported changes
    in local temperatures due to pathogen infections or defense mechanisms for plant-virus
    interactions in tobacco, and for leaf spot disease in sugar beet at their early
    growth stage, before damage appeared. Also, studies (Mahlein, 2016, Mahlein et
    al., 2012, Stoll et al., 2008) have shown thermal sensors to be more effective
    in detecting disease-induced early modifications in plant respiration, water status,
    and leaf temperature compared to optical, multi and hyperspectral sensors. Using
    CWSI derived from aerial thermal images, Calderón et al. (2013) demonstrated the
    detection of early stage development of soil-borne fungus (i.e., Verticillium
    Wilt) in two olive orchards. Thermal images could also be used to evaluate environmental
    conditions (e.g., leaf wetness and the duration of wetness periods) favorable
    for pathogen infections, which can be used in models quantifying the potential
    of crop disease risk (Mahlein et al., 2012). 3.3. Soil texture mapping Some soil
    properties, such as soil texture, can be indicative of other physical and chemical
    soil properties, including structure, porosity, hydraulic properties, and nutrient
    retention ability, and all of these factors affect soil quality which in turn
    influences crop productivity. The ability to quickly determine accurate soil texture
    is thus important for agricultural decision-making. Land surface temperature has
    a strong relationship with soil texture; soil texture influences soil water content
    (i.e., amount of water soil can hold) and this in turn influences the land surface
    temperature (Mattikalli et al., 1998). For example, during dry periods, a sandy
    soil with a lower water holding capacity is expected to have a faster water depletion
    rate and a lower soil water content, and this leads to a higher land surface temperature.
    A clay soil with a higher water holding capacity is expected to have a slower
    depletion rate and higher soil water content, resulting in a lower land surface
    temperature (Wang et al., 2015). By examining the differences in land surface
    temperature under a relatively homogeneous climatic condition, studies (Wang et
    al., 2012, Wang et al., 2015) demonstrated the use of thermal RS in quantifying
    soil texture at a regional scale. Wang et al. (2015) developed linear regression
    models using daily LST data from MODIS satellite and observed sand (>0.05 mm),
    clay (<0.001 mm), and physical clay (<0.01 mm) contents, and produced maps showing
    the spatial distribution of soil texture in the Yangtze-Huai River Plain in East
    China. 3.4. Residue cover and tillage mapping Crop residues play an important
    role in soil and water conservation by providing a protective layer on agricultural
    fields that shields soil from wind and water, prevents erosion, reduces moisture
    loss, and increases soil quality. Accurate assessment of the extent of crop residue
    is necessary for proper monitoring and implementation of conservation tillage
    practices (Hively, 2015). By examining the differences in soil surface temperature
    between conventional and no-till systems, studies (Kozak et al., 2007, Sullivan
    et al., 2004, Potter et al., 1985) have shown the potential of thermal images
    for mapping residue cover and tillage practices. Sullivan et al. (2004) used high
    resolution images from the Airborne Terrestrial Application Sensor (ATLAS) to
    differentiate between residue coverage from treatments that consisted of five
    wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw cover rates (0, 10, 20, 50 and 80%) in the
    Coastal Plain and Appalachian Plateau physiographic regions of Alabama. All other
    conditions being equal, heat capacities of residue and soil surfaces varied depending
    on the residue cover rate. Their study demonstrated that thermal images could
    explain >95% of the variability in crop residue cover amount compared to >77%
    using visible and near IR images. 3.5. Field tile mapping Tile drainage systems
    remove excess water from agricultural fields, which result in both ecological
    and economic benefits (Hofstrand, 2010). However, at the same time, substantial
    concentration of nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) can be contained in
    tile drainage water which can contribute to poor water quality (King et al., 2015,
    Smith et al., 2015). The ability to better monitor tile drains would help farmers
    and natural resource managers to better predict and mitigate any adverse environmental
    and economic impacts. It could also allow farmers to identify and repair or replace
    missing or broken tiles. Improved drainage helps increase crop productivity and
    thus farm revenue. Studies have shown that visible and NIR images, studies (Naz
    et al., 2009, Naz and Bowling, 2008, Verma et al., 1996) can be used to identify
    tile locations in small-sized fields. However, because crop residues and soils
    have spectrally similar visible and NIR wavelengths between, these studies had
    limited success in field tile mapping. On bare agricultural land, tile drain locations
    usually appear lighter in color than the surrounding soil because drained soils
    dry more quickly. Due to the soil drying faster in tile drained fields, it is
    likely that there are differences in temperature between tile and naturally drained
    fields (Yanru and Xiaohong, 1990). By assessing temperature differences within
    a field, thermal images may provide additional opportunities in field tile mapping
    (Hoffman and Erb, 2016). 3.6. Crop maturity mapping The ability to monitor crop
    maturity is useful for determining the harvesting, particularly when weather condition
    deteriorate and the entire area cannot be harvested in the time available. An
    early assessment of crop maturity in the growing season is also useful for screening
    the adaptability of a crop to potentially poor growing seasons such as drought
    (Jensen et al., 2009). Using the visual and infrared images acquired by UAV from
    barley trial areas at Lundavra, Australia in the late growing season, Jensen et
    al. (2009) used discriminant function analyses to map two primary growth stages
    of barley and demonstrated classification accuracy of 83.5%. It is the physiological
    stage and the crop type that influence the transpiration and respiration in crops,
    which in turn influences their thermal condition (discussed in Section 4.5). For
    most row crops, as they reach maturity, the degree of respiration rate decreases
    compared to the initial growth phase (Linke et al., 2000). Less respiration usually
    leads to higher temperatures. For fruit trees, fruit load plays an important role
    in controlling transpiration and respiration. Trees with zero fruit load have
    elevated canopy temperatures compared to those with fruit load. Thus, using thermal
    images to monitor differences in crop temperature during the growing season, the
    maturity phase of row crops and fruit yield of tree crops can be determined. 3.7.
    Crop yield mapping An accurate and early estimate of crop yield is useful for
    farmers for a number of reasons, including crop insurance, planning of harvest
    and storage requirements, and cash flow budgeting. Utilizing images from satellite
    and airborne sensors at regional (Sakamoto et al., 2013, Mkhabela et al., 2011)
    and field scale levels (Geipel et al., 2014, Swain et al., 2010), a large number
    of studies have been carried out to predict crop yield. Sakamoto et al. (2013)
    developed a corn yield estimation model that was used to estimate the spatial
    distribution of corn grain yield for the entire U.S. for more than a decade using
    8-day time series datasets (i.e., visual and near infrared) from an MODIS satellite.
    Mkhabela et al. (2011) forecasted crop yields, such as barley, canola, field peas
    and spring wheat, on the Canadian Prairies using vegetation indices derived from
    MODIS time series data. Using UAV acquired images, Swain et al. (2010) estimated
    yield and total biomass of a rice crop in Thailand, and Geipel et al. (2014) predicted
    corn grain yields in the early to mid-season crop growth stages in Germany. These
    studies however have focused on vegetation indices derived from visible and NIR
    images (i.e., optical RS). Thermal images are found to have a close relationship
    with crop yield, and thus could be utilized for crop yield monitoring and estimation
    (Fig. 1). Currently, only a few studies have used thermal images to estimate crop
    yield. Stajnko et al. (2004) developed a fruit detection algorithm using thermal
    images to estimate the number and diameter of apples for estimating apple yield.
    This algorithm is based on the temperature difference between fruits and the background.
    The study showed a close correlation (R2 = 0.83–0.88) between the manually measured
    fruit number and estimated number, and (R2 = 0.68–0.70) between the manually measured
    diameter and estimated diameter, based on the algorithm. Using thermal imaging,
    Bulanon et al. (2008) demonstrated that citrus fruit can be differentiated from
    its canopy. They demonstrated that the night temperature of fruit is about 1.6
    °C higher than of leaves, whereas during the day, the temperature differs by less
    than 0.5 °C. Utilizing UAV or aerial platforms, thermal sensors can be a valuable
    resource in crop yield monitoring in PA. Download : Download high-res image (494KB)

    Challenges and future perspectives on the use of thermal images for precision
    agriculture Although thermal RS has the potential to provide spatial and temporal
    information of crop and soil surface temperature, there are certain issues that
    need to be considered while making use of thermal RS images. These include the
    influence of: (1) spatial and temporal resolutions of acquired images, (2) atmospheric
    conditions, (3) viewing angle and altitude of thermal sensors, and (4) crop growth
    stage and crop species variation (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image

    to the use of thermal remote sensing images. 4.1. Spatial and temporal resolution
    To date, thermal images from satellite platforms have been used extensively to
    measure crop and soil surface temperatures at regional and global scales. However,
    the pixel sizes of these images are larger than an individual field in most agricultural
    regions, and thus, these images have limited applications for site-specific agricultural
    applications (Mahlein, 2016, Gowda et al., 2008). For example, some satellite-based
    thermal sensors with daily coverage, such as moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer
    (MODIS), geostationary environmental satellite (GOES), and advanced very high
    resolution radiometer (AVHRR) provide thermal images at the range of 1000–4400
    m resolution (Table 1) compared to visible, NIR and SWIR images that have 250–1000
    m resolution. There have been some improvements in the spatial resolution of thermal
    sensors in some satellites (e.g., Landsat 7 ETM provides 60 m, Landsat 8 provides
    100 m, and ASTER provides 90 m pixel size) but these satellites have a revisit
    time of 16 days (Table 1). For producers or farmers willing to use satellite images
    for in-season crop and soil monitoring, the low spatial resolution and temporal
    frequency thus become major limitations. Images from aerial platforms have demonstrated
    advantages over satellite images due to their high spatial (i.e., pixel sizes
    between 0.5 and 2 m), spectral (i.e., 2–20 nm bandwidths in the 400–2500 nm spectral
    range) resolutions (Berni et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b) and temporal resolutions
    (i.e., can be acquired when needed). Studies by Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006, Sepulcre-Cantó
    et al., 2005 demonstrated that high-resolution thermal images acquired aerially
    are useful for detecting crop water stress for site-specific management. However,
    manned aerial systems have high operating costs, and due to the limited presence
    of companies providing cost-effective products, use of manned aerial systems is
    limited in PA. Due to recent developments in UAVs, thermal images are now available
    at high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions at a lower price compared to
    the past few years. A typical thermal imager will range in price from $2000 to
    $50,000 depending on the quality and functionality, and the majority of thermal
    cameras have resolution of 640 pixels by 480 pixels. Although these are significant
    advancements in thermal technology, compared to commercial off-the-shelf optical
    sensors used in UAVs, thermal cameras are still more expensive and have poor resolution.
    Commercially available off-the-shelf optical cameras have resolutions of above
    4200 pixels by 2800 pixels (Stark et al., 2014). Table 4 provides a list of thermal
    cameras currently available. Table 4. Currently available thermal cameras (modified

    scattering and absorption effects for accurate representation of surface temperature
    using thermal sensors. Large portions of the thermal radiation emitted from the
    earth’s surface that is measured by airborne or satellite sensors are attenuated
    by scattering and atmospheric absorption (Bitelli et al., 2015, Quattrochi and
    Luvall, 1999). Absorption of radiation by gas molecules is more significant than
    scattering. Due to strong absorption by water vapor and carbon dioxide molecules,
    thermal RS typically utilizes two atmospheric windows i.e., 3–5 and 8–14 μm wavelengths
    (Quattrochi and Luvall, 1999). Ozone strongly absorbs radiation in the 9.2–10
    μm range, so spacecraft RS systems cannot utilize this range. Airborne system,
    however, can utilize this region due to the low altitude of the sensor’s platform.
    In images acquired during the day, interpretation of data in the 3–5 μm range
    is difficult due to overlap with solar reflection; however, they are especially
    useful for monitoring events such as forest fires and geothermal activities. In
    thermal RS, the 8–14 μm region of the spectrum is of particular interest as it
    contains the peak energy emissions for most earth surfaces. There exist atmospheric
    modeling programs (e.g., LOWTRAN and MODTRAN) to address atmospheric attenuation
    and scattering of radiation over a wavelength region of 0.25–28.5 μm. These programs
    are widely used for satellite acquired thermal data (Quattrochi and Luvall, 1999)
    but less for data acquired from aerial platforms. There is thus a need to evaluate
    existing atmospheric modeling programs as well as to create new ones that can
    address concerns about the potential atmospheric effect on aerial thermal images.
    4.3. Calibration and emissivity adjustment Thermal images can be influenced by
    many factors, such as the performance of the thermal camera, moisture in the atmosphere,
    shooting angle, shooting distance, and other sources of emitted and reflected
    thermal radiation. Calibration of thermal sensors is thus critical to extract
    scientifically reliable surface temperatures of objects. However, this can be
    a complex process due to the reasons discussed below. The radiation measured by
    a thermal sensor is a function of the surface emissivity of an object, transmission
    of the atmosphere, and down-welling and up-welling thermal radiation. Emissivity
    is the ratio of radiation emitted by an object’s surface to that emitted by a
    perfect emitter of radiation (i.e., black body) at the same temperature. Each
    object has a different emissivity, which may vary by temperature. For example,
    crops such as alfalfa, snap bean and tomato have emissivity of 0.97, 0.96 and
    0.98, respectively (Chen, 2015, López et al., 2012). Land surface emissivity varies
    by soil types (Sobrino et al., 2009), and sky emissivity varies based on cloud
    conditions (i.e., temperature and vapor content) (Kjærsgaard et al., 2007). To
    correct thermal images, the effects of emissivity at various levels (i.e., crop,
    soil, and sky) (Fuchs and Tanner, 1966, Rahkonen and Jokela, 2003, Sobrino et
    al., 2009, López et al., 2012) and effects of atmospheric transmissivity, which
    can vary depending on humidity, ambient temperature and distance from the object
    to the sensor, need to be taken into account. Some studies (Allen et al., 2011,
    Kuenzer and Dech, 2013) have used sophisticated models such as MODTRAN to account
    for impacts of humidity, temperature and aerosol profiles on scattering and absorption.
    For surface temperature estimation, down-welling radiation can be measured with
    a thermal sensor. The emissivity of an object’s surface can be assumed to be fixed
    or known. Other atmospheric parameters such as humidity and ambient temperature
    can be measured in the field. The distance of the object to the sensor can be
    approximated from the flight altitude (Stark et al., 2014). 4.4. Atmospheric condition,
    viewing angle, altitude and timing for image acquisition Haze and cloud cover
    conditions can influence the thermal data collected from aerial and satellite
    platforms. Thus these conditions should be carefully monitored while acquiring
    thermal images. Relative humidity, altitude and viewing angle at which images
    are acquired should also be considered. Thomson et al. (2012) collected canopy
    temperatures of soybean crops at both cloud and cloud-free conditions at varying
    altitudes near Stoneville, Mississippi, and demonstrated that thermal images collected
    aerially on cloudy days were of poor quality (i.e., lower contrast and poor radiometric
    resolution). They also found that altitude alone accounted for 58% of the variability
    in canopy temperature, solar radiation and altitude together accounted for 73%,
    and altitude and relative humidity accounted for 76%. Also, remote measurements
    of canopy temperature were shown to be influenced by viewing angle of thermal
    sensors (Berni et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, Fuchs et al., 1967). Fuchs
    et al. (1967) demonstrated a temperature difference of +3 °C in soybean crops
    when the angle of incidence of the sensing beam changed from 0 to 180 deg. Alchanatis
    et al. (2010) developed regression models using thermal indices derived from thermal
    images for two different dates (i.e., July and August) and points in time (i.e.,
    morning (10–12) and midday (12–14)) to estimate water status in cotton, and demonstrated
    that midday was the optimal time for thermal image acquisition. However, Sepulcre-Cantó
    et al.(2006) found temperature from airborne thermal images acquired early in
    the morning to be less affected by background effects than those acquired at noon.
    4.5. Crop growth stage and crop species variation Measurements of canopy temperature
    through RS can be influenced by crop growth stages. Early in the growing season,
    when plants are small and sparse, temperature readings can be affected by reflectance
    from the soil surface. With measurements obtained from partial canopy cover, accurate
    representation of crop stress thus becomes difficult (Thomson et al., 2012). For
    accurate representation and management of crop stress under partial ground cover,
    research should be focused on developing algorithms that help determine the relative
    influence of canopy and soil on remotely sensed thermal data. For example, Bai
    et al. (2016) used Otsu’s adaptive thresholding algorithm to segment green pixels
    from the background to estimate vegetation biomass early in the growing season
    before canopy closure for soybean and wheat field trials. In addition to the crop
    growth stage, it is important to understand how the stomatal response to the environment
    varies across crop species while using canopy temperature as a proxy for plant
    water status (Ballester et al., 2013). For example, some species such as olive
    and citrus display significant stomatal closure at midday, even under well-watered
    conditions (Testi et al., 2008, Moriana et al., 2002), while for almond species,
    the stomatal behavior varies between cultivars (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2012). There
    is currently a gap in understanding of whether the indicators derived based on
    thermal images from various platforms (i.e., manned-aerial, UAV and satellite)
    can detect and differentiate behavior of contrasting species (Gonzalez-Dugo et
    al., 2013). Perhaps the integration of visual, thermal and NIR may provide a better
    understanding in this area, and thus further research is needed in this area.
    4.6. Data processing time and data analytics The usefulness of RS for in-season
    soil and crop monitoring depends on the turn-around time between image acquisition
    and dissemination of image-derived products. At present, image processing is still
    a very time consuming step that requires expert knowledge (Maes and Steppe, 2012).
    The turn-around time is between 1 and 3 weeks depending on the RS platform and/or
    sensor, algorithm utilized, and technician’s expertise on applying such algorithms
    (Gowda et al., 2008). However, for most agricultural practices (e.g., nutrients
    and pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting), information about a crop’s
    health should be delivered almost instantaneously. Currently, due to the relatively
    low flying altitude of UAVs, an unprecedented number of images with a small coverage
    footprint are being collected. For a meaningful interpretation of crop and soil
    conditions, these images need to be geometrically aligned (i.e., ortho-rectified),
    calibrated and corrected to account for atmospheric effects, and then stitched
    together (i.e., mosaic) to create a single image with larger spatial coverage.
    This requires a significant amount of data storage and time for preprocessing,
    analyzing, and presenting data in forms and formats that are meaningful and useful.
    Further, there is not a lack standardized framework for processing these big data
    sets (Zhang and Kovacs 2012). To use any RS technology, including thermal, as
    a common tool in agricultural practices, there is a need for a system that allows
    automatic processing of images as well as implements powerful data analytics to
    differentiate, quantify and detect temporal and spatial patterns of different
    crop and soil conditions. Currently, there are very limited studies focused on
    UAV acquired thermal images in PA, and of those available, the majority have focused
    only on soil moisture estimation (Hassan-Esfahani et al., 2015) and crop disease
    detection (Calderón et al., 2014). There are other areas of agriculture, such
    as mapping of soil, tile drainage, and crop residues, which may benefit from UAV
    based thermal RS. Further, there also exists the potential for evaluating and
    improving the performance of algorithms originally developed using satellite acquired
    images to images acquired from UAV platforms. For example, the METRIC model was
    originally developed to compute ET using Landsat images. Adaption of existing
    models, such as METRIC, to use UAV images might not only help enhance the accuracy
    of the model due to high resolution of the data but might also allow better understanding
    of associated opportunities and limitations. 4.7. Future use of unmanned aircraft
    in PA In the future, due to the flexibility and low cost for image acquisition,
    use of UAVs for crop and soil monitoring is anticipated to increase significantly
    compared to the traditional satellite and manned-aircraft platforms. Based on
    a survey of PA service retailers across the US in early 2015, UAV services are
    expected to increase the most. The use of UAV services was reported at 19% in
    2015 with expectations to increase to 38% by 2018 (Widmar and Erickson, 2015).
    While UAV acquired images could be practical alternatives to aerial photos and
    satellite images, there are several regulatory and technical issues, from acquisition
    to dissemination of final images (Zhang and Kovacs, 2012, Hardin and Jensen, 2011).
    With relaxed aviation regulations and improvement in image processing, geo-referencing,
    mosaicing, and classification algorithms (discussed above), UAV offers great potential
    for soil and crop monitoring (Zhang and Kovacs 2012). 5. Conclusions This review
    has briefly discussed the current state of the art and potential application of
    thermal RS in PA. Potential applications of thermal images in PA include, but
    are not limited to plant water stress monitoring, drought monitoring, plant disease
    detection, soil property mapping, residue cover and tillage mapping, field tile
    mapping, crop maturity mapping, and yield estimation. Although thermal RS has
    several potential advantages over the optical RS in crop and soil monitoring,
    there are a number of practical difficulties in its use, including atmospheric
    attenuation and absorption, calibration, climatic conditions, crop growth stages
    as well as complex soil and plant interaction that have thus far limited its use
    in the agricultural sector. However, the advancements in UAV technologies and
    pressures for greater precision in agricultural applications are likely to provide
    a real impetus to address these issues and increased integration of thermal RS
    in agricultural decision-making. Acknowledgements This material is based upon

    Get rights and content Highlights • Conventional irrigation scheduling techniques
    are unsuitable for automation. • Precision of single measurements of the narrow-band
    indices is not adequate for estimation of plant water status. • Integration of
    various vegetation indices could lead to better water stress prediction. • Combination
    of soil-based and plant-based approaches are needed to improve plant water stress
    monitoring. Abstract In order to meet the demand for increased global food production
    under limited water resources, implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling
    technique is crucial, particularly in irrigated basins experiencing water stress.
    Optimizing water use in agriculture requires innovations in detection of plant
    water stress, at various stages of the growing season to minimize crop physiological
    damage, and yield loss. Remotely sensed plant stress indicators, based on the
    visible and near-infrared spectral regions, have the advantage of high spatial
    and spectral resolutions, low cost, and quick turnaround time. This paper outlines
    recent developments in monitoring crop water stress, for scheduling irrigation,
    some of the constraints experienced, and future research needs. Previous article

    is essential to global food production, utilizing only 20% of cultivated land
    to provide 40% of the world’s food supply (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007). However,
    climate change, increasing worldwide shortages of water, frequent droughts, and
    global warming (Hirich et al., 2016) are threatening the reliability of irrigation
    water supplies. While the human population and demands for freshwater resources
    are increasing, drought and regular water scarcity can put global food security
    at risk (Lei et al., 2016), by severely disrupting agricultural production. The
    challenge is to meet rising productivity demands by improving methods of crop
    management (Behmann et al., 2014), and this requires a deeper understanding of
    plant response to abiotic stresses. Conventional methods for monitoring crop water
    stress rely on in situ soil moisture measurements and meteorological variables
    to estimate the amount of water lost from the plant-soil system during a given
    period (González-Dugo et al., 2006). Regular sampling of soil to assess water
    depletion from the plant root zone assumes that the water holding capacity of
    the entire soil is uniform, so only a few point measurements are used to represent
    water retention characteristics (Clarke, 1997). The method is time consuming,
    assumes uniform plant density, and the same rate of transpiration, over an entire
    field, which is rarely the case. Similarly, evapotranspiration models assume a
    freely transpiring reference crop with uniform cover and soil type within a field.
    These methods are time consuming and produce point information that give poor
    indications of the overall status of the field. Other methods of detecting plant
    water status involve soil water balance calculations, direct and indirect measurement
    of plant water status, via stomatal conductance and leaf water potential. These
    approaches, though reliable, are labour intensive, destructive, and unsuitable
    for automation, due to heterogeneity of soil and crop canopy. In order to increase
    water savings and enhance agricultural sustainability, implementation of suitable
    irrigation scheduling methods is essential (Osroosh et al., 2015), and requires
    early detection of water stress in crops, before it causes irreversible damage
    and yield loss. Recently, studies have focused on the use of remotely sensed data
    as an alternative to traditional field measurements of plant stress parameters,
    as this provides information about the spatial and temporal variability of crops
    (Dangwal et al., 2015, Leroux et al., 2016, Panigada et al., 2014, Rossini et
    al., 2013, Suárez et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2015).
    Spectral reflectance indices obtained from high resolution hyperspectral sensors,
    onboard small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS), can be used in precision agriculture
    for monitoring crop water status and scheduling irrigation (Berni et al., 2009a,
    Berni et al., 2009b, Gago et al., 2015). However, due to several confounding factors
    affecting the vegetation indices (VIs) at the canopy and landscape scales, and
    that the threshold for water stress detection is crop specific, a general agreement
    for their use as a pre-visual indicator of water stress is yet to be achieved.
    This paper reviews the recent advances in crop water stress detection that can
    potentially be applicable to improve irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops
    and aims to identify the most promising approach for large-scale application.
    2. Plant response to water stress Crop water stress is a deficiency in water supply,
    detected as a reduction in soil water content or from the physiological responses
    of the plant to water deficit. Plants absorb root zone soil water to meet their
    evapotranspiration needs, and this depletes soil available water. Under limiting
    soil moisture conditions, chemical and hydraulic signals are transmitted to the
    plant leaf through xylem pathways (Limpus, 2009), which leads to physiological
    responses such as stomatal closure and reductions in photosynthesis rate. Wang
    et al. (2015) indicated that water stressed crops have reduced evapotranspiration,
    and manifest other symptoms such as leaf wilting, stunted growth, and leaf area
    reduction. Also, water stress adversely affects the physiological and nutritional
    development of crops, leading to reduced biomass, yield, and quality of crops
    (Aladenola and Madramootoo, 2014, Rossini et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2017a, Zhang
    et al., 2017b). Plant water status measures the response of a plant to the combined
    effects of soil moisture availability, evaporative demand, internal hydraulic
    resistance, and uptake capacity of the plant-root interface. It is a more sensitive
    indicator of stress than soil moisture (Jones, 2010). Plant response to water
    stress depends on environmental conditions and crop evapotranspiration needs,
    as irrigation must replenish soil moisture deficit from evapotranspiration losses.
    FAO-56 defines the irrigation water requirement for a well-watered crop as water
    loss through evapotranspiration of a disease-free crop under non-limiting soil
    conditions (Allen et al., 1998). Measures of plant water status are required to
    better understand the mechanisms of plant response and adaptation to water stress,
    and for the optimisation of crop production (Osakabe et al., 2014), through precision
    irrigation. Similarly, evapotranspiration (ET) models are used to predict how
    changes in weather parameters can affect plant water status (Osroosh et al., 2016).
    The frequently used ET models are the Penman-Monteith (PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) equations. The Hargreaves model needs
    fewer data than the PM model and can estimate ET using air temperature as only
    input. Other researchers have used the CROPWAT-8, which is based on the Penman-Monteith
    method, to assess reference evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc), and irrigation water requirements (Bouraima et al., 2015, Patel et al.,
    2017, Surendran et al., 2017). The most common and practical approach widely used
    for estimating crop water requirement, and the operational monitoring of soil-plant
    water balance is the FAO-56 method. In the FAO-56 approach, crop evapotranspiration
    is estimated by the combination of ETo and crop coefficients. There are two different
    FAO-56 approaches: single and dual crop coefficients. The single crop coefficient
    approach is used to express both plant transpiration and soil evaporation combined
    into a single crop coefficient (Kc). The dual crop coefficient approach uses two
    coefficients to separate the respective contribution of plant transpiration (Kcb)
    and soil evaporation (Ke), each by individual values (Allen et al., 2005). Kcb
    is multiplied by water stress coefficient (Ks) (range 0–1) to account for the
    reduction of ET due to soil moisture depletion. It has been shown that Ks is related
    to crop water stress index (CWSI) according to Eq. (1). (1) Several researchers
    have evaluated the accuracy of water stress coefficient methods for estimating
    crop ETc under different levels of deficit irrigation. For instance, Bausch et
    al. (2011) successfully used a ratio of canopy temperature (Tc) as a substitute
    for the soil moisture based Ks. Kullberg et al. (2017) observed that using appropriate
    Ks method has the potential to improve irrigation scheduling to properly manage
    stress and ensure optimum crop yield under limited irrigation water supply. The
    main methods that are used for monitoring plant water stress have been summarized
    in Table 1, and are discussed below. Table 1. A summary of the methods for monitoring
    plant water stress, indicating their main advantages and disadvantages. Methods
    Description Advantages Disadvantages 1. Soil water measurement (a) Gravimetric
    method Sampling of soil, which is weighed, oven-dried and reweighed to estimate
    the amount of water lost from the plant-soil system It is reliable and serves
    as a guide on the amount of water to apply during irrigation The method is labour
    intensive, destructive, and time consuming (b) Soil moisture sensors (I) Neutron
    probe Based on the emission of high energy neutrons by a radioactive source into
    the soil Fast, non-destructive, and repetitive Requires adequate operator training,
    storage, licencing, and inspection, due to its radioactive source (II) TDR and
    FDR Based on the difference between the dielectric constant of water and soil
    Precise and easy to apply in practice. Estimates soil water levels at different
    depths along the soil profile. Readings can be logged automatically Several sensors
    are required for an entire field. High cost of installation of sensors (III) Tensiometers
    Measures soil water potential Easy to use for irrigation scheduling Useful in
    coarse textured soils or in high frequency irrigation only. Used for a narrow
    range of available soil water  2. Soil water balance approach Indirect estimate
    of soil moisture status based on soil water balance calculations Good indicator
    of the amount of irrigation water and easy to apply Not very accurate and requires
    calibration with actual soil measurements. Requires estimate of evaporation, rainfall,
    and irrigation events  3. Plant-based approaches (a) Stomatal conductance Indirect
    indicator of plant water stress by measuring the stomata opening Good measure
    of plant water status. Used as benchmark for most research studies Labour intensive
    and unsuitable for automation and commercial application. Not very accurate for
    anisohydric crops (b) Leaf water potential Direct measurement of leaf water content
    Widely accepted reference technique Slow, destructive, and unsuitable for isohydric
    crops (c) Relative water content Direct measurement of leaf water status Good
    indicator plant water status, requiring less sophisticated equipment Destructive
    and time consuming (d) Sap flow measurement Measures the rate of transpiration
    through heat pulse Sensitive to stomatal closure and water deficits. Adapted for
    automated recording and control of irrigation systems Needs calibration for each
    tree and is difficult to replicate. Requires complex instrumentation and expertise
    (e) Stem and fruit diameter Measures fluctuation in stem and fruit diameters in
    response to changes in water content Sensitive measure of plant water stress Not
    useful for the control of high-frequency irrigation systems  4. Remote sensing
    methods (a) Infrared thermometry Measures canopy temperature, which increases
    as a result of water stress Reliable and non-destructive Based on only a few point
    measurements. Does not account for soil and crop heterogeneity (I) CWSI Uses the
    difference between canopy and air temperatures to quantify crop water stress Sensitive
    to stomatal closure and crop water deficit Influenced by cloud cover, requires
    different baselines for different crops (II) DANS, DACT, and Tc ratio Measure
    single canopy temperature for quantifying water stress Require less data than
    CWSI for detecting water stress. Tc ratio gives quantitative water stress coefficient
    (Ks) for calculating crop ET Difficult to scale up to large cropped fields. (b)
    Spectral vegetation indices (i) Structural indices Measures reflectance indices
    within the VIS and NIR spectral range (NDVI, RDVI, OSAVI, TCARI) to indicate canopy
    changes due to water stress Non-destructive with high temporal and spectral resolution
    Requisite image analysis is still a challenging task. Precision reduces from leaf
    scale to canopy scale (ii) Xanthophyll indices Measures PRI and PRInorm, which
    are sensitive to the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments Account
    for physiological changes in photosynthetic pigment changes due to water stress
    More work is needed to convert raw imagery to user-friendly irrigation application
    (iii) Water indices Measures the reflectance trough in the near-infrared region
    (WI, SRWI, and NDWI) used to represent canopy moisture content Rapid and non-destructive
    measure of leaf water content Problem of scaling up to canopy level 2.1. Plant-based
    approach Stress quantification from plant-based approaches include the direct
    measurement of leaf water potential with a pressure chamber (Scholander et al.,
    1965). Leaf water potential is assumed to represent the mean soil water potential
    next to the plant roots (Ameglio et al., 1999), and provides good indication of
    leaf water status. It is widely adopted for scheduling irrigation in various crops
    (Alchanatis et al., 2010, Ameglio et al., 1999, Bellvert et al., 2016, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). However, the approach is slow and destructive, with limited temporal
    and spatial resolution, and is not suitable for strongly isohydric crops, which
    maintain a stable leaf water status over a wide range of evaporative demand or
    soil water supplies (Limpus, 2009). The amount of water in plant leaves can be
    measured by laboratory analysis, using Relative Water Content (RWC) and Equivalent
    Water Thickness (EWT) (Colombo et al., 2011). The EWT is the hypothetical thickness
    of a single layer of water averaged over the whole leaf area and can be computed
    in laboratory by measuring Fresh Weights and Dry weights and the one-sided leaf
    Area , as shown in Eq. (2). (2) At the canopy level, Equivalent Water Thickness
    (shown in Eq. (3)) can be obtained by scaling the with Leaf Area Index (LAI),
    defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf
    area/ground area, cm2/cm2). (3) The RWC compares the water content of a leaf with
    the maximum water content at full turgor and can be considered as an indicator
    of vegetation status. It can be obtained from laboratory measurements of leaf
    weight and leaf Turgid Weight (TW) according to the following expression: (4)
    Both RWC and EWC are good indicators of plant water status, and have been successfully
    used for scheduling irrigation in various crops (Danson et al., 1992, Jones, 2004,
    Panigada et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2015). The approaches require less sophisticated
    equipment, but are also destructive and time consuming. Several other approaches
    are available that give indirect indications of stress such as measurement of
    stomatal conductance (Agam et al., 2013, Ballester et al., 2013, Lorenzo-Minguez
    et al., 1985, Maes et al., 2011), measurement of fruit and stem diameter (Gallardo
    et al., 2006, Huguet et al., 1992), and sap-flow measurement (Giorio and Giorio,
    2003, Granier, 1987, Singh et al., 2010). Most plants exercise some measure of
    control over their leaf water status, by minimizing changes in leaf water status
    as the soil dries, through stomatal closure. Therefore, stomatal conductance is
    a very sensitive plant response to soil water deficit (Jones, 2004), except for
    some anisohydric species, which have less effective control of leaf water status
    under declining soil moisture conditions. The recognition that water stressed
    plants tend to close their stomata, which leads to increase in leaf temperature,
    has been used to develop thermal sensing methods, for the detection of plant stress
    (Idso et al., 1981). The approach provides a good indication of irrigation needs
    in many crops. However, measurements of stomatal conductance are tedious, and
    large leaf-to-leaf variation of the plant canopy requires much replication to
    obtain reliable data for irrigation scheduling. The sap flow technique is used
    to assess transpiration rates of plants, by measuring the rate at which sap ascends
    stems using heat pulse. In this approach, short pulses of heat are applied in
    the stem, and the mass flow of sap is determined from the velocity of the heat
    pulses moving along the stem. The changes in transpiration rate indicated by sap
    flow are mainly determined by changes in stomatal opening. Singh et al. (2010)
    used sap flow sensors to schedule irrigation in corn field, but noted that the
    approach only gives indirect estimates of changes in conductance, as flow is also
    dependent on atmospheric conditions such as humidity. Therefore, changes in sap
    flow can occur without changes in stomatal aperture. Several other studies used
    sap-flow measurement for irrigation scheduling and control in a diverse range
    of crops, including grapevine (Eastham and Gray, 1998), fruit and olive trees
    (Ameglio et al., 1999, Giorio and Giorio, 2003) and even greenhouse crops (Ehret
    et al., 2001), with varying degrees of success. However, Jones (2004) stated that
    sap flow method requires a heat source, complex instrumentation, technical expertise,
    and needs calibration for each crop and for definition of irrigation control thresholds.
    The use of plant-based indicators for irrigation scheduling requires the definition
    of threshold values, beyond which irrigation is essential. Therefore, it is important
    to regularly check the plant water status to avoid exceeding the reference values
    (Ballester et al., 2013). The threshold values, which are determined for plants
    growing under a well-watered condition, are difficult to obtain in a changing
    environment (Fereres and Goldhamer, 2003). Another limitation of plant-based approaches
    is that they do not usually provide information on the quantity of irrigation
    water to apply at any time, but only indicates that irrigation is required. This
    implies that soil moisture measurements or other estimation procedures are needed
    to determine the quantity of water to apply to optimize crop water use (Stockle
    and Dugas, 1992). A general drawback of both direct measurements of soil water
    status and plant-based approaches is the costs of installation of sensors or the
    difficulty with obtaining representative measurements, with single point sampling
    that would adequately account for soil and crop heterogeneity (Ballester et al.,
    2013, Jones, 2012). 2.2. Environmental canopy sensing Infrared thermometry and
    thermal imagery, along with additional environmental measurements, have been acknowledged
    as an alternative approach to soil moisture based methods of plant water stress
    detection (Berni et al., 2009a, Cohen et al., 2005, Jones, 2010, Osroosh et al.,
    2015). Water stress detection based on canopy temperature measurements is probably
    the most widely used plant-based approach for remote sensing that is applicable
    to irrigation scheduling of several crops. As plants absorb solar radiation, canopy
    temperature increases, but is cooled when that energy is used for evapotranspiration.
    Water stressed plants have reduced transpiration and higher leaf temperature compared
    to non-stressed crops. González-Dugo et al. (2006) used variability of canopy
    temperature to indicate water stress, and emphasised the need to quantify the
    complex relationship between canopy temperature, water stress, and spatial water
    availability. Collaizzi et al. (2012) revealed that canopy temperature-based algorithms
    are strongly correlated to crop outputs such as yield, water use efficiency, irrigation
    rates, seasonal evapotranspiration, and midday leaf water potential. Many indices
    have been established for evaluating water stress using infrared canopy temperature
    (Idso et al., 1981, Jones, 2004, Nielsen and Gardner, 1988, Osroosh et al., 2015,
    O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012, Payero and Irmak, 2006). Most of the indices use crop
    canopy temperature as a main driver for evaluation, typically as a single daily
    measurement at an assumed peak stress time, or by evaluating time above a temperature
    threshold. The approach is sensitive to small stresses, and relies on stomatal
    closure as an early indicator of water deficits. 2.2.1. Canopy temperature based
    crop water stress index (CWSI) The CWSI derived from canopy temperature has been
    largely adopted as a tool to indicate plant water status and schedule irrigation
    in many crops (Aladenola and Madramootoo, 2014, Alchanatis et al., 2010, Bellvert
    et al., 2016, Yildirim et al., 2012). CWSI theory is based on the principle that
    transpiration cools the leaf surface and as root zone soil moisture is depleted,
    stomatal conductance and transpiration decrease and leaf temperature increases.
    The concept of using CWSI for improving irrigation scheduling gained popularity
    when Idso et al. (1981) observed a linear relationship between canopy temperatures
    measured using infrared thermometry and air temperature and vapour pressure deficit,
    and developed an empirical method of quantifying crop water stress. The empirical
    CWSI (Eq. (5)) uses two baselines. The lower baseline represents canopy Temperature
    (Tc) minus air Temperature (Ta) of a well-watered crop transpiring at maximum
    potential rate and the upper baselines represents (Tc–Ta) of a non-transpiring
    crop. (5) where, Tc: canopy Temperature (°C), Ta: air Temperature (°C), Tnws:
    non-water stressed canopy Temperature (°C), and Tdry: water-stressed canopy Temperature
    (°C). Within the past few years, there have been improvements in the use of CWSI
    for monitoring water stress and scheduling irrigation in different crops (Berni
    et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014; O’shaughnessy
    et al., 2011; Paltineanu et al., 2013). O’Shaughnessy et al. (2012) incorporated
    a Time-Temperature Threshold (TTT) into a theoretical index (CWSI-TTT), and used
    it to successfully automate irrigations of grain sorghum. The study however, reported
    an under-irrigation problem during the growing season, caused by cloud cover and
    the influence of changing crop aspect on infrared thermometer measurements. Osroosh
    et al. (2015) developed an adaptive irrigation scheduling algorithm relying on
    a theoretical CWSI. This, unlike the traditional CWSI algorithm where the threshold
    is a constant value, uses a dynamic threshold determined by following the CWSI
    trend. However, large discrepancies in their thermal readings, attributed to infrared
    thermal and microclimatic measurements, resulted in dissimilar values of measured
    temperature and midday CWSI. Recent studies have evaluated additional indices
    based on infrared thermometry that require less information than CWSI for detecting
    crop water stress. Bausch et al. (2011) investigated the use of a ratio of canopy
    temperature (Tc ratio) measured over fully irrigated and water-stressed corn as
    a substitute for the Ks presently used in the reference ET-crop coefficient. The
    result indicated that the Tc ratio is a reasonable quantitative estimate of Ks
    for calculating crop ET under water stress conditions and that the ratio allows
    application of the crop coefficient method for scheduling deficit irrigation.
    Taghvaeiana et al. (2014) indicated that the Degrees Above Non-Stressed (DANS),
    which is based solely on canopy temperature, was effective in monitoring water
    stress and scheduling irrigations in deficit-irrigated sunflower in arid/semi-arid
    regions. DeJonge et al. (2015) recommended the Degrees Above Canopy Threshold
    (DACT) as a suitable index that requires a single canopy temperature measurement
    for quantifying water stress in maize. Kullberg et al. (2017) compared four thermal
    remote sensing indices based methods for estimating crop evapotranspiration coefficients:
    CWSI, DANS, DACT, Tc ratio, and observed that thermal indices DANS and DACT are
    responsive to crop water stress, comparable to more data intensive methods such
    as CWSI. While canopy temperature measurements by infrared thermometers are reliable
    and non-invasive (Cohen et al., 2005), they are usually based on only a few point
    measurements. Therefore, uniformity of soil water content and of plant canopy
    for large areas is assumed. Most researchers, however, assume that weather conditions
    are constant if the measurements required to locally calibrate the baselines are
    made close to solar noon and under clear sky conditions. This assumption is problematic
    because weather conditions change with location, time of day and day of the year,
    and the baselines for the same crop will consequently change with weather conditions
    (Payero and Irmak, 2006). Researchers from different places have, therefore, reported
    different baselines for the same crop (Idso et al., 1981, Irmak et al., 2000,
    Nielsen and Gardner, 1988, Payero and Irmak, 2006, Steele et al., 1994, Yazar
    et al., 1999). The lack of transferability of the baselines, together with the
    restriction of having to make required measurements close to solar noon and under
    clear sky conditions, are major drawbacks of using the empirical CWSI method for
    irrigation scheduling (Alves and Pereira, 2000). 3. Remote sensing methods Even
    though the usefulness of canopy temperature, measured from infrared thermometry,
    has been established in several studies for monitoring plant water stress, there
    are physiological and operational concerns that support the development of alternative
    narrow-band indices, based on the visible and red edge spectral region for detecting
    water stress in crops (Berni et al., 2009b, Dangwal et al., 2015, Panigada et
    al., 2014, Rossini et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2015, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013,
    Zhao et al., 2015). In some plants, the diurnal fluctuations in stomatal conductance
    are such that the relationships between canopy temperature and stress levels are
    not clear-cut. An increase in evaporative demand due to high vapor pressure deficits
    induces a constant decline in leaf conductance, even when the crops are well watered
    (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Again, monitoring of large cropped fields requires
    appropriate imagery at high spatial and spectral resolutions, as well as short
    revisit periods (Berni et al., 2009b). Although the use of remote sensing in agriculture
    was proposed few decades ago, it has not been widely adopted until recently, mainly
    because of the widespread adoption of emerging technologies that integrate high-resolution
    thermal cameras on board UAS (Berni et al., 2009a, Elston, 2016, Suárez et al.,
    2010, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). The potential applications of UAS in agriculture
    include; crop scouting, mapping canopy coverage, determining plant stresses, measuring
    soil moisture, managing variable-rate irrigation, and crop yield estimation (Ehsani
    et al., 2016). Recent researchers have proposed the integration of remotely sensed
    data with soil water balance method to improve irrigation water management. For
    instance, Campos et al. (2016) estimated total available water in soil by integrating
    evapotranspiration data and multispectral imagery. Filion et al. (2016) used remotely
    sensed image to map soil moisture in the Mediterranean regions to support water
    management and agricultural practice. Zhang et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2017b
    integrated airborne imagery data into a soil water balance model to improve the
    estimation of soil water deficit for maize and sunflower grown under full and
    deficit irrigation treatments. Therefore, UAS will be a vital tool for growers
    soon, because they can cover large areas, and take advantage of new sensing, mapping
    and data analytic technologies. Image resolution is improving and costs are also
    decreasing with time. Real time mapping and rapid image analysis also provide
    for early detection of plant water stress for timely irrigation scheduling, due
    to the potential to scale up information from the leaf to canopy/field levels
    (Gago et al., 2015) 3.1. Spectral reflectance indices The focus on indicators
    other than thermal infrared indices for monitoring water stress is because leaf
    temperature, though a direct indicator of plant transpiration, does not directly
    account for other physiological changes such as photosynthetic pigment changes
    or non-stomatal reductions of photosynthesis under water stress conditions (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013). The spectral vegetation indices that have been correlated to plant
    water stress are given in Table 2. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) (Gamon
    et al., 1992), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence emission (Flexas et
    al., 2002, Moya et al., 2004), are pre-visual indicators of water stress which
    serve as an indirect means for water stress detection (Berni et al., 2009b, Suárez
    et al., 2010). Table 2. Spectral vegetation indices that has been correlated to

    the reflectances at the respective wavelengths, nm. The PRI is sensitive to the
    epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and to photosynthetic efficiency
    (Gamon et al., 1992, Suárez et al., 2010). The functional basis of the PRI is
    based on its sensitivity to rapid changes in carotenoids through the de-epoxidation
    of the xanthophyll pigments (Magney et al., 2016), and to heat dissipation increasing
    under water stress conditions (Panigada et al., 2014). When the light absorbed
    by plants exceeds their photosynthetic demand, energy dissipation occurs to avoid
    damage to the tissues (Rossini et al., 2013). The plants dissipate this excess
    energy non-destructively through re-emission of photons as fluorescence (radiative
    dissipation), and by conversion of light energy into heat in the pigment bed (thermal
    dissipation). Previous studies have demonstrated that the interconversion of the
    xanthophyll cycle pigments can be detected in leaves as subtle changes in reflectance
    at 531 nm (Gamon et al., 1992, Gamon et al., 1997). Recently, researchers have
    shown the sensitivity of PRI for crop water stress detection over short time scales
    (Gamon et al., 1997, Suárez et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada et
    al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013), whereas studies conducted over longer time
    scales reported contrasting results, at the leaf and canopy scales (Gamon, 2015,
    Magney et al., 2016, Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran et al., 2012). The studies generally
    observed that there are certain issues with the index, such as leaf biomass, background
    reflectance, sensor spectral responses, and viewing-illumination geometry effects.
    Therefore, different researchers proposed new formulations for the index, using
    alternative reference bands (Hernández-Clemente et al., 2011). Zarco-Tejada et
    al. (2012) obtained higher correlations in a citrus orchard with PRI515 for stomatal
    conductance (gs) and leaf water potential (Ψ). Panigada et al. (2014) showed a
    high corelation between PRI586 and EWTcanopy, for cereal crops. Berni et al.,
    2009a, Berni et al., 2009b normalized the standard PRI using the Renormalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), an index that is sensitive to canopy structure,
    and a red edge index that is sensitive to chlorophyll content ( ). The new index
    (PRInorm) not only detects xanthophyll pigment changes as a function of water
    stress, but also normalizes for the chlorophyll content level and canopy leaf
    area reduction induced by stress. The PRInorm, showed an improved capacity for
    water stress detection (correlated with leaf stomatal conductance, gs and leaf
    water potential, Ψ) in comparison with other greenness and structural indices
    (Gago et al., 2015). Several other researchers have used the PRI and PRInorm for
    water stress detection as an alternative to thermal measurements, with varying
    degrees of success (Behmann et al., 2014, Cheng and Wang, 2014, Colombo et al.,
    2008, Dangwal et al., 2015, Meroni et al., 2008, Meroni et al., 2009, Panigada
    et al., 2014, Peñuelas et al., 2011, Rossini et al., 2013, Suárez et al., 2009,
    Suárez et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2015, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013). Rossini et al. (2013) revealed the feasibility of mapping water
    stress using spectral vegetation indices, taking advantage of the high spatial
    resolution capabilities that are more difficult in the thermal region. The studies
    revealed the potential applicability of remote sensing data in precision agriculture
    for improving irrigation scheduling. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of PRI measured
    at the crop canopy level requires further investigation, including an assessment
    for a new index formulation for high value vegetable crops, in order to optimise
    yield and productivity. 3.2. Structural indices Structural Indices are based on
    the reflectance of leaves in the visible and near-infrared bands of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( ) is the best-known vegetation
    index, used as a numerical indicator of vegetation greenness (Leroux et al., 2016,
    Zhao et al., 2015). The is an indication of the amount of chlorophyll and fraction
    of green cover. It is used in irrigation studies for mapping of crop cover as
    a means for estimating crop coefficients (Kc) for use in the conventional FAO-56
    method (Allen et al., 1998), and for irrigation scheduling (Jones, 2012). Previous
    studies have also shown that NDVI has a linear relationship with the basal crop
    coefficient for ET (Kcb), because Kcb primarily depends on the dynamics of plant
    canopies (cover fraction, LAI, greenness). Based on this, several researchers
    have used NDVI to predict Kcb for various agricultural crops (Allen et al., 2005,
    Choudhury et al., 1994, Irmak et al., 2011, Kamble et al., 2013, Kullberg et al.,
    2017, Jayanthi et al., 2000). Roujean and Breon (1995) and Haboudane et al. (2002)
    showed that empirically derived NDVI products are unstable, because they are affected
    by soil reflectance and sun view geometry. In an attempt to improve , the Renormalized
    Difference Vegetation Index ( ), Optimised Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index ( ),
    and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index ( ), were developed
    to minimize soil brightness influences from spectral vegetation indices involving
    red and Near-Infrared (NIR) wavelengths and to reduce the variability of the photosynthetically
    active radiation due to the presence of diverse non-photosynthetic materials.
    Subsequently, was established (Haboudane et al., 2002) to make accurate predictions
    of crop chlorophyll content from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. The ratio
    has been shown to be relatively insensitive to canopy cover variations, even for
    very low LAI values. Apart from their use in yield estimation, structural indices
    , , , , and are useful in plant stress monitoring to capture the changes in canopy
    structures caused by water stress (Haboudane et al., 2002, Roujean and Breon,
    1995, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012), and this is due to their positive correlations
    with stomatal conductance and leaf water potential (Gago et al., 2015). For instance,
    NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI were clearly related to the stem water potential (Ψstem)
    and gs in vineyards cv. Tempranillo (Baluja et al., 2012). However, in Citrus
    orchards the indices were less correlated with gs (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012).
    Usually, most structural indices are more related to plant vigor than the plant
    physiological status, and might correlate well in crops where the biomass proportionally
    increases in parallel to photosynthesis. While the studies demonstrated the feasibility
    of narrow-band indices obtained from hyperspectral sensors onboard UAVs for monitoring
    plant water stress, the results indicate that the sensitivity of the indices at
    the plant canopy level needs further study, before they could be adopted for precision
    irrigation water management. 3.3. Water indices Typically, the water-absorption
    bands in the 1300–2500 nm region show the highest sensitivity to leaf water concentration
    in most crops (Carter, 1991). However, the absorption by water in this region
    is very strong, so that infrared bands are inadequate for measuring the water
    concentration of the plant canopies (Peñuelas and Filella, 1998). Therefore, a
    reflectance trough in the near-infrared region at 950–970 nm, corresponding to
    a weaker water absorption band has been shown to be effective for representing
    the total plant or canopy moisture content (Peñuelas et al., 1997). When plants
    are water stressed, the 970 nm trough of the reflectance spectrum tends to disappear
    and to shift towards lower wavelengths (Peñuelas and Filella, 1998), and this
    concept was used to develop a reflectance water index and simple ration water
    index (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2003). The reflectance at 900 nm is used as a reference
    because there is no absorption by water at this wavelength, but it is subjected
    to the same changes in sample structure as the reading at 970 nm. This water index
    has been found to be highly correlated with plant water content in several crops
    (Peñuelas et al., 1997, Dawson et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2015). Peñuelas et al.
    (1997) observed a strong correlation between greenness and moisture content, and
    proposed the ratio as a better indicator of canopy water content than the water
    index itself. Gao (1996) used the Normalized Difference Water Index ( ) to monitor
    changes in water content of leaves using NIR (Near Infrared) and SWIF (Short Wave
    Infrared) at a wavelength of approximately 860 nm, and the other at 1240 nm, respectively.
    The SWIR reflectance reflects changes in both the vegetation water content and
    the spongy mesophyll structure in vegetation canopies, while the NIR reflectance
    is affected by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content but not by
    water content. The combination of the NIR with the SWIR removes variations induced
    by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content, thereby, improving the
    accuracy in retrieving the vegetation water content (Wang et al., 2015). However,
    Gao (1996) noted that is responsive to changes in water content of plant canopies,
    but is less sensitive to atmospheric aerosol scattering effects than . It is therefore,
    complementary to, not a substitute for . Nevertheless, previous studies have shown
    the relevance of water indices ( , , and ) for monitoring plant water stress in
    wheat and maize crops. For instance, Panigada et al. (2014) obtained a significant
    correlation between WI and EWTcanopy; Rossini et al. (2013) showed a high correlation
    between and RWC; while Wang et al. (2015) obtained a good relationship between
    and leaf water content, and concluded that the narrow bands at 780 and 1750 nm
    are sensitive to the water parameters of spring wheat. The interest in reflectance
    indices is to use them to scale-up to satellite imagery since the use of thermal
    imagery is unreliable due to its poor resolution, which obtains mixed information
    from the plant and the soil background. The researchers showed the possibility
    of mapping plant water stress using hyperspectral indices, but observed that the
    translation of this finding in accurate irrigation scheduling requires further
    investigations. 4. Concluding remarks and future perspectives Conventional irrigation
    scheduling techniques rely on soil moisture measurements, climatic data, and physiological
    measures of plant response to assess water stress. The approach is inadequate
    due to the high costs of sensors and their installation, and the difficulty with
    obtaining measurements, especially for heterogeneous soil and crop canopies. Plant
    indicators commonly used to determine crop water status are leaf water potential
    and stomatal conductance, but their measurements are either destructive, labour
    intensive or unsuitable for automation, which make it difficult for irrigators
    to adopt. Thus, automated techniques for monitoring crop water status that would
    provide non-destructive, rapid, and reliable estimates of plant water status are
    needed. Spectral vegetation indices acquired from hyperspectral sensors onboard
    UAS have been identified as a valuable tool for monitoring plant water status
    and improving irrigation water management. Generally, most physiological studies
    on plant water stress report relatively significant relationships (with R2 values
    of 0.5 or less) between a remotely sensed parameter such as NDVI or PRI and a
    measure such as leaf area index, stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential.
    Unfortunately, this sort of precision is inadequate to allow the use of single
    measurements of the parameters (e.g., NDVI or PRI) for estimation of plant water
    status. Therefore, innovative data management techniques that would integrate
    data from soil-based and plant-based approaches are needed to widen the scientific
    knowledge on the use of crop stress parameters to schedule irrigation, and provide
    irrigators with advanced tools for decision making. Even though spectral reflectance
    indices have been proposed for water stress detection in various crops, most of
    these studies focused on different species of tree and cereal crops. To our knowledge,
    the use of narrow-band optical indices for detecting water stress and scheduling
    irrigation has not been extensively investigated for high value vegetable crops
    in water stressed regions and environments, and growing conditions. Furthermore,
    since VIs for water stress detection are crop and climate specific, it is imperative
    to investigate the spectral VIs needed to improve the productivity and yields
    of vegetable crops. The potential is enormous based on recent advances in sensor
    technologies, image analysis and processing, computer based decision making, and
    in the measurement of hyperspectral indices from UAS. Again, leaf spectral properties
    are not solely dependent on plant water status. Factors such as soil background,
    canopy structure, leaf thickness, leaf age, differences in surface properties
    of leaves, and variations in leaf angle could influence the correlation between
    spectral response of leaves and plant water status. Future research should focus
    on the integration of thermal and narrow-band hyperspectral imagery to provide
    more precise information about plant water status, and the real-time data analysis
    and detection of plant water stress using advanced data analysis techniques that
    would be cost-effective and commercially available to farmers. Acknowledgment

    Abstract Thermal imaging is a technique to convert the invisible radiation pattern
    of an object into visible images for feature extraction and analysis. Infrared
    thermal imaging was first developed for military purposes but later gained a wide
    application in various fields such as aerospace, agriculture, civil engineering,
    medicine, and veterinary. Infrared thermal imaging technology can be applied in
    all fields where temperature differences could be used to assist in evaluation,
    diagnosis, or analysis of a process or product. Potential use of thermal imaging
    in agriculture and food industry includes predicting water stress in crops, planning
    irrigation scheduling, disease and pathogen detection in plants, predicting fruit
    yield, evaluating the maturing of fruits, bruise detection in fruits and vegetables,
    detection of foreign bodies in food material, and temperature distribution during
    cooking. This paper reviews the application of thermal imaging in agriculture
    and food industry and elaborates on the potential of thermal imaging in various
    agricultural practices. The major advantage of infrared thermal imaging is the
    non-invasive, non-contact, and non-destructive nature of the technique to determine
    the temperature distribution of any object or process of interest in a short period
    of time. Similar content being viewed by others Thermal Imaging Chapter © 2014
    Infrared Thermal Imaging Technique for Temperature Measurement in Various Energy
    Systems Chapter © 2020 Thermal Infrared Imaging Chapter © 2014 Introduction Temperature
    measurement is an important aspect in any industrial process and infrared thermography
    has revolutionized the concept of temperature measurement. Temperature measurements
    were generally performed using thermometers, thermocouples, thermistors, and resistance
    temperature detectors. These instruments can only determine temperature at specific
    points and most of these instruments need to establish a contact with the material.
    While infrared thermal imaging is a non-contact, non-destructive technique which
    provides temperature mapping of the material. Hence, use of infrared thermal imaging
    is widely increasing in many fields. All objects above 0 K (−273.15 °C) emit infrared
    rays which are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic spectrum
    comprises of radio waves, microwaves, infrared rays, visible light, ultraviolet
    rays, X-rays, and gamma rays (Fig. 1). The wavelength of infrared rays is in the
    range of 0.78–1,000 μm. The infrared region is further divided into different
    regions: near infrared (0.75–3 μm), mid infrared (3–6 μm), far infrared (6–15
    μm), and extreme infrared (15–1,000 μm); (Meola & Carlomagno 2004). The intensity
    of radiation emitted by an object is a function of its surface temperature, i.e.,
    the higher the temperature of the body, the greater is the intensity of infrared
    radiation emitted by the object. Thermal imaging is a technique which converts
    this radiation emitted by an object into temperature data without establishing
    contact with the object. Fig. 1 Electromagnetic spectrum (Kaiser 1996) Full size
    image Thermal imaging has a wide application in various fields such as civil engineering,
    industrial maintenance, aerospace, medicine, pharmacy, and veterinary. The application
    of thermal imaging is gaining popularity in agriculture and food industry in recent
    years. The major advantages of thermal imaging are non-contact, non-invasive,
    and rapid technique which could be used for online applications. The thermal cameras
    are easy to handle and highly accurate temperature measurements are possible.
    With the thermal imaging, it is possible to obtain temperature mapping of any
    particular region of interest with fast response times which is not possible with
    thermocouples or other temperature sensors which can only measure spot data. Repeatability
    of temperature measurements is high in thermal imaging. Also, thermal imaging
    does not require an illumination source unlike other imaging systems. Previous
    models of thermal camera’s required cryogenically cooled sensors to obtain temperature
    resolution of 0.1 °C whereas recent day cameras can operate at room temperature
    making these cameras user friendly and promoting an increase in the use of thermal
    imaging in various fields. The objective of this paper is to review and summarize
    the potential applications of thermal imaging in various aspects of agriculture
    and food industry. Thermal Imaging System Infrared thermal imaging system comprises
    of thermal camera equipped with infrared detectors, a signal processing unit and
    an image acquisition system, usually a computer. The infrared detectors absorb
    the infrared energy emitted by the object and convert it into an electrical impulse.
    The electrical impulse is sent to the signal processing unit which translates
    the information into thermal image. Most of the thermal imaging devices scan at
    a rate of 30 times per second and can sense temperature ranging from −20 to 1,500 °C,
    but the temperature range can still be increased by using filters (Meola & Carlomagno
    2004). Detectors are the most important part of thermal imaging system which converts
    the radiant energy into electrical signals proportional to the amount of radiation
    falling on them. There are two types of detectors: thermal and photon detectors.
    In thermal detectors, infrared radiation heats up the detector element resulting
    in temperature rise, which is taken as a measure of the radiation falling on the
    object. In photon detectors, incident radiation interacts at an atomic or molecular
    level with the material of the detector to produce charge carriers that generate
    a voltage across the detector element or a change in its electrical resistance.
    The various types of photon detectors used are cadmium mercury telluride (CMT),
    indium antimonide, platinum silicide, and Quantum well devices. Among the two
    types, photon detectors provide greater sensitivity than thermal detectors (Willimas
    2009). Thermal imaging devices can be classified into uncooled and cooled (Sierra
    Pacific Innovations http://www.x20.org/thermal/thermal_weapon_sight.htm). Uncooled
    thermal imaging device is the most common one and the infrared detector elements
    are contained in a unit that operates at room temperature. They are less expensive
    but their resolution and image quality tend to be lower than the cooled device.
    In the cooled thermal imaging device, the sensor elements are contained in a unit
    which is maintained below 0 °C. They have a very high resolution and can detect
    temperature difference as low as 0.1 °C but they are expensive (Sierra Pacific
    Innovations http://www.x20.org/thermal/thermal_weapon_sight.htm). Cooled thermal
    imaging devices are used in military and aerospace applications. An infrared imaging
    system is evaluated based on thermal sensitivity, scan speed, image resolution,
    and intensity resolution. Table 1 describes the specifications of the thermal
    camera used in various studies discussed in this paper. Table 1 Details of infrared

    table Applications of Thermal Imaging in Agriculture Thermal imaging has a potential
    application in many operations involved in agriculture, starting from assessing
    the seedling viability, estimating soil water status, estimating crop water stress,
    scheduling irrigation, determining disease and pathogen affected plants, estimating
    fruit yield, and evaluating maturity of fruits and vegetables. This section elaborates
    on studies conducted to determine potential use of thermal imaging in agriculture.

    Applications of thermal imaging in agriculture Full size table Crop Water Stress
    Use of thermography for monitoring canopy temperature, identifying plant stress,
    and estimating stomatal conductance to aid in irrigation scheduling were studied
    by many researchers (Jones et al. 2002; Jones 1999a; Jones 1999b; Leinonen & Jones
    2004). Leaf water potential (LWP) is a widely accepted parameter for monitoring
    water status and irrigation scheduling for plants. Sela et al. (2007) used thermal
    and visible images to generate leaf water potential status of cotton crops (Gossypium
    barbadense L.). Thermal images were obtained using a ThermaCAM SC2000, thermal
    camera and digital RGB images were acquired using a digital camera (DSC-F717,
    Sony Inc., Tokyo, Japan) attached to the thermal camera. All measurements were
    conducted mainly during flowering and boll development stages during which most
    water is applied to the plants. Crop water stress index (CWSI) was calculated
    based on canopy temperatures and theoretical and empirical references. LWP was
    measured from models built by CWSI and the models based on empirical references
    showed good correlation with measured LWP. They concluded that LWP maps can help
    in irrigation scheduling and can provide support to determine the defects in irrigation
    system. Stoll and Jones (2007) explored the possibility of using thermal imaging
    as a tool for monitoring plant stress. The experiments were conducted on mature
    grapevines (Vitis vinifera) growing on deep sandy soil and the treatments were
    no irrigation and full irrigation and images were obtained using IR Snapshot 525
    thermal camera. The temperature of Moscatel variety with sunlight for irrigated
    and non-irrigated conditions were 35.1 and 36.5 °C, whereas the temperature of
    the Moscatel in shaded area for irrigated and non-irrigated conditions were 32.6
    and 33.5 °C, respectively. Their study showed that temperature difference between
    stressed and non-stressed plants could be very helpful to identify water stress
    in plants and this could be used in irrigation scheduling. Monitoring stomatal
    conductance can be a better indicator of plant response to drying soil than monitoring
    water potential because reductions in stomatal conductance can occur even before
    any change in plant water status (Jones 2004). Thermography seems to have a great
    potential because as water is lost through stomata, leaves cool and hence as stomata
    close, leaf temperature rises which could be detected through thermal imaging.
    Grant et al. (2006) conducted studies aimed at comparing the precision of thermography
    and conventional porometry and water relation measurements between water stressed
    and well-watered control plants under greenhouse conditions using IR Snapshot
    525 thermal camera. The experiments were conducted with grapevines (V. vinifera
    L), French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and lupins (Lupinus albus L.). Stomatal
    conductance and leaf temperatures were measured on the same leaves, with porometer
    measurements immediately following thermal imaging. Based on the results, they
    concluded that a good correlation was found between the IG index ((T dry − T leaf)/(T
    leaf − T wet)) obtained from thermography and stomatal conductance measured with
    a porometer. However, they recommended few guidelines to optimize the technique:
    the time between spraying the wet reference leaf and taking image must be standardized,
    all plants and reference must be subjected to the same amount of radiation environment
    and the imager must be allowed to equilibrate before measurements. Grant and Chaves
    (2005) studied thermal imaging for identifying water stress in grapevines of cultivar
    Aragonez with three irrigation treatments (deficit irrigation, regulated deficit
    irrigation, and partial root zone drying) using a IR Snapshot 525 thermal camera.
    Their results suggested that canopy temperature was more useful for detecting
    water stress than leaf temperature because canopy temperatures are based on average
    temperature over a group of leaves. When images were taken for individual leaves,
    temperature and index values obtained were not correlated with stomatal conductance
    because leaves at similar temperature may have different stomatal conductance
    based on orientation and inclination angles of leaves. Merlot et al. (2002) studied
    the use of infrared thermal imaging to isolate Arabidopsis mutants defective in
    stomatal regulation using ThermaCam PM250 thermal camera. Plants synthesize abscisic
    acid (ABA) hormone which triggers the closure of stomatal pores during periods
    of drought to conserve water by reducing transpirational water loss. Leaf temperature
    can be used as an indicator to detect mutants with altered stomatal control. They
    used ABA-deficient and ABA-insensitive mutants as controls to optimize experimental
    conditions for thermographic detection of individual plants with altered stomatal
    response. These conditions were then used to perform pilot test for mutants that
    displayed a reduced ability for stomatal closure. They identified mutations at
    two novel loci that inhibit ABA regulation of stomatal aperture. Pathogen Detection
    Stoll et al. (2008) explored the potential of thermal imaging for pathogen detection
    in grapevine (V. vinifera L.) under different water status. Experiments were conducted
    under greenhouse conditions to monitor leaf temperature of Plasmopara viticola
    pathogen-infected and non-infected areas under different irrigation treatments:
    (1) control, irrigated to field capacity and non-inoculated vines; (2) irrigated
    to field capacity and inoculated vines; (3) non-irrigated and non-inoculated vines;
    and (4) non-irrigated and inoculated vines. Thermal images were obtained using
    a TH7102MX thermal camera. The analysis of thermal images showed that pathogen
    development caused an increase in leaf temperature at the point of infection in
    irrigated vines and the plants under severe water stress (non-irrigated) showed
    a lower temperature at the sites of inoculation. The authors could not state the
    mechanism causing the contrast effect on leaf temperature due to difference in
    water status of the plant but the study showed that thermal imaging could be used
    as an indicator for early detection of stress and providing information on the
    interaction of biotic and abiotic stressors. Downy mildew of cucumber (Cucumis
    sativus L.) leaves is caused by the pathogen Pseudoperonospora cubensis, which
    results in changes in metabolic processes including transpiration rate. Oerke
    et al. (2006) explored the potential of thermal imaging to determine the effect
    of downy mildew on cucumber leaves. Cucumber seeds were germinated on moist paper,
    transplanted to plastic pots, and grown in greenhouse at 20–25 °C and 70 + 10%
    RH. About 5 ml of P. cubensis suspension was sprayed on the leaves using hand
    sprayer and the plants were assessed daily for mildew development. Thermal images
    were obtained using VARIOSCAN 3021 ST thermal camera. The maximum temperature
    difference between healthy and infected leaves was studied using thermal images
    recorded day by day up to 8 days after inoculation. Two days after inoculation
    with P. cubensis, the temperature of affected leaves was 2 °C higher. The maximum
    temperature difference within the infected leaves was significantly larger than
    the maximum temperature difference of non-inoculated plants. Hellebrand et al.
    (2006) studied the possibility of detecting infested plants using thermal and
    NIR imaging under laboratory and field conditions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum, variety
    “Kanzler”) plants artificially infected by powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis)
    were thermally imaged using ThermaCAM SC 500 or ThermaCAM 545 and NIR images were
    obtained using ALPHA NIRTM (Indigo Systems Corporation). Their results showed
    that temperature of the infested plants was lower compared to healthy plants in
    the range of 0.2 to 0.7 °C and hence infested plants could be identified using
    thermal imaging under the laboratory conditions. Whereas under field conditions,
    temperature variability of soil and plants superposed temperature changes due
    to infestation and hence hampered the detection of infested plants. They concluded
    that NIR imaging as a standalone method was not suitable for determination of
    infested plants while thermal imaging was useful under laboratory conditions.
    Chaerle et al. (1999) studied the presymptomatic determination of plant virus
    interaction by use of thermal camera THV 900 LW. Salicyclic acid (SA) produced
    by plants as a defense signal against pathogens induces metabolic heating, and
    when exogenously applied, increases leaf temperature. The authors applied SA to
    tobacco leaves and determined the resistance of tobacco mosaic virus before any
    disease symptom was visible on tobacco leaves. When SA was applied to tobacco
    leaves, the infected sites were 0.3–0.4 °C warmer than the surrounding tissue
    and were detectable 8 ± 1 h before the initial appearance of necrotic lesions.
    Ice Nucleation The detection of ice formation in plant tissues is challenging
    and the electronic recording of plant temperature using thermocouples and examining
    the latent heat of crystallization of water at the point of freezing was the only
    method available until recently. This method is difficult and unreliable because
    many thermocouples need to be attached and these inserted thermocouples may damage
    cells leading to ice nucleation at that site and sometimes even carefully attached
    thermocouples may become detached during testing. Fuller and Wisniewski (1998)
    used infrared thermal camera Inframetrics Model 760 LW to study ice nucleation
    and freezing behavior of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and cauliflower (Brassica
    oleracea). Thermal imaging of potato plants showed that during freezing, leaves
    rapidly equilibrated (within seconds) to the temperature of the air while the
    stems cooled more slowly (5–10 min). The thermal imaging of cauliflower head showed
    that the coldest zones were those that were most peripheral, i.e., the tip of
    the floret while the warmest zones were the cracks and crevices between florets.
    The use of thermal imaging gave insight into where ice nucleates and how it spreads
    in two plant species. For potato plants, supercooling to sub zero temperature
    (−6 to −8 °C) was possible without any physiological damage; however, once these
    plants froze, then shoot death was complete within 10 min of nucleation. Their
    work was the first published visualization of ice nucleation and demonstrates
    that infrared imaging can be used to investigate frost hardiness in plants. Pearce
    and Fuller (2001) studied the freezing of barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Gleam) by
    infrared video thermography using Inframetrics thermal camera Model 760 LW. Their
    results showed that organs of barley froze in this order: nucleated leaf, roots,
    older leafs, younger leaves, and secondary tiller. Initial spread of freezing
    was not damaging but the ice formed during first freezing event initiates second
    freezing event, which causes the damage. Determination of Fruit Yield Bulanon
    et al. (2008) studied the temporal variation in citrus (Citrus sinensis) canopy
    for citrus fruit detection using thermal imaging. The focus of the study was on
    fruit recognition from the canopy, to enhance the robotic harvesting of fruit,
    which is an alternate for harvesting by hand. The thermal camera ThermaCam P65HS
    was positioned 2 m from the region of interest on the canopy surface and images
    were acquired for 24 h at 15 min interval. The images were analyzed using Matlab
    and the fruit and leaf temperature had the same trend throughout the region of
    interest. From evening 16:00 until early morning, the fruit temperature was higher
    than the leaf by about 1.6 °C while in the other time range, the temperature was
    higher only at less than 0.6 °C. Their results suggested that thermal imaging
    has a potential to distinguish between fruit and canopy from afternoon until midnight.
    Stajnko et al. (2004) demonstrated the applicability of thermal imaging for predicting
    the number and diameter of apple (Malus domestica) fruits to calculate the yield
    in an apple orchard. Thermal camera AGEMA 570 was used for the experiment and
    images were captured at five stages of fruit development and images were recorded
    late in the afternoon to achieve temperature gradient between fruits and the background.
    Various image processing algorithms, thresholding, filtering, and longest segment
    algorithms were used to differentiate the fruits from the background and the leaves.
    The results of the study showed that a close correlation (R 2 = 0.83–0.88) existed
    between manually counted fruits and fruits determined by thermal imaging. The
    correlation coefficient was R 2 = 0.68 to 0.70 between manually measured diameter
    and the diameter of fruit determined by imaging. Post-harvest Operations: Quality
    Evaluation of Agricultural Products Thermal imaging has potential applications
    in many post-harvest operation such as quality evaluation of fruits and vegetables,
    quality testing of meat, detection of foreign materials in food, temperature mapping
    in cooked food and grain, drying, and detection of defects in packaging. Table
    3 describes the applications of thermal imaging in post-harvest and quality evaluation
    operations. In Table 4, the applications of thermal imaging are listed with the
    temperature difference determined in various research studies. Table 3 Applications
    of thermal imaging in post-harvest and food industry operations Full size table
    Table 4 Applications of thermal imaging and the corresponding temperature ranges
    in various applications Full size table Bruise Detection in Fruits Bruising is
    the major factor for rejecting fruits during sorting because bruised fruits can
    cause significant damage to unbruised fruits during storage as well as consumers
    are not willing to purchase fruits with bruises. The existing sorting systems
    are not capable of effectively distinguishing fruit with bruises which has occurred
    a short time before inspection. Baranowski et al. (2009) developed a method to
    detect early bruising in apple using pulsed-phase thermography (PPT). Apple (M.
    domestica Borkh) varieties, Jonagold, Champion and Gloster were subjected to bruising
    by a specific procedure and stored at room temperature for 1 h before thermographic
    bruise assessment. The experimental set-up consisted of VIGOcam v50 thermal camera
    with two halogen lamps and a system for controlling the heat pulse time. In the
    first stage of study (no heat stimulation), the temperature difference between
    sound and bruised areas as well as between shallow and deeper bruises were close
    to 0 °C, indicating that passive thermography could not be used for early bruise
    detection. Whereas, after heating the apple for 1 s, considerable temperature
    difference between bruised and sound apples were seen. The temperature of the
    bruised part was colder and variation ranged between 0.9 and 1.5 °C for Jonagold,
    0.9 and 1.8 °C for Champion, and 1.0 and 2.1 °C for Gloster apples. They concluded
    that with the use of PPT, it was possible to distinguish bruised apples at the
    early stages and the bruises reaching various depths under the skin of the apple.
    Varith et al. (2003) explored the potential of using thermal imaging to detect
    bruises in apples by sensing thermal diffusivity (α) differences between bruised
    and sound tissue because rate of heating or cooling is different for damaged and
    sound tissues. Apples (Fuji and McIntosh) were dropped from 0.46 m onto a smooth
    concrete floor and held at 26 °C and 50% RH for 48 h to allow bruise development.
    Thermal images were taken using a ThermaCamTM PM390 during heating and cooling
    treatments. The apples were refrigerated prior to imaging for at least 3 h and
    then randomly subjected to one of the three treatments: (1) heating with forced
    convection in ambient air; (2) heating with forced convection in the air heated
    to 37 °C; and (3) cooling with forced convection after being heated in 40 °C water
    for 2–3 min. The results showed that heating treatments 1 and 2 were more successful
    in bruise detection than the cooling treatment and the temperature of bruised
    tissue lagged up to 1–2 °C behind the sound tissue temperature. The bruise detection
    was due to thermal diffusivity differences between the damaged and sound tissues
    and not due to the thermal emissivity differences, because there was no temperature
    difference between bruised and sound tissue at thermal equilibrium. They concluded
    that first treatment gave 100% accuracy for bruise detection within 180 s or less,
    second treatment gave slightly less accurate results but in 90 s and the cooling
    treatment gave 66% accuracy in 90 s in bruise detection in apples. Veraverbeke
    et al. (2003) evaluated the surface quality of two different apple cultivars (Elshof
    and Jonagored). Temperatures were recorded during cooling of individual fruits
    from 20 to 12 °C and storage experiment was carried out under standardized conditions
    and quality assessment of apples after 4 and 8 months of control atmosphere storage
    was done. Their results showed a difference in cooling rate between the two cultivars,
    which was related to the differences in wax structure between the two and Elshof
    had a faster cooling rate and lower temperature than Jonagored. Danno et al. (1977)
    demonstrated the potential of grading of fruits for bruise and other surface defects
    by infrared imaging using Infra-Eye 102A thermal camera. Apples and mandarins
    were selected for the study and the fruits were artificially damaged by pressing
    and scratching. The fruits were kept at constant temperature for 24 h before measurement
    and the constant temperature was higher (30 °C) or lower (10 °C) than the room
    temperature. The thermal images of bruised and unbruised fruits showed a difference
    in the temperature range of 0.2–1.0 °C and the temperature of the bruised fruits
    were lower than the unbruised fruits. Maturity Evaluation of Fruits Firmness and
    maturity are important attributes regarding the quality of fruits and vegetables.
    These parameters are determined by visual inspection, ultrasound or destructively
    using a pressure tester. There is a search for an alternative non-destructive
    method for maturity evaluation of fruits and vegetables. Hellebrand et al. (2000)
    evaluated the use of thermography for determination of mechanical damage, bruising,
    and maturing of apples (Jonagold, Cox) using VARIOSCAN 2011 thermal camera. Their
    results suggested that mechanical damages can be detected by means of localized
    temperature decrease. Because bruising of apples causes cell defects without damaging
    the skin and the changes in temperature were lower than 0.1 °C, therefore, bruising
    was not measurable by thermal imaging. They also suggested that maturity of apples
    can be estimated by thermal imaging and different varieties of apples could be
    identified if they are of the same ripeness. Offermann et al. (1998) explored
    the potential of non-contact, non-destructive, infrared thermography to detect
    apples (M. domestica; green Granny Smith and red and yellow Elstar) and cherry
    tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum; red, orange-red, green-yellow, and green) at different
    maturity stages. The samples were placed on a 1 m distant platform and energized
    by a short and intense pulse of light for 5 ms from four lamps (3,000 J). No damage
    was done to the samples due to the incident energy and the resulting temperature
    decay rate was measured using AGEMA 880 LW thermal camera. The results of cherry
    tomatoes showed that red and orange tomatoes are more effectively heated than
    the green ones, indicating higher absorption of light in the skin of red and orange
    tomatoes. For the apples, the Elstar yellow was more transparent to the flash
    radiation than the red Elstar or green Granny Smith apples. The results of the
    pulsed infrared thermography study indicated that to some extent the products
    can be distinguished by the skin temperature. However, due to combined effect
    of optical (semi-transparency and light scattering within apples) and thermal
    (heat diffusion) phenomena, interpretation of data remains a difficult task. Danno
    et al. (1980) studied the potential of maturity evaluation of three different
    fruits: Japanese persimmon (Disopyros kaki L), Japanese pear (Pyrus serotina Rehder),
    and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) using Infra-Eye 102A thermal camera.
    The maturity grades were divided into three: immature, mature, and over-ripe fruits
    based on color, firmness, and sugar content. Their experiments showed that the
    surface temperature of immatured fruits and vegetables, stored at lower temperature
    was slightly higher than matured and over-riped ones. The surface temperature
    of immature fruits and vegetable stored at higher temperature was slightly lower
    than those of matured and over-riped ones. Quality of Ham Nanni Costa et al. (2007)
    used thermography for the assessment of pork and ham suitability to be processed
    as dry cured ham on the slaughter line. Thermal images were obtained on left and
    right ham of 40 carcasses of pigs using ThermaCam P25 thermal camera. Their results
    showed no difference in the average temperature among the various parameters such
    as pH, color values, and ham defects such as veining or red skin. But hams with
    lower fat cover showed a significantly warmer surface temperature and it was suggested
    that lower thermal insulation due to a thinner subcutaneous adipose tissue might
    be responsible for higher skin temperature. They concluded that infrared thermography
    could be a fast and non-invasive method to estimate the fat content of ham. Detection
    of Foreign Bodies in Food The presence of foreign bodies in food is a major safety
    concern and various methods are employed in the food industry. Visual inspection
    is commonly used but it is affected by several factors. Physical separation methods
    such as sieving, sedimentation, screening, filtering, and gravity systems are
    used and more sophisticated systems such as metal detectors, X-ray machines, optical
    sensors, and ultrasonic methods are used for the detection of foreign objects.
    But there is no system capable of determining every contaminant regardless of
    size and shape. Warmann and Märgner (2005) studied the detection of foreign bodies
    in hazelnuts and thermal image analysis of single nuts to inspect the quality
    of individual nuts using a Thermosensorik CMT 384 thermal camera. The hazel nuts
    along with foreign bodies were made to pass on a conveyor belt and slightly heated.
    After a fixed period of cooling time, thermal images were captured. They used
    image processing techniques such as thresholding and texture analysis algorithms.
    The study implies that thermal imaging could be used to detect foreign materials
    and determine the quality of individual hazel nuts such as the ones with insect
    stings or foul nuts. Since their study was tested under laboratory conditions,
    the authors suggested that extensive test under industrial condition need to be
    performed. Ginesu et al. (2004) studied the potential of thermal imaging to detect
    foreign bodies in food products using a Thermosensorik CMT 384 thermal camera.
    To distinguish between a food material and a foreign body, either the emissivity
    or the different heat conductive capacities of the material should be used. Since
    difference in emissivities may not produce good contrast images, they used the
    difference in heat capacities of food and other materials to detect undesirable
    materials. The food materials chosen were almonds and raisin and foreign bodies
    were wooden stick, stone, metal chip, and cardboard. They used a pulse thermography
    and the experimental procedure was that the object was placed (food material and
    foreign body) on a conveyor belt under the camera and a heat pulse was applied;
    and then the decrease in surface temperature was observed. Due to difference in
    heating capacities, different object will cool down with different speed and they
    recorded a long sequence (500 frames, 80 frames per second) and extracted the
    thermal images. They applied various image processing techniques such as binarization,
    statistical, and morphological analysis. They concluded that results are promising
    and thermal imaging has a potential to detect foreign bodies in food materials.
    Meinlschmidt and Märgner (2002) conducted two different studies to detect foreign
    substances in food using Thermosensorik CMT 384 thermal camera. The first one
    was to detect the presence of cherries in chocolate chunks by their emissivity
    coefficient without applying any heat impact. The second study was to detect the
    presence of leaves, stalks, pedicels, and thorns in a variety of different fruits
    by difference in the heat conductivity or capacity of different materials by allowing
    the materials to pass on the conveyor belt with a heat source and a thermal camera
    captures the image during the state of decreasing temperature (Fig. 2). Their
    results showed that thermography could be used to detect foreign substances in
    the food material but they suggested that these methods have to be tested on a
    larger scale material in real-time environment. Fig. 2 Experimental set-up for
    detecting foreign bodies in a food stream (source: Meinlschmidt & Märgner 2002)
    Full size image Storage To maintain an optimum temperature of 5 °C in potato storage
    facility is a challenge and thermal imaging offers a possibility to visualize
    processes like warming-up, cooling, and air flow development in the storage facility.
    The potential of using thermal imaging to optimize the climate control of potato
    storage was demonstrated by Geyer et al. (2004). An infrared thermal camera ThermaCam
    SC 500 was used for the experiments. The results of experiments supplied valuable
    information about temperature distribution in a big box potato store. There was
    a wide temperature range between the front and the sides of the wooden boxes ranging
    from 1.5 to 9 °C and wide temperature variation also occurred between the stacks
    of potatoes in the wooden box. Hence, thermography provided a good view of the
    temperature differences within a potato storage facility which could be used for
    designing a temperature control system to provide uniform temperature within the
    storage. Grain Storage In Canadian grain handling facilities, Berlese funnel is
    the most commonly used method to detect insect infestation (Canadian Grain Commission
    2004). It is a time-consuming method and the accuracy is low for developing life
    stages. The thermal imaging could serve as an alternative method to detect insect
    infestation because, the respiration of insects result in heat production higher
    than that of the grain (Damcevski et al. 1998; Emekci et al. 2002). An infrared
    thermal camera ThermaCAM SC500 was used by Manickavasagan et al. (2007) to test
    whether insect infestation could be determined using thermal imaging. The Canada
    Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat kernels were artificially infested with eggs of
    Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) (Rusty grain beetle) and thermal images were
    acquired on days 4, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 27 to represent four larval stages, pupal,
    and adult stages, respectively. The classification accuracy for quadratic function
    was 83.5% and 77.7%, for infested and sound kernels, respectively, and in linear
    analysis, classification accuracy was 77.6% and 83.0%, respectively, for infested
    and sound kernels. They concluded that insect infestation could be determined
    by thermal imaging to certain accuracy, but it is less effective in identifying
    the developmental stages of the insect. In grain handling facilities, most of
    the grading factors including varietal purity are determined by visual inspection
    which is a subjective method and leads to error in many circumstances (Majumdar
    & Jayas 2000). Manickavasagan et al. (2008a, b) explored the possibility of thermal
    imaging as a rapid online method for identifying various wheat (T. aestivum) classes.
    Eight major wheat classes in Canada: Canada Prairie Spring Red, Canada Prairie
    Spring White, Canada Western Extra Strong, Canada Western Hard White Spring, Canada
    Western Red Spring, Canada Western Amber Durum, Canada Western Red Winter, and
    Canada Western Soft White Spring were used for the study and thermal images were
    obtained using ThermaCAM SC500 camera. Three images were taken for each sample:
    before heating, after heating for 180 s, and after cooling for 30 s. The results
    of the study showed that classification accuracy was in the range of 57–88% for
    the eight-class model and the classification accuracy improved between 76–95%
    for four-class model (red and white class wheat classified separately). They concluded
    that although thermal imaging has a potential to identify wheat classes, further
    investigations to study the performance of the system with composite samples is
    necessary. Thermal Imaging in Processing Temperature is the most frequently measured
    variable in any process engineering but its assessment is always not accurate
    (Berrie 2001). During pelleting, temperature is a critical parameter and high
    temperature in a moist food or feed material results in a wide range of physical
    and chemical changes. Salas-Bringas et al. (2007) studied the non-contact temperature
    monitoring of a pelleting process of poultry feed using infrared thermography
    and ThermoVision A40M thermal camera was used. The experiment was carried out
    in a Pellet Press (Münch Edelstahl, Germany) with two corrugated rollers and assembled
    with a double conditioner. The infrared camera was installed and temperature monitored
    at various locations such as: pellets at the die exit and surface of rotating
    die/pellets, temperature of meal at the outlet of the conditioner, and pellets
    at the outlet of the pellet press. The experiment showed that temperature increase
    in the meal was not only because of the friction in the die hole, but also because
    of the stress, strain, and friction produced in the gap between the rollers and
    die ring, and the heat transfer from the hotter die. They concluded that IR thermography
    facilitates temperature measurement of sticky material, moving objects and temperature
    distribution within the products in a process. They also suggested that improved
    instrument design was required for operation in dusty, damp, steamy, and oily
    environments. Escherichia coli Detection Traditional methods for isolation and
    identification of E. coli from contaminated food are time consuming and labor
    intensive (Catarame et al. 2003). Since E. coli respiration generates a small
    but significant amount of heat that can be detected by thermal camera, Hahn et
    al. (2006) explored the possibility of determining E. coli at their earlier stage
    using thermal imaging. An infrared thermal camera Model D500 was used to image
    sterile agar and those inoculated with culture of E. coli. Detection accuracies
    ranged between 75% and 100% and hence they concluded that E. coli could be detected
    using thermal imaging and the minimum time required for detecting microbial contamination
    was 5 h. They suggested that E. coli should be applied to vegetable and meat surface
    to determine whether they can be detected at the same rate in the food materials.
    Temperature Mapping in Food and Grain Inadequate cooking of ground beef may result
    in food-borne illness attributable to E. coli O157:H7, hence it was suggested
    to cook the ground beef patties to at least 71 °C (USDA 1998). Berry (2000) assessed
    the temperature variability in beef patties cooked from frozen versus thawed state
    using infrared thermography. Cooked beef patties were cut perpendicular to the
    flat surface within 5 s from the removal from the electric griddles and infrared
    images were captured within a second of making the cut using Agema Thermovision
    550 thermal Camera. The observed temperatures were in the range of 54.4 to 73.9 °C.
    These are not actual temperatures but slightly lower due to rapid evaporative
    cooling of patty surfaces. Infrared imaging showed that internal temperatures
    were higher and more consistent for patties cooked from thawed state than for
    frozen patties. The non-uniformity of surface temperatures of grain after heating
    in an industrial microwave dryer (2,450 MHz) was determined using thermal imaging
    (Fig. 3) by Manickavasagan et al. (2006). An infrared camera ThermaCAM SC500 was
    used to determine the surface temperature distribution in barley, wheat, and canola.
    The average surface temperatures after microwave treatment were between 72.5 to
    117.5 °C, 65.9 to 97.5 °C, and 73.4 to 108.8 °C for barley, canola, and wheat,
    respectively. Hence, infrared thermal imaging could be used to determine the surface
    temperature mapping of grain which is important in predicting the end use quality
    of grain. Fig. 3 Industrial microwave system with a thermal camera Full size image
    Drying Surface drying is an important unit operation in a fresh fruit processing
    plant. In a citrus surface drier, using an excessive air temperature or drying
    the fruit for long-time results in loss of sensory quality and reduced shelf life
    of the fruit. Fito et al. (2004) tested a system to control the surface drying
    time of citrus using infrared imaging. An AGEMA Thermovision 470 camera was installed
    on the dryer to record the infrared emission from the surface of the oranges,
    var. Valencia Late (C. sinensis). Their experiment showed occurrence of two drying
    steps: the lowest temperature value at the beginning of drying process was considered
    as the true wet bulb temperature and the end of first drying step occurred when
    the entire orange surface was at a higher temperature than the wet bulb temperature.
    The next step was the orange peel drying which occurred when no water was present
    on the orange surface and it must be avoided because it contributes to the fruit
    surface damage. Drying time could be established using IR thermal cameras and
    an empirical model was developed to correlate drying times with air conditions.
    Their study revealed that image analysis using infrared thermal camera could be
    used as a non-destructive measure to determine final drying time and hence can
    improve the fruit quality. The properties of a dried surface can be controlled
    by the manner in which a solvent evaporates from the surface. Infrared thermography
    can detect the point at which surface drying begins because evaporative cooling
    is lost at this point and the surface temperature rises. Fike et al. (2004) studied
    the drying of surface by infrared thermography using AGEMA 900SW/TE thermal camera.
    The authors demonstrated the technique with two applications: wood drying where
    the surface is rough, and the deposition of an organic film from water on a smooth
    metal surface. Since the temperature rise is initially very small and difficult
    to detect, the coefficient of variance of the temperature can detect the onset
    of surface dryout with greater sensitivity. They concluded that coefficient of
    variance analysis of infrared thermography provides a method for visualizing the
    breakage of a liquid film on metal surface or the onset of wooden surface drying.
    This technique could be used in the design and monitoring of process where film
    dewetting is important. Packaging One of the key challenges in the packaging industry
    is to develop a non-destructive technique to detect package defects such as cracking,
    delamination, and voids. Liu and Dias (2002) studied the potential of thermal
    imaging to identify packaging defects. The principle is that when heat is applied
    to an object, it diffuses from the source to the surrounding material. Any flaw
    in the material affects the diffusion rate which in turn affects the temperature
    in the vicinity of flaw and as a result, changes the temperature profile on the
    surface of the material, which could be detected by surface thermal response of
    infrared imaging. In this study, a thin layer of thermal interface material (TIM)
    was sandwiched between silicon die and lid and the four samples with different
    TIM defect were tested: without TIM defect, TIM delamination, lack of TIM, and
    no TIM. The testing system consists of a heating source, IR camera (3–5 μm) with
    indium antimonide detector, data acquisition, and image processing system. Their
    results showed a temperature difference of 0.2–0.3 °C between the normal surface
    and surface with defects. They concluded that thermal imaging is a non-destructive
    potential tool for detecting packaging defects. Conclusions The thermal imaging
    technique plays a major role in temperature mapping of essential process and product
    in many industries and is gaining momentum in agriculture and food industry. Some
    of the applications are already being used while some are still under research
    phase and most of them seem to have a great potential to be used in real time
    situation in the near future. In agriculture, thermal imaging has wide application
    in determining crop water stress, irrigation scheduling, pathogen and disease
    detection in plants, bruise detection and maturity evaluation of fruits, and yield
    estimation of fruits in the orchard. The non-contact, non-destructive, nature
    of thermal imaging along with rapid online usability are the major reasons for
    the fast growing demand for this technique in various fields. The researchers
    are exploring the potential of using thermal imaging in various processes in agriculture
    and food industry due to its numerous advantages. References Baranowski, P., Mazurek,

    Undetected water stress within poplar plantations can result in high economic
    losses. Although remotely sensed spectral measures associated with variations
    in plant water status have been developed for non-Populus species, little is known
    about the suitability of such spectral indices to identify water stress in Populus
    species. Our experiments assessed whether such spectral indices acquired at the
    leaf and canopy level were suitable for detecting water stress in Populus. Relationships
    between four spectral indices and four common measures of plant water status were
    analyzed for both low to moderate, and highly water stressed trees. The proposed
    maximum difference water index (MDWI) exhibited significant relationships (P <
    0.001) with changes in plant water status at both the leaf and canopy levels.
    At the leaf level, statistically significant, though poorer relationships were
    obtained between each of the normalized differential water index (NDWI), the red
    edge inflection point (REIP), the water index (WI), and the plant water status
    measures. At the canopy level, statistically significant relationships were obtained
    between MDWI and the measure of relative water content (RWC), and the equivalent
    water thickness (EWT) (r2 > 0.56, P < 0.001), while WI produced reasonable relationships
    with these water status measures (r2 > 0.42, P < 0.001). On exclusion of the highly
    stressed plants, only MDWI exhibited low sensitivity to RWC (r2 = 0.37, slope
    = 0.64) and leaf water potential at the canopy level (r2 = 0.42, slope = 9.89)
    whereas no other indices exhibited sensitivity to changes in plant water status.
    MDWI, which incorporates short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1300–2500 nm) spectral bands,
    is more suitable to detect more changes in plant water status as compared to NDWI,
    REIP, and WI that incorporate near infrared (NIR, 700–1300 nm) spectral bands.
    These results suggest that such remotely sensed indices are not a viable option
    to detect low and moderate levels of water stress at a scale of a Populus spp.
    plantation, although further research is warranted to assess the broader applicability
    of MDWI and other SWIR wavelength incorporating indices to detect water stress
    in other species. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Maximum

    1. Introduction Plantations of Populus spp. comprise an economically important
    wood crop in the Pacific Northwest of the USA (Stanton et al., 2002). Suitable
    climatic and soil conditions, combined with intensive farming practices, have
    allowed marketable Populus to be grown in 5–6-year rotations on approximately
    200 km2 of agricultural land (Zsuffa et al., 1996, Stanton et al., 2002). The
    principal products of these plantations are fiber for pulp and paper production,
    as an energy feedstock, for lumber, and as a component of engineered wood products.
    Furthermore, it has been proposed that Populus plantations could serve to treat
    wastewater (O’Neill and Gordon, 1994, Schultz et al., 1995) and their high carbon
    sequestration capabilities have been highlighted as exhibiting potential for carbon
    credit trading (Stanton et al., 2002). To grow Populus in the arid conditions
    of the Eastern Cascades, such plantations can sustain significant water stress
    in mid-summer. Irrigation is therefore required (Zsuffa et al., 1996). To ensure
    sufficient water supply, irrigation scheduling is often based on soil water potential
    measurements. However, such measurements are difficult and time-consuming on a
    plantation basis, and as a result such measurements are often acquired at only
    a limited number of sites. As such, water stress resulting from drip line failures,
    small-scale variations in soil moisture availability, and/or microclimatic differences
    have the potential to go undetected unless high water stress is present, which
    results in visible leaf wilting or discoloration. This is of major concern to
    plantation managers because low levels of water stress are already sufficient
    to reduce tree growth (Zahner, 1962, Marron et al., 2002) and increase the susceptibility
    of trees to pathogens and insects (Ragazzi et al., 1999). Hence, undetected water
    stress can potentially cause high economic losses. In a variety of non-Populus
    species, the timely collection of plant water status data over large areas has
    been achieved through remote sensing systems to detect variations in the spectral
    response of plants to changing levels of plant water status (Penuelas et al.,
    1997, Ustin et al., 1998, Pu et al., 2003, Stimson et al., 2005). However, although
    previous findings have indicated that considerable limitations exist when using
    multispectral satellite sensor imagery to detect changes in plant water status
    (Hunt and Rock, 1989, Pierce et al., 1990), the application of higher spatial-
    and spectral-resolution aerial and ground spectrometers may allow the detection
    of such spectral changes (Goetz et al., 1985). The ability of field spectrometers
    and aerial hyperspectral sensors to sample the electromagnetic spectrum in very
    narrow contiguous bands allows the application of spectral indices that make use
    of specific wavelengths that are sensitive to changes in plant water status (Horler
    et al., 1983, Gao, 1996, Penuelas et al., 1993). In many studies, such indices
    using specific wavelengths in the near infrared (NIR, 700–1300 nm, see Fig. 1)
    part of the electromagnetic spectrum have shown reasonable relationships to plant
    water status (Gao, 1996, Penuelas et al., 1997, Serrano et al., 2000, Ceccato
    et al., 2002, Asner et al., 2003, Pu et al., 2003, Imanishi et al., 2004, Stimson
    et al., 2005). However, some studies indicated that these relationships decrease
    with decreasing water stress suggesting that some spectral indices might show
    limited sensitivity to low and moderate levels of water stress (Carter, 1991,
    Pu et al., 2003, Stimson et al., 2005, Penuelas et al., 1997). However, the sensitivity
    of spectral indices to changes in plant water status is often considered species
    dependant (Sinclair et al., 1971, Penuelas et al., 1997), and thus low sensitivity
    of indices to low and moderate levels of water stress shown in some studies for
    non-Populus spp. does not necessarily imply that these indices are not sensitive
    to low and moderate levels of water stress in Populus spp. Download : Download

    Arrows point to water absorption bands. Several studies have also highlighted
    that the use of wavelengths in the NIR are less sensitive to changes in plant
    water status than wavelengths in the short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1300–2500 nm,
    see Fig. 1) range of the electromagnetic spectrum (Tucker, 1980, Carter, 1991,
    Danson et al., 1992, Ceccato et al., 2002). Furthermore, the selection of the
    specific field-based measure of plant water status for comparison with the specific
    spectral index has been previously demonstrated to affect the strength of the
    relationships between the measure of water status and the spectral indices (Penuelas
    et al., 1993, Stimson et al., 2005). In this study, we examined the suitability
    of both existing and novel spectral indices to help poplar plantation managers
    detect water stress. 2. Background 2.1. Measures of plant water status Various
    methods have been used to express plant water status in a physiological relevant
    way (Slavik, 1974, Turner, 1981). These methods vary in their practical use as
    well as in the physiological processes measured. Therefore, these differences
    may be affected by different sources of variability, which may in turn affect
    the strength of the relationship to spectral indices (Penuelas et al., 1993, Stimson
    et al., 2005). We used four different measures of plant water status to assess
    the relationship between a particular measure of plant water status and spectral
    index-based approaches. 2.1.1. Relative water content Relative water content (RWC)
    has been widely used in the remote sensing literature to determine plant water
    status (Hunt and Rock, 1989, Penuelas et al., 1993, Serrano et al., 2000, Pu et
    al., 2003). It provides information about the water content within the leaf by
    measuring the amount of water in the leaf tissue relative to full saturation.
    It is obtained by the following equation: (1) where FW is the fresh weight of
    the leaf obtained directly after it is removed from the plant, TW the turgid weight
    of the leaf after it is rehydrated to full turgidity, and DW is the dry weight
    measured after all water within the leaf tissue has been removed by drying. A
    limitation of RWC is that it does not provide information about soil water status
    (Kozlowski et al., 1991). Furthermore, the accuracy of RWC measurements is reduced
    when the full saturation weight of leaves cannot be determined (Bradford and Hsiao,
    1982). This uncertainty makes RWC a relatively insensitive index of plant water
    status. In some cases, low levels of water stress were not detectable with measurements
    of RWC (Hsiao, 1970). 2.1.2. Equivalent water thickness The equivalent water thickness
    (EWT) measures the hypothetical thickness of a single layer of water that would
    cover the surface of a leaf if water contained in the leaf was uniformly distributed
    over the entire leaf (Danson et al., 1992). The EWT can be derived from process-based
    models (Roberts et al., 1997, Dennison et al., 2003) as well as from empirical
    calculations (Maki et al., 2004). Empirically, EWT can be derived as follows:
    (2) where FW is the fresh weight, DW the dry weight, and A is the leaf area. Although
    significant correlations between EWT and spectral indices have been shown (Maki
    et al., 2004) suggesting its suitability as an indicator of plant water content
    (Dennison et al., 2003), it does not directly provide information about water
    stress (Champagne et al., 2003). 2.1.3. Leaf water potential Differences in water
    potential in the soil, plant, and atmosphere drive water movement through plants
    (Kozlowski et al., 1991). Thus, it is not surprising that the leaf water potential
    (ψ) is most commonly used to characterize plant water status (Turner, 1981). In
    contrast to RWC and EWT, leaf water potential provides information about the water
    status of the plant and the soil as an integrated system (Kozlowski et al., 1991).
    To measure leaf water potential, the pressure chamber technique developed by Scholander
    et al. (1964) is frequently utilized (Koide et al., 1989). By placing a leaf in
    a pressure chamber with the cut end of the petiole protruding through a tightly
    closed seal, the atmospheric pressure in the chamber is increased until sap is
    just visible on the cut end. At this point, the negative of the atmospheric pressure
    is equivalent to the hydrostatic pressure of the plant and thus equivalent to
    the leaf water potential. The point at which sap is just visible, however, is
    not always easy to determine which can potentially cause erroneous measurements
    (Koide et al., 1989, Ritchie and Hinckley, 1975). 2.1.4. Soil water potential
    Availability of soil water has a major effect on water status of plants (Campbell
    and Campbell, 1982). If sufficient soil water is available, plants are generally
    able to replace water loss overnight keeping the plant water status fairly constant.
    However, if the soil is continuously drying, plants are not able to fully replace
    the water loss resulting in decreasing plant water status. The energy status of
    soil water described by the soil water potential is commonly used to obtain information
    about the availability of soil water. It can be determined by a variety of different
    methods, like the gravimetric method or devices like tensiometers or neutron probes.
    A disadvantage associated with measurement of soil water potential is that representative
    soil samples must be taken which often introduces considerable error due to small-scale
    variations in soil water and the disruption of natural soil structure (Israelsen
    and Hansen, 1962). 2.2. General response of plant spectra to changes in plant
    water status The spectral response of leaves depends on their surface and internal
    chemical and structural properties (Sinclair et al., 1971, Horler et al., 1983).
    Changes in plant water status influence both chemical and structural properties
    of leaves and thus their spectral response (Sinclair et al., 1971, Hsiao, 1973,
    Munné-Bosch et al., 2001). Numerous studies have used these chemical and structural
    changes to evaluate relationships between plant water status and plant spectra
    (Penuelas et al., 1993, Penuelas et al., 1997, Pu et al., 2003, Dennison et al.,
    2005). Unfortunately, the spectral properties of leaves are not only influenced
    by plant water status but may also by factors such as leaf age (Gausmann et al.,
    1970), sun versus shade leaf anatomy (Gates et al., 1965), leaf thickness (Ourcival
    et al., 1999), differences in leaf surface properties (Grant et al., 1993), soil
    background, and non-water stress related variations in leaf angle, canopy structure
    (Asner, 1998) and leaf area (Sims and Gamon, 2003). These factors can introduce
    variation that reduces the correlation between common field measures of plant
    water status and the spectral response of leaves. To minimize the effect of this
    variability and to optimize the sensitivity of the spectral response of plants
    to changes in plant water status, different spectral indices have been proposed.
    Our study examined the commonly used normalized differential water index (NDWI),
    the water index (WI), and the red edge inflection point (REIP) discussed below.
    2.3. Spectral indices Reasonable relationships have been shown between certain
    spectral indices and plant water status (Gao, 1996, Penuelas et al., 1997, Serrano
    et al., 2000, Ceccato et al., 2002, Asner et al., 2003, Pu et al., 2003, Imanishi
    et al., 2004, Stimson et al., 2005). This has prompted their use for detecting
    water stress causing diseases, like ‘Sudden Oak Death’ (Pu et al., 2003), to assess
    live fuel moisture to determine fire danger (Dennison et al., 2003, Dennison et
    al., 2005, Ustin et al., 1998, Chuvieco et al., 2002, Maki et al., 2004) or to
    determine drought conditions of crops (Strachan et al., 2002) and forests (Asner,
    2003). To detect changes in plant water status, spectral indices, like the WI
    or the NDWI, utilize simple ratios between the reflectance of a wavelength located
    within an range of the electromagnetic spectrum strongly absorption by water,
    described as water absorption bands, and another wavelength located outside the
    water absorption band typically used as a control (Sims and Gamon, 2003) (Fig.
    1). With decreasing plant water status, the decrease in water absorption is more
    pronounced for wavelengths inside the absorption band resulting in a changing
    ratio between the reflectance values of these two wavelengths (Fig. 2). Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Ratio between wavelengths with low water absorption
    and wavelength with high water absorption for well watered and water stressed
    P. deltoids × P. nigra hybrid. Other indices, like the red edge inflection point
    (REIP) and the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), utilize wavelengths,
    which are influenced by changes in the leaf pigment content and/or changes in
    leaf cellular structure (Horler et al., 1983). Thus, unlike the NDWI and the WI,
    which measure spectral variances directly caused by changes in plant water status,
    these indices infer spectral variances caused by changes in leaf physiological
    properties that might be indirectly caused by changes in plant water status. 2.3.1.
    Normalized differential water index (NDWI) The normalized differential water index
    (NDWI) uses two wavelengths in the NIR located at 860 and 1241 nm and has been
    shown to be sensitive to leaf water content (Gao, 1996). This index is derived
    from (R860 − R1241)/(R860 + R1241), where R stands for the reflectance at 860
    and 1241 nm, respectively. For Pinus edilus and other species in chaparral communities,
    NDWI was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.93 and 0.74) with water content (Stimson
    et al., 2005, Serrano et al., 2000). 2.3.2. Water index (WI) The water index (WI)
    is the ratio between reflectance measured at 900 nm and the reflectance measured
    at 970 nm. Significant correlations between WI and plant water status have been
    shown for different Mediterranean tree and shrub species (Penuelas et al., 1997).
    2.3.3. Red edge inflection point (REIP) The “red edge” inflection point (REIP),
    defined as the maximum slope of the prominent increase in reflectance between
    the red and the NIR spectral range for green vegetation (Horler et al., 1983),
    may shift when plants exhibit stress. This suggests that REIP can potentially
    be utilized to detect water stress (Jayaraman and Srivastava, 2002). Furthermore,
    it may offer a major advantage over non-derivative-based indices, like the NDWI
    and WI, because it has been shown that derivative spectra used to calculate the
    red edge inflection point are less sensitive to background noise, e.g., caused
    by different soil types (Demetriades-Shah et al., 1990, Danson et al., 1992, Rollin
    and Milton, 1998). 2.3.4. Limitations of existing spectral water status indices
    Ideally, an index for remote detection of water stress in Populus spp. should
    be sensitive enough to detect low and moderate levels of water stress. However,
    several studies suggest that water stress has to be well developed in order to
    be detectable (Carter, 1991, Cohen, 1991, Pu et al., 2003, Penuelas et al., 1993,
    Penuelas et al., 1997, Asner et al., 2003, Stimson et al., 2005). In the Mediterranean
    shrub species Arbutus unedo, the correlation between RWC and the WI decreased
    from r = 0.75 to 0.37 when plants were exposed to low water stress instead of
    full dryness (Penuelas et al., 1997). The exclusion of needles from Pinus edulis
    trees undergoing water stress induced mortality from the sample decreased the
    relationship between the REIP and leaf water potential from r2 = 0.51 to 0.34
    (Stimson et al., 2005). Although these studies suggest that spectral indices are
    not suitable for detection of low and moderate levels of water stress, such responses
    may be species specific (Penuelas et al., 1993). The leaf internal structure of
    some species is more sensitive to changes in plant water status than others, thereby
    influencing the sensitivity of spectral indices to changes in plant water status.
    2.4. Potential spectral water status indices The use of wavelengths in the short-wave
    infrared (SWIR, 1300–2500 nm) could improve the sensitivity of spectral indices
    (Tucker, 1980, Carter, 1991, Danson et al., 1992, Ceccato et al., 2002). Most
    of the current indices such as NDWI and WI, use wavelengths located in the near
    infrared (NIR, 700–1300 nm). Although different studies were able to show significant
    relationships of these indices to plant water status (Penuelas et al., 1997, Serrano
    et al., 2000, Asner et al., 2003, Pu et al., 2003), others suggest that wavelengths
    used by these indices are relatively insensitive to changes in plant water status
    (Tucker, 1980, Carter, 1991, Danson et al., 1992, Ceccato et al., 2002). Selected
    wavelengths in the NIR can be insensitive to changes in plant water status as
    compared to wavelengths located in the SWIR (Tucker, 1980). Wavebands in the SWIR
    located between 1500 and 1750 nm have been suggested to be useful for monitoring
    plant water status (Tucker, 1980, Ceccato et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2005), life
    fuel moisture (Chuvieco et al., 2002) as well as for monitoring other plant biochemical
    variables, like lignin and nitrogen (Serrano et al., 2000) because of the availability
    of solar irradiance and atmospheric transmission essential for remote sensing
    (Tucker, 1980, Ceccato et al., 2002). Simulations with the radiative transfer
    model PROSPECT, a model for leaf reflectance and varying biophysical parameters
    (Jacquemound and Baret, 1990), suggest that wavelengths located in the 1300–2500
    nm range are more sensitive to changes in leaf water content whereas they are
    relatively insensitive to factors like leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter
    content (Ceccato et al., 2002). Furthermore, the NIR (700–1300 nm) wavebands showed
    no or very low sensitivity to detect leaf water content whereas they showed a
    high sensitivity to other factors such as leaf structural characteristics. 2.5.
    Objectives Our primary objectives were to: (1) determine, for selected spectral
    indices, if statistically significant relationships exist between the index and
    four different measures of plant water status at both the leaf and canopy level
    and (2) test the sensitivity of the spectral index measures to low and moderate
    levels of water stress. 3. Methods 3.1. Plant material and growth conditions Our
    study used 180 cuttings of the clone, Populus deltoides × Populus nigra (OP-367),
    obtained from the Boise Fiber Farm “Ice Harbor” located near Wallula, Washington,
    USA. Each cutting was placed in individual 3.79-L pots. The soil medium consisted
    of a commercially available potting mix (70% sphagnum peat moss, 20% regional
    fillers), 10% perlite, a wetting agent, and slow release plant nutrients 0.07%
    nitrogen (N), 0.01% phosphate (P2O5), soluble potash (K2O). During an initial
    growing period of 8 weeks, each sapling was watered daily to field capacity. After
    the initial growing period, 90 saplings were randomly selected for a non-water
    treatment and the remaining 90 saplings served as the control treatment. During
    the 12-day duration of the experiment, water was withheld from the non-water treatment,
    whereas each plant of the control group was provided with 0.25 L per day. Throughout
    the study, pot location was randomized on a regular basis to minimize the effect
    of microclimatic differences in the glasshouse on plant development. Throughout
    the experiment, 10 saplings of each treatment were randomly selected every 36
    h for spectral measurement and for measurement of plant water status. Upon completion
    of the measurements, measured saplings were removed from the study population.
    3.2. Spectral measurements Spectral measurements were taken with an ASD FieldSpec®
    Pro spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO) consisting of
    two sensors. The first sensor measures reflected light in wavelengths between
    350 and 1050 nm by sampling the reflected light every 1.4 nm. The second sensor
    measures reflected light in wavelengths between 1000 and 2500 nm by sampling the
    reflected light every 2 nm. Each spectral measurement was preceded by a dark current
    measurement and a white reference measurement using a white reference panel. Thus,
    reflectance values could be directly measured and used to compare measurements
    through time with each other. 3.2.1. Acquisition of spectral measures at the leaf
    level To obtain spectra at the leaf level, four spectra were taken at the 10–13th
    leaf counted from the apical meristem (see Fig. 3) and the average of the four
    spectral measurements was taken. To reduce errors associated with illumination
    effects a fiber optic contact probe was used. By pressing the contact probe on
    the leaf surface, the leaf surface was only illuminated by a constant light source
    inside the contact probe (Contact Probe, Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder,
    CO). To minimize differences in background reflectance that could be caused by
    electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the leaf, a spectrally black surface
    was put on the underside of the leaf. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Spectral measurement at the leaf level by using a cool contact probe designed
    for leaf spectral measurements. 3.2.2. Acquisition of spectral measures at the
    canopy level For canopy level measurements, the fiber optic probe of the spectroradiometer
    with a 25° field of view was mounted 0.70 m above the highest point of the sapling
    canopy (see. Fig. 4). The sapling was illuminated by a constant, full spectrum
    light source (1000 W) from a 30° angle, whereas the distance between the light
    source and highest point of the canopy was 0.30 m. To ensure a constant background
    within the field of view, spectrally flat black foam was placed around the base
    of each tree. For each sapling canopy, four spectra were measured by turning the
    plant by 90° between each measurement and averaged. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Spectral measurements at the canopy level. 3.2.3. Extraction of
    spectral indices To calculate the NDWI and WI, formulae described above were used.
    For REIP, we calculated the first derivative of the spectrum and determined the
    wavelength associated with the maximum slope located within the prominent increase
    in reflectance between the red and the near infrared wavelength ranges. Before
    extracting the REIP from canopy spectra, potential effects of atmospheric and
    background noise on the REIP were minimize by applying a moving average approach
    (Savitzky and Golay, 1964). 3.2.4. Proposed maximum difference water index (MDWI)
    Based on the relative depth index (RDI) (Rollin and Milton, 1998), which uses
    the reflectance minimum between 1120 and 1250 nm,the maximum difference water
    index (MDWI) was determined by using the following equation: (3) where max1500–1750
    is the maximum and min1500–1750 is the minimum reflectance located at the atmospheric
    window between 1500 and 1750 nm. 3.2.5. Sensitivity of spectral indices To assess
    the sensitivity of each index for detecting low and moderate levels of water stress,
    we evaluated the relationship of spectral indices to plant water status both with
    and without highly stressed trees in the analysis. In this case, water stress
    was assessed visually. Trees were considered to experience low or moderate water
    stress if no or minimal signs of wilting were apparent. Trees were considered
    highly stressed if they showed signs of severe wilting, including desiccation,
    abscission, discoloration, and rolling of leaves. 3.3. Plant water status Measurements
    of soil and leaf water potential, relative water content, and equivalent water
    thickness were coordinated with the spectral measurements. Soil water potential
    was measured with a WP4 Dewpoint Potential Meter (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman,
    Washington, USA). The soil sample required by the WP4 was obtained from the base
    of a 0.07-m soil core. Leaf water potential was measured on the 10th leaf (counted
    from the apical meristem) with a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Corvallis,
    Oregon, USA). For RWC, the fresh weight, turgid weight, and dry weight were determined
    for 7 cm2 leaf disks from the 11th and the 12th leave. Turgid weight was determined
    after each leaf disk was placed in a deionized water bath for 12 h. The final
    weight reading was done after the leaf sample was placed into a drying oven at
    70 °C for 24 h to obtain the dry weight. All three weight measurements were then
    used to calculate the RWC by using Eq. (1) (Barrs and Weatherley, 1962, Slavik,
    1974). The final RWC for each plant was calculated by taking the average of the
    two RWC measurements determined per sapling. The fresh weight and dry weight measurements
    of the 11th and 12th leaf were further utilized to empirically determine the equivalent
    water thickness (EWT) for each leaf disc by using Eq. (2). The final EWT per plant
    was determined by taking the average EWT of the leaf discs obtained from the 11th
    and 12th leaf. 3.4. Statistical techniques and accuracy/validation Linear least
    squares regression was used to determine the relationship between measures of
    plant water status and spectral indices. To test the sensitivity of spectral indices
    to low and moderate levels of water stress, highly stressed trees were excluded
    from the dataset and a linear least squares regression was determined for measures
    of plant water status and spectral indices of the remaining datasets. Following
    prior remote sensing studies (Smith et al., 2002), the coefficient of determination
    of each spectral index was put into one of five categories describing their sensitivity
    to changes in plant water status: • no sensitivity if r2 < 0.20; • very low sensitivity
    if r2 = 0.20–0.30; • low sensitivity if r2 = 0.30–0.60; • moderate sensitivity
    if r2 = 0.60–0.80; • high sensitivity if r2 > 0.80. Within a category, the index
    with the maximum slope obtained from the regression model was considered to be
    the most sensitive. After linear least square regressions analysis, the validity
    of each model was assessed based on standard model diagnostics. The root mean
    square error, the correlation coefficient (r2), the model equation, and probability
    value (P-value) were determined for each model. Correlations were considered statistically
    significant at a probability level of P < 0.001. 4. Results 4.1. Relationship
    of spectral indices to plant water status 4.1.1. Leaf level A statistically significant
    correlation (r2 > 0.53, P < 0.001) to plant water status could be shown for all
    indices derived from spectra taken at the leaf level (Table 1). However, the correlation
    coefficients between measures of plant water status and spectral indices varied
    considerably amongst indices (r2 = 0.53–0.94). MDWI showed the highest correlation
    coefficient (r2 = 0.94) to all measures of plant water status, followed by the
    WI (r2 = 0.94). Substantially lower correlation coefficients could be observed
    for the REIP (r2 = 0.53). Table 1. Linear regression results between four different

    coefficients of r2 < 0.18 were shown at the leaf level if highly stressed trees
    were excluded from the analysis (Table 1). The highest correlation coefficient
    could be shown between REIP and leaf water potential (r2 = 0.18, slope = 0.04)
    and MDWI and EWT (r2 = 0.18, slope = 0.07). No correlation (r2 = 0.00) was shown
    between NDWI and RWC, EWT, and leaf water potential, between REIP and SWP, and
    between WI and RWC and EWT. At the canopy level, correlation coefficients of r2
    < 0.42 were shown if highly stressed trees were excluded from the analysis (Table
    2). The highest correlation coefficient could be shown between MDWI and leaf water
    potential (r2 = 0.42, slope = 9.89) whereas no correlation (r2 = 0.00, slope =
    7.95) could be shown between NDWI and SWP. The decreasing correlations between
    spectral indices and measures of plant water status indicated by our results was
    less pronounced at the canopy level than it was at the leaf level (see Fig. 5,
    Fig. 6 and Table 1, Table 2). For example, the exclusion of highly stressed trees
    changed the correlation coefficient between RWC and MDWI from r2 = 0.94 to 0.05
    at the leaf level and from r2 = 0.60 to 0.37 at the canopy level. Download : Download

    trees from the analysis, correlation coefficients between measures of plant water
    status and spectral indices were in general higher for indices extracted from
    canopy scale measurements compared to indices extracted from leaf scale measurements
    (see Table 1, Table 2). The highest correlation coefficient between measures of
    plant water status and spectral indices derived from canopy scale measurements
    could be observed between leaf water potential and MDWI (r2 = 0.42, slope = 9.89)
    and RWC and MDWI (r2 = 0.37, slope = 0.635) compared to the highest correlation
    coefficient for spectral indices derived from leaf scale measurements between
    leaf water potential and REIP (r2 = 0.18, slope = 0.065) and EWT and MDWI (r2
    = 0.18, slope = 0.04). 5. Discussion 5.1. Relationship of spectral indices to
    plant water status 5.1.1. Leaf level Although leaf level measurements are not
    practical from a management perspective because it is difficult to acquire timely
    information over larger areas with frequency, they provide insights about changes
    in leaf spectral properties accompanied by changes in plant water status. In our
    study, MDWI, NDWI, and WI extracted from reflectance spectra taken at the leaf
    level showed a statistically significant correlation of r2 > 0.75 to RWC and EWT
    if highly water stressed trees were included (Table 1). This result reinforces
    findings by other studies suggesting that there is an existing relationship between
    plant water status and the spectral response of plants (Penuelas et al., 1993,
    Penuelas et al., 1997, Stimson et al., 2005). The advantage of taking spectra
    at the leaf level is that the relationship between plant water status and spectral
    indices is not affected by background variables or atmospheric noise. Thus, we
    can assume that variations of spectral index are purely caused by leaf properties.
    However, leaf property variations are influenced by more than just plant water
    status and these factors complicate the development of a direct relationship between
    plant water status and spectral indices. Changes in leaf morphology and biochemical
    properties that are independent of plant water status are able to influence photon
    scattering and thus present potential sources of variability (Sinclair et al.,
    1971, Curran, 1989). Differences in leaf biochemical properties, such as lignin,
    cellulose or sugar content independent of plant water status may generate spectral
    variability. Curran (1989) showed that a wide variety of absorption features could
    be related to biochemical properties of leaves. Besides biochemical properties
    of leaves, differences in leaf morphology can strongly influence the reflectance
    properties of leaves and thus can be responsible for some variability (Sinclair
    et al., 1971, Ceccato et al., 2002). Differences in leaf morphology may be caused
    by genetic variations between individuals (Van Volkenburgh and Taylor, 1996).
    However, considering that a single poplar clone was used in this study, variability
    caused by genetic variations can be assumed to be negligible. Differences in leaf
    anatomical properties on the other hand, which can be caused by differences in
    light conditions and the developmental stage of leaves may cause variability (Gates
    et al., 1965, Gausmann et al., 1970, Grant et al., 1993, Ourcival et al., 1999,
    Xie and Xianshi, 2003). During leaf development, anatomical changes take place
    potentially altering the spectral response of leaves (Gausmann et al., 1970, Bauer
    et al., 1983). Thus, although spectral measurements were taken at the same node
    positions, leaf developmental stages were not necessarily the same. Furthermore,
    differences in light conditions could have introduced some variation. In order
    to optimize photosynthesis, leaves acclimate their anatomical properties to varying
    light conditions. Some of these acclimations, including, for example, the thickness
    of the cuticle layer or the palisade and spongy mesophyll cells, are known to
    influence the reflectance properties of leaves and thus could have caused some
    variation in our study (Gates et al., 1965, Grant et al., 1993, van Gardingen,
    1996, Ourcival et al., 1999, Xie and Xianshi, 2003). 5.1.2. Canopy level Measurements
    at the canopy level are of greater interest to land managers because it more closely
    represents what remote sensing instruments would “see” when flown over a poplar
    plantation. Thus, results obtained from canopy scale measurements enable better
    inferences of how a certain spectral index may perform if it is extracted from
    spectra acquired by an airborne sensor. Our study showed that the relationship
    between plant water status and spectral indices decreased by moving from the leaf
    to canopy level if highly stressed trees were included (Table 2). This could be
    because of a variety of broader scale factors, including variations in background,
    leaf display, and leaf area. Variations of background and leaf display, however,
    can be assumed to be negligible in this study. A constant background was ensured
    by placing a spectrally flat black foam around the base of the tree and variations
    in leaf display can be assumed to be fairly small because significant species
    and clonal differences in leaf display were eliminated by the use of a single
    clone. In contrast, differences in leaf area were most likely responsible for
    some of the spectral variations in this study. The influence of leaf area on the
    spectral response of leaves can be considerable (Goward and Huemmerich, 1992,
    Asner, 1998, Roberts et al., 1998). Water absorption features located at around
    1000 and 1200 nm used to calculate WI and NDWI become deeper with increasing leaf
    area (Asner, 1998). The strong influence of changes in leaf area on the spectral
    response is especially pronounced for lower leaf area (Asner and Wessman, 1997,
    Ceccato et al., 2002). This suggests that due to the low leaf area in our study,
    changes of LAI between sampled trees may have had a strong effect on spectral
    indices. However, although relationships between indices and measures of plant
    water status decreased by going from the leaf to the canopy level, the relationship
    between MDWI and RWC (r2 = 0.60) and to EWT (r2 = 0.56) was still reasonably high.
    This suggests that MDWI may allow a better mapping of water stressed poplars.
    From these maps, plantation managers would be able to obtain current information
    about the location of poplars experiencing water stress and thus allow them to
    take appropriate management actions against otherwise undetected trees experiencing
    water stress. 5.2. Sensitivity of spectral indices to light and moderate water
    stress It is important for plantation managers to know how sensitive spectral
    indices are to low and moderate levels of water stress because reduced tree growth
    occurs at low levels of water stress (Bradford and Hsiao, 1982). Hence, earlier
    water stress detection may reduce economic loss. Although our results indicate
    that it is possible to map water stress by using spectral indices, plantation
    managers need to know how sensitive these measures are to low and moderate levels
    of water stress to evaluate their suitability. We examined this by excluding highly
    stressed trees from our analysis and demonstrated that no current index is sufficiently
    sensitive to detect light to moderate water stress in P. deltoids × P. nigra hybrids
    at the leaf level (r2 ≤ 0.18) (see Table 1). This suggests that the analyzed indices
    are not suitable to detect light to moderate water stress in P. deltoides × P.
    nigra hybrids at the leaf level. At the canopy level, low sensitivity of indices
    to changing measures of plant water status was shown between MDWI and leaf water
    potential (r2 = 0.37, slope = 0.64) and RWC (r2 = 0.42, slope = 9.89) (see Table
    2) whereas the REIP, WI, and NDWI showed no sensitivity to measures of plant water
    status (r2 < 0.19). This indicates that MDWI performs considerably better in detecting
    moderate levels of water stress than REIP, WI, and NDWI and thus could allow plantation
    managers to take appropriate management actions in an earlier stage of water stress
    than by using the REIP, WI, or NDWI. Although the results suggest that MDWI is
    most sensitive to changes in plant water status, the low sensitivity shown for
    MDWI is unlikely to be sufficient to remotely detect low and moderate water stress
    in Populus spp. No or low sensitivity of spectral indices to low and moderate
    water stress suggests that major changes of leaf properties did not occur until
    the plants were highly stressed, and thus were not detectable by spectral measurements.
    In order to spectrally separate non-water deficient from water deficient plants,
    water deficiency has to be well developed (Cohen, 1991). Spectral variation in
    reflectance among leaves at the same plant water status can be higher than the
    spectral changes due to increasing water deficiency (Cohen, 1991, Pu et al., 2003).
    Although statistical significant relationships between the leaf RWC of Quercus
    agrifolia to the depth of water absorption features at 975 and 1200 nm has been
    observed (Pu et al., 2003) if RWC ranged between 0.45% and 57.94%, the correlation
    would have been considerably lower if one would exclude trees with RWC between
    0.45% and 40% from the analysis. These findings are further supported by Hoffer
    and Johannsen (1969) who reported that in order to detect an increase in reflectance
    due to water deficiency in corn leaves between 500 and 2300 nm, RWC has to decrease
    below 66%. Considering that wilting in corn occurs at RWC < 80%, Hoffer and Johannsen
    (1969) concluded that slight to moderate levels of water stress in corn are not
    detectable from remotely sensed data. Besides these findings, Carter (1991) showed
    that by reducing the RWC to 75%, the difference in reflectance between associated
    wavelengths was 5% or less compared to the reflectance of full turgid leaves.
    By reducing the RWC to 50%, the difference in reflectance between associated wavelengths
    increases to 10% or less compared to the reflectance of full turgid leaves. Based
    on these observations, Carter (1991) concludes that RWC must be highly reduced
    to result in spectrally detectable changes. Our research suggests these findings
    also apply to Populus. The insensitivity of indices extracted at the leaf level
    to slight or moderate water stress in P. deltoides × P. nigra hybrids could be
    explained by observations by Sinclair et al. (1971). They observed that the reflectance
    of wavelengths in the NIR increased only slightly for soybeans by decreasing the
    RWC to 75%. At the same time they observed that the leaf internal structure of
    soybean leaves did not change by decreasing the RWC to 75%. However, by reducing
    the RWC of leaves to about 50% RWC, leaf internal structure collapsed resulting
    in a strong increase in reflectance in the near infrared. From this observation,
    Sinclair et al. (1971) concluded that changes in leaf internal structure associated
    with water stress are mainly responsible for spectral changes. However, RWC values
    ranging between 75% and 85% RWC represent the wilting point in most plant species
    (Bradford and Hsiao, 1982). Hence, RWC values of 50% at which strong spectral
    changes in soybeans took place represent high levels of water stress. The same
    seemed to be true for P. deltoides × P. nigra hybrids. There was virtually no
    relationship between RWC and spectral indices between RWC 1 and 0.85 (Fig. 5A),
    which could have been caused by no or very little change of leaf internal structure.
    However, after RWC dropped below around 0.80, obvious spectral changes, most likely
    caused by the onset of leaf internal changes, started to become obvious and could
    be related to changes in plant water status (Fig. 5A). 5.3. Suitability of spectral
    indices to detect changes in plant water status In this study the strongest relationship
    between a spectral index and measures of plant water status was between MDWI and
    RWC at the leaf (r2 = 0.94) and canopy level (r2 = 0.60). MDWI exhibited low sensitivity
    to changes in leaf water potential (r2 = 0.42, slope = 9.89) and RWC (r2 = 0.37,
    slope = 0.64) at the canopy level compared to no sensitivity shown for all other
    indices. The superior relationship and sensitivity of MDWI to plant water status
    compared to the other analyzed indices may be explained by the use of adjustable
    wavelengths. The MDWI, WI, and NDWI all employ ratios between wavelengths, which
    are weakly and strongly absorbed by water. This optimizes the sensitivity of the
    index to changes in plant water status: the lower the impact of water absorption
    on one wavelength and the higher on the other, the greater the change of the ratio
    between these two wavelengths due to changes in plant water status. The selection
    of wavelengths weakly and strongly absorbed by water is therefore critical for
    the sensitivity of the index to changes in plant water status. However, the WI
    utilizes fixed reference wavelengths at 900 and 970 nm, which may not always be
    the greatest and least affected by water absorption within this wavelength region,
    respectively (Pu et al., 2003). The NDWI utilizes the reflectance at 1241 nm located
    at the water absorption band edge and is less affected by water absorption than
    a wavelength located at the center of the water absorption feature. In contrast,
    MDWI extracts the local minimum and maximum reflectance between 1500 and 1750
    nm and therefore always presents the ratio between the wavelengths least and strongest
    affected by water absorption within this wavelength. This may maximize its sensitivity
    to changes in plant water status since the ratio change between these two wavelengths
    always represents the maximum change in ratio between wavelengths located between
    1500 and 1750 nm caused by changes in plant water status. MDWI also uses longer
    wavelengths located in the SWIR, whereas all other studied indices use wavelengths
    in the NIR. Wavelengths within the SWIR penetrate less far into the canopy in
    comparison to NIR wavelengths (Sims and Gamon, 2003) making SWIR wavelengths less
    sensitive to changes in leaf area compared to NIR wavelengths (Ceccato et al.,
    2002). The lower sensitivity of SWIR wavelengths to changes in leaf area may therefore
    result in less variation and thus a stronger relationship between MDWI and measures
    of plant water status. Furthermore, different studies have shown that wavelengths
    in the SWIR are more suitable to detect changes in plant water status than wavelengths
    in NIR (Tucker, 1980, Carter, 1991, Danson et al., 1992, Ceccato et al., 2002).
    Ceccato et al. (2002) showed that wavelengths in the SWIR are more sensitive to
    changes in plant water status and are less susceptible to noise caused by leaf
    internal structure. They also suggested that NIR wavelengths show no or very low
    sensitivity to leaf water content whereas they show a high sensitivity to other
    factors, like leaf internal structure. These findings are in broad agreement with
    results by Carter (1991) and Danson et al. (1992). Carter (1991) indicated that
    wavelengths located between the NIR are not sensitive to changes in the RWC and
    that wavelengths located at around 1450, 1920 and 2500 nm show the highest sensitivity
    to changes in RWC independent of the plant species. Danson et al. (1992) observed
    that leave reflectance at wavelengths located at 1450, 1650, and 2250 nm was correlated
    to specific water density (SWD) at a α = 0.05 significance level whereas there
    was no relationship between leaf reflectance and specific water density at 975
    and 1175 nm. Thus, these findings by other authors showing that SWIR wavelengths
    are more suitable to detect changes in plant water status than NIR wavelengths
    is further corroborated by this study. The study showed further that the observed
    spectral indices were generally stronger correlated to RWC and EWT than to LWP
    and SWP. An explanation for this could be that RWC and EWT both provide information
    solely about water contained within leaves which are directly “seen” by the spectroradiometer.
    In contrast, LWP gives also information about the water content of other plant
    parts, like the stem and root system (Kozlowski et al., 1991), which are not directly
    “seen” by the spectroradiometer. The same is true for soil used to measure SWP,
    which was not visible for the spectroradiometer because it was covered by black
    foam in this study. Thus, considering that the water content of other plant parts
    and the soil can be significantly higher than indicated by the water content of
    leaves (Kozlowski et al., 1991, Bradford and Hsiao, 1982), the spectroradiometer
    would only see the low water content of leaves even though there are different
    amounts of water contained in other plant tissues or the soil. Consequently, although
    LWP or SWP might not indicate any water stress, spectral indices might indicate
    water stress because leaf water content is low weakening the correlation between
    LWP and SWP to spectral indices. 5.4. Potential limitations of study results 5.4.1.
    Applicability of study results for larger plants and field grown P. deltoides
    × P. nigra hybrids The presented results are based on measurements solely conducted
    on saplings and thus the results might be different if the same study would have
    been conduced on larger trees. Saplings differ from larger trees in their leaf
    area and canopy architecture which both strongly influence canopy reflectance
    properties (Asner, 1998, Ceccato et al., 2002, Sims and Gamon, 2003). These differences
    in canopy reflectance properties might affect the relationship and sensitivity
    of spectral indices to measures of plant water status. To properly evaluate the
    effect of plant size on the relationship and sensitivity of spectral indices to
    plant water status further study is needed. The results of this study suggest
    that spectral indices are not suitable to detect low to moderate levels of water
    stress in greenhouse grown P. deltoides × P. nigra hybrids. This may not be true
    for trees cultivated under field conditions. The drying process in the field is
    likely to be slower than it was in the greenhouse giving the trees in the field
    the opportunity to adjust to lower water availability (Ludlow et al., 1985). These
    adjustments to drought could be spectrally detectable. One of the adjustments
    found in Populus spp. that might be detectable is the lowering of the osmotic
    potential. By lowering their osmotic potential, biochemical properties influencing
    the spectral response of leaves might change and help to detect spectral changes
    associated with water stress. For P. deltoides × P. nigra hybrids it has been
    shown that the osmotic adjustment causes an increase in the concentration of soluble
    sugars (Tschaplinski and Blake, 1985). This increase in concentration of sugars
    might cause spectral changes (Curran, 1989) that could help to detect light and
    moderate levels of water stress. Furthermore, low water stress over a longer period
    of time is sufficient to notably decrease leaf area (Bradford and Hsiao, 1982)
    that might be spectrally detectable (Asner, 1998). Roden et al. (1990) showed
    for Populus trichocarpa and P. deltoides that non-irrigated poplars had a smaller
    leaf area than irrigated poplars. Thus, less radiation is intercepted by trees
    exposed to water stress than by non-water stressed trees causing spectral differences
    that might be useful for mapping water stress. However, reduction in leaf area
    might not only be caused by water stress but also by other stress factors such
    as nutrient deficiency and may be more suitable as a general indicator of stress.
    5.4.2. Determination of high water stress levels We separated high levels of water
    stress from low and moderate levels solely by visual signs. Although visual signs
    have been acknowledged as an indirect technique to determine water status of plants
    (Turner, 1981, Siemens and Zwiazek, 2003), the onset of wilting is species dependant
    and physiological changes may occur before visual signs become apparent (Hsiao,
    1973). Thus, their usefulness as an estimator of water stress is limited and may
    not be sensitive to low and moderate levels of water stress. However, our ability
    to visually separate highly stressed from low and moderate stressed trees is shown
    by leaf water potential and RWC values measured for trees that were excluded from
    the study. All trees that were excluded from the analysis had leaf water potential
    values below −1.6 MPa and RWC values below 0.85 except one sample with a RWC 0.89.
    Considering that values below leaf water potential of −1.5 MPa and RWC of 0.85
    are generally assumed to indicate high levels of water stress, trees that were
    exposed to a high level of water stress based on their visual signs were also
    highly stressed based on published measures of plant water status (Hsiao, 1973,
    Bradford and Hsiao, 1982, Blake et al., 1996). 5.4.3. Applicability of study results
    on other Populus genotypes and hybrids The results of this study are limited to
    P. deltoides × P. nigra hybrids and may not be applicable to other Populus genotypes
    and hybrids due to biophysical differences between genotypes and hybrids that
    could cause different spectral responses to changes in plant water status (Sinclair
    et al., 1971, Van Volkenburgh and Taylor, 1996, Asner, 1998). Distinct anatomical
    differences between genotypes within Populus spp. can for example be shown between
    P. trichocarpa and P. deltoides. P. trichocarpa leaves contain large intercellular
    air spaces whereas they are missing in P. deltoides leaves. Futhermore, differences
    in the thickness of cuticle waxes and leaf display can exist between genotypes
    and hybrids within the Populus spp. (Ceulemans and Isebrands, 1996, Cameron et
    al., 2002). 6. Conclusions The analysis of plant spectra taken at the leaf and
    canopy level to evaluate their suitability to detect water stress in P. deltoides
    × P. nigra hybrids provided some new insights about the potential use of remotely
    sensed spectral information to provide plantation managers with information or
    maps about plant water status in Populus spp. The new spectral index MDWI showed
    a consistently stronger relationship and sensitivity to changes in plant water
    status at both leaf and canopy levels than NDWI, WI, and REIP. Furthermore, on
    exclusion of highly stressed plants from the regression analysis, MDWI was the
    only index that exhibited low sensitivity to low and moderate levels of water
    stress compared to no sensitivity shown for all other indices. This confirmed
    that SWIR wavelengths used by MDWI in contrast to NIR wavelengths used by NDWI,
    WI, and REIP are more sensitive to changes in plant water status. Consequently,
    MDWI and other SWIR incorporating indices could considerably improve the ability
    to detect water stress at earlier stages in Populus spp. from multi- and hyperspectral
    remote sensing data compared to NIR-based indices. The higher sensitivity of MDWI
    may allow earlier detection of water stress assisting plantation managers in their
    decision-making. However, although MDWI showed a higher sensitivity to plant water
    status than the other indices, the strength of the relationship between plant
    water status and spectral indices decreased considerably if highly stressed trees
    were excluded from the analysis revealing no or low sensitivity of spectral indices
    to low and moderate levels of water stress. These results suggest that current
    spectral indices are not suitable to remotely detect low and moderate water stress
    in Populus spp., but that further research is warranted to assess the broader
    applicability of MDWI and other SWIR incorporating indices to detect water stress
    in other species. Biophysical differences between greenhouse and field grown P.
    deltoides × P. nigra hybrids and between genotypes within the Populus spp. may
    influence the sensitivity of the spectral response to changes in plant water status.
    Therefore, further research is necessary to evaluate the use of spectral indices
    to detect water stress in other Populus spp. and in natural settings to further
    understand their suitability to detect water stress in Populus spp. Acknowledgements

  title: Suitability of existing and novel spectral indices to remotely detect water
    stress in Populus spp.
  verbatim_quote1: Several studies have highlighted that the use of wavelengths in
    the SWIR located between 1500 and 1750 nm could improve the sensitivity of spectral
    indices (Tucker, 1980, Carter, 1991, Danson et al., 1992, Ceccato et al., 2002,
    Chen et al., 2005), life fuel moisture (Chuvieco et al., 2002) as well as for
    monitoring other plant biochemical variables, like lignin and nitrogen (Serrano
    et al., 2000) because of the availability of solar irradiance and atmospheric
    transmission essential for remote sensing (Tucker, 1980, Ceccato et al., 2002).
    Simulations with the radiative transfer model PROSPECT, a model for leaf reflectance
    and varying biophysical parameters (Jacquemound and Baret, 1990), suggest that
    wavelengths located in the 1300–2500 nm range are more sensitive to changes in
    leaf water content whereas they are relatively insensitive to factors like leaf
    internal structure and leaf dry matter content (Ceccato et al., 2002). Furthermore,
    the NIR (700–1300 nm) wavebands showed no or very low sensitivity to detect leaf
    water content whereas they showed a high sensitivity to other factors such as
    leaf structural characteristics.
  verbatim_quote2: 'Our primary objectives were to: (1) determine, for selected spectral
    indices, if statistically significant relationships exist between the index and
    four different measures of plant water status at both the leaf and canopy level
    and (2) test the sensitivity of the spectral index measures to low and moderate
    levels of water stress.'

    \ \nIn thermal remote sensing the invisible radiation patterns of objects are\
    \ converted into visible \nimages and these images are called thermograms or thermal\
    \ images. Thermal images can be ac- \nquired using portable, hand-held or thermal\
    \ sensors that are coupled with optical systems mounted \non an airplane or satellite.\
    \ This technology is a non-invasive, non-contact and non-destructive \ntechnique\
    \ used to determine thermal properties and features of any object of interest\
    \ and there-\nfore it can be used in many fields, where heat is generated or lost\
    \ in space and time. Potential use \nof thermal remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ includes nursery and greenhouse monitoring, irrigation \nscheduling, plants\
    \ disease detection, estimating fruit yield, evaluating maturity of fruits and\
    \ \nbruise detection in fruits and vegetables. This paper reviews the application\
    \ of thermal imaging in \nagriculture and its potential use in various agricultural\
    \ practices. \n \nKeywords \nInfrared Radiation, Infrared Thermography, Thermal\
    \ Imaging, Crop, Agriculture \n \n \n1. Introduction \nThermal remote sensing\
    \ is the branch of remote sensing that deals with the acquisition, processing\
    \ and interpre-\ntation of data acquired primarily in the thermal infrared (TIR)\
    \ region of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum [1]. \nThermal remote sensing differs\
    \ from optical remote sensing by measuring emitted radiations from the surface\
    \ of \nthe target object, whereas optical remote sensing measures reflected radiations\
    \ of the target object under consid-\neration [2]. \n \n*Corresponding author.\
    \ \nR. Ishimwe et al. \n \n \n129 \nThermal wavelength region in terrestrial remote\
    \ sensing ranges from 3 to 35 µm but interpretation of the data \nin 3 - 5 µm\
    \ is complicated due to overlap with solar reflection in day imagery and 17 -\
    \ 25 µm regions are still \nnot well investigated. As a consequence 8 - 14 µm\
    \ regions have been of greatest interest for thermal remote \nsensing [1] since\
    \ this is where the atmosphere is fairly transparent and the signal is only lightly\
    \ attenuated by \natmospheric absorption [3]. \nThermal remote sensing exploits\
    \ the fact that everything above absolute zero (0 K or −273.15˚C or −459˚F) \n\
    emits radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum [1] hence\
    \ approximately 80% of the energy \nthermal sensors received in the thermal wavelength\
    \ region is emitted by land surface, making surface tempera-\nture as the easiest\
    \ variable to extract from the thermal infrared signal [4]. Thermal infrared has\
    \ grown into an \nimportant technology that is applied directly by users on the\
    \ ground using infrared instruments that are portable \nand even hand-held or\
    \ by using thermal sensors coupled with optical systems [5]. Therefore, thermal\
    \ imaging \ndata may be used directly or indirectly for many applications such\
    \ as civil engineering, industrial maintenance, \naerospace, medicine, pharmacy\
    \ and veterinary. The application of thermal imaging is gaining popularity in\
    \ \nagriculture in recent years [6] due to the reductions in cost of the equipment\
    \ and simple operational procedure \nthat have created opportunities for its application\
    \ in several fields of agricultural and food industries [7] and it is \npresently\
    \ refined for integration into precision farming [8]. \nThermal properties of\
    \ plant leaves are affected by a complex heterogeneous internal structure that\
    \ contains a \ncertain amount of water per unit area. For that reason, it is possible\
    \ to have research on individual plant with \nthermal remote sensing because of\
    \ the versatility, accuracy and high resolution of the infrared thermography [9].\
    \ \nNevertheless, accurate thermal measurements depend on environmental conditions,\
    \ which influence the thermal \nproperties of the visualized crop. Therefore,\
    \ calibration of images according to weather conditions is necessary \nfor comparison\
    \ between image data obtained during different measuring periods and growth seasons\
    \ [10]. Ther- \nmal remote sensing technology can be used in all agricultural\
    \ materials and processes, where heat is generated \nor lost in space and time\
    \ [11]. Potential use of thermography in agriculture includes nursery monitoring,\
    \ irriga-\ntion scheduling, soil salinity detection, disease and pathogen detection,\
    \ yield estimation, maturity evaluation and \nbruise detection. \nThe purpose\
    \ of this paper is to review the different thermal sensors that can be used in\
    \ agriculture as well as \nsummarize various studies conducted on the potential\
    \ application of thermal imaging in agriculture. \n2. Thermal Sensors \nAn infrared\
    \ thermal imaging system comprises of a thermal camera equipped with infrared\
    \ detectors, a signal \nprocessing unit and an image acquisition system. Thermal\
    \ imaging systems are evaluated on their thermal sensi-\ntivity, scan speed, image\
    \ resolution, and intensity resolution [6]. Table 1 describes the specifications\
    \ and pri-\nmary purpose of operational thermal sensors (still operating) that\
    \ can be used in various studies that will be dis-\ncussed in this paper. \n2.1.\
    \ Spectral Reflectance Properties of Vegetation Parameters \nThe traditional methods\
    \ of measuring vegetation parameters are reliable; however they are labor intensive,\
    \ time \nconsuming and only practical for areas of limited size [12] [13]. More\
    \ recently remote sensing provides more \naccurate data for vegetation parameters\
    \ characterization than traditional techniques because it provides conti-\nnuous\
    \ spatial coverage over a large area at repetitive intervals. Vegetation spectral\
    \ reflectance characteristics \ndepend on leaves properties (leaf canopy orientation\
    \ and structure) but the amount of energy reflected for a par-\nticular wavelength\
    \ depends on leaf pigmentation, thickness, cells composition(cells structure),\
    \ and on the amount \nof water in the leaf tissue [14].  \nGreen plant leaves\
    \ typically display very low reflectance and transmittance in visible regions\
    \ of the spectrum \n(0.4 to 0.7 µm) due to strong absorbance by photosynthetic\
    \ and accessory plant pigments since controlling fac-\ntors for this region are\
    \ leaves pigments (Chlorophyll and anthocyanins) [15] [16]. By contracts in near\
    \ infrared \nregion (0.7 - 1.1 µm) reflectance increases strongly since there\
    \ is considerable scattering at mesophyll cell wall \ninterfaces and there is\
    \ minimal absorbance by pigments, the controlling factor of this part is leaf\
    \ structure. This \nsharp difference of vegetation spectral reflectance properties\
    \ between the visible and near infrared wavelengths \nhelps the majority of remote\
    \ sensing approaches for monitoring and managing crop vegetation [17]. \nSpectral\
    \ properties of plant in the middle or shortwave-infrared (SWIR: 1.1 - 2.5 µm)\

    \ Many remote sensing studies ([18]-[23]) have made use of \nthe visible to short-wave\
    \ infrared (VIS-SWIR; 0.4 - 2.5 μm) spectral properties of plants, to study the\
    \ spatial and \ntemporal variations in vegetation patterns, however data from\
    \ the VIS, NIR and SWIR are not sufficient to ex-\nplain the structure and chemical\
    \ characteristics of vegetation [13] as fundamental absorption features related\
    \ to \nvarious compounds and leaf structure of a crop vegetation occur in thermal\
    \ infrared domains (TIR: 6.0 - 14.0 \nµm) [24]-[26]. Despite primary absorption\
    \ features, strong and wide atmospheric windows in the MIR and TIR, \nlittle is\
    \ known about the optical properties of the vegetation in these spectral domains\
    \ [26] due to a number of \nchallenges such as lack of equipment and laboratories\
    \ that enable measurements of the TIR reflectance or emis-\nsivity of plants (i.e.\
    \ TIR spectroradiometers), low signal to noise ratios (SNR), and the subtle and\
    \ complex na-\nture of the spectral features of vegetation [13], However some\
    \ authors, in their work on other aspects, have \nbrought to light the potential\
    \ of TIR measurement for characterizing vegetation parameters where they recognize\
    \ \nthat organic compounds and absorption features of plant leaves in TIR are\
    \ related to the fundamental molecular \nvibrations of various compounds present\
    \ in plant leaves [24]. Thus the principal cause of spectral features in \nTIR\
    \ region is leaf epidermal materials (i.e. cell wall and cuticular membrane) [27]-[29]\
    \ and [24] and leaf water \ncontent [25] and [26]. \n2.2. Nursery Monitoring \n\
    A nursery is a place where plants are propagated and grown to usable size; plants\
    \ can be grown in open fields, \non container fields and in tunnels or greenhouses.\
    \ Early detection of seed quality and seed monitoring would \nbenefit from a tool\
    \ that identifies individual viable and nonviable seeds before use [30] and it\
    \ facilitates to cor-\nrect changes on cultural practices before stress is well\
    \ established [31]. Periodic inventories, visual inspection \nand conventional\
    \ seed viability testing methods are commonly used to monitor seeds viability\
    \ but all of those \nR. Ishimwe et al. \n \n \n132 \nmethod are destructive, time-consuming,\
    \ and labor-intensive [32]. \nPresently researchers and nursery managers have\
    \ become more aware that physiological attributes of seeds \nare not identifiable\
    \ visually [33] hence thermal infrared imaging techniques were proposed as a possible\
    \ alterna-\ntive to traditional methods of seed viability evaluation. \nThermal\
    \ profile of seeds can be used to detect subtle changes in temperature, these\
    \ changes vary with viabili-\nty [30], and this enables the classification and\
    \ separation of viable seeds from non‐viable ones [34]. According \nto [11] and\
    \ [35] significant positive correlations were found between seedling temperature\
    \ and degree of damage \nwhere the coolest seedling had higher survival rate than\
    \ the warmest seedling therefore thermal signal decay \ncharacteristics can depend\
    \ on the seed aging conditions or seed viability, which are significantly associated\
    \ with \nchanges in the seed membrane permeability [32] thus IR thermography can\
    \ be applied to detect seed and seedl-\nings viability, physical damage, physiological\
    \ disorders and evaluation of the growth process of seeds, seedlings \nand plants\
    \ inside the nurseries and greenhouses \n2.3. Irrigation Scheduling \nIrrigation\
    \ is essential for agriculture production as in-season rainfall is inadequate\
    \ to meet crop water demand \nfor this reason poor irrigation timing and insufficient\
    \ applications of water are ubiquitous factors limiting pro-\nduction in many\
    \ agricultural regions [16]. Various studies have shown that the thermal infrared\
    \ (TIR) part of the \nspectrum is more sensitive to determine water stress than\
    \ other reflectance in visible, NIR, or SWIR wave-\nlengths since infrared (IR)\
    \ thermometer measures the thermal temperature of the plant leaves or a crop canopy\
    \ \nand it is known that once plants go into water stress; their stomata begin\
    \ to close and cease to transpire, causing \nthe plant to “heat up” and the canopy\
    \ temperature to rise [36]. In addition thermal imaging appears to have po-\n\
    tential advantages over gas-exchange measurement when screening for stomatal responses\
    \ in phenotyping plant \nstudies [37]. As a consequence considerable researchers\
    \ have been focusing on the use of thermal imaging or IR \nthermometers to schedule\
    \ irrigation. \nA wide range of researchers that use IR thermometer imagery to\
    \ schedule irrigation focuses on plant parame-\nters such as: plant temperature\
    \ and evapotranspiration rate: ([38]-[48]) as well as stomatal conductance, and\
    \ \nclosing of stomata ([37] [49]-[51]). Monitoring stomatal conductance can be\
    \ a better indicator of plant response \nto drying soil than monitoring water\
    \ potential because reductions in stomatal conductance can occur even before \n\
    any change in plant water status [52].  \nMethods for using TIR to assess spatial\
    \ variation in soil water availability also have utility in precision agri-\n\
    culture applications [16]. As an example [53] showed that plant growth and soil\
    \ water deficit vary spatially and \ntemporally in a crop field where increased\
    \ soil water deficit within the root zone of plants increases canopy \ntemperature\
    \ which leads to an increase in stomatal conductance, and suggest that this could\
    \ be used as an esti-\nmator to schedule irrigation. \nNewly researches combine\
    \ thermal remote sensing with other methods to access crop water stress and irriga-\n\
    tion scheduling. [54] developed an algorithm that can assess automatically canopy\
    \ temperature by aligning an \noptical image taken from the plant canopy with\
    \ the IR image, from simple color identification techniques in \ncombination with\
    \ Gaussian mixture distribution extraction techniques and based on measurement\
    \ of data ac-\nquired from an IR thermography they were able to extract successfully\
    \ and automatically the canopy tempera-\nture distribution of the leaf. A new\
    \ approach was developed by [55] to schedule irrigation based on ground re-\n\
    mote sensing systems. Infrared radiometers and a conventional meteorological system\
    \ were stationed on top of a \nlinear move irrigation system. The output signals\
    \ were collected remotely in a personal computer (PC) that was \nequipped with\
    \ specific code to solve the Penmane-Monteith (PM) equation for parameterization\
    \ of aerodynamic \nand canopy resistances which were then used to calculate the\
    \ water requirement of the plants. From Infrared ra-\ndiometric system they were\
    \ able to control remotely all components that are required to improve irrigation\
    \ \nmanagement, including the automatic data collection, models, hardware and\
    \ software, in addition their remote \nsensing approach does not require signals\
    \ from the soil (as usually practiced) but instead it is based on signals \nthat\
    \ are emitted directly from plants. [56] combines hyperspectral and thermal imageries\
    \ collected from airborne \nsensors on a farm-level field experiments of maize\
    \ and sorghum with different water irrigation treatments im-\nposed. Based on\
    \ the results obtained in their study, Author’s states that the integrated use\
    \ of hyperspectral in-\ndices, fluorescence and thermal imageries can guarantee\
    \ good results for irrigation scheduling and crop water \nstress identification.\
    \  \nR. Ishimwe et al. \n \n \n133 \n2.4. Soil Salinity Detection  \nSoil salinity\
    \ causes severe environmental degradation that impedes crop growth and overall\
    \ regional production \n[57] Soil salinity information can be extracted from thermal\
    \ imageries as emitted radiance can provide subsoil \ninformation that reflected\
    \ radiation cannot [58].  \n[59] studied the application of thermography to rapidly\
    \ diagnosing salinity stress with a high degree of tem-\nperature resolution in\
    \ potted ornamental crops Syngonium podophyllum and Philodendron erubescens that\
    \ were \ntransplanted to pots in a greenhouse in Almeria (Spain). Salinity treatments\
    \ were 1, 2, 6 or 12 dS∙m−1 of electric \nconductivity in a nutrient solution.\
    \ Thermography coupled with adequate software clearly shows the effect of \nsalinity\
    \ on the potted plants, and this effect was maintained for over 30 days thus the\
    \ author states that thermo-\ngraphy can be an early useful method to diagnose\
    \ saline stress in potted plants. \nTherefore thermal Infrared (TIR) radiation\
    \ is important for salinity studies, although only few studies have \nused this\
    \ technology to study and diagnose soil salinity stress on crops. \n2.5. Disease\
    \ and Pathogen Detection \nDuring plant-pathogen infection, the physiological\
    \ state of the infected tissue is altered, such as changes in pho-\ntosynthesis,\
    \ transpiration, stomatal conductance, accumulation of Salicylic acid (SA) and\
    \ even cell death [60]. \nFoliar disease can directly be detected by modern optical\
    \ sensor technology. Using hyperspectral reflectance \nimages [61] and [62] were\
    \ able to identify powdery mildew of barley, diseased cucumber leaves and yellow\
    \ rust \nof wheat respectively. But digital infrared thermography have the potential\
    \ to identify and quantify with high \nspatial resolution management zones in\
    \ disease control and associated pathogens, as they are sensitive to physi-\n\
    ological disorders associated with fungal attack as well as disease [63], in addition\
    \ leaf diseases often affect \nplant transpiration. \nThermal infrared has been\
    \ proved by various researchers to be a useful tool for the pre-symptomatic effect\
    \ of \ndisease and pathogen on plant. [63]-[65] used thermal infrared to detect\
    \ Pseudoperonospora cubensis that caus-\nes downy mildew in cucumber, The maximum\
    \ temperature difference (MTD) within a leaf or a canopy turned \nout to be suitable\
    \ for the differentiation of infected and non-infected tissue under controlled\
    \ conditions, transpi-\nration rate and leaf temperature were similar for healthy\
    \ and infected leaves under non controlled conditions but \nfor infected tissues,\
    \ transpiration rates showed higher variation depending on disease symptoms. However,\
    \ [60] \nfound a decrease in leaf temperature of about 0.5˚C - 1.3˚C lower for\
    \ the infected leaves than the healthy leaves \nwhile they were assessing the\
    \ different temperature distribution between the leaves infected by tobacco mosaic\
    \ \nvirus strain-TMV-U1 and the non-infected leaves within different tomato species\
    \ using digital infrared thermal \nimaging in combination with microscopic observations.\
    \ \nLater on [66] explain this decrease and increase of infected leaves temperature\
    \ while they were assessing scab \ndisease on apple leaves using infrared thermography\
    \ and they found that MTD increased with scab development \nand was strongly correlated\
    \ to the size of infection sites. However in the later stages of the disease,\
    \ the MTD \ndecreased because of leaf senescence and leaf transpiration was increased\
    \ by all stages of scab development, \ntherefore, MTD may be used not only for\
    \ the differentiation between diseased and non-diseased leaves, but also \nfor\
    \ disease quantification. \nTIR could also be used to detect pathogen before visible\
    \ symptoms occur; [67] explored the potential of \nthermal imaging for pathogen\
    \ detection (Plasmopara viticola) in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Riesling)\
    \ on \nwell irrigated or non-irrigated grapevines. Experiments were conducted\
    \ under greenhouse conditions to monitor \nleaf temperature of Plasmopara viticola\
    \ pathogen-infected and non-infected areas. Four different treatments \nwere used:\
    \ (1) irrigated to field capacity and non-inoculated vines; (2) irrigated to field\
    \ capacity and inoculated \nvines; (3) non-irrigated and non-inoculated vines;\
    \ and (4) non-irrigated and inoculated vines. The analysis of \nthermal images\
    \ showed that pathogen development caused an increase in leaf temperature at the\
    \ point of infec-\ntion in irrigated vines, non-irrigated vines showed a lower\
    \ temperature at the sites of inoculation. \nThermal imaging is a straightforward\
    \ choice for providing information for pre-symptomatic diagnosis of bio-\ntic\
    \ stresses before the appearance of visible necrosis on leaves by visualizing\
    \ and analyzing the temperature dif-\nference between infected and non-infected\
    \ leaves.  \n2.6. Yield Estimation and Forecasting \nCrop yield estimation is\
    \ very important because such predictions warn the decision makers about potential\
    \ re-\nR. Ishimwe et al. \n \n \n134 \nduction in crop yields, Time series data\
    \ models are the commonly used methods to estimate yield for many \ncrops in almost\
    \ all parts of the world. But most of the time, high deviation is observed in\
    \ the actual yield from \nthe forecasted yield [7]. Thermal imaging can be used\
    \ to estimate yield as thermography is based on sensing an \nobject's own heat\
    \ radiation. However, only a few reports can be found on the application of thermal\
    \ imaging in \nestimating and forecasting yield  \n[68] analyzed the relationship\
    \ between wheat yield and daytime measurement of temperature difference be-\n\
    tween foliage and ambient air temperature. For foliage temperature measurement,\
    \ they used a thermal camera \nthat received the infrared radiation in 8 - 14\
    \ μm spectral wavelengths. Micrometeorological data were also col-\nlected during\
    \ the wheat growing stages. The experiment was conducted for two crop seasons\
    \ (1982 and 1983) \non a red-brown soil in Australia. Transpiration and canopy\
    \ stomatal resistances to water vapor transport were \npredicted from the collected\
    \ data, the predicted transpiration and CO2 assimilation rates were found to be\
    \ closely \nrelated to yield within each year but not between years. As a result\
    \ it was stated that infrared thermometry would \nbe a useful technique for studying\
    \ yield variations in agronomic experiments where these variations are due to\
    \ \nstomatal control. \nAfter almost two decades [69] developed fruit detection\
    \ algorithm with thermal imaging to estimate the num-\nber of apple fruits on\
    \ the basis of temperature gradients between fruits and their background. At the\
    \ same time, \non each imaged tree, all fruits were manually counted and diameters\
    \ of the fruits were measured with sliding ca-\nlipers. The results of the study\
    \ showed that a close correlation (R2 = 0.83 - 0.88) existed between manually\
    \ \ncounted fruits and fruits determined by thermal imaging. The correlation coefficient\
    \ was R2 = 0.68 to 0.70 be-\ntween manually measured diameter and the diameter\
    \ of fruit determined by imaging. \n[70] conducted a study that focused on fruit\
    \ recognition from the canopy using thermal imaging, to enhance \nthe robotic\
    \ harvesting of fruit, which is an alternate for harvesting by hand. Thermal images\
    \ were acquired on 24 \nh cycles at 15 min interval using a thermal infrared camera,\
    \ after analyzing images with Matlab they found that \nfrom evening 16:00 until\
    \ early morning, fruit temperature was higher than the leaf by about 1.6˚C while\
    \ in the \nother time range, it was higher only at less than 0.6˚C. The authors\
    \ suggested that thermal imaging has a poten-\ntial to distinguish between fruit\
    \ and canopy from afternoon until midnight. \n[71] utilizes thermal infrared image\
    \ for inversion of winter wheat yield and biomass with different technology \n\
    of irrigation (drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, flood irrigation), the authors\
    \ considered the fact that the amount \nof yield of a crop is more related to\
    \ the amount of water received during the growing period. Their research was \n\
    subdivided into tree stages as follows, Firstly, the infrared crop water stress\
    \ index (ICWSI) was obtained by us-\ning thermal infrared camera, Secondly the\
    \ infrared index data was checked for correctness and finally model \nwas developed\
    \ using ICWSI to predict soil moisture, biomass and yield of wheat. Various crop\
    \ prediction mod-\nels were used but cubic model proved to be the best to predict\
    \ yield based on thermal imaging, therefore the au-\nthors indicated that thermal\
    \ infrared images can be used potentially for inversion of winter wheat yield.\
    \ \nRecently, [72] conforms the superiority of thermography technology for predicting\
    \ winter wheat yield. The \nauthors applied BP neural network in predicting winter\
    \ wheat yield based on thermography. Using thermal \ncamera to obtain canopy temperature\
    \ for winter wheat, ICWSI was then calculated in the main water require-\nment\
    \ stage. The performance of a BP neural network was tested with ICWSI values for\
    \ three different periods in \none irrigation circles as independent input factor\
    \ and observed winter wheat yield after harvest as the output. \nThe result showed\
    \ a the maximum relative error of 3.42%, therefore the authors states that BP\
    \ neural network in \ncombination with ICWSI using thermal images successfully\
    \ and accurately predict the yield of winter wheat. \nSince the accuracy of yield\
    \ forecasting by thermometry is very promising, this technique may be used as\
    \ a \ncomplementary method to other methods [7]. However, no further research\
    \ is reported about yield estimation for \nother crops (e.g., Maize, Soybean,\
    \ etc.) using thermal imaging which requires continuous detection and counting\
    \ \n[73]. \n2.7. Maturity Evaluation \nCrop maturity assessment is commonly achieved\
    \ by crop dissection and visual inspection [74] even though sev-\neral automatic\
    \ methods are available. These approaches are both labor intensive and subjective\
    \ due to the repea-\ntability of measurement and limiting number of observation\
    \ made by a single observer [75]. It is known that \ntranspiration resistance\
    \ grows as well as the plant physiological age increases until the plant reaches\
    \ the maxi-\nmum value, in many kinds of plant, this maximum value coincides with\
    \ the stage of maturity or ripeness [76] \nR. Ishimwe et al. \n \n \n135 \nand\
    \ transpiration resistance diminish as plant ageing begins whence infrared thermography\
    \ can be used to assess \ncrop maturity. \n[77] assessed the maturity of Tomato,\
    \ Japanese pear, and Japanese persimmon (one vegetable and two fruits \nrespectively)\
    \ using infrared thermometry. These were divided into three grades of maturity\
    \ that are immature, \nmature, and over-ripe based on color, firmness, and sugar\
    \ content. Samples were kept in constant room temper-\nature for more than 24\
    \ h before measurements. The temperature differences ranged between 0.5˚C to 1.0˚C\
    \ for \nfruit and vegetables in three grades of maturity, whereas, the surface\
    \ temperature of immature fruits stored at \nhigher temperature was slightly lower\
    \ than that of mature and over-ripe fruits.  \n[78] suggested after conducting\
    \ a study on the use of thermography for determination of mechanical damage, \n\
    bruising, and maturing of apples (Jonagold, Cox), that maturity of fruits and\
    \ vegetables can be estimated by \nthermal imaging, even different varieties could\
    \ be identified if they are of the same ripeness. Therefore thermal \nimaging\
    \ systems are suitable for examining maturity and quality of produce as detailed\
    \ thermal analyses of the \ntranspiration behavior of the produce and its interrelation\
    \ with the environment allow the determination of the \noptimal harvest date and\
    \ the adapted design of postharvest machinery [76]. Nevertheless there is a need\
    \ for more \nresearch on the use of thermal imaging for maturity detection of\
    \ other crops. \n2.8. Bruise Detection \nBruises and scratches are the most common\
    \ forms of damage on the surface of fruits and vegetables during \ntransportation\
    \ and handling [7]. Bruising is defined as damage of fruit tissue as a result\
    \ of external forces which \ncause physical changes of texture or chemical changes\
    \ of color, smell and taste [79]. With the development in \nimaging technology\
    \ on-line detection of bruises on fruits & vegetables is feasible. Non-destructive\
    \ methods for \ndetecting bruise damage in fruits have been reported using imaging\
    \ technologies including the Multispectral and \nHyperspectral NIR-based technique\
    \ ([80]-[86]). Thermal imaging offers a potential alternative technique for \n\
    bruise detection, unlike NIR based techniques it does not require an illumination\
    \ source for spectral reflectance \nlike which can be affected by the varied skin\
    \ color of apples or by the illumination setup [87]. The inner defects \nof fruit\
    \ tissue which leads to local changes of thermal properties are responsible for\
    \ obtaining thermal contrasts \nbetween bruised and sound areas on the fruit surface.\
    \ \nThe first study of detecting bruise using thermal imaging was done by [88],\
    \ their study determined the effect \nof surface defects on temperature distribution\
    \ for apple, Satsuma mandarin, and natsudaidai fruits. Artificial \nbruises were\
    \ made on the fruits by pressing and scratching. Thermal images were taken with\
    \ a thermal camera \n(wavelength 8 - 14 μm). The temperature difference between\
    \ bruised and sound skin was found to be usually in \nthe range of 0.2˚C to 1.0˚C,\
    \ with measuring times of at least 10 min and the temperature at the bruises was\
    \ lower \nthan that of unbruised skin.  \n[89] used thermal imaging method to\
    \ detect bruises in tomato where artificially bruised tomatoes were heated \n\
    in microwave oven for 14 second and then thermally imaged and after all treatment,\
    \ measurement of tempera-\nture difference between the intact and bruised parts\
    \ was in the range of 0.5˚C to 1.0˚C. [87] determined the ca-\npability of the\
    \ thermal imaging method that applies forced convection to detect bruises in three\
    \ apple varieties \n(Fuji, Red delicious, and Macintosh), Apples were thermally\
    \ imaged for 3 min. It was determined that before \ntreatment thermal imaging\
    \ could not detect the bruises in apple. But after treatment the bruised tissue\
    \ showed at \nleast 1˚C to 2˚C cooler than sound tissue within 30 to 180 second\
    \ thus the author’s state that the temperature \ndifferences were due to thermal\
    \ diffusivity instead of thermal emissivity  \n[90] developed a method to detect\
    \ early bruising in apple varieties, Jonagold, Champion and Gloster using \npulsed-phase\
    \ thermography (PPT). Samples were subjected to bruising by a specific procedure\
    \ and stored at \nroom temperature for 1 h before thermographic bruise assessment.\
    \ In the first stage of the study (no heat stimu-\nlation), the temperature difference\
    \ between sound and bruised areas as well as between shallow and deeper \nbruises\
    \ were close to 0˚C, while, after heating apples for 1s, the temperature of the\
    \ bruised part was colder and \nvaries between 0.9˚C and 1.5˚C for Jonagold, 0.9\
    \ and 1.8˚C for Champion, and 1.0˚C and 2.1˚C for Gloster ap-\nples.  \nIn spite\
    \ of the fact that infrared thermography techniques have many qualities in bruise\
    \ detection, such as \nnondestructive, non-contact, and allow for full-field imaging\
    \ and fast inspection speed, it has also some limita-\ntions caused by the measurement\
    \ sensitivity. However, this limitation can be overcome by combining infrared\
    \ \nthermography with other technologies such as lock-in techniques, whereby it\
    \ combine several technologies and \ncontrol systems that are supported by computerized\
    \ image processing techniques. Thus, lock-in technique has \nR. Ishimwe et al.\
    \ \n \n \n136 \nbeen applied to infrared thermography to enhance its detection\
    \ sensitivity [91]. [92] uses infrared lock in ther-\nmography to evaluate bruises\
    \ on pears fruits. They measured the thermal emission signals from pears using\
    \ a \nhighly sensitive mid-infrared thermal camera, by applying the lock-in method\
    \ to infrared thermography, the de-\ntection sensitivity and signal to noise ratio\
    \ were enhanced because of the phase-sensitive narrow-band filtering \neffect.\
    \ Thermal characteristic response of pears was analyzed on the basis of phase\
    \ images. Author’s found that \na greater phase difference corresponds to greater\
    \ damage of the pear specimens, because the damaged area \ncauses thermal wave\
    \ delay, therefore their states that the lock-in thermography technique can be\
    \ used for the \ndetection of damage on pear samples. \n3. Conclusion \nThermal\
    \ imaging has been growing fast and playing an important role in various fields\
    \ of agriculture starting \nfrom nursery monitoring, irrigation scheduling, soil\
    \ salinity stress detection, plants disease detection, yield esti-\nmation, maturity\
    \ evaluation and bruise detection of fruits and vegetables. This technique gains\
    \ the popularity in \nagriculture due to its higher temporal and spatial resolutions\
    \ images. However, intensive researches need to be \nconducted for its potential\
    \ application in other various processes of agriculture (e.g. Yield forecasting)\
    \ that are \nnot yet investigated. In spite of the fact that it could be used\
    \ in many agriculture operations during pre-harvest \nand post-harvest period,\
    \ as a noncontact, non-destructive technique, it has some drawbacks unlike with\
    \ other \nremote sensing imaging because high resolution thermal imaging are costly\
    \ and accurate thermal measurements \ndepend on environmental and weather conditions\
    \ thus it may not be possible to develop a universal methodolo-\ngy for its application\
    \ in agricultural operations since thermal behaviors of crops vary with climatic\
    \ conditions. \nAcknowledgments \nWe thank University of Johannesburg and University\

  analysis: This paper presents the results of an NIR spectroscopy study where the
    authors investigated the relationship between the NIR absorption spectrum and
    physiological measures of water potential in grapevine leaves. They found that
    grapevine stem water potential (Ψstem) could be measured non-destructively using
    NIR spectroscopy with good accuracy, and that the best calibration was obtained
    for the prediction of stem water potential in Shiraz (R = 0.92 and a SECV = 0.09
    MPa). The authors also found that the leaf surface from which the spectra were
    collected had an effect on the accuracy of the calibration results for water potential,
    and that spectra collected from the abaxial leaf surface yielded better correlations
    with water potential compared with those collected on the adaxial surface. Overall,
    the findings of this study suggest that NIR spectroscopy has the potential to
    be used as a non-destructive and accurate method for measuring grapevine water
    potential, which could be useful for irrigation management and precision viticulture.

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Background and Aims: Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy
    techniques are not only used for a variety of physical and chemical analyses in
    the food industry, but also in remote sensing studies as tools to predict plant
    water status. In this study, NIR spectroscopy was evaluated as a method to estimate
    water potential of grapevines. Methods and Results: Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay
    and Shiraz leaves were scanned using an Integrated Spectronic (300–1100 nm) or
    an ASD FieldSpec® 3 (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, Colorado, USA) (350–1850 nm)
    spectrophotometer and then measured to obtain midday leaf water potential using
    a pressure chamber. On the same shoot, the leaf adjacent the one used for midday
    leaf water potential measurement was used to measure midday stem water potential.
    Calibrations were built and NIR showed good prediction ability (standard error
    in cross validation (SECV) <0.24 MPa) for stem water potential for each of the
    three grapevine varieties. The best calibration was obtained for the prediction
    of stem water potential in Shiraz (R = 0.92 and a SECV = 0.09 MPa). Conclusion:
    Differences in the NIR spectra were related to the leaf surface from which the
    spectra were collected, and this had an effect on the accuracy of the calibration
    results for water potential. We demonstrated that NIR can be used as a simple
    and rapid method to detect grapevine water status. Significance of the Study:
    Grapevine water potential can be measured using NIR spectroscopy. The advantages
    of this new approach are speed and low cost of analysis. It may be possible for
    NIR to be used as a non-destructive, in-field tool for irrigation scheduling.

    The amount of water available for irrigation is declining worldwide because of
    a quantitative and qualitative deterioration of water resources (Eastham and Gray
    1998). The Australian wine industry, in particular, is facing an unprecedented
    challenge to maintain international competitiveness in the current drought. The
    increasing shortages of water and costs of irrigation are leading to an emphasis
    on the development of new methods of irrigation and irrigation scheduling that
    minimise water use and maximise water use efficiency (WUE) (Jones 2004). According
    to Al-Kaisi and Yin (2003) WUE maximisation should be considered as a key subject
    for research because of water scarcity issues. Grapevines are an intensive crop
    in semi-arid regions, so irrigation would be more effective if scheduled appropriately
    and if dosages and timing are applied to maximise WUE. In order to achieve this,
    the crop water status must be monitored accurately and reliably (Jones 2007).
    Irrigation scheduling in vineyards is conventionally based on direct measures
    of soil moisture status and/or on soil water balance calculations (Jones 2004,
    2007). Soil water measurements rely on the availability of many commercial systems
    and are relatively easy to apply; however, these approaches are prone to cumulative
    errors, require many sensors and may not be representative because of soil heterogeneity
    (Jones 2004). Alternative approaches are based on the physiological knowledge
    of grapevine response to water stress, thus sensing the plant response to water
    deficits rather than sensing the soil moisture status directly. The most common
    direct sensing methods are the measures of midday leaf water potential (Ψleaf),
    and leaf conductance to water vapor (g) largely dependent on stomatal conductance
    (Flexas et al. 2010). The pressure chamber technique of measuring Ψleaf, which
    is a destructive method, has been assessed in several cases for grapevine as a
    relatively simple and rapid measurement (Naor et al. 1997, Trégoat et al. 2002,
    Williams and Araujo 2002, Sibille et al. 2007). A good correlation between Ψleaf
    and g has been found for many grapevine varieties, but not for those showing near-isohydric
    behaviour (Schultz 2003, Cifre et al. 2005). This may reduce the utility of Ψleaf
    as an indicator of water stress for the latter varieties (Cifre et al. 2005).
    Leaf water status within a canopy is variable because it depends on the transpiration
    rate that a particular leaf has at the moment of measurement (Choné et al. 2001).
    As a partial solution to this variability, the measurement of midday stem water
    potential (Ψstem) was proposed because it is a more integrative indicator of whole-vine
    water status (Choné et al. 2001). Nevertheless, traditional methods for measuring
    Ψstem require destructive sampling and pretreatment for up to 1 h. Near infrared
    (NIR) spectroscopy has been used as a non-destructive method to analyse components
    of several agricultural products (Osborne et al. 1993, Batten 1998, Cozzolino
    et al. 2006). The NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum (730–2300 nm) contains
    several wavelengths that are strongly influenced by the presence of water, and
    the state of water in the measured sample. The NIR spectral region is dominated
    by weak overtones and combinations of vibration bands from molecular bonds of
    hydrogen attached to atoms such as nitrogen, oxygen and carbon (Murray 1993, Batten
    1998). Strong NIR absorption bands of water are found around 1400–1440 nm and
    between 1900 to 1950 nm and have often been applied to quantitative analysis of
    water content in food (Murray 1993, Batten 1998, Williams 2001, Büning-Pfaue 2003,
    Cozzolino et al. 2006). Wavelength bands related to water have also been utilised
    in NIR reflectance with remote sensing applications to determine water content
    and water status of plants (Hunt et al. 1987, Bowman 1989, Hunt and Rock 1989,
    Peñuelas et al. 1993, 1997a,b, Ceccato et al. 2001, Maki et al. 2004). Recently,
    Santos and Kaye (2009) attempted to use NIR spectroscopy to assess Ψleaf in grapevines.
    However, their measurements of Ψleaf using the pressure chamber (Boyer 1967) were
    not made in the field at the time of the NIR measurements in some experiments,
    potentially compromising the accuracy of Ψleaf determinations. Nevertheless, in
    a laboratory experiment, they obtained good calibrations (R = 0.84) for the prediction
    of Ψleaf in Cabernet Sauvignon and Thompson Seedless. Rodríguez-Pérez et al. (2007)
    obtained significant correlations for Ψstem and Ψstem-Ψpre-dawn for grapevines
    using the ratio of leaf reflectance at specific wavelengths when measured at the
    canopy level, but correlation coefficients were generally low. They asserted that
    measurements of leaf reflectance may provide a better approach to standardise
    water status measurement for specific grapevine varieties and they identified
    several vegetation indices that may be useful for remote sensing of grapevine
    water stress. In NIR spectroscopy, calibration is a key mathematical process,
    which uses multivariate regression techniques relating NIR optical measurements
    (absorbance values) at selected wavelengths to reference values measured by conventional
    chemical or physical methods (Murray 1993, Batten 1998, Williams 2001). Once calibrated,
    the advantages of NIR spectroscopy are the speed of the analysis, simplicity in
    sample preparation, multiplicity of analysis, and the non-requirement for the
    use of chemical reagents (Murray 1993, Batten 1998, Williams 2001). In contrast,
    water potential measurements can be restrictive, because they are slow, labour
    intensive, and are therefore expensive (Jones 2004). This study reports the results
    of a multivariate analysis of the NIR absorption spectrum and physiological measures
    of water potential in pot and field grown Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay
    grapevines. Materials and methods Field experiment 1 – Cabernet Sauvignon and
    Shiraz The experiment was carried out in the Coombe vineyard at the Waite Campus
    of the University of Adelaide, South Australia (34°58′3.47″S; 138°38′0.43″E),
    during the season 2006–07. Measurements were made on own-rooted Cabernet Sauvignon
    and Shiraz vines, planted in 1991 with a vine spacing of 1.8 m in the row and
    3 m between rows. Rows were oriented North-South. The training system was a bilateral
    spur-pruned cordon with the shoots vertically positioned. Vines were drip irrigated
    by in-line drippers discharging 1.5 L/h. Drippers spacing within the row was 0.8 m.
    Six plants for each variety were selected and Ψleaf, Ψstem and g were measured
    on six occasions for Cabernet Sauvignon and eight occasions for Shiraz, at approximately
    7-day intervals, from February to March 2007. A Scholander pressure chamber (Scholander
    et al. 1965) was used to measure Ψleaf as described by Meron et al. (1987). Measurements
    were made at midday (1200 to 1400 hours, solar time) on two fully expanded and
    undamaged leaves for each plant chosen from the mid-upper part of the canopy.
    One leaf was collected from the midday sunlit side of the canopy and one from
    the shadowed side. Measurements on both the sunlit and shaded sides of the canopy
    were used to build the calibration. No leaves from secondary shoots were used.
    Ψstem was measured immediately after Ψleaf on the same shoot using the leaf below
    the one used to measure Ψleaf. For Ψstem measurements, leaves were covered for
    60 min with a ziplock aluminium foil-coated plastic bag before the measure, in
    order to allow Ψleaf to equilibrate with Ψstem (Begg and Turner 1970). After the
    equilibration period, the leaves were cut and Ψstem was measured following the
    same procedure already described for Ψleaf. A maximum of 30 s elapsed between
    cutting the leaves and the measurements. The same pressure chamber operator did
    all measurements with the objective of normalising interpretation of the moment
    that sap emerges from the petiole. Leaf conductance (g) was measured using a diffusion
    porometer (AP4, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) before the leaf was cut for Ψleaf
    measurement. A reflectance spectrum was acquired on the adaxial surface using
    the same leaf where g and Ψleaf were measured. The time elapsed between the spectra
    acquisition and the water potential measurements was about 30 s for Ψleaf, and
    120 s for Ψstem. No spectra were acquired from the leaf used for Ψstem measurement.
    The spectrophotometer (custom made, Integrated Spectronics, Sydney, Australia)
    was equipped with a 10 W halogen lamp as the light source and a silicon diode
    array detector able to collect spectra from the visible and NIR regions of the
    spectrum to give a total range of 300 to 1100 nm at 3.2 nm wavelength resolution,
    producing a total of 220 data points. Leaf samples were placed in front of the
    lens (diameter approximately 40 mm) for scanning. A spectrally black surface was
    put on the underside of the leaf to minimise differences in background reflectance.
    Lab View software (Version 5.1, National Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA) was
    used to control the spectrophotometer and to acquire the NIR spectra. Field experiment
    2 – Chardonnay The experiment was carried out during January (7th–8th) and February
    (12th) 2009 in a commercial Chardonnay vineyard at Qualco, South Australia (34°6′0.76″S;
    139°50′55.76″E). The vines were 5 years old and grafted on Ramsey rootstock. The
    vines were trained on a two-wire vertical trellis system with a row spacing of
    1.8 m between vines and 3.05 m between rows. Five irrigation strategies were used
    for this study: full irrigation (Control), and reductions to 50, 30, 20 and 10%
    of the control. The control treatment represented the amount of water that is
    normally applied in the vineyard (5 ML/ha/year). The trial was a randomised block
    design with four blocks and was established in 60 rows made of 90 vines each,
    covering a total area of 3.69 ha. In the block, each treatment was made of three
    rows and the rows were divided in three sections of 30 plants each. In the middle
    row of each treatment, the middle plant in each section was selected for measurements.
    All treatments were irrigated with Netafim Dripmaster® (Netafim Australia, Laverton
    North, Australia) pressure compensated in-line drippers, spaced 0.5 m apart along
    the drip line and discharging 2.3 L/h. All irrigation events to the Control were
    scheduled to apply 6 mm using the Irrigated Crop Management Service (ICMS) Water
    Budgeting Tool (Irrigated Crop Management Service (2007) ICMS Water Budgeting
    Tool. http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/pirsa/drought/irrigation__and__water_management/irrigators_toolkit;
    03/04/2010). To apply the reductions in irrigation volume, the interval between
    irrigations was increased. Determinations of water potentials were performed with
    a pressure chamber on two leaves from each of the three vines per plot. Ψleaf
    and Ψstem measurements were made at midday (1200 to 1400 hours, solar time) using
    the method previously described. Ψstem was measured immediately after the Ψleaf
    on the same shoot using the leaf below the one used to measure Ψleaf. Diffuse
    reflectance spectra were acquired from both leaf surfaces (adaxial and abaxial)
    on the same leaves before Ψleaf was determined. No spectra were acquired from
    the leaf used for Ψstem measurement. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the leaf
    surfaces were recorded using a purpose-built contact probe attached by fibre optic
    cable to a spectrophotometer (ASD FieldSpec® 3, Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder,
    Colorado, USA). The time elapsed between the spectra acquisition and the water
    potential measurements was about 30 s for Ψleaf and 120 s for Ψstem. The instrument
    records spectra with resolution of 1.4 nm for the region 350–1000 nm and 2 nm
    for the region 1000–1850 nm. The instrument was used in reflectance mode. The
    data processing software associated with the ASD spectrophotometer interpolates
    the 1.4 and 2 nm-spaced data to produce 1 nm-spaced data. The saved spectrum of
    each sample was the average of ten successive scans. A reference tile (Spectralon®,
    Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, Colorado, USA) was used as a white reference,
    for scatter correction. Software RS3TM (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder,
    Colorado, USA) was used to control the spectrophotometer and to acquire the NIR
    spectra. Glasshouse experiment The experiment was carried out in a glasshouse
    at the Waite Campus of the University of Adelaide, South Australia (34°58′3.47″S;
    138°38′0.43″E), during May and September 2009, on pot-grown Cabernet Sauvignon
    and Shiraz vines. The water potential measurements were conducted on ten plants
    per variety. The same 20 plants were measured in four occasions in May and five
    occasions in September at about 7-day intervals. One shoot for each plant was
    chosen and Ψleaf was measured on a fully expanded leaf using a pressure chamber
    as described before. The adjacent leaf was bagged for 1 h prior to measurement
    and Ψstem was measured immediately after Ψleaf as previously described. Six NIR
    spectra were acquired for each leaf on six different positions evenly distributed
    over the abaxial leaf surface; two distal along the mid vein and four proximal
    (two on each half of the leaf, halfway between the mid vein and leaf margin) using
    the ASD spectrophotometer. No spectra were acquired from the leaf used for Ψstem
    measurement. The time elapsed between the spectra acquisition and the water potential
    measurements was about 30 s for Ψleaf and 120 s for Ψstem. Data analysis and interpretation
    Spectral and associated laboratory reference data were exported to The Unscrambler®
    software (version 9.2 CAMO, Oslo, Norway) for chemometric analysis and calibration
    development. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to examine any relevant
    and interpretable pattern in the data (Otto 1999, Naes et al. 2002). PCA was also
    used to explore the spectral data set for outliers. Calibration models were developed
    using partial least squares regression (PLS) with full cross validation. The NIR
    region 750–1050 nm was used to develop the calibration with the spectra obtained
    from the Integrated Spectronics spectrophotometer while for the ASD FieldSpec®
    3 the range 1100–1830 nm was selected. The cross validation was performed using
    six segments, with 19 samples for each segment. The coefficients of correlation
    in validation (R) and the standard error in cross validation (SECV) were calculated.
    The optimum number of terms in the PLS calibration models was determined as indicated
    by the lowest number of factors that gave the closest to minimum value of the
    PRESS (prediction residual error sum of squares) function in cross validation,
    in order to avoid over fitting of the models (Naes et al. 2002). Water potential
    and g data collected from the Chardonnay field experiment were analysed using
    analysis of variance (anova) with Cohort Costat software (Version 6.2, CoHort
    Software, Monterey, CA, USA). Mean separations were determined using the Student-Newman-Keuls
    test. Results Spectra interpretation Figure 1 shows averaged NIR spectra obtained
    during the 2006–07 season with the Integrated Spectronic spectrophotometer from
    the adaxial surface of leaves of field grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz vines
    under non water stressed (Ψstem > –1 MPa) and water stressed (Ψstem < –1.2 MPa)
    conditions (Lampinen et al. 2001, Trégoat et al. 2002, Williams and Araujo 2002,
    Ferreyra et al. 2003, Cifre et al. 2005, Sibille et al. 2007). The main features
    of the spectra are absorption bands in the 970 nm region. Non-stressed vine leaves
    showed a higher absorbance in the whole spectrum compared with the stressed vines
    for both varieties. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Near infrared spectra

    (Figure 2a). Interpretation of the average spectra of adaxial and abaxial surfaces
    of the leaves at 1445 nm showed a higher absorbance in the adaxial (0.83 a.u.)

    Table 1 shows the NIR calibration statistics for the prediction of Ψleaf, Ψstem
    and g of grapevine leaves obtained using the samples from the 2006–07 season.
    The R obtained for the prediction of Ψstem using NIR was 0.87 (SECV = 0.23 MPa)
    for Cabernet Sauvignon and 0.67 (SECV = 0.11 MPa) for Shiraz. The NIR calibrations
    for Ψleaf yielded an R = 0.74 (SECV = 0.29 MPa) for Cabernet Sauvignon; however,
    a poor correlation (R = 0.24; SECV = 0.19 MPa) was found for Shiraz. The poorest
    calibration statistics were found for NIR and g in both varieties. Table 1. Calibration

    for water potential measurements conducted on the commercial Chardonnay vineyard
    showed significant differences between irrigation treatments (Table 2). Based
    on Ψstem values, it was observed that plants experienced water deficits in January,
    but not in February, mostly because of the hot weather conditions in the first
    month (maximum temperatures: 7 January, 40.7°C, 12 February, 24.5°C). Moreover,
    in February, the measurements were made on a day when the irrigation was turned
    on and this could have influenced the measurements. Table 2. Midday leaf water

    January and 12 February 2009. Means followed by different letters are different
    at P ≤ 0.05 (Newman-Keuls test). Control plants presented the highest water potentials
    in both months. The Ψstem measurements showed the biggest differences between
    treatments. In January, only the 10% treatment exceeded a Ψstem of –1.2 MPa, which
    was considered indicative of water stress. The 30 and 20% treatments reached a
    Ψstem lower than –1 MPa, meaning that those plants were experiencing moderate
    water restrictions (Lampinen et al. 2001, Trégoat et al. 2002, Williams and Araujo
    2002, Ferreyra et al. 2003, Cifre et al. 2005, Sibille et al. 2007). In February,
    Ψstem differences between treatments were small. Only the 10% treatment was significantly
    different from the rest, and did not represent a water stress level for the plants.
    The g was measured in January and results show only significant differences between
    the control and the rest of treatments, which is in contrast with the significant
    differences observed for Ψstem among treatments (Table 2). Table 3 summarises
    the NIR calibration statistics obtained for the prediction of water potentials
    in Chardonnay. Similar correlation coefficients were obtained for both Ψleaf (R = 0.67;
    SECV = 0.26 MPa) and Ψstem (R = 0.67; SECV = 0.24 MPa) when spectra were collected

    Effect of adaxial and abaxial leaf surface on the NIR spectra. A visual analysis
    of the score plot of the second and third principal components (PCs) of the leaf
    samples analysed using NIR spectroscopy (Figure 4) reveals a clear separation
    between the two leaf surfaces. The cluster or separation indicates differences
    in the NIR spectra between the two sides of a leaf. The first three PCs explain
    more than 95% of the variation in the NIR spectra related to surface. Overall,
    similar loading weights were observed for the calibrations built using the adaxial
    surface, with a dominant peak at 1415 nm corresponding to that expected for water.
    Similarly, the calibration for the prediction of Ψleaf using the abaxial leaf
    surface showed a dominant peak at 1415 nm. In contrast, the calibration for Ψstem
    using the abaxial surface had a less dominant negative peak at 1418 nm and a more
    even distribution of the loading weights with wavelength (Figure 5). Figure 4

    water potential of Chardonnay grapevine leaves obtained from the abaxial leaf
    surface. The R for Ψstem was 0.84 (SECV 0.18 MPa), a poorer calibration was obtained
    for Ψleaf (R = 0.80, SECV 0.21 MPa). The best calibration was between NIR spectra
    collected from the abaxial surface and Ψstem. Glasshouse experiment. The calibrations
    built for Ψstem and Ψleaf, when more than one spectrum was collected for each
    Shiraz leaf, yielded the same and high correlation coefficient (R = 0.92) and
    low SECV (0.09 MPa for Ψstem and 0.11 MPa for Ψleaf) (Table 4). Similarly, for
    Cabernet Sauvignon, no differences were observed between the R in the two calibrations
    but this variety yielded lower R and lower SECV compared with Shiraz. Results
    in Table 4 show that all the calibrations built with only one random spectrum
    per leaf had a lower R and a higher SECV compared with those obtained including
    multiple spectra in the analysis. Moreover, better calibrations were obtained
    for Ψstem compared with Ψleaf for one spectrum per leaf. Table 4. Calibration

    Discussion NIR reflectance spectroscopy may be used to predict Ψstem and Ψleaf
    in grapevine because we have demonstrated that regions of the NIR spectrum are
    highly correlated with the water potential in three varieties of Vitis vinifera
    L. using different NIR spectrophotometers and over different ranges of wavelengths.
    A higher absorbance in the whole NIR spectrum was consistently associated with
    non-stressed vine leaves for the three varieties, with both types of spectrophotometers
    used. Peñuelas and Inoue (1999) observed an increase in the reflectance at all
    wavelengths with decreasing leaf water content in peanut and wheat leaves. These
    observations are in general agreement with previous studies showing that the NIR
    reflectance of a dried leaf is greater than that of a fresh leaf at all wavelengths
    (Thomas et al. 1966, Knipling 1970, Woolley 1971, Gausman 1974, Peñuelas et al.
    1994, Jones et al. 2004). It is well known that water is a strong absorber in
    the NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum, therefore non-stressed plants
    will have higher absorbance values in the NIR spectrum compared with stressed
    plants. According to Carter (1991), when scanning single leaves, the water absorption
    bands that show the highest sensitivity to leaf water concentration are those
    in the 1300–2500 nm range. Peñuelas et al. (1993, 1997b) and Peñuelas and Filella
    (1998) showed that the weaker water absorption band between 950 and 970 nm is
    also effective and they defined a water index, initially as the ratio between
    the reflectance at 970 nm and that at 900 nm (R970/R900) (Peñuelas et al. 1993)
    and later as the inverse (R900/R970) (Peñuelas et al. 1997b). The latter ratio
    was highly correlated with the plant relative water content (RWC) in several trees,
    shrubs, crops and grasses. Combinations of wavelength bands sensitive to water
    (760, 970, 1450 and 1940 nm) have been used to generate other indices related
    to plant water status and soil water availability (Thomas et al. 1971, Hunt and
    Rock 1989, Danson et al. 1992, Mogensen et al. 1996, Bahrun et al. 2003, Rodríguez-Pérez
    et al. 2007). Some of these indices have been used to estimate crop water status
    (Peñuelas et al. 1993, 1997b, Jones et al. 2004, Rodríguez-Pérez et al. 2007)
    and in remote sensing studies aimed to asses vineyard conditions (Tucker 1980,
    Broge and Leblanc 2001, Zarco-Tejada et al. 2005a,b). Furthermore, Eitel et al.
    (2006) found a correlation (r2 = 0.34) between Ψleaf and their proposed maximum
    difference water index (MDWI) when spectra were collected at leaf level for poplar
    trees. They defined MDWI as the spectral response at the leaf level to water status
    calculated from the maximum and minimum reflectance located between 1500 and 1750 nm.
    In this study, spectra were obtained at the leaf level and it was found that the
    most relevant water absorption peaks were in the regions of 970 and 1400–1450 nm
    for the Integrated Spectronics and the ASD FieldSpec® 3 spectrophotometers, respectively.
    The absorption bands at 970 nm are related to the second overtone of the O-H stretch
    vibration of water (Murray 1986, Osborne et al. 1993, Williams 2001). Bands in
    the 1400–1450 nm are related to the first overtone of the OH stretch of water
    (Murray 1986, Osborne et al. 1993, Williams 2001). According to Eitel et al. (2006)
    the advantage of taking spectra at the leaf level is that the effect of background
    variables or atmospheric noise is eliminated so that variations in the spectra
    are only caused by leaf properties. However, we did not find correlations between
    Ψleaf or Ψstem and some of the above mentioned indices (WI, MDWI) (data not shown).
    Nevertheless, water potential was used in this study rather than other measures
    related to plant water status, such as the RWC and equivalent water thickness
    (EWT), which is the hypothetical thickness of a single layer of water averaged
    over the whole leaf (Danson et al. 1992). Water potential provides information
    about the water status of the plant and the soil as an integrated soil–plant-atmosphere
    system (Kozlowski et al. 1991), compared with RWC and EWT, which may vary with
    cell elasticity and leaf development for equivalent water potentials. In this
    study, rather than using any specific wavelength, a multivariate analysis of the
    whole spectrum in the range 1100–1830 nm was used to build the calibrations. Previously,
    Santos and Kaye (2009) obtained good calibrations for the prediction of Ψleaf
    in Cabernet Sauvignon and Thompson Seedless in a laboratory experiment, using
    the whole spectral range 1100–2300 nm. Therefore, the higher correlations obtained
    in this study and by Santos and Kaye (2009) compared with those obtained by Rodríguez-Pérez
    et al. (2007) using various vegetation indices (0.55 < R < 0.67), might be related
    to: (i) the use of a larger range of wavelengths rather than ratios of specific
    wavelengths; (ii) including regions known to be related to water content, and
    (iii) the collection of spectra at the leaf level instead of the canopy level.
    As suggested by Eitel et al. (2006), variations in leaf properties are influenced
    by factors other than plant water status and these factors complicate the development
    of a direct relationship between plant water status and spectral indices. Varietal
    differences in leaf structure, such as the presence or absence of a thick cuticle
    or waxes, might negatively influence the amount of light transmitted or reflected
    from the adaxial leaf surface, hampering the penetration of the NIR light through
    the leaf. These variations might explain the differences in performance of the
    NIR calibration statistics obtained for the analysed samples. Additionally, factors
    such as the closely packed palisade tissue in the adaxial surface, compared with
    the air-filled spongy tissue in the abaxial surface, might play a role in the
    amount of light transmitted or reflected, as reported by Woolley (1971) and Gausman
    and Allen (1973). Sinclair et al. (1971) asserted that the spectral response of
    leaves depends on their surface and internal chemical and structural characteristics.
    In this study, NIR calibration statistics from spectra collected using the abaxial
    surface of the Chardonnay leaves yielded better correlations with water potential
    compared with those collected on the adaxial surface. In particular, the collection
    of the NIR spectra in Shiraz samples from the abaxial surface might be one of
    the reasons why better calibrations were obtained for this variety in the glasshouse
    experiment compared with the results obtained in the field trial for the season
    2006–07. However, this could be the result of factors other than the leaf surface,
    considering that different instruments and wavelength ranges were used in the
    two experiments. Differences have been observed previously between adaxial and
    abaxial surfaces of leaves (Woolley 1971, Walter-Shea et al. 1991, Slaton et al.
    2001). The results from this study, in relation to the importance of leaf surface
    on the collection of the NIR spectra, have some practical implications in the
    way that canopy reflectance is used to predict plant water status in remote sensing
    studies. The PLS loading weights as a function of wavelength were examined to
    determine if particular NIR wavelengths tended to dominate the PLS calibrations
    obtained for Ψleaf and Ψstem on the two leaf surfaces (abaxial and adaxial). The
    similarities between the PLS loading weights for the calibrations obtained using
    the adaxial leaf surface suggested that wavelengths, in the region around 1400 nm,
    were important. In contrast, the differences between the loading weights for the
    two calibrations (Ψleaf and Ψstem) developed using the abaxial surface indicate
    a greater variability in reflectance when collecting spectra from this surface.
    Because these two calibrations yielded better R and SECV compared with those built
    using the adaxial surface, this may indicate that the spectra contain more information
    when collected from the abaxial surface, making them more suitable for the purpose
    of water potential calibrations. Interestingly, the calibration that gave highest
    R and SECV (Ψstem on the abaxial surface) also had the lowest absolute value of
    loading at 1400 nm relative to other wavelengths. This indicates that other wavelengths
    in the range 1100–1830 nm gave extra information that improved the calibrations
    relative to those that might be obtained from selection of only a few wavelengths
    known to be related to water. Choné et al. (2001) suggested that ψstem might be
    used, instead of ψleaf, for vine irrigation management. Given that ψstem is generally
    considered to be a more integrated and stable measure of plant water status compared
    with ψleaf, this might explain better NIR calibration statistics obtained for
    the measurement of ψstem. In most cases, there was greater variation in ψleaf
    than ψstem. Furthermore, there may be differences in tissue water potential for
    different positions of a leaf, perhaps because of patchiness in stomatal conductance
    (Downton et al. 1988). Water status measurements made on Chardonnay during this
    study showed that ψstem reflects more the imposed water stress treatments than
    ψleaf or g. These results are in agreement with those reported by other authors
    (Choné et al. 2001). These authors suggested that ψstem might be used, instead
    of ψleaf, for vine irrigation management. Given that ψstem is generally considered
    to be a more integrated and stable measure of plant water status compared with
    ψleaf, this might explain better NIR calibration statistics obtained for the measurement
    of ψstem. It was shown that there was greater variation in ψleaf than ψstem and
    furthermore, there may be differences in tissue water potential and water content
    for different positions of a leaf, perhaps because of patchiness in stomatal conductance
    (Downton et al. 1988). This variation appears to be the reason why a single measured
    spectrum per leaf (spot size 20 mm2) correlated less well with ψleaf than with
    ψstem. Taking the average of six spectra uniformly distributed over the lamina
    surface of a single leaf, resulted in equivalent correlations with ψleaf and ψstem
    (Table 4). However, Santos and Kaye (2009), found that repeated NIR scanning on
    the same leaf (15–20 spectra per leaf) may contribute to high levels of background
    noise in the spectra, requiring the use of the first derivative of the absorbance
    values to compute the best calibration. Precision irrigation can be achieved in
    grapevines using Ψstem as a measure of vine water status, because it responds
    quickly and accurately to (i) vine water restriction; (ii) soil water availability;
    (iii) soil hydraulic conductivity; and (iv) the capacity of the vine to transport
    water from the soil to the atmosphere (Choné et al. 2000, 2001). Because NIR can
    be used as a surrogate and non-destructive measure of Ψstem, this technique can
    be used to accurately control water deficits imposed on vines with the objective
    of obtaining better WUE and high quality grapes for wine production (Ojeda et al.
    2002, Coombe and Iland 2005, Pellegrino et al. 2005). NIR can be used as a physiological
    indicator for irrigation scheduling based on vine water demand, rather than relying
    on weather and/or soil moisture measurements, which do not consider the plant
    in the assessment. For irrigation scheduling purposes, NIR has the potential to
    be used within the same general guidelines for vineyard water management as for
    Ψstem, which are: above –1.0 MPa (non-stress), between –1.0 to –1.2 MPa (moderate
    water restriction) and from –1.2 to –1.5 MPa (severe water restrictions) (Lampinen
    et al. 2001, Trégoat et al. 2002, Williams and Araujo 2002, Ferreyra et al. 2003,
    Cifre et al. 2005, Sibille et al. 2007). However, these thresholds may vary depending
    on the yield and quality aims and the climatic conditions. From our irrigation
    trial on Chardonnay, it was evident that even at 50% of the normally applied irrigation
    the vines would not be classified as stressed according to the values indicated
    above. The link between Ψstem and berry quality attributes was shown by Trégoat
    et al. (2002), who found a strong correlation between this parameter and anthocyanins,
    phenols and malic acid content in berries. These authors also found good correlations
    between midday Ψstem and grape berry weight and yield. Conclusions This study
    showed that grapevine Ψleaf and Ψstem can be measured non-destructively using
    NIR spectroscopy using appropriate calibrations. Observed differences in the NIR
    spectra were related to the leaf surface in which the spectra were collected,
    and this had an effect on the accuracy of the calibration statistics for water
    potential. The global calibrations built using data obtained from glasshouse and
    field studies on two varieties are indicative that, in the future, a universal
    calibration, able to predict water potential for all varieties in different environments
    can be built. Further studies will be carried out in order to address the physiological
    implications of different leaf surfaces and morphology on the accuracy of NIR
    calibrations for water potential and in order to build a universal calibration
    able to predict field water potential for all varieties in all environments. Acknowledgements

    is a key determinant of plant photosynthesis and water relations, influencing
    plant survival, adaptation, and growth. Stomata sense the surrounding environment
    and respond rapidly to abiotic and biotic stresses. Stomatal conductance to water
    vapour (gs) and/or transpiration (E) are therefore valuable physiological parameters
    to be monitored in plant and agricultural sciences. However, leaf gas exchange
    measurements involve contact with leaves and often interfere with leaf functioning.
    Besides, they are time consuming and are limited by the sampling characteristics
    (e.g. sample size and/or the high number of samples required). Remote and rapid
    means to assess gs or E are thus particularly valuable for physiologists, agronomists,
    and ecologists. Transpiration influences the leaf energy balance and, consequently,
    leaf temperature (Tleaf). As a result, thermal imaging makes it possible to estimate
    or quantify gs and E. Thermal imaging has been successfully used in a wide range
    of conditions and with diverse plant species. The technique can be applied at
    different scales (e.g. from single seedlings/leaves through whole trees or field
    crops to regions), providing great potential to study plant–environment interactions
    and specific phenomena such as abnormal stomatal closure, genotypic variation
    in stress tolerance, and the impact of different management strategies on crop
    water status. Nevertheless, environmental variability (e.g. in light intensity,
    temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) affects the accuracy of thermal imaging
    measurements. This review presents and discusses the advantages of thermal imaging
    applications to plant science, agriculture, and ecology, as well as its limitations
    and possible approaches to minimize them, by highlighting examples from previous
    and ongoing research. Crop stress, genetic improvement, remote sensing, screening

    Plant–environment interactions and stomata The physical environment is often adverse
    to plant growth and survival as well as to crop yield and quality. Factors such
    as insufficient water or nutrients, high or low temperature, salinity, diseases,
    and insect damage are likely to restrict plant growth at some stage. The predicted
    global climate change will increase the incidence of extreme climate events (drought
    spells and heat waves) and related stress, leading to changes in plant biodiversity
    and reduced crop yields (Fedoroff et al., 2010). Increased sensitivity of crops
    to pests and diseases and the spread of novel pests and diseases are also likely
    to occur (Gregory et al., 2009). Plants interact with the surrounding environment
    namely through carbon, water- and energy-exchange processes, maintaining an equilibrium
    that permits them to grow and adapt to variable growing conditions. Stomatal regulation
    of leaf gas exchange (CO2 and H2O fluxes) in response to the environment plays
    a key role in this adaptation, allowing a compromise between photosynthetic gains
    and water loss as well as allowing regulation of canopy temperature (Tcanopy)
    (Jones, 1992; Chaves et al., 2003). Heat loss by plants occurs mainly via evaporative
    cooling, resulting from leaf transpiration (E) (Jones, 1992). Reduced transpiration
    under water deficits and high irradiance raises the risk of leaf temperature (Tleaf)
    increasing above the optimum for metabolic activity or above the threshold that
    leads to irreversible leaf tissue oxidative stress. The control of stomatal aperture
    results from coordinated alterations of guard cell turgor dependent on ionic fluxes,
    cytoskeleton changes, membrane transport, and gene expression. This regulation
    involves the concurrence of different signals in a complex and coordinated network,
    resulting in a tight and fast modulation of stomatal aperture in response to a
    fluctuating environment (Hetherington and Woodward, 2003). If we consider the
    linear relationship between stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) and E under
    a constant air vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and the non-linear relationship
    between gs and photosynthetic rate, decreased stomatal aperture under the first
    stages of stress development may improve intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi)
    with a positive impact on plant growth and adaptation to the environment. However,
    when stress becomes severe, a strong decline in carbon assimilation leads to decreased
    WUEi, with photosynthesis being restricted not only by stomatal closure but also
    by biochemical and photochemical limitations (Chaves et al., 2003). Regulation
    of water loss by an efficient control of the opening/closing of stomata also minimizes
    the risks of xylem embolism by reducing xylem cavitation, and by regulating water
    fluxes in the plant, indirectly influences water and nutrient uptake. Stomata
    also influence plant response to biotic stresses. In general, plants respond to
    surface-inoculated pathogens by reducing stomatal aperture as part of the innate
    immune response to restrict bacterial invasion (Melotto et al., 2008). Improved
    understanding of stomatal regulation of leaf gas exchange is needed to better
    predict and model key factors influencing crop growth and yield as well as ecosystem
    sustainability under increasing environmental stress. However, leaf gas exchange
    measurements involve contact with leaves and often interfere with leaf functioning.
    Besides, they are time consuming and can be limited by the reduced dimension of
    the leaf samples and/or the large number of measurements to be done. Therefore,
    faster, remote and non-invasive high-throughput analysis based on imaging are
    mandatory. Remote sensing and functional imaging for plant science Remote sensing
    of vegetation is a non-invasive methodology to monitor physical and physiological
    characteristics of plants and to evaluate the effects of environmental stresses
    on plant performance (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). Functional imaging permits observations
    at different scales (from single leaves/seedlings to entire branches/plants or
    trees or fields) and the assessment of dynamic and spatial variability of processes.
    The basis of nearly all remote sensing is electromagnetic radiation. Remote sensing
    involves the measurement of the amount of reflected and emitted radiation at different
    spectral wavelengths (e.g. ultraviolet, visible, infrared (IR), and microwave).
    It includes several imaging techniques such as visible imaging, near-IR and thermal
    IR imaging, chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging, and multispectral imaging and
    luminescence imaging (Chaerle and Van der Straeten, 2001; Baker and Rosenqvist,
    2004; Havaux et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2010; Jiménez-Bello et al., 2011; Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). Among those, thermal imaging (thermography) is one of the most
    used in agronomic and environmental sciences and also in the agri-food industry
    (Jones and Vaughan, 2010; Maes and Steppe, 2012). Remote sensing is the basis
    of precision agri-horticulture, which aims to use more efficiently the inputs
    (e.g. water, biocides, fertilizers), optimize yield, and minimize environmental
    impact (Lee et al., 2010). This is in line with the need to increase food production
    under increasingly unfavourable climate, scarcer natural resources (water, arable
    land) (Wilkinson and Hartung, 2009; Fedoroff et al., 2010), stricter environmental
    legislation, and increased consumer demands (Lubin and Esty, 2010). Remote sensing
    is also applied in phenomics, an innovative approach towards high-throughput plant
    phenotyping (Furbank and Tester, 2011), to aid breeding of more productive and
    stress-resistant cultivars. IR thermal imaging and stomatal conductance IR radiation
    and imaging Heat transfer by radiation occurs in the IR region of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, between 0.75 and 1000 μm (Kaplan, 2007). According to Planck’s radiation
    law, every object at a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin) emits electromagnetic
    radiation in the IR region of the spectrum. The amount of IR radiation emitted
    by an object depends on its emissivity (ε) and absolute temperature, in accordance
    with the Stefan–Boltzmann law (Equation 1): W = ε σ Ts4 (1) where W is spectral
    radiant excitance (total radiation emitted) (W m−2), ε is emissivity (dimensionless),
    σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (5.67×10−8 W m−2 K−4), and Ts is the surface
    temperature (K). The emissivity, at a particular wavelength, represents the amount
    of radiation emitted by a theoretical object as a fraction of the radiation emitted
    by a perfect emitter, named blackbody, with ε = 1. ‘Real-world’ objects (grey
    bodies) absorb a certain fraction of the incident radiation and reflect and transmit
    the remaining part, resulting in ε < 1. Plant material has high ε, varying between
    0.91 and 0.97. Soils have slightly lower ε (0.94–0.95) and sand can have ε as
    low as 0.89 (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). When determining the temperature of an
    object with thermal imaging, we must consider that the total radiation (W) detected
    by camera’s sensor is the sum of three major IR radiation streams: (1) the radiation
    leaving the object’s surface; (2) the radiation emitted by the object’s surroundings
    and further reflected by the object’s surface, commonly named background radiation
    (Wbackground) (both stream 1 and 2 are modified by transmission through the atmosphere);
    and (3) any radiation emitted by the atmosphere (Watm) (Equation 2). Therefore,
    the total radiation is given by: W = τ [εσ (Ts)4 + (1 – ε) Wbackground)] + Watm
    (2) where τ is atmospheric transmissivity (dimensionless), Wbackground is background
    radiation (W m−2), and Watm is the radiance emitted by the atmosphere (W m−2).
    The contribution of the atmosphere is relevant for airborne and satellite measurements
    (Jones and Vaughan, 2010) but it can be neglected for ground-based measurements
    and laboratory experiments and when IR radiation is sensed at appropriate wavelengths
    (e.g. 3–5 and 7–14 µm), in which the atmospheric transmission for IR radiation
    is close to a maximum (Kaplan, 2007). In this case the total radiation leaving
    the surface of the object is calculated as follows: W = εσ (Ts)4 + (1 – ε) Wbackground
    (3) To discard the effect of the Wbackground, it can be estimated by measuring
    the temperature of a crumpled sheet of aluminium foil (high reflectivity and ε
    = 0.03), placed in the same location as the target object and setting the camera
    with ε = 1 (Jones et al., 2002). Most thermal cameras will automatically provide
    Ts, once the ε and Wbackground have been input. Relationship between gs and Tleaf
    As thoroughly reviewed by Maes and Steppe (2012), leaf and plant temperature depends
    on the radiation and atmospheric conditions (time of day, clear or cloudy sky,
    air temperature, wind speed), soil conditions (soil type, soil water content,
    etc.), and canopy properties (morphology, density, height) that all together influence
    the size and ratios of the radiant, sensible and latent heat fluxes. The relationship
    between gs, the inverse of stomatal resistance (rs, leaf resistance to water vapour
    loss, assumed to be dominated by the stomatal resistance component), and Tleaf
    is summarized by the leaf energy balance equation (Jones, 1992, 1999) given by:
    Tleaf – Tair = [rHR (raw + rs) γRni − ρ cprHR VPD] ÷ [ρ cp {γ (raw + rs) + srHR}]
    (4) where Tleaf is leaf temperature (K), Tair is air temperature (K), rHR is parallel
    resistance to heat and radiative transfer (s m–1), raw is boundary layer resistance
    to water vapour (s m–1), γ is the psychrometric constant (Pa K–1), Rni is net
    isothermal radiation (the net radiation for a leaf at air temperature) (W m–2),
    ρ is density of the air (kg m–3), cp is specific heat capacity of air (J kg–1
    K–1), s is the slope of curve relating saturating water vapour pressure to temperature
    (Pa K–1), and VPD is air vapour pressure deficit (Pa). Fluctuating environmental
    conditions and thermal indices It is clear from Equation 4 that Tleaf depends
    not only on gs, but also on Tair, Rni, VPD, and wind speed (Jones, 1999). If comparing,
    for example, the impact of different management practices on crop physiology while
    the weather is stable, Tleaf alone can provide the required information about
    relative stress in the different treatments. If the aim is to determine the development
    of stress in a crop over time, on the other hand, it is necessary to normalize
    Tleaf in relation to references to account for changing meteorology (Jones et
    al., 2009). A wide range of different types of stress index have been used to
    address this issue. Here an overview is provided to allow the reader to determine
    what technique might suit a particular experiment. For more detailed assessment
    of the pros and cons of each, including analysis of the impact of such factors
    as leaf size and albedo, Tair and VPD, and Rni, see Maes and Steppe (2012). That
    Tleaf increases as a result of stress was first exploited by Jackson et al. (1977),
    who developed the stress degree day to detect stress by using thermometers in
    field conditions. The stress degree day is the accumulated difference in temperature
    between the leaf (or crop canopy) and the air along a certain period. According
    to this index, if Tcanopy is lower than Tair, then plants are assumed to be well
    watered. If Tcanopy is greater than the Tair, then plants are assumed to be drought
    stressed. While this index represents an improvement over the use of Tcanopy alone,
    since it allows for fluctuating Tair, it does not take into account changes in
    VPD, solar radiation, or wind speed. Based on energy balance considerations, Jackson
    et al. (1981) appreciated that the canopy to air temperature difference (Tcanopy
    – Tair) depends on VPD: under non-limiting soil water conditions, a crop transpires
    at the potential rate (i.e. evapotranspiration is the maximum it can be, but maximum
    evapotranspiration increases with increasing VPD). Thus for several crops, when
    water availability is not limiting and when measured under clear sky conditions,
    there is a linear relationship between Tcanopy – Tair and VPD. Jackson et al.
    (1981) called this linear relationship the theoretical non-water-stressed baseline.
    For a given crop, at a given VPD, this theoretical baseline provides the minimum
    possible value of Tcanopy – Tair. The Tcanopy – Tair for a non-transpiring crop
    is insensitive to VPD, and can be estimated if wind speed and net solar radiation
    are known. This sets the ‘upper limit’ to Tcanopy – Tair. Jackson et al. (1981)
    used the idea of ‘upper and lower’ baselines, to create a crop water stress index
    (CWSI): (5) where Tcanopy – Tair is the measured difference in temperature, (Tcanopy
    – Tair)nwsb is the estimated difference at the same VPD under non-limiting soil
    water conditions (non-water-stressed baseline), and (Tcanopy – Tair)ul is the
    non-transpiring upper limit. This CWSI allows to relate crop’s temperature to
    the maximum and minimum values possible under similar environmental conditions.
    The higher the CWSI, the greater the crop stress is assumed to be. Yuan et al.
    (2004) and Testi et al. (2008) for example, found CWSI to be inversely correlated
    with leaf water potential. A disadvantage of the above form of CWSI is the need
    to determine the non-water-stressed baseline by plotting Tcanopy − Tair against
    VPD. This requires substantial time to be spent determining the baseline for a
    well-watered crop, and the VPD needs to be known when measuring Tcanopy of the
    crop of interest. Also, this index does not account for changes in Tcanopy due
    to irradiance and wind speed, and the non-water-stressed baseline is not necessarily
    the same under different radiation conditions. Finally, the non-transpiring upper
    limit also varies, with a wide range of values being reported (Ben-Gal et al.,
    2009). Use of artificial references An alternative approach is to replace the
    non-water-stressed baseline and the non-transpiring upper limit, respectively,
    with the Tleaf or Tcanopy from which there is maximum transpiration and the Tleaf
    and Tcanopy from which there is no transpiration, measured in the same environment
    and at the same time as the crop of interest. The fact that these ‘references’
    are in the same environment as Tcanopy means that there is no need for theoretical
    estimations of baselines, as they will be exposed to the same VPD, Rni, and wind
    speed as the canopy of interest. The temperatures of the references are referred
    to as Twet and Tdry, respectively. Jones (1999) adapted the crop water stress
    index to include these reference temperatures, giving the following form: (6)
    This version of CWSI (referred to as CWSId in the review by Maes and Steppe, 2012)
    has been shown to inversely correlate with leaf water potential (e.g. Cohen et
    al., 2005; Grant et al., 2007). To ensure that there are suitable references in
    each thermal image, leaves can be sprayed with water (Twet) and covered in Vaseline
    to artificially close stomata (Tdry) (Fig. 1A–C). Other approaches include the
    use of wet and dry filter paper (Jones et al., 2002; Loveys et al., 2008), wet
    and dry cotton (Fig. 1D, E), and wet and dry tensiometers (Fig. 1F, G). Metal
    artificial leaves can be used as well (Fig. 1H, I). To prevent the wet reference
    from drying out, sometimes a reservoir of water is provided, with material acting
    as a wick (Alchanatis et al., 2010). Fig. 1. Open in new tabDownload slide Different
    approaches to providing wet and dry reference surfaces to estimate Twet and Tdry.

    An alternative index, based on a rearrangement of the energy balance equation,
    is thermal index of relative stomatal conductance (IG) (Jones, 1999): (7) For
    most values of gs, IG is linearly proportional to gs, as has now been demonstrated
    under a wide range of conditions (as reviewed by Maes and Steppe, 2012). This
    index uses the same references as the second form of CWSI (Equation 6), but gives
    low values in stressed crops and higher values with increasing gs. As the inclusion
    of wet and dry reference surfaces in every image can sometimes be logistically
    difficult, an alternative to the above indices is to use an actual non-water-stressed
    plant/crop and a stressed plant/crop as extremes and relate the temperature of
    the crop of interest to these (Grant et al., 2007). This is appropriate for example
    where the crop of interest is deficit irrigated and hence expected to have a Tcanopy
    intermediate between those extremes. Since the reference crops, however, cannot
    usually be included in every image, there is the problem that meteorological conditions
    can change between imaging the reference crop and the crop of interest. Grant
    et al. (2007) therefore interpolated the temperatures of the reference crops between
    a series of images to estimate their temperature at the precise time at which
    the crops of interest were imaged. Separating canopy from soil temperature The
    above indices are appropriate where only leaves are being analysed (i.e. either
    the crop completely covers the soil, or only leaves are selected to acquire Tcanopy).
    An alternative index called the water deficit index (WDI) was developed for applications
    where soil and crop temperatures could not be separated (Moran, 1994). This index
    uses the difference between the temperature of the surface (which includes vegetation
    and bare soil) and the temperature of the air – (Ts – Tair) – along with an index
    of vegetation cover. At 100% vegetation cover, the values of WDI will fall within
    the same limits of the CWSI. For more details on the estimation and the pros and
    cons of the WDI, see Maes and Steppe (2012). Alternatives to the stress indices
    An alternative to the use of stress indices is to estimate gs (Leinonen et al.,
    2006; Guilioni et al., 2008) from Tleaf. This requires that Tair and VPD, net
    radiation, and wind speed are measured at the same time as Tleaf. Berni et al.
    (2009) used this approach to estimate canopy conductance of olive trees under
    different irrigation regimes, with Tleaf being derived from an image obtained
    from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). They also estimated CWSI using meteorological
    data rather than references to obtain Twet and Tdry, and found that the estimated
    CWSI was strongly inversely correlated with leaf water potential. Ben-Gal et al.
    (2009) compared estimation of CWSI using meteorological data with estimation using
    Tdry = Tair + 5°C (which is rather arbitrary) and Twet being the temperature of
    a wet cloth. The two methods gave similar results, and the authors suggest using
    meteorological data is preferable, to avoid the need of a wet reference in every
    image. This approach, however, does mean that the reference temperatures are not
    obtained at the same environmental conditions as Tleaf, since a full set of meteorological
    data cannot be collected at each plant of interest. A compromise is to use one
    reference: if Tdry is measured, then the need to measure net radiation is removed
    – an approach that gave consistent results in both field (Leinonen et al., 2006)
    and greenhouse (Grant et al., 2012) conditions. If Twet is also measured, Tair
    and the boundary layer resistance are the only additional information required
    to estimate gs. Some authors have empirically determined the relationship between
    CWSI and leaf water potential, or between Tcanopy and stem water potential or
    gs, and then used this relationship to map variation in water potential or gs
    (Cohen et al., 2005; Alchanatis et al., 2010; Baluja et al., 2012). The step of
    determining the empirical relationship for a subsample is not necessary because
    gs can be mapped from Tleaf based simply on Equation 4. A different approach is
    to focus on variability of temperature, rather than absolute temperature. Given
    the large influence of gs on the energy budget of a canopy, a greater range of
    temperatures will be found in a canopy as stomata close, due to the relatively
    greater influence of variation in leaf exposure as compared to a non-stressed,
    fully transpiring canopy (Fuchs, 1990). This, however, will not apply to canopies
    with a non-random distribution of leaf exposure (Grant et al., 2007). There has
    been little experimental assessment of this approach with canopies that do show
    a random distribution of leaf angle and orientation, with the exception of a study
    by Bryant and Moran (1999), which showed that crop temperatures deviate from a
    normal distribution as plant water stress increases. González-Dugo et al. (2006)
    considered that variation in temperature in a crop will increase with stress not
    because of increased variation in leaf exposure when transpiration is low, but
    because variability in rooting depth or soil structure, for example, will increase
    as soil dries. They therefore compared the standard deviation of Tcanopy to that
    of CWSI and found that the standard deviation of Tcanopy correlates with CWSI
    for moderate but not for severe water stress. Thermal imaging: applications in
    plant and agricultural sciences Forward genetics screens and characterization
    of mutants and transgenics Forward genetics and selection of stomatal mutants
    has been providing new biological tools to study and better understand the genetic,
    physical, and physiological basis of stomatal responses to environment (Papdi
    et al., 2009; Dodd, 2013). Forward genetics involves induction of artificial genetic
    variation by chemical, physical, or biological mutagenesis and the screening of
    mutants for a certain phenotype of interest (Papdi et al., 2009). Mutants identified
    in novel screens are useful to identify signalling pathway components and potential
    genes that can be used to improve plant performance under stress (e.g. drought)
    (Plessis et al., 2011). The use of thermal imaging in forward genetics and related
    large-scale screens and mutant characterization is rather recent (Merlot et al.,
    2002) and accompanied rapid developments in plant molecular physiology and functional
    genomics. In the context of studies on stomatal regulation, the aim of forward
    genetics is to dissect different signalling pathways (e.g. abscisic acid) at the
    genetic level involved in regulation of guard cell response to internal and environmental
    signals. With thermal imaging it is possible to screen several thousands of young
    seedlings and isolate those presenting a temperature difference relative to the
    respective wild type, as a result of different stomatal regulation (example in
    Fig. 2A). The model species Arabidopsis thaliana has been used to identify and
    characterize molecular regulators of transpiration using forward genetics (Nilson
    and Assmann, 2007). Mutants with abnormal stomatal response to drought (Merlot
    et al., 2002; Plessis et al., 2011), light (Merlot et al., 2007), air CO2 concentration
    (Hashimoto et al., 2006), air VPD (Xie et al., 2006) and ozone (Saji et al., 2008)
    have been isolated to date. Genetic characterization of these mutants led to the
    identification of new genes encoding proteins such as an abscisic acid-activated
    protein kinase (Merlot et al., 2002) and a plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Merlot et
    al., 2007), as well as other key mediators involved in signalling networks regulating
    stomatal aperture/closure in response to the environment (Papdi et al., 2009;
    Sirichandra et al., 2009). For example, Merlot et al. (2002) isolated mutations
    at two novel loci designated as OST1 (OPEN STOMATA 1, At4g33950) and OST2. ost1
    and ost2 were the first mutations altering abscisic acid responsiveness in stomata
    and not in seeds (Merlot et al., 2002). More recently, Negi et al. (2008) isolated
    another Arabidopsis gene, SLAC1 (SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1, At1g12480),
    encoding the S-type anion channel, which was shown to mediate sensitivity of stomata
    to CO2. SLAC1 was found essential for stomatal closure in response to CO2, and
    SLAC1-deficient mutants showed constitutively higher gs as result of larger stomatal
    aperture. Fig. 2. Open in new tabDownload slide Examples of thermal imaging in
    forward genetics and plant phenotyping. A: Visible (upper) and false-coloured
    thermal (lower) images at two growth stages (young seedlings and mature stage),
    for wild type (WT, ecotype Columbia) (left) and mutant ost2 (Merlot et al., 2007)
    (right) Arabidopsis thaliana after plants were dark adapted. The WT close their
    stomata in the dark whereas the ost2 plants do not. Therefore, the WT show higher
    leaf temperatures than mutants. (B) Visible and false coloured IR images of 4-week-old
    rice plants subjected to drought and overexpressing (right) and silencing (left)
    a bHLH transcription factor (Chander S, Almeida D, Serra T, Barros P, Costa JM,
    Santos T, Oliveira MM, Saibo N, unpublished, with permission). In rice, thermography
    helped to isolate and characterize SLAC1-deficient mutants with a constitutive
    low Tleaf phenotype and consequently higher gs (Kusumi et al., 2012). These mutants
    had higher photosynthetic rates than the wild type, which could improve growth
    and yield. Transgenic lines of rice overexpressing a transcription factor (bHLH
    family) were characterized for their response to drought stress. The overexpressing
    line showed lower Tleaf (and consequently higher gs) than the silencing line (Chander
    et al., unpublished) (Fig. 2B). Thermal imaging is also useful to support preliminary
    physiological characterization of novel mutants with abnormal leaf growth (small
    and curled leaves), which limit leaf gas exchange measurements. Characterization
    of ESK1, which results in reduced growth and deficient vascular water transport,
    was based on measurements of Tleaf in detached leaves (Lefebvre et al., 2011).
    Stress detection and management Water stress monitoring and irrigation management
    Given the relationship between Tleaf and crop stress, the potential of thermal
    imaging to monitor crop water status is clear. In fact, thermal imaging can show
    differences between irrigated and non-irrigated plants and between different intensities
    of irrigation (Cohen et al., 2005; Grant et al., 2007; Möller et al., 2007; Berni
    et al., 2009; Padhi et al., 2012; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). In some cases, a
    single thermal image is sufficient to reveal spatial variation in plant water
    status. On a larger scale, aerial thermal imaging is used to detect variation
    in crop water status at a single point in time. In this case, resolution is critical:
    Berni et al. (2009) were able to determine the temperature of individual trees
    from a thermal image taken from an UAV, providing a resolution of 40cm; this was
    not possible when thermal images were taken from a higher-flying aeroplane that
    provided a resolution of only 2 m. The greatest temperature differences between
    stressed and non-stressed canopies are found in hot, dry environments. There are
    limitations concerning measurements in more humid areas with low leaf-to-air vapour
    pressure differences (Thomson et al., 2012). Nevertheless, detectable differences
    were measured under relatively humid, cool, and low radiation conditions, as noted
    by Maes and Steppe (2012). The capacity of thermal imaging to detect variation
    in crop water status depends on the plant’s stomatal response. In species with
    more marked anisohydric behaviour (e.g. sunflower, wheat, soybean, almond tree),
    leaf water potential falls with increasing evaporative demand (Tardieu and Simonneau,
    1998), due to poor stomatal control over tissue water loss. For this reason, in
    these species leaf water potential is a better indicator of soil moisture than
    gs. Isohydric species (e.g. maize, lupin, pea, poplar), on the other hand, close
    their stomata in response to a decrease in soil water and/or an increase in VPD,
    controlling plant water potential. Under such conditions, gs is a better indicator
    of soil moisture than water potential. Therefore, drought detection using thermal
    imaging is more suited to species or varieties exhibiting isohydric behaviour
    (Jones et al., 2009). A logical step forward for the use of this methodology is
    to use thermal imaging to decide where, when, and how much to irrigate. This,
    however, requires that a threshold for crop temperature, a stress index, or a
    value of gs is established beforehand. Irrigation would be applied when this threshold
    is reached. Threshold values may vary according to the environment and species
    or variety/cultivar (Cohen et al., 2005; Möller et al., 2007; Costa et al., 2012;
    Fuentes et al., 2012). Further progress is still required before thermal imaging
    is routinely used for irrigation scheduling. There is the need for monitoring
    crops over the whole season and ultimately compare thermography with other scheduling
    methods. Where the costs involved in frequent thermal imaging are prohibitive,
    infrequent thermal imaging (e.g. aerial or satellite) that will provide information
    on spatial variation may be combined with frequent (or continuous) alternative
    means of monitoring water stress. The latter would provide poor spatial resolution,
    but high temporal resolution. For example, a single aerial or satellite image
    may be sufficient to pinpoint areas of a crop with different water demands, and
    representative plants within each zone could then be continuously monitored (e.g.
    by measuring stem diameter fluctuations or sap flow) in order to schedule irrigation
    over a season. Garciá-Tejero et al. (2011) suggested that the combined monitoring
    of maximum daily trunk shrinkage (to obtain information regarding individual plants)
    and Tcanopy – Tair (to obtain information regarding plots) would help to determine
    irrigation requirements in orchards with spatial variation in plant water status.
    Aerial and ground thermal imaging can also support detection of malfunctioning
    (e.g. leaks) of irrigation canals and delivery systems, which result in large
    water losses (Thomson et al., 2012). Crop protection Pests and diseases limit
    the genetic potential of crops regarding their growth and yield. Pests and diseases
    can change the amount and direction of radiation reflected and emitted by plants
    (Jackson, 1986) or can modify plant temperature due to stomatal deregulation and/or
    changes in plant water relations (Nilsson, 1995; Allègre et al., 2007). Thermal
    imaging can thus be used to monitor infection patterns of diseases or infestation
    by pests, which assume typical patchy distributions (Mahlein et al., 2012), or
    even to detect the stress before symptoms are visible (Jackson, 1986; Nilsson,
    1995; Oerke et al., 2006; Stoll et al., 2008; Chaerle et al., 2009). Increase
    in plant temperature can co-occur with senescence due to biotic stress, resulting
    from modified plant–water relationships due to the interruption of normal function
    of the root system or/and blockage of water and nutrient transport in the stem
    or leaves (Nilsson, 1995). Foliar pathogens can disrupt cuticular and/or stomatal
    regulation of transpiration and influence plant water relations and WUEi (Grimmer
    et al., 2012). Thermal imaging also supports studies of the action of herbivorous
    insects: for example, transpirational water loss in soybean (Glycine max) leaflets
    occurred mostly from injuries on cuticle and cut edges of the attacked leaves
    (Aldea et al., 2005). Combined thermal imaging and gas exchange studies under
    laboratory conditions showed that the accumulation of salicylic acid (a hormone
    produced in plant defence against infections) in response to tobacco mosaic virus
    infection in tobacco leaves was paralleled by stomatal closure: Tleaf increased
    after virus inoculation prior to cell death (Chaerle et al., 1999). However, if
    the infection has only a minor effect on transpiration, detection using thermography
    may not be possible, particularly in field conditions. Moreover, combination of
    stresses can also pose limitations when monitoring infection with thermal imaging.
    For example, in grapevine, the maximum temperature difference between infected
    and non-infected areas reached 0.9 °C in irrigated plots, but only 0.3 °C for
    non-irrigated plots (Stoll et al., 2008). Although there are limitations in the
    identification of the causal agent of biotic stress (disease, pest) (Jackson,
    1986), thermal imaging can be used in field conditions to localize spots where
    the crop is more affected and demanding more urgent intervention (Sankaran et
    al., 2010). Other stresses Shimshi (1967) observed that, under conditions favouring
    stomatal opening (non-limiting soil moisture content) nitrogen and iron deficiency
    would induce stomatal closure in different crop species (e.g. beans, wheat, sugar
    beets, maize, groundnuts). Under controlled conditions, Chaerle et al. (2007)
    using thermal imaging showed that bean plants growing on magnesium deficient solution
    had a higher temperature (by about 0.5 °C) compared to control plants. Preliminary
    thermal imaging of spring barley also indicated higher canopy temperature in crops
    that did not receive any nitrogen fertilizer compared to those that were well
    fertilized (165kg N ha−1; Fig. 3). This suggests stomatal closure in the nutrient-starved
    crops. On the contrary, wheat plants growing under higher nitrogen conditions
    for two consecutive years exhibited lower Tcanopy (Tilling et al. 2007). In field
    measurements, combining thermal and spectral properties of canopies may help to
    identify more precisely nutrient deficiency and distinguish between water and
    nutrient stress (Christensen et al., 2005). Fig. 3. Open in new tabDownload slide
    Spring barley crops subjected to a high nitrogen fertilizer input (165kg N ha−1;
    left) and no nitrogen fertilizer (right), and imaged with an IR Snapshot 525 (Infrared
    Solutions, Minneapolis, USA) 120×120 pixel line scan imager, 8–12 μm (top) and
    a digital camera (bottom) from a ladder, showing higher crop temperature in the
    nitrogen-deprived crop. In Trifolium subterraneum, ozone exposure resulted in
    higher Tleaf in long-day plants as compared to short-day plants, suggesting that
    ozone reduces E in long-day plants (Vollsnes et al., 2009). Energy released during
    freezing results in an increase of temperature, which can be recorded by thermal
    imaging (Wisniewski et al., 2008), with the advantage over contact thermometry
    of detecting the actual site of ice initiation and the number of ice nucleation
    events. The technique has been applied to study frost resistance in woody plants
    (Pramsohler et al., 2012). Crop phenotyping and breeding The ultimate goal of
    phenotyping in plant breeding is to quantify and rank the success of a range of
    genotypes in certain environments (Walter et al., 2012). It involves comparison
    of large numbers of genotypes, which requires fast and robust measurement procedures,
    with a high degree of automation (Roy et al., 2011; Walter et al., 2012). Novel
    crop genotypes are often characterized on the basis of leaf gas exchange traits
    (e.g. photosynthetic assimilation, gs, WUEi). Thermal imaging emerged as a faster
    method to carry out high-throughput field phenotyping compared to point measurements
    of Tleaf, porometry, or leaf gas exchange (Furbank and Tester, 2011; Walter et
    al., 2012). Besides, it allows phenotyping of different sized plants (small seedlings
    to entire plants/canopies) in controlled or field conditions (Jones et al., 2009;
    Walter et al., 2012). Genotypes of different crops have been characterized in
    their response to different environmental stresses using thermal imaging (Munns
    et al., 2010; Walter et al., 2012). High-yielding rice cultivars have been selected
    on the basis of their lower Tleaf and higher canopy diffusive conductance to water
    vapour (Jones et al., 2009; Berger et al., 2010), and several quantitative trait
    loci for Tleaf differences have been mapped in relation to stomatal behaviour
    traits (Pelleschi et al., 2006). In maize, lower Tleaf was positively correlated
    with biomass accumulation under water stress, supporting the use of thermal imaging
    in breeding and selection of drought tolerant maize genotypes (Liu et al., 2011).
    The low Tcanopy of resistant lines observed under drought stress is an indicator
    of plant water status and of drought-avoidance mechanisms and may be related to
    deep root growth that allow plants to continue water uptake and transpiration
    that cools the leaves (Jones et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2011). In strawberry,
    thermal imaging indicated that some cultivars display low gs whereas others show
    high gs under similar well-watered conditions (Grant et al., 2012). In grapevine,
    thermal imaging can also be used in breeding programmes for WUEi since both gs
    and photosynthetic assimilation are genetically dependent traits in this species
    (Flexas et al., 2010). Recently, Costa et al. (2012) observed different Tleaf
    and gs phenotypes between grapevine varieties with similar water status, suggesting
    different types of stomatal regulation. High-resolution thermal imaging can also
    help to characterize morphology and plant architecture traits that are important
    for selecting superior varieties for different environmental conditions (Chéné
    et al., 2012). Ecological studies and environmental monitoring Remote sensing
    has been used by ecologists and conservation biologists in larger scale studies
    to better understand environmental changes and their consequences in plant ecosystems
    (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). Thermal remote sensing allows monitoring of physiological
    activity of vegetation (Jacob et al., 2008), and satellite thermal sensing has
    been used to support modelling of regional fluxes of water and mapping of evapotranspiration
    and moisture availability (Anderson et al., 2008; Chávez et al., 2008; Sobrino
    et al., 2009), as well as in monitoring drought and water use, administering irrigation
    projects, predicting local and regional water demand, and supporting hydrological
    and weather forecast models (Anderson and Kustas, 2008). Scherrer and Körner (2010)
    have used thermal imaging to monitor alpine landscapes over time with very high
    spatial resolution. They quantified variation between microhabitats by the deviation
    of vegetation surface temperature from Tair. This is an advance compared to previous
    approaches based on conventional climate station data that only enabled monitoring
    of individual plants or soil plots. More recently, Scherrer and Körner (2011)
    used high-resolution IR thermal imaging to assess the spatial and temporal variation
    of plant surface and ground temperatures for hundreds of plots distributed across
    three alpine slopes of contrasting exposure. The results emphasize the need to
    take microhabitat temperature variation into account when predicting climate change
    impacts on vegetation: meter-scale thermal contrasts were far greater than the
    average increase in temperature predicted for the next 100 years. Scherrer et
    al. (2011) established a drought-sensitivity ranking of deciduous tree species
    based on thermal imaging and found that in drier sites and at higher temperatures
    some species could be less competitive than others. Pronounced drought might change
    the competitive abilities of tree species in favour of those that are able to
    maintain transpirational fluxes and cooler canopies, such as Fraxinus excelsior
    and Quercus petraea. Complementary ground thermal imaging at key locations could
    enhance the usefulness of satellite sensing (Qiu and Zhao, 2010), namely in ecology
    (Kerr and Ostrovsky, 2003), by providing the fine local resolution that satellite
    imaging cannot. Other applications in agro-food industries Thermal imaging can
    be used to monitor quality of horticultural products, namely seed viability (Kranner
    et al., 2010), health of transplants (Kim and Lee, 2004), and graft union quality
    (Torii et al., 1992). In orchards and groves, thermal imaging can help to assess
    fruit number (Bulanon et al., 2008). Additionally, thermal imaging of fruits under
    field conditions could assist in understanding the impact of extreme temperatures
    on fruit quality, namely on the incidence/resistance to sunscald (yellowing/browning
    of a fruit’s skin and softened flesh from exposure to high temperatures) (Prohens
    et al., 2004). Thermal imaging can also support optimized climate control in greenhouse
    horticulture. Greenhouse climate control could be based on continuous measurements
    of Tleaf instead of Tair because Tleaf is more closely linked to plant performance
    (Ehret et al., 2001). Future prospects As advances in detector technology and
    progress in image processing increase the diagnostic power of thermal imaging,
    the main challenge may shift from such technical aspects to the optimization of
    data collection. Physiologically, there is still a need to establish leaf/canopy
    thresholds (thresholds of relevant thermal indexes) for different biotic or abiotic
    stress effects and for different species and varieties. Studies that deal with
    a longer time scale are required as well, rather than mere correlations between
    temperature variables and standard indicators of stress based on measurements
    on single dates. Technologically, future developments will include the combination
    of thermal imaging with imaging in other spectral wavelengths (visible and red/infrared
    reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence) (Bulanon et al., 2008; Jiménez-Bello et
    al., 2011). The use of UAVs for civil applications opened up a new era of remote
    sensing, aiding assessment of plant–environment interactions at a larger scale
    (e.g. crop fields and forest plots) (Berni et al., 2009), although there exists
    legal restrictions in its use in many countries. Coupling of ground and airborne
    measurements must be improved, in order to increase the accuracy of retrieved
    data. Thermal imaging in parallel with wireless sensor networks and geographical
    information systems will allow a more precise mapping and monitoring of, for example,
    irrigation and fertilizer requirements (Lee et al., 2010). Coupling of thermal
    imaging with modelling approaches is expected (Maes and Steppe, 2012), which should
    be supported by improved software tools to optimize automation and speed up robust
    image analysis (Fuentes et al., 2012). With respect to routine application in
    the land-based industry sector, as opposed to scientific research, enhanced benefits
    will arise from reduction in costs of thermal imaging devices that will permit
    extending the use of the technique in agronomy to a wider range of crops and situations
    than only the most advanced and intensive agricultural/horticultural systems.

  title: Thermography to explore plant–environment interactions
  verbatim_quote1: Remote sensing and functional imaging for plant scienceRemote sensing
    of vegetation is a non-invasive methodology to monitor physical and physiological
    characteristics of plants and to evaluate the effects of environmental stresses
    on plant performance (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). Functional imaging permits observations
    at different scales (from single leaves/seedlings to entire branches/plants or
    trees or fields) and the assessment of dynamic and spatial variability of processes.
  verbatim_quote2: Heat loss by plants occurs mainly via evaporative cooling, resulting
    from leaf transpiration (E) (Jones, 1992). Reduced transpiration under water deficits
    and high irradiance raises the risk of leaf temperature (Tleaf) increasing above
    the optimum for metabolic activity or above the threshold that leads to irreversible
    leaf tissue oxidative stress.
  verbatim_quote3: An alternative to the use of stress indices is to estimate gs (Leinonen
    et al., 2006; Guilioni et al., 2008) from Tleaf. This requires that Tair and VPD,
    net radiation, and wind speed are measured at the same time as Tleaf.

  analysis: Improvements in irrigation infrastructure through modernisation and automation
    have led to water savings. The concept of real-time control and optimisation in
    irrigation is in its developmental stages but has already demonstrated potential
    for water savings. The future is likely to see increased use of remote sensing
    techniques as well as wireless communication systems and more versatile sensors
    to improve WUE.

    \ the increase, and the irrigation industry in Australia\nis looking to a future\
    \ with less water. Irrigation consumes the bulk of the water extracted from\n\
    various sources, and hence the efﬁciency of its use is of outmost importance.\
    \ This paper reviewed\nthe advancements made towards improving irrigation water\
    \ use efﬁciency (WUE), with a focus on\nirrigation in Australia but with some\
    \ examples from other countries. The challenges encountered, as\nwell as the opportunities\
    \ available, are also discussed. The review showed that improvements\nin irrigation\
    \ infrastructure through modernisation and automation have led to water savings.\n\
    The concept of real-time control and optimisation in irrigation is in its developmental\

    \ water saved as a result of using efﬁcient technologies ends up being reused\n\
    to expand the area of land under irrigation, sometimes resulting in a net increase\
    \ in the total water\nconsumption at the basin scale. Hence, to achieve net water\
    \ savings, water-efﬁcient technologies and\npractices need to be used in combination\
    \ with other measures such as incentives for conservation\nand appropriate regulations\

    Irrigation is an essential agricultural practice for food, pasture and ﬁbre production\
    \ in semiarid\nand arid areas. In many countries including Australia, efﬁcient\
    \ water use and management are today’s\nmajor concerns. The bulk of the irrigation\
    \ water is sourced from rivers and dams and conveyed\nvia open channels or pipelines\
    \ to irrigated farms for storage before use or direct application to root\nzones.\
    \ Irrigators who use groundwater often have storage tanks on their properties.\
    \ At the farm\nlevel, irrigation systems or methods commonly in use may be broadly\
    \ classiﬁed as sprinkler, surface,\nand drip or trickle systems. In sprinkler\
    \ systems (e.g., solid sets, centre pivots and travelling irrigators),\nwater\
    \ is delivered in form of sprays using overhead sprinklers. In drip or trickle\
    \ systems, water is\ndelivered in small amounts via small nozzles installed in\
    \ pipes or tapes, which can either be above the\nWater 2018, 10, 1771; doi:10.3390/w10121771\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n2 of 17\nground or underground.\
    \ The sprinkler and drip/trickle systems are also referred to as pressurised\n\
    systems, as they operate under low pressure which often involves some form of\
    \ pumping. In surface\nsystems (e.g., furrow and basin/border), water is conveyed\
    \ over the ﬁeld surface by the gravitational\nforce. The furrow system is the\
    \ most common method for the irrigation of row crops in Australia and\nin the\
    \ world.\nGlobally, it is estimated that about 70% of fresh water abstracted is\
    \ used to irrigate 25% of the\nworld’s croplands (399 million ha) which supply\
    \ 45% of global food [1]. Water used for industrial and\ndomestic purposes account\
    \ for approximately 20% and 10% of the total global water usage, respectively.\n\
    In Australia, for instance, in the year 2016–2017, 9.1 million mega litres were\
    \ used to irrigate 2.2 million\nha [2]. The demand for fresh water resources is\
    \ on the increase, and the trend is likely to continue with\nthe increasing population\
    \ that comes with increased demand for food and ﬁbre, and the predicted\nnegative\
    \ impacts of climate change. There is also increased awareness of the need to\
    \ provide sufﬁcient\nwater to serve other ecological services. There appears to\
    \ be consensus that irrigated agriculture in\ngeneral is up against a future with\
    \ less water.\nThis, therefore, calls for increased effectiveness in the utilisation\
    \ of the scarce water resources,\na concept that is technically called water use\
    \ efﬁciency (WUE) or simply irrigation efﬁciency. From an\nengineering standpoint,\
    \ WUE is often deﬁned using a volumetric or hydrological approach, simply as\n\
    the proportion of the water supplied through irrigation that is productively or\
    \ beneﬁcially used by\nthe plant (Equations (1) and (2)). This deﬁnition is predominantly\
    \ used when referring to ﬁeld-scale\nirrigation water management. However, it\
    \ should be noted that WUE may also be assessed at the\ncatchment or basin scale\
    \ [3].\nThe two most commonly used efﬁciency measures of an irrigation system\
    \ are (i) application\nefﬁciency (AE) and (ii) requirement efﬁciency (RE), which\
    \ can be written as:\nAE = volume of water stored in the root zone\ntotal volume\
    \ of water applied\n(1)\nRE = volume of water stored in the root zone\nwater deﬁcit\
    \ prior to irrigation\n(2)\nThe efﬁciency performance measures, AE and RE, are\
    \ only applicable at the ﬁeld scale. However,\nlosses of water also occur in conveyance\
    \ and distribution channels prior to delivery to the ﬁeld. If the\nwater is stored\
    \ in dams prior to usage, then further losses may occur as a result of evaporation\n\
    and seepage.\nPerformance measures used in these cases include conveyance, distribution\
    \ and\nstorage efﬁciencies.\nOn the other hand, the efﬁciency of irrigation water\
    \ use may also be seen in a plant physiological\nsense, and in particular as a\
    \ comparison of the yield or economic return of an irrigated crop or pasture\n\
    to the total amount of water transpired by the crop or pasture. In fact, in recent\
    \ literature (e.g., [4]),\nthis is commonly referred to as irrigation water productivity\
    \ and not WUE. In the cotton industry\nin Australia, this is sometimes referred\
    \ to as irrigation water use index (IWUI) and relates cotton\nproduction only\
    \ to the amount of irrigation water used [5].\nIn Australia, surface irrigation\
    \ is the main irrigation method used, and in 2013–2014, it accounted\nfor 59%\
    \ of the total irrigated land [2]. However, the system in general is associated\
    \ with high labour\nrequirement and low WUE. This explains why modernisation and\
    \ automation projects (discussed later\nin this paper) have tended to focus on\
    \ this irrigation system. Conversely, the pressurised irrigation\nmethods (sprinkler\
    \ and drip) are generally less labour-intensive and have signiﬁcantly higher WUE.\n\
    With the advancement of technology, thanks largely to the many years of investment\
    \ and research\nand development in agriculture, there are new and emerging opportunities\
    \ for further improving the\nWUE in irrigated agriculture. Examples of these include\
    \ use of remotely sensed data (from drones or\nsatellites), communication networks\
    \ and the availability of cheap sensors.\nIt is clear from the above discussion\
    \ that in order to improve the irrigation WUE, losses that occur\nalong the conveyance\
    \ and distribution channels must be minimised, and the timing and the quantity\
    \ of\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n3 of 17\nwater applied (or irrigation scheduling)\
    \ must be optimised. Improvement of the irrigation WUE may\nlead to water savings\
    \ which may be used to irrigate more land, which is particularly relevant where\n\
    water is the limiting factor of production. The purpose of this paper was to review\
    \ the advancements\nthat have been made to improve the irrigation WUE, document\
    \ the challenges encountered as well as\nexploring opportunities for further development.\
    \ Although the bulk of the review is on Australia’s\nirrigated agriculture, examples\
    \ from other countries are also used, and it is anticipated that the\nﬁndings\
    \ will inform researchers and policy makers in general. The paper starts by looking\
    \ at the nexus\nbetween irrigation modernisation and automation in Australia,\
    \ particularly focusing on irrigation\ndistribution channels and on-farm development.\
    \ The review then discusses the role of irrigation\nscheduling in improving the\
    \ WUE, and the concept of real-time control and optimisation that is still\nunder\
    \ development. The emerging and potential opportunities for improved WUE through\
    \ remote\nsensing techniques, and sensors and communication networks are discussed.\
    \ In the ﬁnal section,\nwe discuss the challenges to the achievement of higher\
    \ WUE, with focus on water consumption at the\nbasin scale and factors affecting\
    \ trends in WUE which are broadly categorised as: engineering and\ntechnological;\
    \ environmental; advancements in plant and pasture science; and socio-economic.\n\
    2. Irrigation Modernisation and Automation\nThe terms irrigation modernisation\
    \ and automation have become common in irrigation literature\nin the recent decades,\
    \ and in some cases have been used interchangeably. In the context of this paper,\n\
    modernisation is the process of replacing ageing irrigation infrastructure and\
    \ methods, often with new\nor “modern” equipment and technologies that have been\
    \ developed in the recent past. The aims of\nirrigation modernisation include\
    \ water saving and improved water delivery, and reduced operating\nand labour\
    \ costs, which leads to sustainable agricultural production and enhanced livelihoods\
    \ of\nfarmers [6]. On the other hand, automation of irrigation systems is the\
    \ use of equipment that allows the\nirrigation process to proceed with minimum\
    \ human involvement, except for periodic inspections and\nroutine maintenance.\
    \ In Australia, modernisation and automation have been undertaken in the water\n\
    distribution networks at the farm level as well. The nexus between automation\
    \ and modernisation,\nand WUE will be explored in this paper.\n2.1. Irrigation\
    \ Water Distribution Systems\nIrrigation has been practiced for many decades in\
    \ Australia, especially in the Murray Darling\nBasin (MDB) (Figure 1), which consumes\
    \ about two-thirds of the water abstracted for irrigation of\ncrops and pasture\
    \ [2]. The bulk of the water in the basin is delivered to irrigators by private\
    \ and\nfarmer-owned companies. Murray Irrigation in the MDB, which supplies water\
    \ to 2300 farms with a\ntotal area of 748,000 ha is the largest in the country.\
    \ Other large companies include Murrumbidgee\nIrrigation and Coleambally Irrigation\
    \ Co-Operative Limited, which supply water to the Murrumbidgee\nIrrigation Area\
    \ and the Coleambally Irrigation District, respectively.\nIn the last few years,\
    \ irrigation water in the MDB has been largely conveyed via open channels.\nIn\
    \ addition, a signiﬁcant portion of the infrastructure supporting irrigation,\
    \ with some built in the\nearly years of the last century, have started to age\
    \ and become inefﬁcient. From the WUE perspective,\nirrigation water conveyed\
    \ via open channels is of interest because of the associated losses. Hence,\n\
    the Federal and State and Territory Governments developed the Murray Darling Basin\
    \ Plan and\nembarked on a program of modernising and automating this critical\
    \ infrastructure, as discussed below.\nSeepage losses, particularly in earthen\
    \ open channels, may consume up to approximately 14% of\nthe total water supplied\
    \ to an irrigation scheme. Evaporation losses, especially in large open channels,\n\
    may also be considerable [7], especially in arid parts of Australia. Therefore,\
    \ one of the priorities of\nthe modernisation plan of the MDB was to reduce these\
    \ losses using a variety of methods including\nlining the canals with clay or\
    \ rubber, repair of earthen and concrete channels, installation of gravity\npipelines\
    \ in place of open channels, and upgrade of on-farm irrigation infrastructure\
    \ (discussed in\ngreater detail in the next subsection). One example of such a\
    \ project undertaken in the MDB from 2011\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n4 of 17\nto 2015\
    \ is the Trangie-Nevertire Irrigation Scheme, which returned about 40% of the\
    \ original water\nentitlements, significantly reduced water losses, and improved\
    \ the water delivery efficiency from about\n65% to 93% [8].\nWater 2018, 10, x\

    \ significantly reduced water losses, and improved the water delivery \nefficiency\
    \ from about 65% to 93% [8]. \nA critical step towards improving the WUE is the\
    \ ability to accurately measure the amount of \nwater supplied to irrigators.\
    \ This is in line with the saying that goes: “You cannot manage what you \ncannot\
    \ measure.” However, previous research undertaken in Australia showed that inaccurate\
    \ flow \nmeasurement techniques, for instance using the Dethridge wheels, led\
    \ to the supply of irrigation \nwater in excess of entitlement volumes. A study\
    \ by Goulburn Water [9] showed that large Dethridge \nwheels operated with inaccuracies\
    \ of between −18% to +3%. Hence, regulatory requirements were \nput in place to\
    \ ensure that irrigation water meters operate at an acceptable level of performance\
    \ [10]. \nThe requirements include pattern approval by the National Measurement\
    \ Institute (NMI) and the \nability of the meters to perform within maximum limits\
    \ of error of ±5% in field conditions The\nFigure 1. The Murray Darling Basin,\

    A critical step towards improving the WUE is the ability to accurately measure\
    \ the amount of\nwater supplied to irrigators. This is in line with the saying\
    \ that goes: “You cannot manage what you\ncannot measure.” However, previous research\
    \ undertaken in Australia showed that inaccurate ﬂow\nmeasurement techniques,\

    \ pattern approval by the National Measurement Institute (NMI) and the ability\n\
    of the meters to perform within maximum limits of error of ±5% in ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ The irrigation\nmodernisation program involved the replacement of Dethridge\
    \ wheels with water meters that were\ncompliant with these regulations.\nThe above\
    \ examples, therefore, demonstrate the opportunities for improving the WUE before\n\
    the water is delivered to the farm and provide an indication of the magnitude\
    \ of savings that have\noccurred in speciﬁc projects. There are still many irrigation\
    \ enterprises that rely on open and unlined\nchannels for their water supply,\
    \ although statistics on their proportion are not immediately available.\nSome\
    \ of the strategies used to modernise and automate ﬂow of water in irrigation\
    \ canals are also\nused on-farm to control the ﬂow of water to different portions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. These include automatic\nregulators or gates and telemetry systems.\
    \ These are discussed in the next subsection.\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n5 of 17\n\
    2.2. On-Farm Irrigation Development\nIn the recent past, a number of on-farm research\
    \ and development projects aimed at improving\nthe WUE have been undertaken. The\
    \ funding scheme discussed above mainly focused on large\nirrigation schemes,\
    \ but the Australian Government also initiated the On-farm Irrigation Efﬁciency\n\
    Program to help individual irrigators improve their irrigation infrastructure\
    \ or change irrigation\npractices (e.g., convert to more efﬁcient irrigation methods)\
    \ in order to save water. The most signiﬁcant\ndevelopments, especially in the\
    \ surface system, appear to be automatic gates or outlets, water metering\nand\
    \ use of telemetry systems. Some of the on-farm modernisation and automation projects\
    \ have also\nbeen funded by the irrigators themselves.\nGates are structures placed\
    \ in irrigation channels or bay/basin outlets to control ﬂow of water,\nand be\
    \ may be controlled by a mechanical timer or electric solenoid. Some gates also\
    \ have the capacity\nto measure the ﬂow rate. There has been an increase in the\
    \ use of telemetry systems in irrigation to\nallow for remote measurement and\
    \ control of various parameters. The mode of communication used by\nthese telemetry\
    \ systems include radio, telephone, infrared, satellite and internet. In Australia,\
    \ there are\ncommercially available on-farm irrigation telemetry systems manufactured\
    \ by local companies, such as\nAWMA and Rubicon that utilise the Supervisory Control\
    \ and Data Acquisition (SCADA) platform.\nThese on-farm automation developments\
    \ may appear to be focussed on reducing the irrigation\nlabour requirement especially\
    \ in the surface systems, but they also play a role in improving the WUE.\nThis\
    \ is because, with automated systems, there is less chance of human error that\
    \ may lead to water\nloss. A good example of this is that in manual surface irrigation\
    \ systems, inﬂow is turned on and off at\nthe completion of the irrigation by\
    \ an operator. A delay of cutting off the ﬂow will therefore lead to\nwater losses.\
    \ Improvement of application efﬁciencies of well-managed automated-bay-irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds\nin Northern Victoria was demonstrated by Smith et al. [11].\n2.3. Irrigation\
    \ Modernisation in Developed and Developing Countries\nThe above discussion on\
    \ irrigation modernisation and automation has largely focused on\nAustralia. To\
    \ provide context, this subsection will brieﬂy examine the scenario in the rest\
    \ of the\nworld, particularly in Spain and the Unites States, two countries which\
    \ are also major irrigating\neconomies in Europe and North America, respectively.\n\
    According to Plusquellec [6], developed and some emerging countries generally\
    \ possess\nconditions favourable for automation and modernisation of especially\
    \ large-scale irrigation systems,\nfor instance:\n•\nOrganised manner of supply\
    \ of water to users;\n•\nIrrigation systems that are generally well-maintained,\
    \ hence less costly to upgrade;\n•\nStrong policy and regulatory environment,\
    \ and the willingness and capacity to enforce laws\nrelated to water use;\n•\n\
    Availability of technical expertise and equipment; and\n•\nWell-developed infrastructure\
    \ such as roads.\nBackground information about irrigation modernisation and automation\
    \ in Spain can be obtained\nfrom a number of articles, for instance González-Cebollada\
    \ [12] and Lecina et al. [13]. Significant Spanish\nGovernment reforms and modernisation\
    \ to manage demand of water began in 2002, and as was the\ncase in Australia,\
    \ the projects were largely taxpayer-funded, and the objectives included revitalisation\n\
    of the irrigation sector and water conservation. The programs included improvement\
    \ of the irrigation\nwater distribution network and promotion of water-efficient\
    \ methods such as the drip system. Similarly,\nthe modernisation of irrigation\
    \ systems in the United States aimed to improve the water delivery\nsystem using\
    \ methods such as modification of check structures, use of reticulation systems,\
    \ improved\nmeasurement and control, and the use of SCADA systems [14]. However,\
    \ in a survey conducted by the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ a few years ago, it was estimated that at least half of\nthe United States cropland\
    \ was still irrigated with less efficient irrigation methods [15].\nWater 2018,\
    \ 10, 1771\n6 of 17\n3. Irrigation Scheduling\nIrrigation scheduling is the process\
    \ of determining how much water to apply and when to irrigate,\nand thus has a\
    \ direct effect on WUE: the application of more water than that is necessary for\
    \ optimal\nplant consumption reduces the irrigation WUE. Irrigation scheduling\
    \ requires an understanding of\nthe pattern of plant water use, which is affected\
    \ by factors such as weather, growth stage and canopy\nwetness. The meteorologic\
    \ component varies seasonally, daily and diurnally.\nIrrigation may be scheduled\
    \ based on the plant water status, which may be measured directly\nusing a pressure\
    \ bomb, or indirectly by monitoring the ﬂow of the stem sap.\nOther indirect\n\
    methods include the measurement of soil moisture content using probes and estimation\
    \ of crop\nevapotranspiration (ET). A summary of the main irrigation scheduling\
    \ approaches is presented in\nJones [16]. In Australia, the most common tools\
    \ used for irrigation scheduling are soil probes and\ntensiometers [17]. The major\
    \ drawback of using these soil-moisture-based tools for scheduling is that\nthey\
    \ give point-based measurements, while the soil characteristics are known to vary\
    \ spatially and\ntemporally [18].\nFarmers who do not use any scheduling tool\
    \ often rely on their experiences to schedule their\nirrigations. However, previous\
    \ studies have shown that such farmers who rely on the “rule-of-thumb”\nmay be\
    \ losing water [19]. Emerging methods of measuring or estimating crop water status\
    \ for irrigation\nscheduling purposes are discussed later in this paper.\nWith\
    \ the advancement in technology including the internet, a number of computer-based\n\
    irrigation scheduling systems have been developed to help farmers in their decision-making\
    \ process.\nTypical examples of these used in Australia include WaterSense, WaterTrack\
    \ Rapid and IrriSatSMS [20].\nHowever, despite the proven beneﬁts of improved\
    \ WUE using these technologies, their adoption is\nstill limited because of reasons\
    \ ranging from complexity to cost [17]. In the recent years, cheaper and\nmore\
    \ versatile sensors have become available (for instance Figure 2).\n \nsuch as\
    \ the drip system. Similarly, the modernisation of irrigation systems in the United\
    \ States aimed \nto improve the water delivery system using methods such as modification\
    \ of check structures, use of \nreticulation systems, improved measurement and\
    \ control, and the use of SCADA systems [14]. \nHowever, in a survey conducted\
    \ by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) a few years \nago, it\
    \ was estimated that at least half of the United States cropland was still irrigated\
    \ with less \nefficient irrigation methods [15]. \n3. Irrigation Scheduling \n\
    Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining how much water to apply and\
    \ when to \nirrigate, and thus has a direct effect on WUE: the application of\
    \ more water than that is necessary for \noptimal plant consumption reduces the\
    \ irrigation WUE. Irrigation scheduling requires an \nunderstanding of the pattern\
    \ of plant water use, which is affected by factors such as weather, growth \n\
    stage and canopy wetness. The meteorologic component varies seasonally, daily\
    \ and diurnally.  \nIrrigation may be scheduled based on the plant water status,\
    \ which may be measured directly \nusing a pressure bomb, or indirectly by monitoring\
    \ the flow of the stem sap. Other indirect methods \ninclude the measurement of\
    \ soil moisture content using probes and estimation of crop \nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ET). A summary of the main irrigation scheduling approaches is presented in\
    \ \nJones [16]. In Australia, the most common tools used for irrigation scheduling\
    \ are soil probes and \ntensiometers [17]. The major drawback of using these soil-moisture-based\
    \ tools for scheduling is that \nthey give point-based measurements, while the\
    \ soil characteristics are known to vary spatially and \ntemporally [18].  \n\
    Farmers who do not use any scheduling tool often rely on their experiences to\
    \ schedule their \nirrigations. However, previous studies have shown that such\
    \ farmers who rely on the “rule-of-thumb” \nmay be losing water [19]. Emerging\
    \ methods of measuring or estimating crop water status for \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ purposes are discussed later in this paper. \nWith the advancement in technology\
    \ including the internet, a number of computer-based \nirrigation scheduling systems\
    \ have been developed to help farmers in their decision-making process. \nTypical\
    \ examples of these used in Australia include WaterSense, WaterTrack Rapid and\
    \ IrriSatSMS \n[20]. However, despite the proven benefits of improved WUE using\
    \ these technologies, their \nadoption is still limited because of reasons ranging\
    \ from complexity to cost [17]. In the recent years, \ncheaper and more versatile\
    \ sensors have become available (for instance Figure 2).  \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \n\

    \ a device with multiple sensors (a), with the ability to measure soil properties\n\

    \ The device has a\n2G/3G connectivity, and its web platform has an open Application\
    \ Programming Interface (API) for\nease of integration with other systems.\nIt\
    \ is clear from the above discussion that scheduling of irrigation is easier if\
    \ the irrigation system\nis automated, and with features such as accurate metering\
    \ and sensors.\n4. Real-Time Control and Optimisation\nDue to factors such as\
    \ differences in soil composition and weather, the inﬁltration characteristics\n\
    at the ﬁeld scale will vary both spatially and temporally. For most conventional\
    \ irrigation systems that\nseek to apply water uniformly, this will mean that\
    \ the on-farm WUE will be equally variable across\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n7 of\
    \ 17\nthe ﬁeld [21]. The variability in WUE is more pronounced in surface irrigation\
    \ systems (e.g., furrow)\nwhereby irrigation water is conveyed over the soil surface.\
    \ Hence, in the recent times, the concept of\nreal-time control and optimisation,\
    \ which was traditionally used in other branches of engineering,\nhas gained prominence\
    \ in irrigation water management.\nIn the context of irrigation, real-time control\
    \ implies measurements taken during an irrigation\nevent (e.g., advance of water\
    \ in a furrow system) are processed for the modiﬁcation of the same\nirrigation\
    \ event. This is at variance with conventional management systems which typically\
    \ rely\non previous or historical measurements, which are affected by the temporal\
    \ nature of inﬁltration\ncharacteristics. Real-time control is feasible when the\
    \ control process is automated so that the feedback\ncan be implemented rapidly.\
    \ On the other hand, optimisation is the process of manipulating various\nvariables\
    \ of an irrigation system with the aim of achieving the best possible outcome.\
    \ This has\ntraditionally been achieved through trial and error or irrigator experience;\
    \ however, owing to the\nadvancement in computing technology in the recent past,\
    \ the use of simulation models has been on\nthe increase [22].\nSurface irrigation\
    \ systems that can be controlled and optimised in real time are sometimes referred\n\
    to as smart irrigation systems (Figure 3). They are regarded as improvements from\
    \ purely automated\nsystems, which are mostly designed to reduce irrigation labour\
    \ requirement through automation\nof some tasks. The traditional or conventional\
    \ irrigation systems are associated with high labour\nrequirement and low WUE\
    \ (Figure 3).\n \ng\n4. Real-Time Control and Optimisation \nDue to factors such\

    \ \npotential for an improvement in WUE and a reduction in labour requirement\
    \ [26]. The system \nFigure 3. Advances in irrigation technologies.\nIn surface\

    \ of the inﬂow rate, sensing of the advance of water along the furrow, a computing\
    \ system\nwith a simulation model, and a telemetry system to facilitate communications\
    \ between different\ncomponents. A commercial prototype of this system was produced,\
    \ and trials in a commercially\nirrigated ﬁeld showed that it is able to control\
    \ irrigation events by cut-off time to achieve the maximum\napplication efﬁciency\
    \ [27].\nHence, it is clear that real-time control and optimisation in the Australian\
    \ irrigation industry is\nstill at its infancy, particularly in surface irrigation.\
    \ However, based on the amount of research and\nthe progress made so far (for\
    \ instance the commissioning of prototype systems), it is conceivable that,\n\
    in the future, it will play a bigger role in irrigation water management and improvement\
    \ of WUE.\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n8 of 17\n5. Emerging and Potential Opportunities\
    \ for WUE\nInvestments in research and development projects in the recent decades\
    \ and advancement in\ntechnology, in general, have yielded new or emerging opportunities\
    \ for increased WUE in irrigated\nagriculture. This has come in the form of new\
    \ and advanced equipment and techniques, as well as\ncheaper and relatively accurate\
    \ alternatives.\n5.1. Remote Sensing\nAs discussed above, in irrigated agriculture,\
    \ improvement of WUE is achieved by optimising the\ntiming and quantity of irrigation\
    \ applications. The scheduling methods described, whether plant-,\nsoil- or meteorologic-based\
    \ (evapotranspiration), are normally used on the ground. These methods\nare generally\
    \ expensive, time-consuming and cannot be easily automated [16], and also mostly\n\
    location-speciﬁc and not suitable for use in large areas. The option of remote\
    \ sensing, which is\nnot at all a new concept in agriculture, has, in the recent\
    \ years, been an active area of irrigation water\nmanagement research due to its\
    \ advantages in systematic measurements across space and time, ability\nto cover\
    \ large areas and capability to be integrated into models and with Geographic\
    \ Information\nSystems (GIS).\nNew approaches using remotely sensed data to estimate\
    \ the crop or plant water status and\nhence schedule irrigations are emerging.\
    \ The ﬁrst is satellite imagery which has been applied in\nmany agricultural applications,\
    \ for example yield and disease monitoring. In the last few decades,\nmethods\
    \ using algorithms to derive vegetation indices from satellite imagery in combination\
    \ with\nground-based measurements to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) over large\
    \ areas have emerged [21,28].\nUse of Landsat thermal infrared (TIR, https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/L8)\
    \ imagery to derive spatial variability\ninformation of ET at the ﬁeld scale and\
    \ uniformity of water consumption for the purposes of improving\nWUE [29,30] is\
    \ a recent step towards improved irrigation water management.\nUse of remote sensing\
    \ in irrigation water use monitoring, evaluation and management\nare underutilized\
    \ due to issues of spatial and temporal resolution, quality of results and\none-time/one-place\
    \ syndrome among others. However, the current Lansat-8 satellite series comes\
    \ with\na 30 m spatial resolution and can be used to assess actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ and crop water use\nat the ﬁeld and farm scale. There are a number of commercial\
    \ satellites now available that may be used\nfor agricultural purposes, for instance\
    \ Sentinel-2 (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/\nsentinel-2) and\
    \ Planet (https://www.planet.com/markets/monitoring-for-precision-agriculture/).\n\
    Another remote sensing approach to determining the crop water status, which is\
    \ still in research\nphase, is the use of thermal and multispectral imagery collected\
    \ using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)\nor drones. Research has shown that the\
    \ plant canopy temperature is correlated to the plant water\nstatus, and hence\
    \ can be used for irrigation water management [31]. Applications using reﬂectance\
    \ of\nnear and mid-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to assess\
    \ water status in cereal crops,\nfruit trees, grapevine, and pasture are described\
    \ in Cozzolino [31].\nThe main advantage of remote sensing is the ability to estimate\
    \ the crop water status over\nspatial scales, which cannot be possibly realised\
    \ with the conventional methods such as soil probes\nor plant-based techniques.\
    \ It is also expected that, with the increased uptake of drone technology,\ntheir\
    \ prices will decrease and therefore become more accessible to many farmers. However,\
    \ increased\neffort is also needed to connect irrigators and remote sensors to\
    \ maximise economies of scale.\nKey opportunities and advances to watch include\
    \ future collection of very high resolution (<10 m)\ndata through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors such as the current commercial IKONOS and Quickbird satellites,\nrapid\
    \ data access availability of data from multiple sensors with a wide array of\
    \ spatial, spectral,\nand radiometric features and remote sensing multi-data synthesis\
    \ through streaming technology.\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n9 of 17\n5.2. Sensor and\
    \ Communication Networks\nSensors are equipment used to collect a range of data\
    \ such as soil moisture and weather in order to\nimprove agricultural management.\
    \ Typical examples of sensors used in irrigation water management\ninclude soil\
    \ moisture probes and weather stations. Traditionally, equipment for monitoring\
    \ crop or\nsoil water status were connected using cables and often required manual\
    \ reading and the data used\nto schedule future irrigations. Apart from the inaccuracies\
    \ that come with using historical data for\nfuture water management, such manual\
    \ processes are time-consuming and often expensive. The use\nof wireless sensor\
    \ technologies to improve WUE in irrigated agriculture is on the increase.\nMore\
    \ often, a series of wireless sensors are used to monitor various parameters in\
    \ the ﬁeld,\nfor example soil moisture and weather data. This is especially driven\
    \ by the fact that the recent\nadvancement in technology and competition has led\
    \ to the availability of cheap sensors. A wireless\nsensor network consists of\
    \ a number of individual sensors (sensor nodes), a sink node or hub to receive\n\
    and process data from the sensor nodes, and a communication technology [32]. The\
    \ sensor networks\nmay also have actuators that can be used to automate the irrigation\
    \ system.\nThe wireless communication technologies that are used for agricultural\
    \ purposes including water\nmanagement are discussed in many texts, for instance\
    \ Rehman et al. [32]. The current communication\ntechnologies used in agriculture\
    \ are ZigBee, Bluetooth, WiFi, GPRS/3G/4G, Long Range Radio (LoRa)\nand SigFox\
    \ [33]. The ZigBee technology is commonly preferred in irrigation water management\n\
    because of the range, low cost, energy efﬁciency and reliability [32,34].\nThe\
    \ use of wireless sensors that measure soil moisture, temperature and humidity\
    \ and relay\nthe data over the 3G internet network is described in Reference [35].\
    \ The automation of such crucial\ndata collection means that the irrigation system\
    \ can be controlled in real time, thereby achieving\nhigher WUE.\nIt appears from\
    \ the literature reviewed that research into water loss through leakage has\n\
    concentrated on urban water supply distribution networks. The techniques used\
    \ to detect leakages in\nurban water distribution networks can be applied in irrigation\
    \ settings. Pressure sensors connected to\na wireless sensor network can play\
    \ a vital role in in detecting leakages, and thus facilitate faster repair\nand\
    \ prevention of further losses [36]. There is also a potential for using smart\
    \ water technology to\ndetect losses in water pipelines [37].\nThere are substantial\
    \ ongoing research activities involving sensors and communication networks\nwhich\
    \ are likely to lead to improved products and services in the future. It is also\
    \ likely that\ncommunication networks will be used in a more integrated manner\
    \ to achieve multiple objectives, for\nexample irrigation and urban water supply\
    \ using smart water meters.\n6. Irrigation Water Productivity\nThis paper has\
    \ largely been written from an engineering perspective, which predominantly\n\
    deﬁnes WUE as the ratio of the irrigation water beneﬁcially used by the plant\
    \ or pasture to the water\nsupplied through irrigation. This section will brieﬂy\
    \ discuss irrigation water productivity, with a focus\non plant genetics and agronomic\
    \ practices used to achieve higher yields using less water.\nThrough plant breeding,\
    \ scientists have managed to develop high-yielding crop varieties.\nThis implies\
    \ that, all other factors kept constant, with the same amount available water,\
    \ farmers\ncan achieve a higher irrigation water productivity. Detailed information\
    \ on how the plant WUE can\nbe improved through molecular genetics is described\
    \ in Ruggiero et al. [38]. The research provides\nan overview of the manipulation\
    \ of genes that strongly impacts on WUE such as these that control\nroot traits\
    \ and stomatal development. Some genetically modiﬁed varieties are also resistant\
    \ to pests\nand diseases, leading to higher yields. A study conducted within the\
    \ cotton industry in Australia\nfound that the water use productivity had increased\
    \ by 40% over a period of ten years as a result of\nyield increases achieved by\
    \ developments in plant breeding, the use of genetically modiﬁed varieties,\n\
    and improved crop and water management systems [5].\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n10\
    \ of 17\nDeﬁcit irrigation, which is the application of less water than that is\
    \ required by the plant or\npasture, is a strategy that is often used when water\
    \ is limiting. In a trial conducted in a dairy region of\nVictoria, Australia,\
    \ where pasture is often irrigated, Rogers et al. [39] demonstrated that lucerne\
    \ under\ndeﬁcit irrigation can fully recover once full irrigation is restored,\
    \ and thus ideal forage can be grown\nunder water limiting conditions. Tejero\
    \ et al. [40] in a trial undertaken in a citrus orchard in Spain\nconcluded that\
    \ deﬁcit irrigation strategies have the potential to improve WUE. Du [41] proposed\
    \ the\nadoption of deﬁcit irrigation strategies in areas of China where conventional\
    \ irrigation is no longer\nsustainable because of water shortages.\n7. Water Consumption\
    \ at the Basin Scale and Trends in WUE\n7.1. WUE and Water Consumption at the\
    \ Basin Scale\nThe need for water users to achieve greater WUE is often seen as\
    \ a prerequisite for saving water\nfor the beneﬁt of other users as well as the\
    \ environment. However, literature reviewed suggests that a\nhigher WUE does not\
    \ necessarily equal to net water saving, particularly at the basin scale.\nWhen\
    \ seen from the dimension of a water basin, what may be assessed as a loss in\
    \ one perspective\n(e.g., deep drainage losses that may occur in surface systems),\
    \ may be a gain in another way\n(e.g., recharge of groundwater resources). Some\
    \ research has shown that signiﬁcant improvement in\ndelivery and on-farm WUE\
    \ may in fact lead to a decline in groundwater resources [21] or reduce water\n\
    for environment and downstream users [3]. Therefore, although improvement of on-farm\
    \ irrigation\nWUE may lead to water savings on the farm, it will not necessarily\
    \ be beneﬁcial on a catchment or\nbasin scale [15].\nAn overall increase of water\
    \ consumption at the basin scale may occur if water savings ultimately\nleads\
    \ to an expansion of the irrigated area [42]. This was demonstrated by research\
    \ conducted in\nMorocco which saw the overall water consumption rise as a result\
    \ of subsidised drip irrigation kits\npromoted as a means of increasing productivity\
    \ and saving water [43]. In this example, although the\ndrip system is generally\
    \ regarded as water-efﬁcient, farmers were found to shift to more water-intensive\n\
    crops and generally used the “saved” water to expand the acreage under irrigation.\
    \ This view has been\ncorroborated by other studies, for instance a FAO-funded\
    \ research project undertaken in North Africa\nand the Middle East region [44].\
    \ The study found that at the ﬁeld scale, water saving may appear to be\nsubstantial,\
    \ but at the basin scale, the total water consumption may actually increase while\
    \ the crop\nwater productivity gains for the most important crops may be modest\
    \ at best. In a study undertaken in\nIndia, the widespread adoption of water efﬁcient\
    \ methods such as the sprinkler and drip systems were\nfound to have the capacity\
    \ to substantially reduce overextraction of groundwater resources, but half of\n\
    the water saved was reused to expand the area under irrigation [45].\nFigure 4\
    \ is used as an example to demonstrate the simultaneous increasing uptake of\n\
    water-efﬁcient technologies (sprinkler and drip) and the increasing total area\
    \ under irrigation\n(especially between 1994 and 2013) in the Unites States. This\
    \ suggests the potential reuse of any\nwater savings to expand the area under\
    \ irrigation. The graph in Figure 4 also shows the corresponding\ndecrease in\
    \ surface irrigation systems that are generally regarded as inefﬁcient.\nWater\

    \ that technology adoption is a complex sociological phenomenon, and its success\
    \ will largely\ndepend on the willingness of water users to change their attitudes.\
    \ Irrigation water users, like other\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n14 of 17\nmembers\
    \ of the community in general, are predisposed to continue with the farming practices\
    \ they are\nmost familiar with, for fear of the unknown. In most cases, water\
    \ users have access to information on\nnew technologies, but getting people to\
    \ change their attitudes and adopt new practices or technologies\nis a slow process.\
    \ Research undertaken in the United States suggested that the requirement to learn\n\
    a new set of skills may act as a deterrent to irrigators investing in new technologies\
    \ or adopting\nnew practices [15].\nIn both Australia and the United States, the\
    \ cost of changing to new technologies and practices\nhas been cited as a signiﬁcant\
    \ factor causing non-adoption [15,52]. This includes the capital required as\n\
    well as the associated on-going costs. A typical example is when farmers decide\
    \ to change from surface\nirrigation methods to pressurised systems such as centre\
    \ pivots and lateral move machines which\nare generally associated with higher\
    \ WUE. These pressurised systems not only require substantially\nhigher capital\
    \ costs to install, but come with higher energy consumption and are therefore\
    \ expensive\nto run [5].\nA European-Union-funded research project undertaken\
    \ in Italy and Portugal concluded that\nlack of adequate knowledge and incentives\
    \ may prevent farmers from exploiting the full potential\nof available technologies\
    \ to optimise WUE [53]. The study thus recommended that there should\nbe a continuous\
    \ knowledge exchange among scientiﬁc experts, farmers and other stakeholders,\n\
    and appropriate support be provided to encourage environmental conservation.\n\
    As discussed earlier, one of the main approaches used in Australia to attain increased\
    \ WUE is the\nupgrade of irrigation infrastructure and provision of subsidies\
    \ for on-farm improvements. However,\nsome studies [3] have shown that sometimes\
    \ these investments are not cost-effective, especially when\ncompared to other\
    \ alternatives such as water trading which is aimed at efﬁciently allocating water\n\
    across competitive use. Therefore, when the economic beneﬁts of these taxpayer-funded\
    \ initiatives are\nnot apparent, public support is not guaranteed.\nIt should\
    \ be noted, however, that WUE cannot be improved inﬁnitely. In the case of an\
    \ irrigation\nsystem that has a lower irrigation performance to start with, it\
    \ would be easier to notice an increase\nin WUE when improvements to the system\
    \ are undertaken. However, for a system that is already\noperating at or near\
    \ the optimum level, the WUE will increase (if at all) at a much slower rate.\
    \ A study\nconducted in the Guadalquivir River Basin in Spain found that the impact\
    \ on the WUE of technological\ninnovations, such as deﬁcit irrigation, new crop\
    \ varieties and other water-saving technologies, had\ndecreased considerably after\
    \ a number of years [54]. As previously noted, plant breeding has been used\n\
    for a number of decades now to develop plant varieties with higher WUE. However,\
    \ this improvement\nis not expected to continue at the same rate as before [55].\
    \ This implies that the world cannot solely rely\non the past and the present\
    \ technologies to improve WUE, but must continue to undertake research to\ngenerate\
    \ newer technologies that can be used to further improve the WUE.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    The purpose of this paper was to review the steps that have been taken to improve\
    \ the use of the\nscarce water resources, with a focus on irrigation in Australia\
    \ but with examples from other countries.\nWe also looked at the challenges that\
    \ have been encountered and explored opportunities that may lead\nto improved\
    \ WUE in the future.\nThe Australian Federal, State and Territory Governments\
    \ have facilitated the modernisation\nand automation of irrigation infrastructure\
    \ such as distribution channels and improvements on\non-farm irrigation hardware.\
    \ This has led to improved WUE, and some of the water saved has been\nused for\
    \ environmental purposes. Improved irrigation scheduling and the real-time control\
    \ and\noptimisation have also demonstrated potential for further water savings.\
    \ The use of remote sensing\nand communication sensor networks are emerging in\
    \ the irrigation industry and are expected to\ncontribute to improve WUE. However,\
    \ challenges lie in the way of enhanced WUE. These include\nlack of public support,\
    \ especially when the methods used are not cost-effective, and reluctance of\n\
    irrigations to adopt new technologies.\nWater 2018, 10, 1771\n15 of 17\nThe review\
    \ has demonstrated that the adoption of water-efﬁcient technologies has delivered\n\
    water savings at the ﬁeld scale, with some of the savings being released as environmental\
    \ ﬂows.\nHowever, the net water saving at the basin scale is not always achievable.\
    \ In fact, some studies have\ndemonstrated that a net increase in water consumption,\
    \ largely due to the reuse of the saved water\nto expand the area of land under\
    \ irrigation. Hence, an overall reduction of water consumption at\nthe basin scale\
    \ is likely to be achieved when water-efﬁcient technologies are used in combination\n\
    with other measures, such as provision of incentives for water conservation and\
    \ regulations to limit\nwater allocation.\nAuthor Contributions: R.K. conceptualised\

    Abstract Hyperspectral sensing technique can provide an exact and expeditious
    manner for effective management of deficit irrigation through assessment of changes
    in plant water status in a large scale and real-time. This hypothesis was tested
    in this study using the hyperspectral signatures of the canopy in the visible-
    (VIS), near- (NIR), and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) to estimate and predict the
    leaf water status, measured here in terms of leaf water potential (LWP), relative
    water content (RWC), and equivalent water thickness (EWT), and grain yield (GY)
    of wheat cultivars exposed to 1.00, 0.75, and 0.50 of the estimated evapotranspiration
    (ETc). Results showed that the three parameters of leaf water status exhibited
    strong correlations with GY under 0.75 (except LWP) and 0.50 ETc treatments. This
    indicates that these parameters can be used as early indicators for management
    of deficit irrigation. Based on the relationships between these four phenotypic
    parameters and original canopy spectral reflectance within 350–2500 nm, the sensitive
    spectral wavelengths that exhibited strong correlations with all parameters existed
    mainly within the NIR and SWIR regions, with peak-wavelengths around 351, 518,
    and 687 nm in the VIS, 762, 974, 1100, and 1240 nm in the NIR, and 1392, 1515,
    1930, and 2273 nm in the SWIR regions. These peak-wavelengths were used to build
    new two- and three-band normalized spectral reflectance indices (NDSIs). The NDSIs
    that combine NIR and VIS, NIR and NIR, SWIR and NIR, and SWIR and SWIR wavelengths
    were more effective for tracking changes in leaf water status and GY than those
    that combine only VIS wavelengths. The high fit between the observed and predicted
    values for phenotypic parameters based on twelve newly developed and published
    NDSIs indicates that the most recently developed NDSI models were more precise
    and accurate, and thus could be used for monitoring the changes in leaf water
    status and wheat production caused by deficit irrigation. The performance of partial
    least square regression (PLSR) based on either eleven wavelengths or different
    NDSIs as a predictive approach was the same and sometimes better than the individual
    NDSIs for assessment of phenotypic parameters. The results of spectral reflectance
    data and PLSR tools can serve as rapid and non-destructive alternative approaches
    for monitoring the water status and wheat production, and can be used to develop
    certain spectral indices for management of deficit irrigation in arid regions.

    selection 1. Introduction Water shortage currently plagues almost every country
    in arid and semiarid regions and is one of the key factors for stagnation and
    decrease of crop production in these regions. In addition, the global climate
    change, which is synchronously accompanied by low and variable precipitation,
    high evaporation rates, and frequent incidences of drought, causing water shortage
    in these regions has already become the rule rather than the exception. Furthermore,
    most of cropping areas in these regions are irrigated and consumes about 75% of
    the total available water supply. Thus, gradually shifting from full irrigation
    to deficit irrigation practices in order to achieve maximum crop production per
    unit of irrigation water applied rather than emphasizing on production per unit
    of area represents a plausible solution to deal with this issue (El-Hendawy et
    al., 2017a; Fereres and Soriano, 2007). Accurate estimation and real time detection
    of the responses of different plant parameters to deficit irrigation, particularly
    those associated with the plant water status, are increasingly required for effective
    water management in precision agriculture. The valuable information provided by
    the monitoring of plant water status can be used directly or indirectly for different
    purposes, such as assessment of drought indicators, understanding the relationships
    between plant and soil water, mapping and monitoring the conditions of plant biosphere
    processes, aiding in yield estimation, and making sound decisions related to irrigation
    scheduling, which involve deciding when and how much water should be applied (Gutierrez
    et al., 2010; Peñuelas et al., 1994; Stimson et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2015).
    Leaf water potential (LWP), relative water content (RWC), and equivalent water
    thickness (EWT) have been developed and widely used as indicators for monitoring
    plant water status. LWP is used as the standard parameter, while RWC is often
    used as a substitute plant parameter for detecting plant water status (Clevers
    et al., 2008; Elsayed et al., 2011; Kakani et al., 2007). RWC is expressed as
    a fraction of the water volume for the leaf at full turgidity and has a real physiological
    meaning, because it measures the amount of water available for leaf transpiration
    and reflects the physiological outcome of cellular water deficit (Chaves et al.,
    2003; Rossini et al., 2013). EWT is defined as the ratio between the volume of
    water and the leaf area (Danson et al., 1992; Yao et al., 2014). Therefore, gaining
    a comprehensive and better understanding of these plant water parameters will
    play an important role in managing deficit irrigation and sustaining crop production
    under such conditions. The ordinary methods for the measurement of these three
    plant water status parameters, that include measuring the area and fresh weight
    of the leaves and drying them in an oven, are practicable, very simple, and do
    not require special expertise. Nonetheless, they are generally time- and cost-inefficient,
    destructive and tedious, fail to fulfill the requirement of real-time evaluation,
    and are not feasible when the measurements are made on a large scale. Importantly,
    some methods provide information on the plant water status such as LWP solely
    on a single effective leaf. Such measurements are not only time- and cost-inefficient
    but also subject to errors and unrepresentative of the water status of the entire
    canopy. Consequently, quantitative and instantaneous methods for assessment of
    these plant parameters are needed to address the aforementioned drawbacks of the
    conventional measurement methods as well as to advance deficit irrigation regulation
    in wheat through precision agriculture practices. Spectral reflectance techniques
    have been demonstrated to be instantaneous, cheap, applicable for a large scale,
    and non-destructive alternative methods for integrative assessment of several
    phenotypic parameters under different environmental conditions (El-Hendawy et
    al., 2017a,b; Elsayed et al., 2017; Gitelson et al., 2003; Lobos et al., 2014;
    Rapaport et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2008). The ground-based hyperspectral reflectance
    technique, which detects the spectral reflectance of the canopy from visible-
    (VIS) to shortwave-infrared (SWIR), has been shown to have a great potential to
    detect even the slight variations and modifications in biophysical and biochemical
    characteristics of the canopy. Therefore, it is successfully used to track the
    changes in plant parameters related to plant water status. The possibility of
    detecting various water-related parameters through proximal remote sensing data
    derives from the fact that canopy reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR, 700–1300 nm)
    and the shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1300–2500 nm) regions is strongly influenced
    by several internal leaf structural and water content of the canopy. The OH bonds
    in the canopy water strongly absorbs solar radiation in the NIR and SWIR regions,
    with the strong water absorption bands found in the SWIR region and centered at
    approximately 1450, 1950, 2250, and 2500 nm and the weak absorption bands located
    in the NIR region near 970 and 1200 nm (Bowyer and Danson, 2004; Ceccato et al.,
    2002; Seelig et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). The canopy spectral reflectance
    in the NIR region is also strongly affected by several internal leaf structural
    factors such as leaf cuticles, intercellular air spaces, and the ratio between
    palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll that are strongly associated with the
    leaf water status. Although the VIS region (400–700 nm) does not have water bands,
    previous studies have shown that the wavelengths in this region could indirectly
    be used to estimate the plant water status through the effects of dehydration
    on the properties of the leaf pigments (Carter, 1991; Vescovo et al., 2012). Therefore,
    there is also a secondary effect of plant water status on canopy spectral reflectance
    in the NIR and VIS regions. Thus, many studies have demonstrated that various
    parameters related to plant water statuscould be assessed with hyperspectral instruments
    using different spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) based on the wavelengths of
    the three parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (VIS, NIR, and SWIR). For example,
    Rapaport et al. (2017) developed a new index, the water balance index (WABI, (R1500–R531/R1500+R531)),
    for monitoring the plant water status and detecting the irrigation scheduling
    in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) under field conditions. Several studies have also
    found that the wavelengths in the NIR region are appropriate to detect plant water
    status and the SRIs formulated based on NIR wavelengths such as the water index
    (WI = R970/R900) and different normalized water indices: NWI-1 = (R970 − R900)/(R970
    + R900), NWI-2 = (R970 − R850)/(R970 + R850), NWI-3 = (R970 − R880)/(R970 + R880),
    and NWI-4 = (R970 – R920)/(R970 + R920) are better for identifying genotypic differences
    in plant water content under water-limited conditions (Babar et al., 2006; El-Hendawy
    et al., 2015; Gutierrez et al., 2010; Peñuelas et al., 1994; Prasad et al., 2007;
    Rischbeck et al., 2014). Zarco-Tejada et al. (2003) estimated the leaf water content
    in relation to leaf area (EWT) and dry matter content (fuel moisture content,
    FMC) using the simple ratio water index: SRWI = (R860/R1240). Interestingly, the
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, (R900-R680)/(R900+R680)), which
    is one of the most widely used vegetation indices, showed significant correlation
    with LWP and leaf water content (Stimson et al., 2005). Yao et al. (2014) successfully
    estimated EWT in wheat under various water and nitrogen treatments by using a
    three-band index (R1429–R416–R1865)/(R1429+R416+R1865). Gaulton et al. (2013)
    found strong correlations between leaf EWT (R2 = 0.80, root mean square error
    [RMSE] = 0.0069 g/cm2) and the normalized ratio between 1063 and 1545 nm wavelengths.
    Junttila et al. (2016) showed that the SRIs calculated from 690, 905, and 1550 nm
    showed significant correlations with leaf EWT. Importantly, although the strong
    water absorption bands located in SWIR are more sensitive to plant water status
    than the weak water absorption bands located in NIR, the SRIs that are used to
    assess the different parameters related to plant water status are effective when
    NIR and SWIR wavelengths are combined in order to overcome the sensitivity of
    SWIR to the other leaf parameters such as dry matter and internal structure (Ceccato
    et al., 2001, 2002; Chuvieco et al., 2002). In other words, the SRIs are efficient
    when measurement bands where water absorption is high and reference bands where
    the water absorption is weak are included. Although several SRIs have great potential
    for assessing different water-related parameters as aforementioned and can easily
    be calculated, these indices focus mostly on 2–3 wavelengths only. Importantly,
    there are different factors related to the conditions for the measurement the
    spectral reflectance of the canopy (i.e., crop phenological growth stages, cultivars,
    levels of treatments, and year) influencing the performance of the SRIs in the
    assessment of plant parameters. Additionally, most regression analyses used for
    assessment of plant parameters relies on a single SRI, and therefore very few
    SRIs are applied in published work, although hundreds of SRIs are available (Lobos
    and Poblete-Echeverría, 2017). Therefore, there are compelling reasons for integrating
    multiple SRIs as a single index for improving prediction analysis in the assessment
    of plant parameters. The advantages of such analysis in the assessment of plant
    parameters are that (1) the plant parameters can be simultaneously assessed through
    different types of SRIs (e.g., simple ratio (SR), normalized spectral indices
    (NDSIs), perpendicular vegetation index (PVI), soil adjusted vegetation index
    (SAVI)), and (2) the plant parameters can be simultaneously assessed through a
    wide range of wavelengths from the three parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
    Multivariate regression analyses, including partial least square regression (PLSR),
    are found to be suitable methods for dealing with a large number of SRIs as a
    single index in order to improve the prediction of plant parameters. Recently,
    PLSR has been widely used to estimate and predict different plant parameters.
    For instance, PLSR based on different normalized SRIs increased the accuracy estimations
    of grain yield under field conditions by decreasing RMSE and increasing the coefficients
    of determination (R2) (Elsayed et al., 2017). Strong and significant relationships
    were found between the observed and predicted values as well as the validation
    value of wheat grain yield (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 413 kg ha−1) when PLSR based on
    different wavelengths (Sharabian et al., 2014). In general, hyperspectral measurements
    allow various multivariate analyses to deal with the whole spectrum wavelengths
    and various SRIs. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify most wavelengths
    within the three regions of the spectrum (VIS, NIR, and SWIR) that were specifically
    sensitive to leaf water status (LWP, RWC, and EWT) and GY measured for different
    wheat cultivars under different levels of irrigation, (2) utilize these wavelengths
    for developing new specific normalized spectral reflectance indices (NDSIs), (3)
    examine the suitability of these new NDSIs and published SRIs for assessment of
    leaf water status and GY, (4) develop and validate prediction models for accurate
    estimation of leaf water status and GY based on various new and published NDSIs,
    and (5) compare the performance of PLSR based on either different wavelengths
    or NDSIs for estimating the leaf water status and GY in wheat. We propose that
    developing the new NDSIs will help in precise assessment and monitoring of plant
    water status in semiarid regions and will be useful for irrigation scheduling
    and maximizing the water productivity of wheat. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Plant materials and growing conditions This study was conducted on three different
    wheat cultivars (Pavon 76, Sakha 93, and Yecor Rojo) at the Dierab Experimental
    Research Station of the College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University,
    Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during two consecutive growing seasons of 2016/2017 and
    2017/2018. Based on previous evaluation, the first two cultivars have been identified
    as drought-tolerant cultivars, while Yecor Rojo has been recognized as a drought-sensitive
    cultivar (Elshafei et al., 2013; El-Hendawy et al., 2015). The research station
    is located in the south west of Riyadh between latitudes 24°24′30′′ N - 24°25′30′′
    N and longitudes 46°39′0′′ E 46°39′30′′ (Fig. S1). The area is characterized by
    typical arid climate conditions, with the precipitation and temperature ranging
    from 5 to 28 mm and 9.9 to 35.2 °C, respectively. The soil type of the experimental
    area was sandy loam (8.5% clay, 15.4% silt, and 76.1% sand), with bulk density,
    field capacity, and wilting point of 1.51 g cm−3, 0.148, and 0.090 m3 m−3, respectively
    (El-Hendawy et al., 2017a). 2.2. Irrigation treatments Three irrigation treatments
    (1.00, 0.75, and 0.50 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration, ETc) were applied
    in this study. The amount of irrigation water applied, I, for the full irrigation
    treatment (1.00 ETc) was calculated according to the following equation: (1) I = ETo × Kc.
    The daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated by the Penman-Monteith
    modified equation (Allen et al., 1998) using daily meteorological data collected
    from a weather station located within 200 m of the field experimental site. The
    crop coefficients (Kc) for spring wheat recommended by FAO-56 (0.15, 1.10, and
    0.30 for the initial, mild, and late stages, respectively) were adjusted to the
    conditions of the study location (Allen et al., 1998). The values of Kc must be
    adjusted when the wind velocity is less or greater than 2 m s−1 and the minimum
    relative humidity differ from 45%. Based on Eq. (1), the total amounts of irrigation
    water applied for 1.00 ETc were 571.0 and 565.0 mm ha−1 in first and second seasons,
    respectively. These amounts of irrigation water were reduced by 25.0% and 50.0%
    for the 0.75 and 0.50 ETc treatments, respectively. The irrigation water was applied
    using surface irrigation system. To deliver equal and consistent amounts of water
    to each experimental unit (subplot), the main pipe of the irrigation system was
    equipped with a water meter and distributed to the sub-main hoses at each unit
    and equipped with a manual control valve at each experimental unit. 2.3. Experimental
    design and crop management The field experiments were laid out in a randomized
    complete block split-plot design, with three main plot irrigation treatments and
    three subplot cultivar treatments replicated three times. Each subplot was 4.0 m
    long and 1.5 m wide (6.0 m2 plot−1). The seeds of each cultivar were planted in
    ten rows per subplot at a seeding rate of 17 g m-2. All treatments were fertilized
    with 180 kg ha−1 of ammonium nitrate (33.5% N), 60 kg ha−1 of potassium chloride
    (60% K2O), and 90 kg ha−1 of calcium superphosphate (15.5% P2O5). Nitrogen fertilizer
    was applied at seeding, tillering, and booting stages in three equal doses. The
    entire amount of phosphorus and potassium were applied prior to seeding and at
    booting stage, respectively. Other field practices such as application of fungicides
    and herbicides were undertaken to control diseases and weed infestation, respectively.
    2.4. Measurements of phenotypic parameters Six fully-developed leaves from each
    subplot were collected randomly at the anthesis growth stage at 9:30–12:30 AM
    and immediately weighed for fresh weight (FW) determination. After measuring leaf
    water potential (LWP), using the Scholander pressure chamber (Scholander et al.,
    1965), and leaf area (LA), using a leaf area meter (LI 3100; LI-COR Inc., Lincoln,
    NE, USA), leaves were then rehydrated in deionised water in a dark cold room at
    5 °C for 16 h until they were fully turgid. Following rehydration, each leaf was
    blotted and immediately weighed to obtain turgid weight (TW), and then oven-dried
    at 75 °C in a forced-air oven for 48 h to obtain dry weight (DW). Relative water
    content (RWC) and equivalent water thickness (EWT) were calculated using the following
    equations: (2) RWC (%) = (FW – DW)/(TW – DW) × 100, (3) EWT (g cm−2) = (FW – DW)/LA.
    After physiological maturity, five internal rows in each subplot, each 3 m long
    (2.25 m2 total area), were harvested and threshed, and the water content in the
    seed was adjusted to 15% to determine the total grain yield per hectare. 2.5.
    Canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements Along with measurement of phenotypic
    parameters, canopy hyperspectral reflectance was measured using a portable ASD
    spectroradiometer (Field Spec FR 350–2500 nm, Analytical Spectral Devices Inc.,
    Boulder, CO, USA). The spectrum of this instrument is characterized by 1.4 and
    2.0 nm sampling intervals from 350 to 1050 nm and 1050 to 2500 nm, respectively.
    However, moving averages were calculated automatically to achieve 1.0 nm width
    continuous bands. Measurements were taken within ± 2 h of solar noon under cloudless
    conditions using a fiber optic probe with a 25° full conical angle and 2.3 mm
    diameter. The probe was held vertically at approximately 80 cm above the canopy
    in a nadir position on an adjustable monopod pole to cover the three central rows.
    A spectralon white reference panel (Labsphere, Inc., North Sutton, NH) was used
    to calibrate the spectroradiometer and to generate reflected light percentages.
    The calibrations were made before and after reflectance measurements for each
    sub-plot. Four measurements were taken for each subplot on the three central rows.
    An average of 10 scans calculated automatically was used for each measurement,
    and the average of four measurements was considered a measured spectrum for a
    sub-plot. Based on the hyperspectral reflectance data, seven existing indices
    that are effective for assessing plant water status, and combined wavelengths
    from three parts of the spectrum (VIS, NIR, and SWIR regions) were calculated.
    These indices were the water index (WI = (R900/R970); Peñuelas et al. (1994)),
    the simple ratio water index (SRWI = (R860/R1240); Zarco-Tejada et al. (2003)),
    the moisture stress index (MSI = (R1600/R820); Hunt et al. (1989)), the normalized
    water index-3 (NWI-3 = (R970 − R880)/ (R970 + R880); Prasad et al. (2007)), the
    normalized difference water index-1240 (NDWI1240 = (R860 – R1240)/(R860 + R1240);
    Gao (1996)), the normalized difference water index-1640 (NDWI1640 = (R860 – R1640)/
    (R860 + R1640); Chen et al. (2005)), and the three-band index (NDSI, 860, 1640,
    2130); Yao et al., 2014). In this study, based on the relationship between the
    original spectral reflectance of the full wavelengths range (350–2500 nm) and
    the tested phenotypic parameters, eleven wavelengths were selected to create all
    possible combinations between pairs of wavelengths as normalized difference spectral
    indices (NDSIs) based on the following formula: (4) NDSI = [Rλ1 – Rλ2]/[Rλ1 +
    Rλ2], where Rλ1 and Rλ2 are the spectral reflectance at the sensitive wavelengths
    λ1 and λ2, respectively. 2.6. Data analysis Data for phenotypic parameters (LWP,
    RWC, EWT, and GY) were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) appropriate for
    a randomized complete block split-plot design, with the irrigation rate and cultivar
    considered as the main factor and the split factor, respectively. Duncan’s test
    at the 95% probability level was used to compare the differences between the mean
    values of cultivars, irrigation rates, and their interactions. Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient matrix was used to determine the relationship between all phenotypic
    parameters for each irrigation rate as well as to determine the relationship between
    the original spectral reflectance of the full wavelength range and phenotypic
    parameters to select the sensitive wavelengths. Linear and non-linear curve-fitting
    models were used to test the relationships between exiting and novel NDSIs (as
    independent variables) and the phenotypic parameters (as dependent variables).
    The relationships with the highest coefficients of determination (R2) were considered
    as the best fit relationships. Different statistical parameters were used to evaluate
    the fit of different models of the predicted and observed values. The fitting
    accuracy was visually assessed from a 1:1 scatter plot of the measured and predicted
    phenotypic values. The statistical parameters included the coefficient of determination
    (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean relative error (RE%), the Amemiya’s
    prediction criterion (PC), and the intercept and slope of the linear regression
    between the observed and predicted values of the phenotypic parameters. A model
    with highest values of R2 and slope and lowest values of RMSE, RE, and PC was
    considered as the model of the higher prediction accuracy. These statistical parameters
    were performed with XLSTAT statistical package (vers. 2017.4, Excel Add-ins soft
    SARL, New York, NY, USA). The R package “lattice” from the software R statistics
    version 3.0.2 (R foundation for statistical computing 2013) was used to produce
    the contour maps. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was performed with the
    Unscrambler X multivariate data analysis software version 10.2 (CAMO Software
    AS, Oslo). The PLSR is a technique that specifies a linear relationship between
    a set of independent variables (NDSIs and wavelengths) and target variables (LWP,
    RWC, EWT, and GY). It seeks the sensitive information from reflectance bands or
    NDSIs. Eleven wavelengths or sixty-six NDSIs were used as input variables in the
    PLSR. The optimum number of PLSR factors was identified based on the minimum RMSE
    for cross validation to avoid over-fitting or under-fitting problems. The quality
    of calibration and validation models was tested through RMSE and R2 both for calibration
    (RMSEcal. and R2cal.) and validation (RMSEval. and R2val.). 3. Results 3.1. Variation
    of phenotypic parameters between irrigation rates and cultivars The all phenotypic
    parameters of leaf water status [leaf water potential (LWP), relative water content
    (RWC) and equivalent water thickness (EWT)] and grain yield per hectare (GY) were
    significantly affected by irrigation rates, with the values of RWC and GY for
    0.75 ETc treatment being similar to those of the full irrigation treatment (1.0
    ETc). However, when averaged over the two seasons, severe water stress treatment
    (0.50 ETc) was found to have resulted in decreases in LWP of 35.5% and 78.0%,
    RWC of 13.8% and 22.4%, EWT of 35.6% and 52.4%, and GY of 19.7% and 31.4% when
    compared with the 0.75 and 1.00 ETc treatments, respectively (Table 1). Table

    the differences in all phenotypic parameters between Pavon 76 and Sakha 93 were
    not significant, with the drought-sensitive cultivar Yecora Rojo producing the
    lowest values for these parameters (Table 1). The interaction between irrigation
    rate and cultivar had a significant effect on all phenotypic parameters in both
    growing seasons. The differences in all phenotypic parameters between Pavon 76
    and Sakha 93 appeared only under the severe water stress treatment (0.50 ETc),
    with the exception of EWT, which showed non-significant differences between both
    cultivars in the first season. When compared with these two cultivars, Yecora
    Rojo produced the lowest values for RWC and GY, even under the full irrigation
    treatment (1.00 ETc), and the values of both parameters for Pavon 76 under 0.50
    ETc were competitive with those of Yecora Rojo under 1.00 ETc (Table 1). 3.2.
    Correlation of phenotypic parameters related to individual irrigation rate The
    only significant correlation found between phenotypic parameters under the full
    irrigation treatment (1.00 ETc) was a positive and strong correlation between
    GY and RWC, with a coefficient of 0.70 (Table 2). Under moderate (0.75 ETc) and
    severe water stress (0.50 ETc) treatments, all phenotypic parameters showed a
    stronger positive or negative correlation with each other, with the exception
    of the correlation between GY and LWP under the 0.75 ETc treatment. In addition,
    all phenotypic parameters showed a stronger relationship with each other under
    0.50 ETc compared with 0.75 ETc (Table 2). Table 2. Pearson’s correlation matrix

    and phenotypic parameters The relationship between the original spectral reflectance
    of the full wavelength range (350 to 2500 nm) and the tested phenotypic parameters
    were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients and the pooled data of years,
    replications, irrigation rates, and cultivars (Fig. 1). Generally, the wavelengths
    in the near-infrared (NIR, 700–1300 nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1300–2500 nm)
    regions exhibited higher Pearson correlation coefficients with all phenotypic
    parameters than those in the visible (VIS, 400–700 nm) region. LWP was positively
    correlated with the wavelengths in the VIS and SWIR regions, while the other parameters
    (RWC, EWT, and GY) displayed opposite relations; the opposite held true for the
    wavelengths in the NIR region. The wavelengths in the three parts of the spectrum
    (VIS, NIR, and SWIR) exhibited higher correlation with RWC and GY than the LWP
    and EWT. The wavelength intervals from 708 to 734 nm in the NIR region, and from
    1301 to 1388 nm in the SWIR were the only two regions that showed no significant
    correlation with all phenotypic parameters. The peaks with the strongest correlations
    were observed around 351, 518, and 687 nm in the VIS region, 762, 974, 1100, and
    1240 nm in the NIR region, and 1392, 1515, 1930, and 2273 nm in the SWIR region

    yield (GY) per hectare based on pooled data of years, replications, water irrigation
    rates, and cultivars. 3.4. The relationships between wavelengths and phenotypic
    parameters determined using a contour map To further identify the sensitive band
    regions in the full wavelength range (350 to 2500 nm), the coefficients of determination
    (R2) of the relationships between phenotypic parameters and all normalized difference
    spectral indices (NDSIs), based on the combination of one wavelength on the horizontal
    axis (wavelength-1) and one wavelength on the vertical axis (wavelength-2), were
    plotted on contour maps, which is a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional
    data, using the pooled data of years, replications, irrigation rates, and cultivars
    (n = 54) (Fig. 2). The relationships between phenotypic parameters and NDSIs were
    determined using the linear regression fits. Based on R2, wavelengths in the VIS
    region on the vertical axis showed significant relationships with phenotypic parameters
    when they combined only with wavelengths in the NIR region on the horizontal axis.
    Wavelengths in the NIR region on the vertical axis observed significant relationships
    with phenotypic parameters when they combined with wavelengths in the SWIR regions
    on the horizontal axis. The combination of wavelengths in the SWIR region on both
    the vertical and horizontal axes showed significant relationships with phenotypic
    parameters (Fig. 2). The R2 values for the relationships between phenotypic parameters
    and NDSIs were mostly greater than 0.60 when the NDSIs were based on the combination
    of wavelengths in the NIR and SWIR regions on the vertical axis and wavelengths
    in the SWIR region on the horizontal axis, or based on the combination of wavelengths
    in the VIS region on the vertical axis and wavelengths in the NIR region on the
    horizontal axis (yellow color in Fig. 2). The hotspot regions for R2 values larger
    than 0.80 were confined between the wavelength interval from 740 to 1240 nm on
    the vertical axis, and the wavelength intervals from 1300 to 1550 nm and 1900
    to 2200 nm on the horizontal axis, as well as at around 2100 nm on the vertical
    axis and around 2300 nm on the horizontal axis (white color in Fig. 2). Download

    Contour maps of coefficients of determination (R2) within the full wavelengths
    (350–2500 nm) between the normalized difference spectral indices (NDSIs) and the
    parameters of leaf water potential (LWP), relative water content (RWC), equivalent
    water thickness (EWT), and grain yield (GY) per hectare based on pooled data of
    years, replications, water irrigation rates, and cultivars. 3.5. Formulation of
    novel NDSIs to remotely assess phenotypic parameters Fifty-nine NDSIs were constructed
    in this study using all possible combinations of wavelengths, which were identified
    by the strongest peaks in Fig. 1 (NDSIs No. 1-59 in Table 3). The efficiency of
    these NDSIs in the estimation of phenotypic parameters was compared with seven
    published spectral reflectance indices (SRIs No. 60-66 in Table 3), which are
    sensitive to plant water status. The best models of regression and coefficients
    of determination (R2) for the relationships for all data (n = 54) between phenotypic
    parameters and these sixty-six spectral indices are summarized in Table 3. The
    linear and quadratic polynomial regressions were the best models fitting the relationships
    between NDSIs and LWP and RWC, while the exponential regression and quadratic
    polynomial regressions best modeled the relationships between NDSIs and EWT. The
    three types of regression models (linear, quadratic polynomial, and exponential)
    were the best models providing the highest R2 for the relationships between NDSIs
    and GY (Table 3). Generally, most NDSIs estimated RWC and GY better than LWP and
    EWT. The NDSIs that incorporate VIS/VIS or SWIR/VIS were poorly correlated with
    all phenotypic parameters, while most NDSIs that incorporate NIR/VIS, NIR/NIR,
    or SWIR/NIR showed strongest relationships with all phenotypic parameters, with
    R2 values for these relationships ranging from 0.50 to 0.68, from 0.58 to 0.81,
    from 0.54 to 0.69, and from 0.59 to 0.81 for LWP, RWC, EWT, and GY, respectively
    (Table 3). In addition, these NDSIs were competitive with the published SRIs (No.
    60-66 in Table 3) in estimating the phenotypic parameters, with the moisture stress
    index (MSI), normalized difference water index-1640 (NDWI1640), and NDSI (860,
    1640, 2130) showed strongest relationships with all phenotypic parameters. The
    corresponding R2 for these relationships ranged from 0.65 to 0.66, 0.78 to 0.82,
    0.65 to 0.68, and 0.73 to 0.74 for LWP, RWC, EWT, and GY, respectively. The water
    index (WI) and normalized water index-3 (NWI-3) were comparable to the MSI, NDWI1640,
    and NDSI (860, 1640, 2130) in estimating LWP and RWC (Table 3). Table 3. The best
    models of regression and coefficients of determination (R2) for the relationships,

    of phenotypic parameters for each irrigation rate using a wide range of NDSIs
    Twelve different NDSIs (eight NDSIs constructed in this study and four NDSIs published
    in the literature) were selected from the previous 66 NDSIs to assess the phenotypic
    parameters individually for each irrigation rate. The relationships between these
    twelve NDSIs and phenotypic parameters are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig.
    6. Coefficients of determination (R2) values for these relationships depended
    on irrigation rate and phenotypic parameters. All selected NDSIs (constructed
    and published NDSIs) failed to assess LWP and EWT under the full irrigation treatment
    (1.00 ETc). All published NDSIs (MSI, NWI-3, NDWI1640, and NDSI (860, 1640, 2130))
    and two constructed NDSIs (NDSI (1240, 687), and NDSI (2273, 1240)) also failed
    to assess GY under the same irrigation rate. Except NDSI (1240, 687) and NWI-3,
    the other NDSIs showed a moderate to strong correlation with RWC under the 1.00
    ETc treatment (R2 = 0.51 – 0.70) (Fig. 4). Under severe water stress (0.50 ETc),
    most selected NDSIs were highly correlated with LWP (R2 = 0.74 – 0.82) and GY
    (R2 = 0.73 – 0.89) (Fig. 3, Fig. 6) but showed weak and moderate correlations
    with RWC (R2 = 0.36 – 0.69) and EWT (R2 = 0.33 – 0.67), with the exception of
    NWI-3 and NDSI (860, 1640, 2130)), which showed a strong relationship (Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5). Under the moderate irrigation rate (0.75 ETc), most selected NDSIs failed
    to assess EWT; while most correlations associated with the other parameters (LWP,
    RWC, and GY) showed moderate to strong correlations (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig.
    6). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image

    based on different NDSIs The twelve NDSIs, which were used to assess the phenotypic
    parameters for each irrigation rate, were also used to predict the measured phenotypic
    parameters. The data of NDSIs of the second year were used to predict the measured
    phenotypic parameters of the first year. Table 4 shows various statistical parameters
    for determining the accuracy of the validation of predictive models between the
    observed and predicted values of the phenotypic parameter (see materials and methods).
    A model with highest values of R2 and slope and lowest values of RMSE, RE, and
    PC displayed the beast prediction accuracy. The models that fulfilled most criteria
    of the six statistical parameters were selected for accurate prediction of each
    phenotypic parameter and presented on a 1:1 scatter plot line (Fig. 7). In general,
    based on the criteria of six parameters, different models of the twelve NDSIs
    provided a more accurate estimation of RWC and GY than of LWP and EWT. Among the
    twelve NDSIs, five confirmed the most criteria of the accuracies of the models
    for each phenotypic parameter (Fig. 7 and Table 4). The models based on NDSI No.
    39 (NDSI (1930, 974)), No. 44 (NDSI (1930, 1100)), and No. 58 (NDSI (762, 518,
    1930)) provided accurate estimation of all phenotypic parameters (No. of NDSIs
    listed in Table 3). The four phenotypic parameters can also be estimated effectively
    from the prediction models based on the NDSI No. 56 (NDSI (974, 518, 1392)), with
    the exception of LWP. The LWP, RWC, and GY can also be estimated effectively from
    the prediction models based on NDSIs No. 65 (NDWI1640), No. 32 (NDSI (1515, 762)),
    and No. 23 (NDSI (1240, 687)), respectively. The models based on the NDSI No.
    66 (NDSI (860, 1640, 2130)) provided accurate estimation for only LWP and EWT
    (Table 4 and Fig. 7). Furthermore, the three-band NDSIs, such as NDSIs No. 56
    and No. 58, provided accurate estimation of LWP and RWC similar to the two-band
    NDSIs, but provided more accurate estimation of EWT and GY than the two-band NDSIs.
    Importantly, some NDSIs formulated in this study such as NDSIs No. 39, 44, 56,
    and 58 provided more accurate estimation of the measured phenotypic parameters
    than the published NDSIs such as NDSIs No. 62, 63, and 65 (Table 4). Table 4.

    The NDSIs selected based on various statistical parameters are listed in Table
    4. The numbers (No.) of NDSIs are presented in Table 3. The data of the NDSIs
    of the second year were used to predict the measured parameters of the first year.

    partial least squares regression (PLSR) with full cross-validation The eleven
    wavelengths selected from Fig. 1 and sixty-six NDSIs listed in Table 3 as independent
    data were also used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters using the PLSR
    model. The data of spectral reflectance of eleven wavelengths or the data of sixty-six
    NDSIs of the second year were used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters
    of the first year using the pooled data of years, replications, irrigation rates,
    and cultivars. The equation, R2 and RMSE of the linear validations between the
    observed and predicted values of all phenotypic parameters are shown in Fig. 8.
    In general, different models of the spectral reflectance or NDSIs provided also
    a more accurate estimation of RWC and GY than of LWP and EWT as such as the individual
    NDSI. In addition, the performance of PLSR model was the same and sometimes better
    than some individual NDSIs for assessment of phenotypic parameters. Download :

    reflectance of eleven wavelengths or the data of sixty-six normalized difference
    spectral indices (NDSIs) plotted on 1:1 line. The data of spectral reflectance
    or spectral indices of the second year across all treatments were used to predict
    the measured parameters of the first year. Table 5 summarizes the statistical
    parameters of the calibration and validation results of the PLSR models for predicting
    phenotypic parameters based on eleven wavelengths selected from Fig. 1 and sixty-six
    NDSIs listed in Table 3 (Fifty-nine NDSIs formulated from the eleven wavelengths
    and seven published NDSIs). The PLSR models were determined for each season across
    irrigation rates and cultivars as well as for each irrigation rate across two
    seasons and cultivars (Table 5). Generally, increasing the number factors of PLSR
    models tended to decrease RMSE and increase R2 and slope of regression in both
    calibration and validation models. An accurate model should have a low RMSE value
    with high values for R2 and slope. Based on all 14-wavelengths, these principles
    of accurate model were observed in 7, 4, and 7 factors of the PLSR model for LWP,
    RWC, and EWT, respectively, in the 2nd season, as well as in 5 and 4 factors for
    RWC and EWT for 0.75 ETc. Based on all 66-NDSIs, these principles were found in
    4 and 6 factors for RWC and GY in the 1st season, 7 and 7 factors for LWP and
    EWT in the 2nd season, 7 and 5 factors for LWP and RWC for 0.75 ETc, and 7 and
    6 factors for LWP and GY for 0.50 ETc, respectively, in both the calibration and
    validation models (Table 5). Based on either wavelengths or NDSIs, the PLSR model
    showed greater modeling and prediction accuracy for phenotypic parameters in the
    2nd season than in the 1st season as well as for 0.75 and 0.50 ETc than 1.00 ETc.
    Generally, the R2 and slope of regression in the calibration sets were higher
    than those in the validation sets; the opposite held true for RMSE. Interestingly,
    the PLSR model failed to predict the LWP, EWT, and GY in both calibration and
    validation sets under the 1.00 ETc treatment when based on wavelengths, as well
    as LWP and EWT under the same treatment when based on NDSIs. The validation sets
    were poorer than the calibration sets for EWT under 0.75 and 0.50 ETc when the
    PLSR model was based on wavelengths and NDSIs, as well as for RWC under 0.50 ETc
    and LWP and EWT in the 1st season when the PLSR model was based on NDSIs, but
    still showed significant relationships between the measured and predicted values
    (R2 ranged from 0.28 to 0.46, Table 5). Table 5. Model summary for predicting

    between plant water status and crop production Crop productivity under deficit
    irrigation is closely related to plant water status, and the latter status is
    directly influenced by soil water conditions. As expected, increasing deficit
    irrigation stress negatively affected the plant water relations, which in turn
    reduced leaf expansion and elongation, leaf initiation rates, and dry matter accumulation,
    ultimately resulting in significant reduction in final grain yield. Therefore,
    the assessment of plant water status through monitoring the status of leaf water
    potential (LWP), relative water content (RWC), and equivalent water thickness
    (EWT) could provide important insights for enhancing crop productivity under deficit
    irrigation stress by taking the right decisions of the irrigation scheduling,
    such as when and how much water should be applied. RWC is an immediate response
    to deficit irrigation at the canopy level, and thus is widely used for describing
    the water stress levels (Chaves et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2016). Changes in LWP,
    which provides a good indication of the degree of tissue and cell hydration, are
    synchronously accompanied by the changes in the soil water potential next to the
    plant roots (Bellvert et al., 2016; Elsayed et al., 2011; Gutierrez et al., 2010).
    Drought stress affects EWT before any symptoms appear on the canopy. Therefore,
    detecting the changes in EWT under deficit irrigation stress provides an early-warning
    signal for water deficit in the soil next to the plant roots (Ihuoma and Madramootoo,
    2017; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2003). This indicates that these three plant water
    relation parameters could serve as key indicators for providing information about
    the actual water stress level, and thus accurate detection of these parameters
    could potentially minimize crop irreversible physiological damage and yield loss
    under deficit irrigation conditions. As observed in this study, final grain yield
    (GY) per hectare gradually decreased with decreasing irrigation rates, and was
    accompanied by parallel reductions in LWP, RWC, and EWT (Table 1). This result
    was also supported by the strong positive and negative correlations between GY
    and the three plant water relation parameters under moderate (0.75 ETc) (except
    for LWP) and severe (0.50 ETc) water stress treatments (Table 2). Close relationships
    between GY and these plant water relation parameters on one side, and the strong
    relationships between each other on the other side suggest that these three plant
    water status parameters could be used to understand the mechanisms of plant response
    and adaption to deficit irrigation stress and optimize crop production through
    right irrigation scheduling. 4.2. Performance of spectral reflectance for assessment
    of plant water status and grain yield The relative importance of these three plant
    water status parameters in improving irrigation water management depends on monitoring
    their status at frequent times in order to determine irrigation thresholds and
    implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling. Fortunately, various changes
    in plant water status, which can be induced by deficit irrigation stress, generate
    variability in the canopy spectral reflectance in the range of 400–2500 nm (El-Hendawy
    et al., 2017a). Therefore, many studies have shown significant correlations between
    different water relation parameters and spectral information of the canopy at
    different wavelengths, which offers the possibility of assessing plant water status
    in a non-destructive and expeditious manner using the spectroradiometer (El-Hendawy
    et al., 2017a; Elsayed et al., 2017; Erdle et al., 2011, 2013). In this study,
    with the exception of the wavelength intervals from 708 to 734 nm and 1301 to
    1388 nm, all other wavelengths in the three parts of the spectrum showed moderate
    to strong significant correlations with the three plant water relation parameters
    and GY (r = ±0.50 – ±0.84) with some clear peaks at around 351, 518, and 687 nm
    in the visible region (VIS), 762, 974, 1100, and 1240 nm in the near-infrared
    region (NIR), and 1392, 1515, 1930, and 2273 nm in the shortwave-infrared region
    (SWIR) (Fig. 1). These results reveal that these eleven peaks may have some specific
    roles in the eco-physiological process that is directly and indirectly associated
    with the plant water status. Therefore, building different spectral reflectance
    indices (SRIs) based on these wavelengths could be used effectively to assess
    the leaf water relation parameters and grain yield. Interestingly, a series of
    typical wavelengths have been identified in literature at the reflection peaks,
    valleys, and inflection points of the canopy spectral reflectance from VIS to
    SWIR of the spectrum ranges. Previous studies have shown that the wavebands centered
    at 540, 610, 630, 680, 760, 970, 1100, 1200, 1240 1400, 1450, 1730, 1930, 2100,
    2250, and 2500 nm provided insights for estimating different parameters related
    to plant water status under different irrigation treatments and for different
    crops (Cheng et al., 2010; Curran et al., 2001; Clevers et al., 2008; Elsayed
    et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2014). Datt (1999) reported significant negative correlations
    between the wavelengths intervals of 1120–1870 nm and 1980–2440 nm and EWT. Kriston-Vizi
    et al. (2008) reported moderate correlations between the plant water status of
    mandarin and peach canopies, expressed by LWP, and reflectance at green (490–580 nm)
    and red (580–760 nm) regions. Sun et al. (2008) reported that the wavelengths
    in the SWIR region (i.e., 1502, 1391, and 1656 nm) were also found to be more
    sensitive to changes in RWC in olive plants exposed to different levels of water
    stress than other wavelengths in the NIR region. Zhang et al. (2012) also found
    significant correlations (r > 0.60) between leaf water content and the wavelength
    intervals of 553–556 nm, 689–720 nm, 755–842 nm, 950–970 nm, 1013–1034 nm, and
    1055–1075 nm under different water stress levels. In grass (Poa pratensis), Bayat
    et al. (2016) found that the wavelengths at 1400, 1516, 1870, 2225, and 2273 nm
    exhibited strong relationships with leaf water content under drought stress. All
    the wavelengths listed above, other published wavelengths not mentioned here,
    or the wavelengths discovered in this study indicate that the effects of leaf
    water status on spectral reflectance may include both direct and indirect effects.
    The direct effects, which are manifested by the magnitude in spectral reflectance
    in the SWIR region, are related to the plant water status as well as to leaf biochemical
    properties that are independent of leaf water status such as sugar, cellulose,
    or lignin. The indirect effects, which are manifested by changes in spectral reflectance
    in the VIS and NIR regions, are not explained by the spectral properties of plant
    water status but associated with other vegetation properties such as leaf pigment
    concentration, cell wall–air interfaces, leaf anatomy, and the leaf thickness
    and structure, which are indirect influenced by the state of hydration in the
    leaf. Therefore, it is feasible to use different wavelengths from the three parts
    of the spectrum (VIS, NIR, and SWIR) and incorporate it in the different SRIs
    to assess changes in plant water relation parameters and grain yield under different
    levels of irrigation rates. The contour map (Fig. 2), which shows the best coefficients
    of determination (R2) between phenotypic parameters and normalized difference
    spectral indices (NDSIs) based on linear regression, and the data in Table 3,
    which shows the best models of regression and R2 for the relationships between
    the tested parameters and 55 NDSIs constructed from the possible combinations
    of eleven wavelength peaks and 7 published NDSIs, reinforce these findings and
    also show that the NDSIs based on NIR-vs.-VIS, NIR-vs.-NIR, SWIR-vs.-NIR, and
    SWIR-vs.-SWIR wavelengths showed significant relationships (R2 values ranging
    from 0.50 to 0.81) with the three plant water relation parameters and GY. The
    NDSIs based on VIS-vs.-VIS wavelengths failed to track the changes in these parameters.
    These findings also reinforce the direct and indirect effects of the state of
    water hydration in the leaf on spectral reflectance features, as well as suggest
    that it is advantageous to construct the NDSIs based on combined information from
    the three parts of the spectrum (VIS, NIR, and SWIR) to assess plant water relations
    and crop productivity under a wide range of water irrigation rates. Furthermore,
    these findings also indicate that to build new NDSIs for monitoring plant water
    relations, the NDSIs should be established using bands not sensitive to plant
    water content. The absorption of light by water in tissues at these bands is very
    weak or do not occur, which makes them suitable for use as reference bands. These
    bands should be combined with bands sensitive to plant water content and the absorption
    of light by water in tissues at these bands is moderate or high. Data from literature
    allow us to conclude that the NDSIs formulated using SWIR combined with NIR, combining
    two wavelengths from the NIR regions, but the energy of one of them is not absorbed
    by water in tissues, or using NIR combined with VIS are useful for monitoring
    the plant water relations for different crops under different levels of water
    stress (Bayat et al., 2016; Ceccato et al., 2002; Colombo et al., 2008; Elsayed
    et al., 2011; Gao, 1996; Gutierrez et al., 2010; Ollinger, 2011). Elsayed et al.
    (2011) also assessed LWP of wheat under drought stress using the SRI (R100/R1100).
    Strong correlations between the SRI based on the ratio between the water index
    (WI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and RWC, as well as
    between NWI-3 and LWP of wheat have been reported (Gutierrez et al., 2010; Kakani
    et al., 2007). Winterhalter et al. (2011) successfully identified strong relationships
    between the water status of wheat and SRIs based on VIS/NIR regions. Ruthenkolk
    et al. (2002) also reported that although the NDSIs based only on the SWIR regions
    delivered favorable relationships with LWP, the NDSI based on the NIR/VIS regions
    were found to be more related to LWP. Yao et al. (2014) successfully estimated
    EWT in wheat under various water regimes using a three-band index (R1429–R416–R1865)/(R1429+R416+R1865).
    No consistent relationship was found between the photochemical reflectance index
    (PRI), which is based only on the VIS, and the water potential of olive plants
    because PRI was strongly affected by canopy structure and soil background (Suárez
    et al., 2008). Different factors affect the measured canopy spectral reflectance,
    affecting the performance of SRIs for tracking the changes in the measured parameters
    under different conditions. For instance, some SRIs performed the best for tracking
    the changes in the measured parameters under drought stress conditions but failed
    to track these changes under well-watered conditions and vice versa. Garriga et
    al. (2017) found that various SRIs showed the strongest predictive power for assessment
    of the measured parameters when the data of spectral reflectance for full irrigation
    and water stress were combined together as compared with the results obtained
    for individual treatments. On the contrary, El-Hendawy et al. (2017a) reported
    that various SRIs failed to track the changes in transpiration rate (E) when the
    data of spectral reflectance of different irrigation rates were pooled together,
    whereas they successfully tracked these changes under each irrigation rate. Elsayed
    et al. (2011) also found that the changes in LWP of wheat can reliably be tracked
    under either well-watered or water stress conditions. The results of this study
    showed that most selected NDSIs showed moderate to strong relationships with RWC
    under the full irrigation rate (R2 = 0.51–0.70), although they failed to assess
    the LWP and EWT, which suggest that the relationships between the NDSIs and both
    LWP and EWT were independent of RWC under full irrigation conditions (Fig. 3,
    Fig. 4, Fig. 5). However, half of the NDSIs (six out of 12 NDSIs) showed moderate
    relationships with GY under full irrigation conditions (R2 = 0.41–0.65, Fig. 6).
    Although the LWP was tracked effectively by the NDSIs under both moderate (0.75
    ETc) and severe (0.50 ETc) water stress conditions similar to RWC and GY, these
    NDSIs showed moderate to strong relationships with EWT under severe water stress
    conditions only (R2 = 0.43–0.70, Fig. 5). These results indicate that major changes
    in EWT did not occur until the plants were exposed to highly water stress conditions
    and therefore the analyzed NDSIs are not able to detect light and moderate changes
    in EWT under full and moderate irrigation conditions. Furthermore, EWT may be
    less related to spectral reflectance than to RWC and sometimes LWP. The reason
    for this may be that although the EWT provides information about canopy water
    content such as the RWC and LWP, it is very sensitive to changes in the leaf area
    of the plant. Severe water stress is sufficient to notably decrease the plant
    leaf area. Thus, strong responses of leaf area to severe water stress may also
    have strong impacts on the canopy spectral reflectance. Therefore, the results
    of this study suggest that EWT does not directly provide information about water
    status as such as LWP and RWC, because it is dependent of the leaf area of the
    plant. 4.3. Validation of predictive models The three water relation parameters
    (LWP, RWC, and EWT) and GY were estimated from the developed predictive models
    based on the twelve NDSIs that are used for tracking changes in these parameters
    under each irrigation rate. Interestingly, all of these twelve NDSI models provided
    very good prediction accuracy of all parameters as indicated by the six validation
    statistics, with the prediction of RWC and GY being more accurate than those of
    LWP and EWT. At least five out of the 12 NDSI models were selected for each parameter
    with very high accuracy because they fulfilled most criteria of the six validation
    statistics (Table 4 and Fig. 7). The new NDSIs constructed in this study such
    as NDSIs No. 32, 39, 44, and 49 as well as the published SRIs such as SRIs No.
    62 and 65, which showed very good prediction accuracy with the observed values
    of all phenotypic parameters, combined most relevant SWIR wavelengths with the
    most relevant NIR wavelengths (Table 4). The three-band indices, such as NDSIs
    No. 56, 58, and 66, also combined SWIR wavelengths together with NIR and VIS wavelengths.
    This indicates that most NDSIs composed of the NIR and SWIR bands could be used
    for indirect management of irrigation scheduling through detecting the changes
    in plant water status. The three water relation parameters tested in this study
    are always used to detect the water status of plants. This is because the sensitivity
    of the NDSIs to changes in plant water status depends on the selection of the
    wavelengths whose energy are weakly and strongly absorbed by water, which found
    always with the NIR and SWIR wavelengths, respectively. The wavelengths within
    the SWIR region are less sensitive to noise caused by the leaf internal structure,
    penetrate less far into the canopy, and are more sensitive to changes in plant
    water status; the opposite is true for the wavelengths within the NIR region (Eitel
    et al., 2006; Mariotto et al., 2013; Rapaport et al., 2017). As a result, the
    models derived from this study are simple, applicable, and conforms to the principle
    of remote sensing in management of irrigation scheduling. The results of this
    study also showed that the tested phenotypic parameters can also be accurately
    estimated from the prediction models based on the NDSIs that incorporate NIR-VIS
    regions such as NDSI No. 5 (NDSI (1100, 351)) or only NIR wavelengths such as
    NDSI No. 63 (NWI3 = R970–R880)/(R970 + R880). These results indicate significant
    responses of leaf structure, photosynthetic efficiency, and photosynthetic pigments
    to deficit irrigation stress. Therefore, it is likely that a cheaper NIR–VIS broadband
    sensor may be suitable also for detecting vegetation water status under a range
    of irrigation water levels. This assumption is supported by Becker and Schmidhalter
    (2017); Elsayed et al. (2011); Gutierrez et al. (2010); Marino et al. (2014);
    Prasad et al. (2007); Rapaport et al. (2017), and Ruthenkolk et al. (2002), who
    reported that the NIR-based indices and NIR–VIS based indices are sufficient to
    detect the parameters of plant water status such as LWP and RWC, and are sufficient
    to explain a large proportion of the variability in GY. The NIR wavelengths at
    970 and 1100 nm penetrate deeper into the canopy and successfully detect the direct
    changes in the internal leaf structure caused by water deficit, and therefore
    are also suitable for detecting changes in plant water status. However, the other
    wavelengths at 880 and 351 nm are used as a reference because their energy is
    not absorbed by water. 4.4. Evaluation of the partial least square regression
    (PLSR) model Although several SRIs have great potential for detecting the changes
    in different phenotypic parameters of plants under different environmental conditions,
    most common SRIs with simple ratios and normalized or combined formulas focus
    on 2–3 wavelengths only. This makes it difficult to build a unified spectral index
    to cover most associated bands related to the crop biophysical and biochemical
    parameters as well as to deal with potentially confounding factors. Several researchers
    have used PLSR to improve the prediction accuracy of phenotypic parameters of
    plants by using several and different sensitive wavelengths or SRIs (Colombo et
    al., 2008; Elsayed et al., 2017; Gislum et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2013; Li et
    al., 2014). For instance, Colombo et al. (2008) examined the performance of different
    SRIs for estimation of leaf EWT using the model of PLSR. The results of this study
    showed that leaf EWT could be successfully estimated through different SRIs using
    the PLSR model, with the mean relative errors between the predicted and the measured
    values around 19%. Jin et al. (2013) also reported that the PLSR model has great
    potential similar to the three-band indices for estimating the leaf water content
    of winter wheat under water stress conditions using the entire spectral dataset,
    with R2 value of 0.74 and RMSE value of 9.82%. Elsayed et al. (2017) also found
    that the PLSR model based on different NDSIs improved the estimation accuracy
    of leaf and canopy RWC of wheat by decreasing the RMSE value and increasing the
    coefficients of determination. Garriga et al. (2017) compared different regression
    algorithms including PLSR with different SRIs for the estimation of different
    agronomic parameters of wheat under full irrigation and water stress conditions;
    the results indicated that the PLSR model was similar to or better than the individual
    SRIs for estimation of GY. Similarly, the results of this study found that the
    PLSR model based on either the data of spectral reflectance of eleven wavelengths
    selected from Fig. 1 or the data of sixty-six NDSIs listed in Table 3 was similar
    to or better than most individual NDSIs for estimation of water relation parameters
    and GY (Fig. 8). PLSR was better than the NDSI for estimation of LWP and EWT in
    the 2nd year and LWP under 0.75 and 0.50 ETc treatments, especially in the validation
    datasets (Table 5). This further confirms that the PLSR model includes a wide
    range of sensitive wavelengths compared to the method of SRIs. 5. Conclusion In
    this study, close relationships between GY and three parameters of plant water
    relations (LWP, RWC, and EWT) under moderate and severe water stress conditions
    suggested that accurate and real-time estimation of these three plant water status
    parameters could be useful for irrigation scheduling and maximizing the water
    productivity of wheat. The observed significant relationships between plant water
    status parameters and the spectral information of the canopy at different wavelengths
    identified a series of novel wavelengths and, therefore, indicate that it is possible
    to assess changes in plant water status in a non-destructive and expeditious manner
    using the spectroradiometer. In this study, Fifty-nine novel NDSIs were also developed
    and the NIR/VIS, NIR/NIR, SWIR/NIR, and SWIR/SWIR based indices were most effective
    for tracking changes in leaf water status and GY. Different phenotypic parameters
    can be estimated from the prediction models based on a series novel NDSIs with
    very high accuracy. Acknowledgments The authors extend their appreciation to the

    Citation Excerpt : The primary effects are directly related to the absorption
    of radiation by water, imposing a strong influence over shortwave infrared (SWIR)
    wavelengths. The secondary effects cannot be explained solely by the water absorption
    of radiation but also by its indirect relation to the leaf structure and physiology,
    imposing a substantial influence over visible and near-infrared wavelengths (Carter,
    1991; El-Hendawy et al., 2019). Visible wavelengths (between 400 nm and 720 nm)
    are associated with the leaf pigments and the absorption of photosynthetically
    active radiation and, under water stress, there is lower light absorption, leading
    to higher values of reflectance (Carter, 1991; Singer et al., 2011; Gitelson et

  title: Potential of the existing and novel spectral reflectance indices for estimating
    the leaf water status and grain yield of spring wheat exposed to different irrigation
    rates
  verbatim_quote1: The peak-wavelengths around 351, 518, and 687 nm in the VIS, 762,
    974, 1100, and 1240 nm in the NIR, and 1392, 1515, 1930, and 2273 nm in the SWIR
    regions were the most sensitive to indicate plant water status and were used for
    formulating new spectral indices.

  analysis: Growth determinants in wheat under drought conditions are critical in
    crop improvement programs. We evaluated the association of several water spectral
    indices (WSIs) with plant and soil water status in contrasting wheat genotypes
    under a range of field conditions. We examined the normalized water index 3 (NWI-3),
    one of the most consistent associations with water status parameters, which demonstrated
    a significant relationship with leaf water potential across a wide range of values.
    The NWI-3 showed associations with canopy temperature, a measure of water flow
    associated with water extraction from the soil, and was related to soil water
    potential and available volumetric soil water, indicating drought-tolerant genotypes
    could extract more water from deeper layers. The study suggests the potential
    application of NWI-3 in rapid and cost-effective screening for genotypes with
    enhanced water status and potential yield under drought conditions.

    Abstract Spectral reflectance indices can be used to estimate the water status
    of plants in a rapid, non-destructive manner. Water spectral indices were measured
    on wheat under a range of water-deficit conditions in field-based yield trials
    to establish their relationship with water relations parameters as well as available
    volumetric soil water (AVSW) to indicate soil water extraction patterns. Three
    types of wheat germplasm were studied which showed a range of drought adaptation;
    near-isomorphic sister lines from an elite/elite cross, advanced breeding lines,
    and lines derived from interspecific hybridization with wild relatives (synthetic
    derivative lines). Five water spectral indices (one water index and four normalized
    water indices) based on near infrared wavelengths were determined under field
    conditions between the booting and grain-filling stages of crop development. Among
    all water spectral indices, one in particular, which was denominated as NWI-3,
    showed the most consistent associations with water relations parameters and demonstrated
    the strongest associations in all three germplasm sets. NWI-3 showed a strong
    linear relationship (r2 >0.6–0.8) with leaf water potential (ψleaf) across a broad
    range of values (–2.0 to –4.0 MPa) that were determined by natural variation in
    the environment associated with intra- and inter-seasonal affects. Association
    observed between NWI-3 and canopy temperature (CT) was consistent with the idea
    that genotypes with a better hydration status have a larger water flux (increased
    stomatal conductance) during the day. NWI-3 was also related to soil water potential
    (ψsoil) and AVSW, indicating that drought-adapted lines could extract more water
    from deeper soil profiles to maintain favourable water relations. NWI-3 was sufficiently
    sensitive to detect genotypic differences (indicated by phenotypic and genetic
    correlations) in water status at the canopy and soil levels indicating its potential
    application in precision phenotyping. Canopy reflectance, canopy water content,

    Introduction Crop water status is an important consideration in dryland agriculture
    and is influenced by many factors including environmental conditions, agronomic
    practices, soil properties, and crop growth (Hanks, 1988). Plant water status
    provides information that can be used to prevent crop water deficit through irrigation
    (Koksal, 2008), to select genotypes in breeding (Munjal and Dhanda, 2005), and
    to assess crop growth under drought conditions (Tucker, 1980; Peñuelas et al.,
    1993). Several methods are used to determine crop water content; leaf water potential
    (ψleaf) is the standard while leaf relative water content (RWC) is often used
    as a substitute (Slatyer, 1967). Other approaches for estimating water flow through
    plants include measuring leaf stomatal conductance in irrigated environments (Amani
    et al., 1996) and measuring canopy temperature (CT) as a relative measure of water
    flow associated with water extraction from the soil under water deficit (Reynolds
    et al., 2007). Plant water status can also be assessed remotely by measuring canopy
    reflectance indices, since they change in response to crop water content (Peñuelas
    et al., 1997; Ustin et al., 1998; Stimson et al., 2005). As a technique, canopy
    spectral reflectance offers a number of advantages, such as easy and quick measurements,
    integration at the canopy level and the fact that additional parameters can be
    estimated simultaneously via a series of diverse spectral indices (i.e. photosynthetic
    capacity, leaf area index, intercepted radiation, and chlorophyll content) (Araus
    et al., 2001). Given its versatility, canopy reflectance is a valuable tool for
    high throughput phenotyping (Montes et al., 2007; Chapman, 2008). Energy is strongly
    absorbed by water at specific wavelengths and different reflectance indices have
    been suggested for predicting crop water content (Peñuelas et al., 1993; Gao,
    1996, 1997; Serrano et al., 2000; Stimson et al., 2005). Wavelengths in the near
    infrared (NIR; 700–1300 nm) and in the short infrared (SIR; 1300–2500 nm) regions
    have been employed for monitoring plant water status and several water bands have
    been proposed in the electromagnetic spectrum at 970, 1240, 1400, and 2700 nm
    (Tucker, 1980; Peñuelas et al., 1993; Gao, 1996; Zarco-Tejada and Ustin, 2001;
    Anderson et al., 2004; Stimson et al., 2005). Gao (1996) developed and proposed
    the normalized difference water index (NDWI; [R860–R1240]/[R860+R1240]) to sense
    vegetative water content using air-borne imagery with high image resolution. Anderson
    et al. (2004) utilized this index to determine canopy water content in soybean
    and corn by employing air-borne imagery (ASIRIS). Stimson et al. (2005) found
    that the NDWI and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; [R900–R680]/[R900+R680])
    showed significant correlation with leaf water content and water potential (r2=0.44–0.71)
    in two conifer species (Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma). Zarco-Tejada and
    Ustin (2001) and Zarco Tejeda et al. (2003) modelled the simple ratio water index
    (SRWI, R860/R1240) to estimate the vegetation water content in relation to leaf
    thickness, biomass, and leaf area index. The water index (WI, R970/R900) proposed
    by Peñuelas et al. (1993) has been used to estimate water status in Phaseolus
    vulgaris, Capsicum annuum, and Gerbera jamesonii, and was associated with RWC
    under water-stressed conditions. In broccoli plants, the WI explained variations
    in plant water content as well as total biomass under diverse water treatments
    (El-Shikha et al., 2007). Babar et al. (2006) proposed two normalized water indices
    (NWI-–1=[R970–R900]/[R970+R900] and NWI-2=[R970–R850]/[R970+R850]) based on the
    water index proposed by Peñuelas et al. (1993) for screening grain yield in spring
    wheat genotypes under well-irrigated and water-deficient, stressed conditions.
    Two additional normalized water indices (NWI-3=[R970–R880]/[R970+R880] and NWI-4=[R970–R920]/[R970+R920])
    have been proposed for use in screening the grain yield of advanced lines of winter
    wheat under rainfed conditions (Prasad et al., 2007). These five water indices
    (WI and four NWIs) have explained a large proportion of grain yield variability
    and are an alternative approach for selecting high yielding lines in wheat for
    diverse environments (Babar et al., 2006; Prasad et al., 2007). The water indices
    (WIs) are based on the hypothesis that the NIR wavelengths (970 nm) penetrate
    deeper into the canopy and therefore accurately estimate water content (Babar
    et al., 2006; Prasad et al., 2007; Gutierrez et al., 2010). The association between
    the WIs and grain yield indicates that canopy water content plays a vital role
    in determining yield of wheat genotypes under optimal as well as adverse growth
    conditions (Babar et al., 2006; Prasad et al., 2007). Although a large number
    of indices at diverse wavelengths, based on theoretical perspectives, have been
    proposed, there is relatively little validation with field data (Serrano et al.,
    2000; Sims and Gamon, 2003). The objectives of the present study were (i) to establish
    which of a number of spectral reflectance indices showed the most reliable associations
    with the following plant and soil water status related parameters under a range
    of field conditions: ψleaf, RWC, CT, soil water potential (ψsoil), and available
    volumetric soil water (AVSW); (ii) assess the sensitivity of spectral water indices
    to detect genotype effects on plant water status and related traits using contrasting
    types of germplasm, and (iii) evaluate spectral water indices as a potential high
    throughput screening tool for water relations related traits in comparison to
    other methods. Materials and methods Experimental materials Three types of wheat
    germplasm were used in this study which were evaluated and selected in previous
    breeding trials with a larger line number at the International Maize and Wheat
    Improvement Center (CIMMYT). The first germplasm set was composed of 16 advanced
    lines (ALN) previously selected and characterized as drought-resistant lines (high
    yielding) among other lines in earlier trials and used in our study during two
    growing seasons (2006 and 2007). The second germplasm was a subset of 14 bread
    wheat sister lines obtained from a larger population of random derived sister
    lines of the cross Seri-M82/Babax (elite/elite cross) plus the two parents previously
    selected and characterized as contrasting in drought resistance (Lopes and Reynolds,
    2010). These sister lines and the two parents (SBS-I) were evaluated during 2006
    and 2007. For the season 2008, the sister lines were reduced from 14 to six lines
    maintaining the two parents (SBS-II) based on the grain yield performance. The
    third germplasm set consisted of ten lines derived from inter-specific hybridization
    with wild relatives including the recurrent parents used to breed synthetic derived
    lines; [as described in Lage and Trethowan et al. (2008), Olivares-Villegas et
    al. (2007), and Reynolds et al. (2007), respectively]. The ten synthetic derivative
    lines (SYNDER), which were previously selected for high grain yield from a bigger
    yield trial (large line number), was also evaluated under water-stressed conditions
    during the 2008 season. Growing conditions The genotypes were grown during the
    winter season at CIMMYT''s experimental station at Ciudad Obregon, Northwest Mexico
    (27.3° N, 109.9o W, 38 m above sea level). Weather conditions are mostly sunny
    and dry during the winter cropping cycle. The soil type is coarse sandy clay,
    mixed montmorillonitic type caliciorthid, low in organic matter, and slightly
    alkaline (pH 7.7) in nature (Sayre et al., 1997). The seeding rate for each experiment
    was 78 kg ha−1. Nitrogen and phosphorus were applied to the plots at a rate of
    150 kg ha−1 and 22 kg ha−1, respectively. Field plots consisted of two raised
    beds (28 cm apart) each 5 m long and 80 cm wide. An alpha lattice design with
    two repetitions was used for all experiments. The planting dates were in November
    and plants reached booting and heading during February–March and were harvested
    in May. The crop growing seasons for all experiments are referred to as years:
    2006 for the cycle 2005–2006, 2007 for the cycle 2006–2007, and 2008 for the cycle
    2007–2008. The ALN, SBS-I, SBS-II, and SYNDER were planted under water stressed
    conditions in the 2006, 2007, and 2008 growing seasons. Drought stressed conditions
    were achieved by applying one irrigation before seeding (which provided approximately
    100 mm of available water) and then two irrigations (approximately 50–70 mm of
    available water each) were applied prior to the booting stage. Folicur was applied
    at the booting, heading, and grain-filling stages at a rate of 0.5 l ha−1 to protect
    the experimental materials from leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina. Spectral
    reflectance measurements Canopy reflectance was measured in the 350–1100 nm range
    and collected at 1.5 nm intervals using a FieldSpec spectroradiometer (Analytical
    Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO). Data were collected during cloud-free days at
    midday (between 10.30 h and 14.00 h) after the machine was calibrated using a
    white plate of barium sulphate (BaSO4) which provides maximum reflectance (Labsphere
    Inc., North Sutton, USA). Four measurements in each plot were taken at a height
    of 0.5 m above the canopy and with a field of view of 25°. Readings were taken
    once during booting (SBS-II and SYNDER), anthesis (SBS-II, and SYNDER), and grain
    filling (all trials). The water index proposed by Peñuelas et al. (1993) was calculated
    (WI=R970/R900) and four normalized water indices (NWIs) were also estimated according
    to Babar et al. (2006) and Prasad et al. (2007) (NWI-1=[R970–R900]/[R970+R900],
    NWI-2=[R970–R850]/[R970+R850], NWI–3=[R970–R880]/[R970+R880], and NWI-4=[R970–R920]/[R970+R920]).
    Leaf and soil water potential and relative water content Leaf water potential
    (ψleaf) was estimated on flag leaves during booting (SBS-II and SYNDER), anthesis
    (SBS-II, and SYNDER) and grain filling (all trials) one day before or one day
    after the spectral reflectance measurements. Four flag leaves in each plot were
    used to determine water potential using a pressurized pump (Scholander''s pump)
    at midday (13.00–15.00 h). Water potential determined at night using flag leaves
    (22.00–24.30 h) was assumed to approximate soil water potential of the rhizosphere
    (ψsoil), as explained in the Discussion. The relative water content (RWC) determined
    on flag leaves at grain filling was taken almost synchronously with the spectral
    measurements, and fresh samples of four flag leaves per plot (7–10 cm2) were collected
    and immediately weighed (fresh weight, FW). Intact leaves were transferred to
    sealed tubes, rehydrated in de-ionised water (around 8–12 h, until fully turgid
    at 25 °C), and weighed again (turgid weight, TW). Finally, the leaf samples were
    oven-dried at 78 °C for 24 h and then weighed (dry weight, DW). The RWC was calculated
    using the following formula: Canopy temperature A hand-held infrared thermometer
    (Mikron M90 Series, Mikron Infrared Instrument Co. Inc., Oakland, NJ) was used
    in all experiments to measure canopy temperature (CT) during booting and grain
    filling. The mean of four readings was obtained from the same side of each plot
    at an angle of approximately 30° with respect to the horizontal angle to integrate
    as many leaves as possible without capturing the soil in the measurement. The
    measurements were taken in the afternoon (13.00–14.00 h) when the crop experienced
    maximum transpiration rates. The WIs determined at booting, anthesis, and grain
    filling were related to the CT readings of booting and grain filling (same for
    anthesis and grain filling of NWI-3). Available volumetric soil water To estimate
    the available volumetric soil water (AVSW), a hydraulic probe (tube 6.54 cm in
    diameter and 2 m in length) connected to a tractor was used for collecting soil
    samples at different depths (30–60, 60–90, and 90–120 cm deep) during booting,
    anthesis, and grain filling in the SBS-II and SYNDER experiments. For the SBS-I
    and ALN, the AVSW was determined only after physiological maturity (2006 and 2007).
    During 2008, AVSW determined at booting, anthesis and grain filling was compared
    to WIs and CT values determined at the same respective growth stages. Grain yield
    and biomass In all experiments, grain yield was determined after physiological
    maturity by harvesting and threshing the entire plot, excluding a 0.5 m border
    at each end. Prior to grain harvest, a random subsample of 100 spike-bearing culms
    was removed from the plots. The subsample was oven-dried, weighed, and threshed.
    The grain weight was recorded and individual kernel weight estimated using a subsample
    of 200 kernels. For biomass harvesting, all plants in a 0.5 m long area were cut
    at soil level in one of the two beds of each plot. The area harvested for biomass
    was 0.4 m2 (0.5 m by 0.8 m). The canopy reflectance measurements were taken randomly
    before biomass harvesting. After biomass harvesting, the total fresh weight was
    taken and oven-dried at 78 °C for 48 h. The dry weight of the biomass was recorded
    for estimating biomass by area (g m−2). The biomass was sampled at booting, anthesis,
    and maturity in the SBS-II and SYNDER experiments for the year 2008. During the
    previous years (2006 and 2007), biomass was not measured. Estimation of genetic
    correlations Genetic correlations between the NWI-3 and water relations parameters
    were estimated using the SAS software with Proc Mixed, following the method described
    by Singh and Chaudhary (1977) (SAS Institute, 2001). The formula used to estimate
    genetic correlation was: where Var and Cov, respectively, refer to the components
    of variance and covariance. The genetic correlations were estimated by combining
    years in ALN and SBS-I (2006 and 2007) for the grain-filling stage, while for
    SBS-II and SYNDER were estimated by combining growth stages (booting, heading,
    and grain filling) during 2008. Statistical analyses All experimental data were
    analysed according to the alpha lattice design by using Proc Mixed in the SAS
    program for each growth stage and year (SAS Institute, 2001). Pearson correlation
    coefficients were estimated using adjusted means to estimate the phenotypic relationship
    of the water indices to ψleaf, ψsoil, RWC, AVSW, grain yield, and biomass. Results
    The unselected recombinant inbred lines, elite advanced lines, and synthetic derivative
    genotypes showed differences in drought resistance under high levels of water
    stress measured as ψleaf (ranging from –2.49 to –3.59 MPa) across growth stages
    and across growing seasons (Table 1). Furthermore, genotypic differences were
    maintained as the magnitude of water stress increased across growth stages (–1.2
    MPa for booting, –2.2 MPa for anthesis, and –3.3 MP for grain filling) where drought-resistant
    genotypes always had higher ψleaf (Fig. 1). The five canopy spectral water indices
    (WI and four normalized WIs) tested in the present study demonstrated strong associations
    with the plant and some soil water parameters under field water-stressed conditions,
    with NWI-3 demonstrating the strongest associations (Table 2). The four normalized
    WIs (NWI-1, NWI-2, NWI-3, and NWI-4) sometimes demonstrated similar results without
    significant differences among them, but NWI-3 generally showed stronger relationships
    (ranging from 1–6% stronger compared with the other WIs) in all germplasm sets
    evaluated during three growing seasons (Table 2). Therefore, data for NWI-3 was
    mostly presented in the current study to illustrate the relationship of WI with
    water status parameters. Table 1.Mean and least significant difference (LSD) for

    diverse water stress levels during the three growing seasons (2006–2007 and 2008)
    (Table 2; Fig. 1a, b). For the ALN and SBS-I, both parameters were only determined
    at grain filling, while for SBS-II the same relationship was significant at anthesis
    and grain filling. The association of NWI-3 with ψleaf was stronger when booting,
    anthesis, and grain filling were combined in SBS-II and SYNDER during 2008 (Fig.
    1a, b). Similarly, NWI-3 showed a negative association with ψsoil at booting,
    anthesis, and grain filling in SBS-II, but again the relationship was stronger
    when the three growth stages were combined (Fig. 1c, d). Variation in NWI-3 across
    the growth stages (booting, anthesis, and grain filling) followed ψleaf and ψsoil
    changes in SBS-II and SYNDER (significant associations at P ≤0.05 and 0.01) (Fig.

    was significant at anthesis for SBS-II (Fig. 4). Combining the three growth stages,

    by the normalized water indices There were genotypic differences (P ≤0.01 and

    (ALN), recombinant inbred lines (SBS-I and SBS-II), and synthetic derivatives
    lines (SYNDER) across growing seasons (Table 1). AVSW also showed genotypic differences
    at different soil depths (30–60 cm, 60–90 cm, and 90–120 cm) and across growth
    stages in the three growing seasons. The relationship of NWI-3 with ψleaf and
    CT across growth stages demonstrated that NWI-3 was sensitive to genotypic differences
    in drought resistance at the canopy level in each germplam set at different water
    stress levels across years (Table 2; Figs 1a, b, 3). At the soil level, the changes
    in AVSW that were associated with NWI-3 in SBS-II and SYNDER also demonstrated
    that the genotypic differences at superficial and deeper soil layers could be
    related to differential capacity of root systems to explore water at low ψsoil
    (Figs 1c–d, 5). The NWI-3 gave significant genetic correlations with the water
    relations parameters across growing seasons (ALN and SBS-II) and across growth
    stages (SBS-II and SYNDER) (Table 4). The genetic correlation between NWI-3 and
    canopy and soil water parameters was generally similar or higher to the phenotypic
    correlation values (Tables 2, 4; Figs 1–5). Also, the genetic correlation showed
    the same trends for each germplasm set when individual growth stages were tested

    and water relation parameters using a combined analysis Since the different germplasm
    sets showed similar associations of WIs with water relations parameters, a combined
    analysis of all germplasm sets across growing seasons was performed (Fig. 6).
    The relationship of NWI-3 with all water parameters was strengthened at both the
    canopy level (ψleaf, RWC, and CT) and at the root level (ψsoil and AVSW). Fig.

    of sister lines (SBS-I and SBS-II), advanced lines (ALN), and synthetic lines
    (SYNDER). When the relationship of NWI-3 with ψleaf was considered for all germplasm
    sets across growing seasons the association was clearly strong across a wide range
    of environments (Fig. 6a). Similarly, CT showed a strong relationship with NWI-3
    (Fig. 6c) by combining all germplasm sets, but RWC showed a relatively low relationship
    with NWI-3 across growing seasons (Fig. 6d). At the soil level, ψsoil and AVSW
    were highly associated with NWI-3 at diverse water stress levels when all germplasm
    sets were combined across years and stages (Fig. 6b, e). Discussion The potential
    of water indices to screen canopy water content The value of spectral reflectance
    indices to sense plant water status, based on strong absorption by water at specific
    wavelengths such as 970 nm, has been reported in different crops, conifers, shrubs,
    and other plant species under water stressed conditions (Table 5). Other spectral
    reflectance indices based on visible, near, and far infrared regions have also
    been associated with plant water status parameters (i.e. ψleaf) under different
    levels of water stress (Table 5). Some of these indices were based on ground-based
    canopy reflectance to estimate crop water content, while others utilized satellite
    and aircraft imagery in forest species and farm fields to estimate vegetative
    water content. The WI (source for the four normalized water indices used in the
    current study) proposed by Peñuelas et al. (1993) has been widely associated with
    diverse water relations parameters in a variety of crops (Table 5). WI showed
    a good association with RWC and ψleaf (r=0.60–0.80) by inducing artificial leaf
    dehydration of gerbera and pepper plants growing under greenhouse and growth chamber
    conditions, but WI had weaker associations at moderate water stress (RWC <85%
    and ψleaf–1.55 MPa) (Peñuelas et al., 1993). In another study, the plant water
    content of the seedlings of several shrubs and tree species was highly correlated
    with WI (r=0.61–0.75) when plants were grown in plastic tubes; however, under
    natural conditions, the association was reduced (r=0.05–0.56) (Peñuelas et al.,
    1997). Sim and Gamon (2003) studied several plant species (annual and perennial
    species) grown in natural conditions and found that WI gave a better association
    with plant water content than did other indices (NDVI, NDWI, and SR). Eitel et
    al. (2006) also used WI, but it showed a weak relationship with RWC and ψleaf
    at the leaf and canopy level, compared to NDWI and the maximum difference water
    index (MDVI) in Populus tree species grown in greenhouse conditions. MDWI [Rmax(1500–1750)–Rmin(1500–1750)]/[Rmax(1500–1750)+Rmin(1500–1750)]
    was a newly proposed water index that incorporated short-wave infrared wavelengths
    and was more efficient at detecting changes in plant water status compared with
    the indices that employ near infrared wavelengths (NDWI and WI) (Eitel et al.,
    2006). Table 5.Spectral water indices and their relationship with water relation

    five WIs tested, was clearly sensitive to the water content differences among
    genotypes over a range of water deficits, showing strong linear relationships
    with most of the water relations parameters measured (Table 2; Fig. 6). These
    indices compare the energy absorbed by water at 970 nm with different reference
    wavelengths (850, 880, 900, and 920 nm), which do not show energy absorption by
    water (Peñuelas et al., 1997; Babar et al., 2006; Prasad et al., 2007). Overall,
    the reference wavelength at 880 nm (employed for the NWI-3) resulted a little
    better than the others (Table 2). The current study is the first to report genetic
    effects within a species (as far as the authors are aware), suggesting the potential
    for application of WI in high-throughput screening of genotypes for water relations
    parameters; this will be discussed subsequently. Environmental range in which
    NWI-3 is associated with water relations parameters The fact that NWI-3 was measured
    across distinct crop stages and crop cycles, in addition to in different genetic
    materials, afforded the opportunity to assess the association of NWI-3 with water
    relations parameters across a broad range of expression. In general, water stress
    intensified over the course of the crop cycle and there was also significant seasonal
    variation when comparing crop cycles. This environmental variation in water stress
    was manifest in the wide range of expression of water relations parameters, and
    NWI-3 showed relatively strong linear associations with most water relations parameters
    (Figs 1–6). For example, ψleaf and ψsoil were expressed in the range –2.0 to –4.0
    MPa and –0.5 to –2.0 MPa, respectively, and showed linear associations with NWI-3
    across this range explaining 60–80% of the variation between the traits, depending
    on germplasm set. The data presented in this study give a reasonably comprehensive
    idea of the range of water relations traits and their levels of expression for
    which NWI-3 can be expected to serve as a proxy in situations where inexpensive
    or rapid estimation of water status of plants is useful. NWI-3 and water status
    parameters NWI-3 showed strong association with ψleaf which was generally the
    water relation parameter most consistently associated with NWI-3 (Table 2; Fig.
    1). ψleaf determined at night was assumed to approximate the ψsoil of the active
    root environment for each genotype as plants tend to equilibrate with the soil
    when demand for water from the atmosphere is negligible (Nobel, 1983). The expression
    of genetic effects for ψsoil indicates that different genotypes explore distinct
    soil water profiles. Furthermore, its association with expression of ψleaf (r2=0.52–0.76)
    and NWI-3 (r2=0.59–0.64) indicates that hydration status during the day could
    be related to the ability of roots to explore wetter soil profiles (Fig. 5), as
    opposed to adopting a more conservative water relations strategy. Our results
    suggest that drought-resistant genotypes maintain a better canopy water content
    compared with susceptible genotypes across a range of developmental stages (Table
    2; Figs 1–6). RWC, a useful indicator of plant hydration status under water stress
    (Slatyer, 1967; Chaves et al., 2002), showed low relationship at individual growth
    stages (Table 2; Fig. 2), but combining growth stages RWC showed significant association
    with NWI-3 during 2008 and across seasons (Figs 2, 6). RWC has also been associated
    with other spectral water indices (i.e. WI and NDWI) and specific wavelengths
    in crops evaluated under water stress (Table 5) (Peñuelas et al., 1993; Pu et
    al., 2003; Eitel et al., 2006). Boyer et al. (2008) found that barley and wheat
    leaves absorb excess water (10–15%) as a result of osmotic adjustment during water
    incubation to obtain full leaf turgidity, thereby overestimating RWC, a source
    of error that may have affected results in the current study. The strong relationship
    between CT and NWI-3 (Fig. 3) and between CT and ψleaf (Fig. 4) of genotypes corroborate
    the argument that better performance associated with cooler canopies is a function
    of improved hydration status (Olivares-Villegas et al., 2007) which is associated
    with roots that access deeper soil profiles (Lopes and Reynolds, 2010). The association
    between NWI-3 and AVSW at different soil profiles in the current study further
    supports this (Table 2; Fig. 5). Under soil water deficits, plants close stomata
    to reduce water loss (Medrano et al., 2002) while resistant plants may develop
    deeper roots to maintain better gas exchange (transpiration and photosynthesis)
    and higher growth rates (Passioura, 1983). The association reported here between
    NWI-3 and AVSW (Fig. 5) suggest its potential application in screening for genotypes
    that more effectively access water at soil depth (Table 2; Fig. 5). Genotypic
    differences in canopy water content NWI-3 showed a strong relationship with ψleaf
    at individual growth stages in all three sets of germplasm ALN, SBS-I, and SBS-II
    (Table 2; Fig. 1). Genetic correlations made using data combined across growth
    stages in the SBS-II and SYNDER and across growing seasons in ALN and SBS-I, demonstrated
    that NWI-3 is able to detect genetic differences among the lines evaluated in
    the present study (Table 4). The significant genetic correlations between NWI-3
    and the majority of water relations parameters (as indicated by ψleaf, cooler
    canopies and the ability more effectively to dry the soil) indicate strong genetic
    effects (Table 4). While, in general, NWI-3 was significantly associated with
    water relations parameters at all growth stages measured, a possible reason for
    low association at some individual growth stages was the environmental field variation
    associated with the high water-stress levels. The idea that associations may have
    been weakened by environmental variance is supported by the fact that when growth
    stages in SBS-II and SYNDER were combined, the relationships were strengthened.
    A cross correlation analysis between NWI-3 and ψleaf during two seasons (2006
    and 2007) for ALN and SBS-I and during three growth stages (booting, anthesis,
    and grain filling) for SBS-II and SYNDER also showed strong associations (r ranged
    from –0.45 to –0.86 for ψleaf, ψsoil, RWC, and AVSW and from 0.41 to 0.87 for
    CT). The use of NWI-3, or other spectral water indices, to explain genotypic differences
    for drought resistance in relation to the canopy water content (ψleaf and CT)
    and root capacity (ψsoil and AVSW) under water-stressed conditions has not previously
    been reported. Liu et al. (2004) compared three wheat cultivars and combined four
    irrigation regimes and four nitrogen treatments using a red edge band (740–930
    nm) to explain plant water content. Measuring canopy reflectance at six different
    growth stages (tillering to milking stage), the red edge band showed significant
    association with plant water content. Under both drought and hot-irrigated environments,
    deeper root growth permits better access to soil water to maintain better plant
    water content (Reynolds et al., 2007). McKenzie et al. (2009) found that the root
    mass of several barley genotypes was associated with subsoil water extraction
    and similar results have been shown in bread wheat (Lopes and Reynolds, 2010).
    In our study, WIs indicate improved hydration status in resistant genotypes and
    their relationship with AVSW at different soil depths (Fig. 5) could indicate
    an association with root capacity. The argument that NWI-3 is sensitive to genetic
    differences in water relations parameters is supported by the results of this
    study, including phenotypic and genetic correlations within different classes
    of breeding material (Tables 2, 4; Figs 1–5). Not surprisingly there is also an
    association of NWI-3 with grain yield in genotypes that maintained better water
    status (Table 3). Water indices and other water relations methods ψleaf is considered
    the most reliable indicator of plant water status and has been used to evaluate
    drought resistance among wheat genotypes (Munjal and Dhanda, 2005). Given the
    strong association between NWI-3 and ψleaf in the present study, the advantages
    of using NWI-3 to estimate plant water status, instead of the time-consuming method
    of measuring water potential with Scholander''s pressure pump, are self evident
    (20–30 samples h−1 for ψleaf and 150–200 readings h−1 for WIs). The spectral reflectance
    method is much more rapid at integrating several leaves on the canopy avoiding
    cutting leaf samples from plants. Other methods, such as measurement of RWC, are
    also time-consuming and less integrative when compared with using WIs to estimate
    water status. NWI-3 integrates dozens of leaves on the canopy and additional parameters
    can be estimated simultaneously through other spectral indices, such as photosynthetic
    capacity (NDVI), leaf area index (GNDVI), intercepted radiation (PRI), chlorophyll
    a/b (RARSa and RARSb), etc (Araus et al., 2001). The association between CT and
    NWI-3 (Fig. 3) confirms that CT is also a good indicator of hydration status.
    In this study, NWI-3 showed a better association with ψleaf and AVSW (r2=0.56–0.81)
    (Figs. 1, 5) than CT (r2=0.13–0.72). The robustness of the WIs as an indicator
    of ψleaf at different growth stages (Table 2; Fig. 1) could also indicate its
    value in irrigation decisions, to avoid water stress at critical growth stages
    during the cropping season (Koksal, 2008). Irrigation scheduling is an important
    goal in remote sensing; crop water status information and several indices (NDVI
    and NDWI) have been proposed for improving this (Jackson, 1986; Jackson et al.,
    2004). Data presented in this study suggest that NWI-3 may be a more reliable
    index for application in irrigation scheduling, though confirmation would have
    to come ultimately from calibration studies to establish threshold NWI-3 values
    that correspond to the water relations parameters associated with standard irrigation
    intervals. Conclusions The relationship between NWI-3 and ψleaf was generally
    consistent across years, and across growth stages in unselected recombinant inbred
    lines, elite advanced lines, and synthetic derivative genotypes under a wide range
    of water-stressed conditions. Results show a link between hydration status, transpiration
    rates (cooler canopies), water extraction capacity, and improved yield in drought-resistant
    genotypes under diverse water stress levels. The argument that genotypes with
    better canopy water content can access deeper soil layers for water uptake was
    supported by the association of the NWI-3 with AVSW and ψsoil. In addition, the
    genetic correlations between NWI-3 and water relations parameters support the
    idea that NWI-3 is able to distinguish genotypic differences in drought resistance
    at the canopy and soil level during the crop cycle. NWI-3 offers significant advantages
    for screening water relation traits since it integrates at the canopy level and
    can evaluate a large number of genotypes quickly and cheaply, compared with other
    methods that have been described in the literature. Abbreviations  ALN advanced

  limitations: The study did not directly explore the automation or real-time aspects
    of irrigation management. The specific scope of the review was on water spectral
    indices in relation to plant and soil water relations. Additionally, the study
    only evaluated three types of wheat germplasm, which may limit the generalizability

  title: Association of water spectral indices with plant and soil water relations
    in contrasting wheat genotypes
  verbatim_quote1: Among all water spectral indices, one in particular, which was
    denominated as NWI-3, showed the most consistent associations with water relations
    parameters and demonstrated the strongest associations in all three germplasm
    sets.
  verbatim_quote2: The NWI-3 showed a strong linear relationship (r2 >0.6–0.8) with
    leaf water potential (ψleaf) across a broad range of values (–2.0 to –4.0 MPa)
    that were determined by natural variation in the environment associated with intra-
    and inter-seasonal affects.
  verbatim_quote3: The NWI-3 was sufficiently sensitive to detect genotypic differences
    (indicated by phenotypic and genetic correlations) in water status at the canopy
    and soil levels indicating its potential application in precision phenotyping.

  analysis: 'Recent advances in sensor technology and the availability of hyperspectral
    TIR imagers (Table 2) facilitate new possibilities to detect environmental stresses
    based on spectral emissivity. The main underlying advantage of TIR spectral information
    in comparison to the VNIR/SWIR domain is that TIR spectral features originate
    from primary absorption bands of biochemical leaf compounds (e.g., cellulose)
    and should thus exhibit higher spectral contrast as VNIR/SWIR spectra which are
    mainly dominated by overtones and combination modes of fundamental vibrations
    originating from the interactions between solar radiation and leaf contents (e.g.,
    leaf pigments) [107]. Therefore, changes in the compositions of leaf constituents
    induced by water stress should be accompanied by changes in the emissivity spectra
    (e.g., [108]).

    However, only little eﬀort has been directed to the detection of plant responses
    to environmental stresses based on spectral emissivity. Buitrago et al. [62] showed
    the ability of spectral emissivity to detect water and cold stress on both European
    beech (Fagus sylvatica) and rhododendron (Rhododendron cf. catawbiense) leaves
    using DHR laboratory measurements. Gerhards et al. [63] conducted further successful
    research on the utility to use spectral emissivity for the detection of water
    stress on potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. Cilena).'

    \ launched on March 2019) in the VNIR/SWIR,\nFluorescence Explorer (FLEX) in the\
    \ SIF). Identiﬁcation of plant water stress or drought is of utmost\nimportance\
    \ to guarantee global water and food supply. Therefore, knowledge of crop water\
    \ status\nover large farmland areas bears large potential for optimizing agricultural\
    \ water use. As plant\nresponses to water stress are numerous and complex, their\
    \ physiological consequences aﬀect the\nelectromagnetic signal in diﬀerent spectral\
    \ domains. This review paper summarizes the importance of\nwater stress-related\
    \ applications and the plant responses to water stress, followed by a concise\
    \ review\nof water-stress detection through remote sensing, focusing on TIR without\
    \ neglecting the comparison\nto other spectral domains (i.e., VNIR/SWIR and SIF)\
    \ and multi-sensor approaches. Current and\nplanned sensors at ground, airborne,\
    \ and satellite level for the TIR as well as a selection of commonly\nused indices\
    \ and approaches for water-stress detection using the main multi-/hyperspectral\
    \ remote\nsensing imaging techniques are reviewed. Several important challenges\
    \ are discussed that occur\nwhen using spectral emissivity, temperature-based\
    \ indices, and physically-based approaches for\nwater-stress detection in the\
    \ TIR spectral domain. Furthermore, challenges with data processing\nand the perspectives\
    \ for future satellite missions in the TIR are critically examined. In conclusion,\n\
    information from multi-/hyperspectral TIR together with those from VNIR/SWIR and\
    \ SIF sensors\nwithin a multi-sensor approach can provide profound insights to\
    \ actual plant (water) status and the\nrationale of physiological and biochemical\

    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n2 of 24\n1. Importance of Water-Stress Detection\n\
    Water-deﬁcit stress, usually shortened to water or drought stress, describes the\
    \ plant physiological\nresponses induced by a lack of available water due to either\
    \ soil water deﬁcit or high evaporative\ndemand of the atmosphere. Water stress\
    \ induces dehydration in the plant and prevents plant cells\nfrom keeping water\
    \ concentrations at an acceptable and healthy level [1,2]. Therefore, water stress\
    \ is\none of the most critical abiotic stressors limiting plant growth, crop yield\
    \ and quality concerning food\nproduction [3,4].\nSince the global population\
    \ is projected to grow by about 2.3 billion people between 2015 and 2050\nand\
    \ societies are changing from low to medium per capita income, global food demand\
    \ is expected\nto double within the same time [5–7]. Therefore, one of the most\
    \ challenging tasks of our generation\nis to meet the second Sustainable Development\
    \ Goal as deﬁned in the 2030 agenda for sustainable\ndevelopment by the United\
    \ Nations: “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and\npromote\
    \ sustainable agriculture” [8]. In this respect, agricultural processes need to\
    \ be optimized and\ninnovative farming methods must be developed to guarantee\
    \ global food supply, as arable land and\nenvironmental resources have almost\
    \ reached the limits of sustainability.\nWater is the most valuable resource of\
    \ our planet. Presently, agriculture consumes 80–90% of the\nfreshwater used by\
    \ humans worldwide and about two thirds of this freshwater is required for crop\n\
    irrigation [9]. Therefore, the ultimate goal must be a reduction in the amount\
    \ of water used per unit\nyield [10].\nIn addition, anthropogenic climate change\
    \ is predicted to cause an increase of 1.0–2.5 ◦C in the\nannual mean global temperature\
    \ over the next 50 years with a tremendous impact on agriculture [11].\nConsequently,\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) rates will increase and thus, the demand of water for\
    \ crop\nirrigation will further rise. At the same time, extreme weather events\
    \ such as droughts will appear\nmore frequently and be more severe. These facts\
    \ add some extra pressure to increasing global water\nscarcity and the need for\
    \ saving water.\nHence, it is desired to reduce the amount of water used per unit\
    \ yield by reducing yield loss\nand by reducing the amount of water used for irrigation.\
    \ To achieve this goal, early detection and\nmonitoring of plant responses to\
    \ water stress in agricultural crops are mandatory. Remote sensing\noﬀers the\
    \ opportunity to acquire high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution data as\
    \ input for\nprecision agriculture [12]. Precision agriculture promises great\
    \ potential to close the yield gap by\noptimizing food production using the right\
    \ management practice at the right place and the right time\nwhile keeping the\
    \ consumption of resources at an environmentally sustainable level [13].\n2. Plant\
    \ Responses to Water Stress\nPlant responses to water stress are numerous and\
    \ complex (see [4,14–16] for comprehensive\nreviews). They appear synergistically\
    \ or antagonistically and are modiﬁed by co-occurring plant\nstresses under ﬁeld\
    \ conditions (Figure 1) [4,17,18].\nTherefore, it remains diﬃcult to detect and\n\
    monitor plant water deﬁcit based on a single plant response [19]. In general,\
    \ water deﬁcit causes\nphysiological and biochemical changes which induce a reduction\
    \ in photosynthesis and thus plant\ngrowth [16]. However, the timing, intensity,\
    \ and duration of water stress are crucial to determine the\nplant physiological\
    \ responses and their impact on plant metabolism [20]. For example, under mild\n\
    water-stress conditions, plant regulation of water loss and uptake still allows\
    \ the plant to maintain\nrelative leaf water content with no or only little change\
    \ in photosynthetic capacity. In contrast, severe\nwater deﬁcit induces serious\
    \ physiological and biochemical changes, which lead to eﬀects ranging\nfrom inhibition\
    \ of photosynthesis and growth to leaf wilting and the loss of key pigments such\
    \ as\nchlorophyll and thus to irreversible damages to the photosynthetic machinery\
    \ [15–17]. Hence, plants\nhave developed multiple mechanisms to prevent severe\
    \ damage through water stress [21].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n3 of 24\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 24 \n \n \n90 \nFigure 1. Most important\
    \ relationships between primary plant stresses, the induced plant responses, \n\
    91 \nand the multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing techniques for the detection\
    \ of environmental stresses \n92 \n(modified after Jones and Vaughan [19]). \n\
    93 \nThe first plant response to water stress is stomatal closure, which prevents\
    \ transpirational water \n94 \nloss (e.g., [4,15,17]). In particular, stomatal\
    \ closure is the response to either a deficit in soil water sup-\n95 \nply or\
    \ to low-humidity atmosphere with high evaporative demand. It is commonly assumed\
    \ that \n96 \nstomatal response is rather linked to soil water content than to\
    \ leaf water content. This suggests that \n97 \nstomata are most likely triggered\
    \ by chemical signals, such as the accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) \n98 \n\
    in dehydrated roots rather than by a reduced cell turgor [4]. However, under severe\
    \ and/or prolonged \n99 \nwater stress, cell turgor, and leaf water content is\
    \ also reduced [15]. As a consequence, the exchange \n100 \nof water vapor between\
    \ plants and atmosphere is reduced by stomatal closure and thus, the evapo-\n\
    101 \nrative cooling effect is decreased resulting in an overall increase of plant\
    \ surface temperature com-\n102 \npared to a plant which does not suffer from\
    \ water stress [14,18,22].  \n103 \nHowever, the stomata not only control plant\
    \ transpiration but also plant respiration which in-\n104 \nhibits CO2 uptake\
    \ and fixation. As a result of stomatal closure, the photosynthetic rate is reduced,\
    \ \n105 \nwhich causes a reduction in cell division and thus slows down leaf growth\
    \ and reduces the rate of \n106 \nleaf surface area expansion. A persistent water\
    \ deficit will further damage the photosynthetic ma-\n107 \nchinery through loss\
    \ of chlorophyll, which finally introduces changes in leaf color and wilting \n\
    108 \n[15,16,20]. Another plant response to water stress is the change in sun-induced\
    \ fluorescence (SIF). \n109 \nWhile the photosynthetic rate is reduced by a decreased\
    \ CO2 uptake due to stomatal closure, irradi-\n110 \nance and absorbed photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation (fAPAR) remain constant. In general, energy \n111 \nabsorbed\
    \ by plant pigments (i.e., the chlorophylls and carotenoids) is dissipated by\
    \ three competitive \n112 \nprocesses (i.e., photosynthesis, SIF, and heat emission).\
    \ Consequently, a reduced photochemistry as \n113 \ninduced by water stress results\
    \ in several physiological mechanisms to protect the plant against pho-\n114 \n\
    toinhibition. These mechanisms foster non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and reduce\
    \ SIF [23,24].  \n115 \nBesides these plant responses to water stress, osmotic\
    \ adjustment is a further strategy to prevent \n116 \nirreversible damage. Osmotic\
    \ adjustment describes the process of the accumulation of solutes such \n117 \n\
    as carbohydrates and proteins to maintain the cell turgor at osmotic equilibrium\
    \ [25]. \n118 \nIn summary, plant responses to water stress can be recognized\
    \ as a sequence of physiological \n119 \nand biochemical changes depending on\
    \ the severity and duration of plant water deficit. Hence, the \n120 \ndetection\
    \ of water-stress symptoms is a function of time and depends on the plant responses\
    \ to water \n121 \ndeficit and their corresponding physiological changes, which\
    \ may be sensitive to different remote \n122 \nsensing techniques.  \n123 \nFigure\

    \ the detection of environmental stresses\n(modiﬁed after Jones and Vaughan [19]).\n\
    The ﬁrst plant response to water stress is stomatal closure, which prevents transpirational\
    \ water\nloss (e.g., [4,15,17]). In particular, stomatal closure is the response\
    \ to either a deﬁcit in soil water\nsupply or to low-humidity atmosphere with\
    \ high evaporative demand. It is commonly assumed that\nstomatal response is rather\
    \ linked to soil water content than to leaf water content. This suggests that\n\
    stomata are most likely triggered by chemical signals, such as the accumulation\
    \ of abscisic acid (ABA)\nin dehydrated roots rather than by a reduced cell turgor\
    \ [4]. However, under severe and/or prolonged\nwater stress, cell turgor, and\
    \ leaf water content is also reduced [15]. As a consequence, the exchange of\n\
    water vapor between plants and atmosphere is reduced by stomatal closure and thus,\
    \ the evaporative\ncooling eﬀect is decreased resulting in an overall increase\
    \ of plant surface temperature compared to a\nplant which does not suﬀer from\
    \ water stress [14,18,22].\nHowever, the stomata not only control plant transpiration\
    \ but also plant respiration which inhibits\nCO2 uptake and ﬁxation. As a result\
    \ of stomatal closure, the photosynthetic rate is reduced, which\ncauses a reduction\
    \ in cell division and thus slows down leaf growth and reduces the rate of leaf\n\
    surface area expansion. A persistent water deﬁcit will further damage the photosynthetic\
    \ machinery\nthrough loss of chlorophyll, which ﬁnally introduces changes in leaf\
    \ color and wilting [15,16,20].\nAnother plant response to water stress is the\
    \ change in sun-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF). While the\nphotosynthetic rate is reduced\
    \ by a decreased CO2 uptake due to stomatal closure, irradiance and\nabsorbed\
    \ photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) remain constant. In general, energy\
    \ absorbed by\nplant pigments (i.e., the chlorophylls and carotenoids) is dissipated\
    \ by three competitive processes (i.e.,\nphotosynthesis, SIF, and heat emission).\
    \ Consequently, a reduced photochemistry as induced by water\nstress results in\
    \ several physiological mechanisms to protect the plant against photoinhibition.\
    \ These\nmechanisms foster non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and reduce SIF [23,24].\n\
    Besides these plant responses to water stress, osmotic adjustment is a further\
    \ strategy to prevent\nirreversible damage. Osmotic adjustment describes the process\
    \ of the accumulation of solutes such as\ncarbohydrates and proteins to maintain\
    \ the cell turgor at osmotic equilibrium [25].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n\
    4 of 24\nIn summary, plant responses to water stress can be recognized as a sequence\
    \ of physiological\nand biochemical changes depending on the severity and duration\
    \ of plant water deﬁcit. Hence, the\ndetection of water-stress symptoms is a function\
    \ of time and depends on the plant responses to water\ndeﬁcit and their corresponding\
    \ physiological changes, which may be sensitive to diﬀerent remote\nsensing techniques.\n\
    3. Remote Sensing of Water Stress\nRemote sensing is one of the key technologies\
    \ in precision agriculture, which has an enormous\ndemand for geospatial information\
    \ [12,13]. Besides the information needs for soil properties, crop\nnutrients,\
    \ crop biomass, and diseases, farmers and decision makers have a major interest\
    \ in the\ndetection of plant responses to environmental and water stresses [26–30].\
    \ In general, remote sensing\nprovides a fast, cost-eﬃcient, non-destructive,\
    \ and spatio-temporal measure of numerous physiological,\nbiochemical and structural\
    \ crop characteristics at diﬀerent scales (ground, airborne, and satellite).\n\
    Plants can be irreversibly aﬀected before visible symptoms of water stress appear\
    \ [15–17]. Therefore, a\npre-symptomatic or pre-visual detection of plant physiological\
    \ changes can essentially contribute to\navoiding severe crop damages [31]. Hyperspectral\
    \ imagery, with its continuous spectral data, has the\npotential to provide further\
    \ insights into the relationship between the spectral features and associated\n\
    plant conditions [32]. Focusing on the detection of plant responses to environmental\
    \ stresses, the main\nmulti-/hyperspectral remote sensing techniques are thermal\
    \ imaging (TIR; 8–14 µm), visible, near- and\nshortwave infrared reﬂectance (VNIR/SWIR;\
    \ 0.4–2.5 µm), and sun-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF 0.685 and\n0.74 µm).\n3.1. Thermal\
    \ Infrared Domain\nSince the 1970s TIR remote sensing (8–14 µm) has been recognized\
    \ as a potential tool for early\nplant water-stress detection. In general, emitted\
    \ radiance in the TIR contains two intrinsic kinds of\ninformation: (i) surface\
    \ temperature (i.e., “directional radiometric surface temperature” as deﬁned\n\
    by [33]) of the object of interest and (ii) its spectral emissivity.\n3.1.1. Temperature\
    \ and Emissivity Separation (TES)\nTo derive both accurate surfaces temperatures\
    \ and emissivity spectra, from hyperspectral TIR\ndata, two fundamental problems\
    \ have to be solved (e.g., [34–36]). First, atmospheric correction is\nneeded,\
    \ hence, the spectral radiance measured at sensor consists not only of the radiance\
    \ emitted by the\nobject of interest itself but also includes thermal radiation\
    \ emitted by surroundings and reﬂected from\nthe surface of the object (down-welling\
    \ radiance (DWR)). It is further inﬂuenced by the intervening\natmosphere in terms\
    \ of absorption, emission, and scattering (upwelling radiance and transmittance\n\
    (τ) of the atmosphere). In the past, upwelling path and τ were mostly neglected\
    \ for short distance\nﬁeld measurements. However, it has been shown by MIDAC (Model\
    \ M4401-F; MIDAC Corporation,\nCA, USA) measurements over agricultural site’s\
    \ in Barrax (Spain) that atmospheric correction is\nrequired (and possible) for\
    \ such short distance measurements [37]. For airborne or satellite imagery\nthe\
    \ correction of atmospheric distortions is essential. Second, a solution to the\
    \ so-called TES-problem\nis required. The measured spectral radiance is, regarding\
    \ Planck’s law, a function of the absolute\ntemperature and the spectral emissivity\
    \ of the observed object. Thus, if the radiance is measured in n\nbands, there\
    \ will be n + 1 unknowns, n emissivities values, plus the surface temperature.\
    \ Therefore, to\nretrieve accurate surface temperatures, the spectral emissivity\
    \ must be known and vice versa.\nWhile in theory, the TES represents an ill-posed\
    \ problem, hyperspectral data in comparison\nto multispectral data allows a good\
    \ ﬁt to Planck’s radiance curve for a speciﬁc temperature [38].\nPresently, a\
    \ variety of algorithms exist which diﬀer in the underlying assumptions and the\
    \ data\nbasis.\nA comprehensive review is given by Li et al. [39].\nIn general,\
    \ it must be distinguished\nbetween short (indoor and outdoor measurement with\
    \ 1–3 m) and large (ﬁeld or air- and spaceborne\nmeasurements) sensor–target distances.\
    \ For short distance ﬁeld measurements, the new approach\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11,\
    \ 1240\n5 of 24\nby Timmermans et al. [37] oﬀers an auto-correction for atmospheric\
    \ eﬀects in TIR by: (i) calculating\ntransmissivity from hot and cold blackbody\
    \ measurements, (ii) using a simple atmospheric radiative\ntransfer model based\
    \ on MODTRAN for the retrieval of the atmospheric gas-constituents (i.e., H2O\n\
    and CO2). Besides, the Spectral Smoothness method introduced by Horton et al.\
    \ [40] is a widely used\nand accurate TES-approach for short distance ﬁeld measurements.\
    \ This is because the smoothness\napproach requires no a priori knowledge, neither\
    \ the maximum value of the emissivity nor the\ncorresponding wavenumber. The atmospheric\
    \ emission lines (i.e., H2O) are negatively oriented if\nthe sample temperature\
    \ is overestimated and vice versa. Using this atmospheric characteristic, the\n\
    target emissivity spectrum can be accurately retrieved by iteratively changing\
    \ the target temperature.\nHowever, this approach is only suitable for outside\
    \ measurements in the presence of atmospheric\nwater vapor lines. Because atmospheric\
    \ features are not present or much lower in closed rooms, the\nReference Channel\
    \ or the Blackbody Fit should be used alternatively for indoor measurements [41].\n\
    Concerning measurements from a greater distance (ﬁeld, airborne or satellite),\
    \ atmospheric upwelling\npath and τ cannot be neglected. The Automatic Retrieval\
    \ of Temperature and Emissivity using Spectral\nSmoothness (ARTEMISS) by Borel\
    \ [42] is a hybrid approach, combining atmospheric correction and\nTES. First,\
    \ the required atmospheric parameters (DWR, upwelling radiance, τ) are determined\
    \ using a\nMODTRAN (MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission) look-up-table\
    \ (LUT). To this end, a\npre-selection of potential atmospheric parameters is\
    \ completed by using the In-Scene Atmospheric\nCompensation (ISAC) approach by\
    \ Young et al. [43]. Finally, spectral emissivity is retrieved using a\nspectral\
    \ smoothness approach called ISSTES (Iterative Spectrally Smooth Temperature and\
    \ Emissivity\nSeparation, [44]). In comparison to other in-scene atmospheric correction\
    \ approaches, such as ISAC\nor AAC (Autonomous Atmospheric Compensation, [45]),\
    \ ARTEMISS does not require any a priori\nknowledge and considers DWR. Therefore,\
    \ ARTEMISS can be considered the state-of-the-art algorithm\nfor hyperspectral\
    \ TIR airborne data.\n3.1.2. Temperature-Based Approach\nMeasuring leaf or canopy\
    \ temperature for the detection of plant responses to water-deﬁcit stress\nis\
    \ based on the idea of Tanner [46]. It is well established from the leaf energy\
    \ balance equation that leaf\ntemperature varies with (evapo-) transpiration rates\
    \ of the leaves and hence is a function of stomatal\nconductance [46–48]. The\
    \ transpiration rate is inversely correlated with leaf temperature [49]. The\n\
    underlying principle is that if plant water status decreases, leaf transpiration\
    \ is reduced as a result\nof active regulation of stomatal aperture [31]. Consequently,\
    \ the inhibited evaporative cooling eﬀect\nleads to higher leaf and canopy temperatures\
    \ in comparison to a well-watered plant (see Section 2\nof this review). Normally,\
    \ the leaf temperature of a fully transpiring plant is about 2–5 K below the\n\
    ambient air temperature [50]. Thus, leaf or canopy temperature depends substantially\
    \ on the stomatal\nconductance [22]. Accordingly, as stomatal closure is the initial\
    \ plant response to water deﬁcit, TIR\nremote sensing of leaf and/or canopy temperature\
    \ has become an established technique to detect\npre-visual water stress (e.g.,\
    \ [22,51–55]).\nThe major limitation of the temperature-based approach is that\
    \ the use of leaf or canopy temperature\nvalues alone cannot directly estimate\
    \ the physiological status of crop plants [49]. This is because\nleaf temperatures\
    \ measured under natural ﬁeld conditions are very sensitive to highly ﬂuctuating\n\
    environmental factors such as air temperature, humidity, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ (VPD), wind speed,\nand incident radiation. Therefore, a variety of crop water-stress\
    \ index approaches have been developed\nin the past with the aim of estimating\
    \ plant water stress more quantitatively by normalizing radiatively\nmeasured\
    \ leaf temperatures to actual environmental conditions. Following, a concise overview\
    \ of\nthe most important approaches of TIR sensing for water-stress detection\
    \ is given (see [22,51,55] for\ncomprehensive reviews).\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11,\
    \ 1240\n6 of 24\nThe ﬁrst development was the normalization of plant temperatures\
    \ against air temperature\nformulated in the Stress Degree Day (SDD) by Jackson\
    \ et al. [56] and Idso et al. [57]. This approach\nis based on the diﬀerence between\
    \ leaf and air temperature (Tleaf − Tair) measured 1–1.5 h after solar\nnoon.\
    \ The appearance of water stress is assumed as soon as Tleaf − Tair rises above\
    \ 0 K. A further\nimprovement of SDD was the commonly established and mostly used\
    \ index for remotely sensed\nwater-stress detection, the Crop Water Stress Index\
    \ (CWSI, see Table 1 [52,53]):\nCWSI = (Tleaf − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ Tleaf is the measured leaf temperature, Twet is the lower boundary for canopy\
    \ temperature,\nassuming a leaf with stomata fully open and a maximum potential\
    \ transpiration rate, and Tdry is the\nupper boundary represented by a non-transpiring\
    \ leaf with stomata completely closed. The greatest\nadvantage of CWSI, in comparison\
    \ to the simple approach of SDD, is the inclusion of current leaf\ntemperature\
    \ (Tleaf) and their extreme limits (i.e., Twet and Tdry). By deﬁning these potential\
    \ boundaries,\nCWSI also implicitly accounts for eﬀects of free convection on\
    \ the plant water stress, and thus indirectly\nconsiders not only current air\
    \ temperature but also other environmental factors (i.e., wind, radiation,\nVPD,\
    \ etc.). Therefore, CWSI should be adaptable to any crop under any meteorological\
    \ condition.\nA variety of approaches have been developed to estimate Twet and\
    \ Tdry as the input of CWSI\ncalculation. While the analytical CWSI is a combination\
    \ of leaf temperature measurements and actual\nmicro-meteorological data (e.g.,\
    \ wind, air temperature, VPD), the empirical approach only accounts for\nleaf\
    \ temperature, air temperature, VPD and two empirically determined calibration\
    \ variables [55].\nDespite CWSI performing reasonably well in dry and hot climates\
    \ with high VPD, its performance\nis limited in humid climates with low VPD and\
    \ high variability in wind speed, cloud cover, and thus\nincident radiation [22].\
    \ Therefore, the most powerful approach to overcome these problems is the\nuse\
    \ of artiﬁcial reference surfaces. This approach allows simultaneous measurement\
    \ of reference\nand leaf temperature. The main advantage of using artiﬁcial reference\
    \ surfaces is that no additional\nmeteorological measurements are required and\
    \ all the needed values can be measured within the\nsame image even for the spatial\
    \ scale implementation (e.g., [22,55,58]). However, the use of artiﬁcial\nreference\
    \ surfaces presents some problems regarding the choice of material and its handling\
    \ in the\nﬁeld. In principle, it should have the same aerodynamic and optical\
    \ properties as the real leaves.\nFurthermore, its spectral emissivity must be\
    \ close or similar to the emissivity of the observed leaves to\nprevent errors\
    \ in temperature estimation [22]. At the airborne and satellite scale, the application\
    \ of\nartiﬁcial reference surfaces seems to be diﬃcult [59] and could be replaced\
    \ by larger wet references as\nsuggested by Meron et al. [60].\nRemote Sens. 2019,\

    \ derivatives of the CWSI are the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI, [61]) and the thermal\
    \ index\nof relative stomatal conductance (IG, [48]). WDI takes advantage of an\
    \ optical vegetation index (VI)\n(e.g., NDVI, SAVI) to separate vegetation from\
    \ soil pixels within a ﬁeld. Based on some rearrangement\nof the leaf energy balance\
    \ equation, IG has the advantage over CWSI that it is directly linearly related\n\
    to stomatal conductance [55].\nBecause of the enormous potential of temperature-based\
    \ indices for the pre-visual detection of\nplant responses to water stress, many\
    \ airborne and satellite TIR sensors (Table 2) have been developed\nand have been\
    \ applied in agriculture (see [29] for review). However, satellite sensors have\

    \ 100 m is delivered by Landsat 8, which for most agricultural\ncultivation systems\
    \ corresponds to a single ﬁeld per pixel [74]. Thus, recent developments in TIR\n\
    remote sensing from airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have great potential\
    \ to bridge\nthe gap between low-resolution satellite images and small-scale in\

    \ majority of studies uses broadband TIR sensors to estimate temperature-based\
    \ indices for\nthe detection of plant responses to water stress [59,97–100]. Broadband\
    \ TIR imagers (i.e., one spectral\nband in the wavebands of 7–14 µm) are based\
    \ on the assumption of a constant emissivity (e.g., 0.97\nfor vegetation), which\
    \ does not exist in nature [101]. Thus, neglecting the spectral emissivity of\
    \ the\nleaves themselves limits the accuracy of temperature estimation. For example,\
    \ an error in the assumed\nemissivity of 1% results in absolute temperature errors\
    \ of about 1 K [22]. However, new hyperspectral\nTIR imagers provide innovative\
    \ techniques to overcome this limitation by many narrowband measures,\nwhich allow\
    \ precise spectral emissivity retrieval and hence better surface temperature estimation\n\
    compared to broadband thermal cameras (for more details see Section 3.1.4 in this\
    \ review).\n3.1.3. Emissivity-Based Approach\nDespite a variety of geological\
    \ applications using TIR spectroscopy (e.g., [102,103]), up to now,\nhyperspectral\
    \ TIR remote sensing of plant properties has received little attention.\nThe general\n\
    assumption that vegetation does not provide suitable spectral features in the\
    \ TIR to study plant\nphysiological traits depends on several issues as summarized\
    \ by Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley [104]:\n(i) general lack of hyperspectral instruments\
    \ for remote sensing (most available setups are based on\nlaboratory equipment),\
    \ (ii) very low and complex spectral emissivity variations are originating from\n\
    complex plant physiological and biochemical processes, (iii) low signal-to-noise-ratio\
    \ (SNR) as well as\nlow spatial and spectral resolution of airborne or satellite\
    \ remote sensing TIR sensors fail to detect\nminor variations in plants TIR spectral\
    \ ﬁngerprint, (iv) proper atmospheric correction and advanced\nTES methods are\
    \ needed to retrieve accurate emissivity spectra.\nOnly a few researchers have\
    \ studied vegetation spectra in TIR thus far. Salisbury [105] was\nthe ﬁrst who\
    \ recognized detectable spectral variations in fresh leaves of 13 diﬀerent tree\
    \ species\nusing Directional Hemispherical Reﬂectance (DHR) measurements at the\
    \ laboratory level. In 2007,\nRibeiro da Luz and Crowley [104] associated vegetation\
    \ spectral features to leaf chemical compounds\nsuch as cellulose, xylan, lignin,\
    \ cutin, and silica. Furthermore, they were the ﬁrst who carried out\nsuitable\
    \ ﬁeld, canopy and airborne measurements of vegetation spectra in the TIR domain\
    \ [106]. These\nﬁndings, together with recent advances in sensor technology and\
    \ the availability of hyperspectral\nTIR imagers (see Table 2; e.g., Telops HyperCam-LW,\
    \ Speciem AisaOWL, Itres TASI-600, SEBASS\n(Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array\
    \ Spectrograph System), HyTES) facilitate new possibilities to\ndetect environmental\
    \ stresses based on spectral emissivity. The main underlying advantage of TIR\n\
    spectral information in comparison to the VNIR/SWIR domain is that TIR spectral\
    \ features originate\nfrom primary absorption bands of biochemical leaf compounds\
    \ (e.g., cellulose) and should thus\nexhibit higher spectral contrast as VNIR/SWIR\
    \ spectra which are mainly dominated by overtones and\ncombination modes of fundamental\
    \ vibrations originating from the interactions between solar radiation\nand leaf\
    \ contents (e.g., leaf pigments) [107]. Therefore, changes in the compositions\
    \ of leaf constituents\ninduced by water stress should be accompanied by changes\
    \ in the emissivity spectra (e.g., [108]).\nHowever, only little eﬀort has been\
    \ directed to the detection of plant responses to environmental\nstresses based\
    \ on spectral emissivity. Buitrago et al. [62] showed the ability of spectral\
    \ emissivity to\ndetect water and cold stress on both European beech (Fagus sylvatica)\
    \ and rhododendron (Rhododendron\ncf. catawbiense) leaves using DHR laboratory\
    \ measurements. Gerhards et al. [63] conducted further\nsuccessful research on\
    \ the utility to use spectral emissivity for the detection of water stress on\
    \ potato\nplants (Solanum tuberosum L. Cilena).\n3.1.4. Physically-Based Approach\n\
    Since the temperature-based indices only provide the relative measures of plant\
    \ stress, the\nphysically-based modeling of evapotranspiration (ET) could oﬀer\
    \ an alternative approach not only for\nthe detection of plant responses to water\
    \ deﬁcit, but, also to gain further insights into the interaction\nof plants with\
    \ the intervening pedosphere and atmosphere under environmental stress conditions.\n\
    Intrinsic water use by crops is principally determined by transpiration (T), thus,\
    \ accurately quantifying\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n10 of 24\ncrop T and its\
    \ spatial variability is a key metric to account for the crop consumptive water\
    \ use and\ncontribute to water resource management needed in both ecology and\
    \ agriculture.\nAmong the ranges of techniques used to measure ET (e.g., lysimetric,\
    \ Bowen-ratio energy balance\nand the eddy covariance) [109–111], eddy covariance\
    \ (EC) is the most promising for continuous\nmonitoring of ET. However, it is\
    \ hindered by several technical, economic, and environmental factors,\nand sometimes\
    \ suﬀers due to extended periods of non-operation [112]. EC does not provide spatially\n\
    explicit ET, and thus is not ideally suited for the research purposes of water-stress\
    \ detection. However,\nTIR remote sensing provides the ability of synoptic, spatially\
    \ continuous, and frequent observations of\nET at varying spatial and temporal\
    \ scales.\nEstimation of ET through TIR remote sensing is based on surface energy\
    \ balance (SEB)\nmodeling [113–117]. In state-of-the-art SEB models, λE (evaporation\
    \ as latent heat ﬂux) is derived\neither as a residual of the SEB or through partitioning\
    \ of the net available energy (ϕ) (i.e., net radiation,\nRN-soil heat ﬂux, G).\
    \ The principal assumption of using land-surface temperature (LST) in a SEB model\n\
    is, TIR remote sensing can give direct information of the land-surface moisture\
    \ status inﬂuencing the\nsurface energy ﬂuxes and their partitioning [113,118].\
    \ This LST is directly integrated into physical SEB\nmodels [115] which describes\
    \ the heat ﬂux between the surface and atmosphere by an electrical analog\nwhich\
    \ is driven by a diﬀerence in temperature (as a potential) with the rate controlled\
    \ by aerodynamic (or\nboundary layer) conductance (gA). Examples are: the one-source\
    \ approach that treats the soil-vegetation\nsystem as a single unit and derive\
    \ lumped evaporation [116,119]; or the two-source approach treating\nthe soil-vegetation\
    \ system separately, thereby decomposing LST into soil and vegetation temperatures,\n\
    so that evaporation and transpiration can be retrieved individually [113,120,121].\
    \ Both approaches\nfollow a bottom-up scaling approach and combine LST with radiation,\
    \ meteorological and VI data to\nsolve for sensible heat ﬂux (H) and estimate\
    \ ET as a residual in the SEB equation. However, solving\nthis aerodynamic approach\
    \ causes additional problems, particularly in relation to the speciﬁcation\nof\
    \ gA which is generally not measurable at scales in which TIR remote sensing is\
    \ applied. So far, the\nadoption of some empirical models to determine this conductance\
    \ is the state-of-the-art which makes\nET estimates prone to signiﬁcant uncertainties\
    \ [122,123].\nTo circumvent such problem, a non-parametric and calibration-free\
    \ ET estimation approach has\nbeen developed: the STIC model (Surface Temperature\
    \ Initiated Closure, [124–128]) for simultaneously\nestimating ET, H, gA and canopy-surface\
    \ conductance (gS), surface moisture status, and ET components\n(evaporation,\
    \ E, and transpiration, T) from the data itself. The STIC formulation is based\
    \ on physical\nintegration of LST into the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation to ﬁnd\
    \ analytical solutions to gA, gS, and the\naerodynamic temperature (T0) thereby\
    \ obtaining a “closure” of the SEB. This approach simultaneously\ncaptures the\
    \ critical feedbacks between gA, gS, T0, and VPD surrounding the evaporating surface.\
    \ The\nestimates of conductances, ET, and associated surface ﬂux components obtained\
    \ through STIC are\nindependent of any land-surface parameterization [128,129],\
    \ thus having the potential to overcome\nsome of the major stumbling blocks of\
    \ the currently available thermal ET algorithms.\nBeyond ET, water stress is an\
    \ important factor for inferring the surface and root zone water\nstatus [130].\
    \ Based on the ratio of ET to potential evaporation, Anderson et al. [114] developed\
    \ the\nevaporative stress index (ESI) for continental-scale water-stress mapping.\
    \ Water stress is generally\nobtained by combining simulated ET and the theoretical\
    \ upper limit of ET under unstressed surface\nconditions. While a recent study\
    \ of Delogu et al. [131] assessed the performance of a two-source Soil\nPlant\
    \ Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration (SPARSE) model for predictions\
    \ of water\nstress from the ET components of soil and canopy; Yang et al. [132]\
    \ used ESI to capture crop stress and\nimpacts on regional yield variability in\
    \ water-limited agricultural regions. Apart from that, ESI is also\nused in the\
    \ U.S. [133,134], Brazil [135], and the Czech Republic [136] to demonstrate the\
    \ importance of\nET-based water stress to explain regional yield variability in\
    \ water-limited agroecosystems.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n11 of 24\n3.2. Comparison\
    \ to Other Spectral Domains\nOver the past four decades, remote sensing of vegetation\
    \ has focused on the solar- or\noptical-reﬂective domain of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum (0.4–2.5 µm; VNIR/SWIR) with a large number\nof available multi- and\
    \ hyperspectral sensors at ground- (e.g., ASD FieldSpec, SpectralEvolution PSR+),\n\
    airborne- (e.g., AVIRIS, HyMap, HySpex, Aisa FENIX), and spaceborne-level (e.g.,\
    \ Landsat, SPOT,\nMODIS, IKONOS; HYPERION). Optical-reﬂective remote sensing is\
    \ based on the spectral reﬂectance\nproperties of mainly the leaves, the canopy\
    \ and the underlying soil [32,137]. Especially hyperspectral\ndata opened the\
    \ opportunity for the development of narrowband vegetation indices (VIs), simplifying\n\
    the interpretation of complex vegetation reﬂectance signatures based on their\
    \ indirect relationships\nto plant physiological and structural parameters [138]\
    \ such as canopy water content (e.g., MSI; [69]),\ngreenness or fractional vegetation\
    \ cover (NDVI; [66]), or photosynthetic activity (PRI; [64]). All of these\nVIs\
    \ are somehow sensitive to the current plant water status (e.g., chlorophyll and\
    \ water content, as well\nas photosynthetic rate and leaf or canopy structure\
    \ change under water-stress condition [15,16,20])\nand thus can be used as indicators\
    \ for the detection of plant water stress [73,100,139]. However, VIs\nrelated\
    \ to chlorophyll or leaf water content are related to late plant responses which\
    \ tend to arise\nwith visible symptoms (i.e., changing leaf color, leaf rolling,\
    \ or wilting). Thus, it can be assumed that\ntheir usage for pre-visual water-stress\
    \ detection in crops is limited. On the contrary, PRI is directly\nlinked to the\
    \ photosynthetic process due to short-term changes in xanthophyll pigments under\
    \ stress\nconditions. Therefore, PRI is considered a pre-visual index for water-stress\
    \ detection. For instance,\nSuárez et al. [140] and Panigada et al. [73] illustrated\
    \ the feasibility of PRI as a pre-visual water-stress\nindicator at airborne level.\
    \ Suárez et al. [140] observed robust relationships with canopy temperatures\n\
    for various crops (e.g., r2 = 0.8 for peach trees, r2 = 0.65 for olive trees,\
    \ r2 = 0.72 for maize). Additionally,\nPanigada et al. [73] found that PRI is\
    \ more sensitive to an early plant water-stress stadium than\ntraditional VIs\
    \ (e.g., NDVI). However, the ability of the PRI to be used for water-stress detection\
    \ is not\nconclusive [63,73,139].\nIn contrast, remote sensing of SIF, the passive\
    \ measurement of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence emission\npeaks centered at 685 nm and\
    \ 740 nm, is considered a direct indicator of photosynthetic eﬃciency [72] and\n\
    has become more and more prominent over the last decade (see Meroni et al. [71]\
    \ for a comprehensive\nreview). Simpliﬁed, the rationale for remote sensing of\
    \ SIF is based on the competitive interactions of\nhow radiative energy absorbed\
    \ by leaf chlorophyll is processed within the plant: (i) most of the energy\n\
    is used for the photochemical conversion to sugars through photosynthesis, (ii)\
    \ the non-used energy is\nrapidly re-emitted through chlorophyll ﬂuorescence or\
    \ (iii) heat dissipation [23]. Since CO2 uptake\nis reduced under water-stress\
    \ conditions and thus energy used by photosynthesis is also decreased,\nmeanwhile\
    \ the amount of radiative energy remains constant, SIF and/or heat dissipation\
    \ would\nconsequently also change. Therefore, changes in SIF might be highly correlated\
    \ with photosynthetic\neﬃciency and it can thus be assumed to be a proxy for early\
    \ detection of plant responses to water\nstress [72,141,142]. Many ground-based\
    \ studies have been undertaken to demonstrate the feasibilities\nof ﬂuorescence\
    \ sensing to detect and monitor plant stresses. Additionally, current advances\
    \ in sensor\ntechnology have opened new opportunities to focus on SIF imaging\
    \ from airborne and even spaceborne\nplatforms. Since the ﬂuorescence signal is\
    \ considerably lower (about 1–2% of the total energy reﬂected\nand emitted by\
    \ plants) than the plant reﬂectance used by optical sensor systems, a sensor for\
    \ SIF\nsensing requires an extremely high SNR which traditionally limits other\
    \ sensor abilities (i.e., spectral\nand/or spatial resolution). Apart from this\
    \ limitation, the ﬂuorescence emission peaks appear in\nsuper-narrow spectral\
    \ windows within the spectral range from 650 to 800 nm, requiring extremely high\n\
    spectral resolution in the range of nanometers. Notwithstanding, the major potential\
    \ of SIF remote\nsensing could be presumed from the FLEX (Fluorescence Explorer)\
    \ satellite mission supported by the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA). Although recent\
    \ experiments based on airborne data demonstrated\nthe utility of SIF for quantitative\
    \ plant stress detection [139,142], further multi-sensor airborne studies\n(e.g.,\
    \ comparative research of SIF, VNIR/SWIR and TIR) are needed to establish a consistent\
    \ basis for a\nrobust assessment.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n12 of 24\nSince\
    \ diﬀerent plant stresses co-occurring under ﬁeld conditions cause various plant\
    \ responses,\na multi-sensor approach not only provides useful information about\
    \ current plant status but also\non the causes of biophysical, physiological,\
    \ and photochemical changes. Several airborne studies\nexamined the relationship\
    \ between diﬀerent remote sensing approaches for water-stress detection,\nranging\
    \ from optical indices over SIF to temperature-based indices. For example, Panigada\
    \ et al. [73]\nperformed a comparative analysis on airborne level. They found\
    \ that temperature-based indices\nperformed best in comparison to SIF and optical\
    \ indices (e.g., PRI) in cereal crops under diﬀerent\nirrigation levels. Similar\
    \ results were obtained by Gerhards et al. at ground [63] and airborne\nlevel\
    \ [143]. However, a hyperspectral multi-sensor airborne approach with its high\
    \ spatial, spectral,\nand temporal resolution has great potential to bridge the\
    \ gap between in situ and satellite observation.\nFurthermore, such concepts provide\
    \ profound insights into the actual plant status and the rationale\nof physiological\
    \ and biochemical changes. Thus, integrated use of thermal and narrowband optical\n\
    imagery to accurately retrieve stress-related plant responses as an input for\
    \ agricultural applications\n(e.g., irrigation scheduling, phenological growth\
    \ stage assessment, agricultural species detection) is\nhighly recommended.\n\
    4. Challenges and Future Perspectives\n4.1. Relationship between Spectral Emissivity\
    \ Features and Leaf Traits\nCurrent advances in sensor technology have opened\
    \ the opportunity for imaging hyperspectral\nremote sensing of vegetation in the\
    \ TIR spectral domain and thus to use spectral emissivity for the\ndetection of\
    \ environmental stresses. However, only a few studies have been conducted that\
    \ examine\nspectral emissivity in remote sensing of vegetation. For example, Ullah\
    \ et al. [144] and Rock et al. [145]\ndemonstrated that speciﬁc spectral features\
    \ in the TIR signature are related to various plant species.\nFurthermore, for\
    \ the ﬁrst time, water stress was detected through changes in spectral emissivity\
    \ as\nmeasured by imaging TIR spectroscopy at ground level [63]. Additional studies\
    \ by Buitrago et al. [62]\nand Buitrago Acevedo et al. [146] provided promising\
    \ results on the relation between leaf structural or\nbiochemical characteristics\
    \ and leaf emissivity spectra.\nHowever, the utility of spectral emissivity for\
    \ the detection of plant responses to environmental\nstresses is limited. For\
    \ example, it is still unknown which physiological and biochemical processes\n\
    cause changes in the spectral emissivity and how they are related. Furthermore,\
    \ the major challenge\nof emissivity-based applications of TIR remote sensing\
    \ is the upscaling from ground to airborne\nand satellite level. Ribeiro da Luz\
    \ and Crowley [106] and [147] were able to discriminate diﬀerent\ntree species\
    \ based on their airborne emissivity features but most of the spectral information\
    \ of plant\nemissivity spectra is lost through scaling eﬀects (e.g., mixed pixel,\
    \ cavity eﬀects), which are still largely\nunknown. Furthermore, current TIR satellites\
    \ do not accomplish the requirements (i.e., high SNR, high\nspectral and spatial\
    \ resolution) to measure the low spectral contrast emissivity features of vegetation\n\
    from space. Consequently, the upscaling of emissivity-based approaches for water-stress\
    \ detection\nfrom space is very limited yet. Therefore, further fundamental research\
    \ is absolutely needed to better\nunderstand the relations between the spectral\
    \ emissivity features and changes in leaf traits under\nenvironmental stress conditions\
    \ at diﬀerent remote sensing scales.\n4.2. Thresholds for Temperature-Based Indices\n\
    In comparison to VNIR/SWIR indices, temperature-based indices provide an appropriate\
    \ pre-visual\nproxy for the detection of plant responses to water stress, which\
    \ already has been demonstrated earlier\nby Zarco-Tejada et al. [100] and Panigada\
    \ et al. [73]. Therefore, TIR indices have an enormous potential\nto be applied\
    \ in precision agriculture and especially in irrigation management to determine\
    \ the right\ntime, the right place and the right amount of water to apply to reduce\
    \ the amount of water used per\nunit yield. However, it is still unclear when\
    \ to irrigate the ﬁelds and how much water the crops need.\nCWSI is pointed out\
    \ to be applicable for the detection of crop water stress in diﬀerent crop types,\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n13 of 24\nseasonal growing stages, and even various\
    \ climates. Notwithstanding, further research is needed to\nestablish generally\
    \ accepted calculations of CWSI to determine thresholds for irrigation scheduling.\
    \ In\nparticular, CWSI can be estimated following various approaches from the\
    \ analytical CWSI to the use of\nartiﬁcial reference surfaces for the calculation\
    \ of Twet and Tdry. In addition, crop-speciﬁc thresholds of\nCWSI are needed to\
    \ consider plant-speciﬁc strategies to environmental stresses such as various\
    \ leaf\nstructural architectures (e.g., hypo- or amphistomatous leaves, cuticle\
    \ thickness, trichomes). Since the\ntemperature diﬀerences between stressed and\
    \ non-stressed plants are low in cold and humid climates\ndue to the low VPD,\
    \ further care must be taken when applying thresholds of CWSI in more temperate\n\
    climate zones [48,51].\n4.3. ET Modeling\nThe uncertainties and challenges of\
    \ TIR remote sensing to derive ET are mainly categorized\ninto three generic classes,\
    \ namely (i) calibration, parameterization uncertainty and spatial scaling\nuncertainty,\
    \ (ii) representative spatial and temporal resolution uncertainty, (iii) ET partitioning\n\
    water-stress characterization uncertainty.\nSome of the fundamental challenges\
    \ in ET mapping through SEB models have evolved due to, (i)\nthe inequality between\
    \ LST and the aerodynamic temperature (T0), which is essentially responsible\n\
    for the exchanges of H [124,125,148,149]; (ii) a non-unique relationship between\
    \ T0 and LST due to\ndiﬀerences between the roughness lengths (i.e., eﬀective\
    \ source/sink heights) for momentum (z0M) and\nheat (z0H) within vegetation canopy\
    \ and substrate complex [124,150–152]; (iii) the unavailability of a\nuniversally\
    \ agreed model to estimate spatially explicit T0 [125,153]; (iv) the lack of a\
    \ physical-based\nor analytical gA model as a true representative for spatial\
    \ application [124,125]; (v) complexities in\ngA parameterization to accommodate\
    \ the diﬀerences between the scalar roughness lengths of heat\n(z0H) and momentum\
    \ (z0M) transfer. Such parameterizations are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by land-surface\n\
    heterogeneity and could cause the ET severely overestimated in the semi-arid or\
    \ arid ecosystems.\nField-scale ET mapping demands both high temporal and spatial\
    \ resolution images. Therefore,\ndedicated exploitation of both thermal infra-red\
    \ (IR) and shortwave infrared bands could be helpful to\ndirectly constrain the\
    \ elements of the SEB and ﬁeld-scale water status [154]. Another major challenge\
    \ in\nSEB-based ET estimates using polar orbiting sensors is associated with integration\
    \ of one-time-of-day\nET estimates to daily ET. In the water-unlimited ecosystems,\
    \ the diurnal course of ET closely follows\nsinusoidal pattern of net radiation\
    \ [155]. Therefore, sinusoidal integration is generally followed to\nextrapolate\
    \ the instantaneous ET to daily ET, with the assumption of self-preservation of\
    \ evaporative\nfraction. However, in the water-stressed ecosystems, morning rise\
    \ in LST leads to rapid decline of the\ntopsoil moisture and diurnal ET is substantially\
    \ lagged behind the net available energy from 11 a.m.\nThus, the assumption of\
    \ diurnal conservation of evaporative fraction is violated in such ecosystems\n\
    and sinusoidal integration could lead to overestimation of daily ET.\nET is an\
    \ absolute, physical quantity, but it also needs to be translated into quantitative\
    \ water-stress\ninformation for inferring the surface water status and the root\
    \ zone soil moisture by partitioning of\nET into evaporation (E) and transpiration\
    \ (T) [130,156]. Contemporary ET partitioning frameworks\nuse single soil-vegetation\
    \ composite surface skin temperature (i.e., LST). The two-source SEB model\nproposes\
    \ an arguable underlying assumption to down-regulate transpiration from its potential\
    \ upper\nlimit to actual [113], the model assumes suﬃcient accessibility of water\
    \ in the root zone to transpire\nat a potential rate. Thus, the modeled potential\
    \ transpiration rate is a valid ﬁrst guess estimate for\nT under water-unlimited\
    \ conditions. However, if vegetation stress is ignored in the ﬁrst guess, the\n\
    resulting evaporation will decrease to unrealistic levels (negative ﬂuxes) to\
    \ maintain the same total\ncomposite LST and T will be substantially overestimated.\
    \ Such ambiguous assumptions need to be\nstudied and improvised in detail for\
    \ routine mapping of ﬁeld-scale water stress in semi-arid and arid\necosystems,\
    \ and in the Mediterranean climates.\nNot only the challenges of TIR remote sensing\
    \ to derive ET are numerous but also ET modeling\nitself. due to aforementioned\
    \ criticalities in determining the aerodynamic (gA) and canopy-substrate\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n14 of 24\nconductance (gC) [157], and T0 [151]. Observations\
    \ of gA and gC are not available at the respective\nscales and their estimation\
    \ relies heavily on the empirical parameterizations of surface roughness,\ndisplacement\
    \ height, and atmospheric stability correction, which degrades the performance\
    \ of the\nmodels especially in the water-stressed ecosystems. A new ET model,\
    \ SPARSE [130,158], is particularly\ndesigned for ET mapping in water-scarce ecosystems\
    \ and tends to overcome the T0 vs. LST inequality\nchallenges. The non-parametric\
    \ STIC ET model [125–128], has also been developed to circumvent the\nchallenges\
    \ of scalability of empirical conductance functions for satellite-based ET mapping,\
    \ and is\nthe only model that estimates spatially explicit ET without any biophysical\
    \ parameterization of the\nconductances [124]. For successful application of SEB\
    \ models in ET mapping, it is not only important\nto have an LST component in\
    \ the model, but, another crucial importance is to have an ensemble\nET from a\
    \ range of LST-driven models to obtain the best ET estimate for respective crop,\
    \ soil, and\nhydrometeorological conditions.\n4.4. Data Processing\nThe main challenge\
    \ of all TIR approaches for the detection of crop water-stress at airborne\nand\
    \ satellite level is associated with sensor related technical limitations and\
    \ scale eﬀects. From the\ntechnical side, instrument SNR, atmospheric correction,\
    \ and TES are the most challenging tasks to\nbe solved. Meanwhile, scale eﬀects\
    \ are dealing with constraints originating from mixed pixels and\ncanopy structure-related\
    \ factors such as scattering, re-radiation and cavity eﬀects [95]. For example,\
    \ the\ndisaggregation of crop temperature from the much warmer soil pixels is\
    \ of great interest for the accuracy\nof temperature-based indices and ET modeling\
    \ approaches as retrieved from airborne- and satellite\nplatforms [159]. However,\
    \ since the pre-processing of TIR data is essential for the retrieval of both\n\
    spectral emissivity and surface temperature, the major limitation of hyperspectral\
    \ TIR remote sensing\nfrom airborne- and satellite platforms persists in the lack\
    \ of appropriate data processing schemes.\nTherefore, further research is especially\
    \ needed in the development and implementation of solid\natmospheric correction\
    \ processing schemes and TES algorithms. Since hyperspectral remote sensing\n\
    in the TIR is currently limited to ground- and airborne level and thus only available\
    \ for small-scale\nstudies, there is a demand for hyperspectral satellite TIR\
    \ missions with regional or global coverage.\n4.5. Satellite Multi-/Hyperspectral\
    \ TIR Missions\nSince multi- and hyperspectral TIR satellites are currently missing,\
    \ mission designs such as\nHiTeSEM (High-resolution Temperature and Spectral Emissivity\
    \ Mapping [95]) HyspIRI (Hyperspectral\nInfrared Imager [94]), and LSTM (Land-Surface\
    \ Temperature Monitoring [96]) provide very promising\nperspectives towards the\
    \ application of multi-/hyperspectral TIR for the detection of environmental\n\
    stresses from space.\nFurthermore, in 2018 four innovative Earth-observation instruments\
    \ were launched and tested\nfor potential future satellite-based plant function\
    \ monitoring on the International Space Station\n(ISS) [93]. This multi-sensor\
    \ approach covers a wide range of instruments for the survey of novel\nregional\
    \ and global insights into ecosystem processes and functions. The instruments\
    \ are the Global\nEcosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI, NASA), the Ecosystem\
    \ Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer\nExperiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS, NASA),\
    \ the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-3, NASA),\nand the Hyperspectral Imager\
    \ Suite (HISUI, JAXA). GEDI carries a LiDAR (Light Detection And\nRanging) measuring\
    \ canopy structural parameters (e.g., height, biomass). TIR data products (i.e.,\n\
    surface temperature, ET) will be delivered by ECOSTRESS. SIF is measured by OCO-3\
    \ and HISUI\ndelivers surface reﬂectance (10 nm spectral resolution) in the VNIR/SWIR.\
    \ The data products will be\nfreely available and will open the unique opportunity\
    \ for scientists to examine the performance and\ncapabilities of such innovative\
    \ satellite-based multi-sensor approach to study plant functioning and\nthe response\
    \ to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems. In particular, the ECOSTRESS\n\
    instrument on ISS will oﬀer ﬁrst prospects for future TIR satellite missions.\
    \ However, the atmospheric\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n15 of 24\ncorrection\
    \ of the data is very challenging due to the changing height of the ISS. Thus,\
    \ the data from the\nupcoming TIR satellite missions are expected to be more beneﬁcial.\n\
    4.6. Representativness and Compatibility\nThe justiﬁcation of water-stress research\
    \ originates due to the increases in agriculture because of\npopulation growth,\
    \ and increases in environmental stressors (such as drought). However, most of\
    \ the\ncurrent satellite missions fail to have representative spatial and/or temporal\
    \ resolutions. Because of\ntechnical limitations of the remote sensing sensors,\
    \ current state-of-the-art thermal infrared sensing\nsatellites either deliver\
    \ high temporal (e.g., MODIS, AVHRR, or Sentinel-3 with 1–3 days revisit time;\n\
    Table 2) but coarse spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) or high spatial (e.g., Landsat\
    \ series, ASTER with ~100 m;\nTable 2) but low temporal (i.e., 16 days) resolution\
    \ images. One Solutions to this could be multi-sensor\nscaling, such as pan-sharpening,\
    \ or more complex disaggregation approaches (e.g., thermal sharpening\nor temperature\
    \ unmixing as listed in Zhan et al. [159]). The combination of independent spectral\n\
    domains in a multi-sensor approach would deﬁnitely provide the possibilities of\
    \ new insights in the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere continuum. However, before multi-sensor\
    \ combinations can be performed, one\nof the major challenges in today’s remote\
    \ sensing products (i.e., satellite and airborne), the compatibility\nof such\
    \ datasets originating from diﬀerent platforms and spectral domains with various\
    \ spatial and\ntemporal resolution, needs to be conﬁrmed.\n5. Conclusions\nThis\
    \ review paper has brieﬂy discussed the current state-of-the-art, opportunities\
    \ and limitations\nof multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing approaches for the detection\
    \ of crop water stress. Water-deﬁcit\nstress is of utmost importance to guarantee\
    \ global water and food supply and knowledge of crop\nwater status over large\
    \ farmland areas bear large potential for optimizing agricultural water use. Plant\n\
    responses to water stress can be recognized as a sequence of physiological and\
    \ biochemical changes\ndepending on the severity and duration of plant water deﬁcit.\
    \ Hence, the detection of water-stress\nsymptoms is a function of time and depends\
    \ on the plant responses to water deﬁcit and their\ncorresponding physiological\
    \ changes, which may be sensitive to diﬀerent remote sensing techniques.\nThe\
    \ latest state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques for the detection of crop\
    \ water stress are:\n(i) thermal infrared (TIR) multi-/hyperspectral, (ii) SIF\
    \ approaches and (iii) classic solar-reﬂective\n(VNIR/SWIR) hyperspectral imaging.\
    \ For all three domains dedicated sensor technology is required,\nwhich are currently\
    \ in place for ground and airborne applications and either have satellite concepts\n\
    under development (e.g., HySPIRI, Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject\
    \ to satellite missions\nrecently launched or scheduled within the next years\
    \ (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA (launched on March\n2019) in the VNIR/SWIR, FLEX in\
    \ the SIF).\nAlthough TIR remote sensing has several potential advantages over\
    \ optical remote sensing in\ncrop water-stress detection, there are important\
    \ challenges to the large-scale usage of hyperspectral\nTIR remote sensing for\
    \ precision agriculture applications: (i) missing thresholds of temperature-based\n\
    indices (e.g., CWSI) for the application in irrigation scheduling, (ii) profound\
    \ knowledge about the\nrelationship between the spectral emissivity features and\
    \ changes in leaf traits under environmental\nstress conditions is missing, (iii)\
    \ lack of current TIR satellite missions with suitable spectral and\nspatial resolution,\
    \ (iv) lack of appropriate data processing schemes and radiative transfer models\n\
    in TIR spectral domain (including atmospheric correction and temperature emissivity\
    \ separation)\nfor hyperspectral TIR remote sensing at airborne- and satellite\
    \ level. Information from multi-sensor\napproaches, including sensors from all\
    \ three domains (i.e., multi-/hyperspectral TIR, VNIR/SWIR,\nand SIF sensors),\
    \ could provide profound insights about the actual plant status and the rationale\n\
    of physiological and biochemical changes. Furthermore, soil water content (SWC)\
    \ derived by SAR\n(Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing (e.g., Sentinel-1)\
    \ together with ET modeling can add some\nextra information about the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum.\
    \ All this remotely sensed information\nare independent but interlinked to the\
    \ plant available water in the soil and the resulting ﬂuxes of water\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2019, 11, 1240\n16 of 24\nvapor and heat. A synergistic multi-sensor use will\
    \ provide better information on the crop water status\nthan the information provided\
    \ by a single spectral domain.\nIn particular, hyperspectral TIR remote sensing\
    \ provides a large potential for the detection of crop\nwater stress. Synergistic\
    \ sensor use will open new avenues for scientists to study plant functioning\n\
    and the response to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems.\nAuthor\

    \ vineyards water management \n \n1. Introduction \nIn Mediterranean regions,\
    \ where precipitation is scarce and irregularly distributed throughout \nthe year,\
    \ irrigation plays a major role in agriculture. However, there is a rising intersectoral\
    \ \ncompetition for water use, which leads to an increased need for improving\
    \ crop water use and \nproductivity. \nAlthough grapevine was traditionally non-irrigated\
    \ in the Douro Valley, irrigation has recently \nbeen introduced in several areas\
    \ aiming to regulate crop yield and quality. A strategy of deficit \nirrigation\
    \ (DI) has been often adopted for vines aiming to obtain high quality grapes for\
    \ wine \nproduction [1,2]. An adequate management of DI depends upon an accurate\
    \ control of the crop \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479 \n16461 \nwater status,\
    \ which is often done through measurements of predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd).\
    \ The \nuse of Ψpd for irrigation scheduling is due to the fact that a quasi equilibrium\
    \ between the water \npotential of plants and the soil occurs before the sunrise\
    \ [3,4]. Although some studies recently \nreported the occurrence of night-time\
    \ transpiration in grapevine, resulting in incomplete predawn \nequilibrium between\
    \ the water potential of plants and the soil, the response of such process has\
    \ \nshown to be primarily affecting water use efficiency and is highly variable\
    \ among cultivars and \nenvironmental conditions [5–9]. However, the knowledge\
    \ about this effect is still limited to a small \nnumber of crops and vine cultivars.\
    \ Nevertheless, the Ψpd may be considered a reliable indicator of \ncrop water\
    \ status in vineyards, thus usable for irrigation scheduling purposes [3,4,8,10].\
    \ Meanwhile, \nlike for other plant water status indicators, the measurement of\
    \ Ψpd over large areas is labor-intensive \nand time-consuming due to the large\
    \ number of observations necessary to accurately characterize a \nsingle plot.\
    \ As a consequence, non-destructive, accurate, and fast methodologies are desirable\
    \ to assess \ncrop water status and other parameters related with crop water stress\
    \ or deficit [11]. \nIn the last decades, spectral reflectance data have increasingly\
    \ been used in the study of \nvegetation due to the strong relationship between\
    \ the spectral properties of vegetation and several \nbiophysical and biochemical\
    \ attributes of vegetation, e.g., vegetation fraction, leaf pigments content,\
    \ \ncanopy water content, crop coefficients, and crop evapotranspiration (e.g.,\
    \ [12–17]). The \ncorresponding spectral reflectance data are often used in the\
    \ form of spectral indices, which are \nmathematical combinations of two or more\
    \ spectral bands selected to describe the biophysical \nparameters of interest\
    \ [18]. The rising availability of spectroradiometers, with the ability to provide\
    \ \nhyperspectral reflectance data, i.e., data collected in very narrow bandwidths\
    \ (1–10 nm) and \ncontinuously over the spectral range [19], has contributed to\
    \ increasing the interest in using \nvegetation indices (VI) based on narrowband\
    \ or hyperspectral data. Most applications of such \nnarrowband indices are focused\
    \ on the study of leaf pigments concentration (e.g., [20,21]) but \nstudies related\
    \ with crop water status and plant water stress have also been published (e.g.,\
    \ [11,22]). \nThe most common reflectance based VIs related with crop water status\
    \ use information from \nthe near and mid-infrared regions because of the strong\
    \ water absorption features in this region of \nthe electromagnetic spectrum.\
    \ The reflectance at 950–970 nm has proved to be useful for estimation \nof plant\
    \ water status [23,24]. Water strongly absorbs radiation at 970 nm, 1200 nm, 1450\
    \ nm, 1930 \nnm, and 2500 nm bands, and these wavelengths can thus be used for\
    \ estimating plant water content \nand water potential [4,13,18,25–27]. Several\
    \ studies have focused on the use of shortwave infrared \n(SWIR) data to detect\
    \ crop water stress (e.g., [28,29]). Alternatively, VIs derived from hyperspectral\
    \ \ndata of the visible and red-edge (sharp transition of vegetation’s reflectance\
    \ between red and \nnear-infrared spectral ranges) regions of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum have been considered for \nassessing crop water status and detecting\
    \ crop water stress at the canopy level in crops like maize [30], \nbarley [31],\
    \ olive orchards [11], and vineyards [4,22]. \nThe narrow band data in the visible\
    \ and red-edge regions can be more easily obtained by using \nthe commonly available\
    \ field spectroradiometers or by remote sensing imagery, both from satellite \n\
    sensors or unmanned aerial vehicles [22]. The use of narrow band VIs based on\
    \ spectral data of the \nvisible and red edge regions is mainly related with the\
    \ content of plant pigments and the associated \nprocess of photosynthesis. Specifically,\
    \ it relates with the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle \npigments [32] and\
    \ the chlorophyll fluorescence emission [33]. The first process is a proxy for\
    \ water \nstress detection, while the second is associated with stomatal conductance\
    \ under water stress \nconditions, as discussed by Zarco-Tejada et al. [22]. Thus,\
    \ although there is no water absorption in \nthe visible spectral region, several\
    \ VIs based on this spectral domain have shown high correlation \nwith crop water\
    \ status and are used as its proxy due to the physiological dependence of leaf\
    \ \npigments on water [4,22,30,34,35]. \nThe increasing availability of instruments\
    \ providing better spectral resolution, both handheld \nspectroradiometers and\
    \ hyperspectral sensors, allows selecting the specific wavelengths that are \n\
    more sensitive to the crop-related parameters under study. For this wavelength\
    \ optimization, both \nempirical statistical approaches and physically based methods\
    \ can be used [18]. Nevertheless, in \nboth approaches, a wide range of values\
    \ of the variable of interest must be sampled in the training \nRemote Sens. 2015,\
    \ 7, 16460–16479 \n16462 \nset of spectra [18]. Recently, a few studies related\
    \ with the assessment of crop water status have \nfocused on this wavelength optimization\
    \ process; however, only a limited number of VIs [11,22], or \nspecific regions\
    \ of the electromagnetic spectrum [13,26,27] have been considered. These studies\
    \ \ninclude applications to several crops, including to vineyards. However, applications\
    \ to different \ncrop conditions and considering a larger set of VIs covering\
    \ different regions of the electromagnetic \nspectrum in the domains of visible\
    \ and near infrared are still lacking. \nConsidering the need to support wine\
    \ growers water management practices, the objectives of \nthe present study consisted\
    \ in (i) evaluating the performance of a large set of VIs, computed with \nspectral\
    \ data ranging from the visible to near-infrared regions, to predict grapevine\
    \ Ψpd; (ii) \nassessing the best narrow wavelengths combination for the several\
    \ VIs (optimized formulation) \nusing an empirical statistical approach; and (iii)\
    \ comparing the performance of VIs computed with \nthe standard formulation and\
    \ the optimized formulation to estimate grapevine Ψpd. References are \nmade to\
    \ support the physiological hypotheses on the interaction of grapevine water status\
    \ measured \nby Ψpd and the optimal VIs. \n2. Material and Methods \n2.1. Study\
    \ Area \nThe research was carried out in Douro Wine Region (Figure 1), northeast\
    \ Portugal, which is a \nwell-known UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape [36,37].\
    \ Viticulture is favored by the \npeculiar climate of Mediterranean type [38–40].\
    \ Vineyards are dominantly on sloppy and terraced \nlandscapes that made it an\
    \ unique vine landscape and favored the quality of wine produced [36,41,42]. \n\
    The most common red wine varietals are the Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Tinta\
    \ Barroca and \nTinta Roriz (Tempranillo), all of them native of the region [43].\
    \ The mean annual precipitation in \nDouro region varies from 400 to 900 mm, with\
    \ an average value of 560 mm, and the mean monthly \ntemperatures range from 5\
    \ °C to 8 °C (January) up to 21–24 °C (July). During the period April–\nOctober,\
    \ the mean temperature is about 19.5 °C and thus the growing season can be defined\
    \ as \n“warm” according to the climate maturity grouping [44]. A heavy water stress\
    \ is commonly observed \nin summer due to the low rainfall, high vapor pressure\
    \ deficit and low soil water content [45]. \nThe study area is located in a commercial\
    \ vineyard (Quinta dos Aciprestes, Real Companhia \nVelha) in Soutelo do Douro\
    \ (41.21°N of latitude and 7.43°W of longitude; Figure 1). The vineyard has \n\
    a total area of 1.17 ha, with an undulating terrain with an average slope of 25%.\
    \ The soil is typical of \nthe schist geologic complex. The vineyard was planted\
    \ in 1998 adopting a bilateral Royat system, \nfollowing the orientation Northeast-Southwest,\
    \ with 2.2 m × 1 m plant spacing. The vines are of the \ncultivar Touriga Nacional,\
    \ and the maximum plants height is 1.5 m. The vineyard is irrigated with a \n\
    drip irrigation system with spacing of 1 m between emitters and an emitter discharge\
    \ of 2 L·h−1. \nThe experimental plot considered in this study was divided in\
    \ two blocks (Block 1 and Block 2; \nFigure 1). Three irrigation treatments with\
    \ two replicate areas were considered in each block (Figure \n1): non-irrigated\
    \ (NI), irrigation treatment 1 (IT1), and irrigation treatment 2 (IT2). Irrigation\
    \ was \nperformed in three dates during the field campaign of 2014: 26 July 2014,\
    \ 2 August 2014 and 8 \nAugust 2014. In the first irrigation date, both IT1 and\
    \ IT2 treatments were equally irrigated during 8 h \n(33.6 mm). In the second\
    \ irrigation date, just the IT2 treatment was irrigated, during 4 h (16.8 mm);\
    \ in \nthe third irrigation date, water was applied for 8 h (33.6 mm) in the IT1\
    \ treatment and for 6 h (25.2 \nmm) in IT2 treatment. The irrigation dates were\
    \ determined by regular measurements of predawn \nleaf water potential (Ψpd) and\
    \ following the management of the commercial vineyard. Field \nmeasurements were\
    \ performed with two replicate sites per water regime in each block: sites A and\
    \ B \nin block 1, and sites C and D in block 2 (Figure 1). \n \n \nRemote Sens.\

    \ plot, with Blocks 1 and 2, and irrigation treatment plots. \n2.2. Plant Water\
    \ Status and Spectral Field Measurements \nThe water status of the vines was assessed\
    \ using Ψpd observations. In grapevines, the Ψpd is \nhighly correlated with leaf\
    \ water potential measured at midday [3]. Between June and September of \n2014,\
    \ Ψpd was measured with a pressure chamber [46] (PMS 600, Albany, OR, USA) in\
    \ six uncovered \nleaves in each replicate site per water regime (n = 12 per water\
    \ regime in each one of the blocks). \nMeasurements were performed before sunrise\
    \ in five dates through the grapevine post flowering \nperiod: 16 June 2014, 10\
    \ July 2014, 26 July 2014, 19 August 2014, and 9 September 2014. \nIn the same\
    \ five dates, reflectance data were collected using a portable spectroradiometer\
    \ \n(Handheld 2, ASD Instruments, Boulder, CO, USA). The spectroradiometer recorded\
    \ spectral data \nbetween 325 nm and 1075 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum,\
    \ with a wavelength interval of 1 nm. \nThe spectroradiometer has a full conical\
    \ angle field-of-view of 25 degrees. For the spectral signatures \nacquisition,\
    \ the sensor was maintained 30 cm above the canopy, directed vertically downward\
    \ \n(nadir view) in order to capture a portion of full canopy. The diameter of\
    \ the spot measured in each \nplant was approximately 15 cm, which was smaller\
    \ than the plant width (40–50 cm), hence avoiding \ninterference of the soil.\
    \ All the spectral measurements were obtained between 11 h and 13 h local \ntime\
    \ in order to minimize changes in solar zenith angle (e.g., [10,11,13,14]), in\
    \ cloud free conditions, \nin two plants per replicate site. Thus, a total of\
    \ four plants per water regime were sampled in each \nblock. Ten repetitions of\
    \ the spectral measurements were collected per plant. Before the canopy \nspectral\
    \ data acquisition, a dark current correction was applied and the reflectance\
    \ of a white \nstandard panel (Spectralon) was measured and automatically divided\
    \ by each canopy spectrum to \nobtain a reflectance output. These calibration\
    \ procedures were automatically performed by the \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479\
    \ \n16464 \nspectroradiometer. Due to high noise observed at the inferior edge\

    \ region were not used. Considering the low or \ninexistent noise between 400\
    \ nm and 1075 nm, the raw reflectance spectral data were directly used \nwithout\
    \ a smoothing pre-treatment of data through filters. \nThe values of Ψpd recorded\
    \ in the field (Ψpd obs) during the year 2014 ranged from −0.025 MPa to \n−0.91\
    \ MPa, reflecting the long-term variation of Ψpd obs registered in Douro region\
    \ [45]. In addition, \nthe recorded dataset covers all the water deficit conditions\
    \ as defined by Carbonneau [47] for a \nvineyard: (i) none to mild water deficit\
    \ conditions (0 MPa > Ψpd > −0.2 MPa); (ii) mild to moderate \nwater deficit conditions\
    \ (−0.2 MPa > Ψpd > −0.4 MPa); (iii) moderate to high water deficit conditions\
    \ \n(−0.4 MPa > Ψpd > −0.6 MPa); and (iv) high water deficit conditions (−0.6\
    \ MPa > Ψpd). \n2.3. Selection of Vegetation Indices to Be Used as Predictors\
    \ of Plant Water Status \nThe reflectance data provided by the spectroradiometer\
    \ measurements in each date were \nanalyzed separately. The ten records obtained\
    \ for each plant were averaged. In order to define the \nbest predictor of crop\
    \ water status, several reflectance based vegetation indices (VI) currently \n\
    available in the literature were computed for the five dates studied. Only VIs\

    \ \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479 \n16465 \nFollowing the equations proposed\
    \ by the original references, hereafter called standard \nformulations, some of\
    \ the VIs were computed considering broadband regions of the electromagnetic \n\
    spectrum (e.g., visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), normalized difference\
    \ greenness vegetation \nindex (NDGI), normalized difference vegetation index\
    \ (NDVI)), while others refer to specific \nwavelengths (water index (WI), photochemical\
    \ reflectance index (PRI), transformed chlorophyll \nabsorption in reflectance\
    \ index (TCARI), modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance (MCARI), \nstructure\
    \ insensitive pigment index (SIPI), modified red edge simple ratio index (mRESR))\
    \ (Table 1). \nAn analysis of the best wavelengths aimed to improve the performance\
    \ of all VIs was \nimplemented following an empirical statistical approach. Other\
    \ authors have also used statistical \napproaches for similar purposes (e.g.,\
    \ [11]). In the current study, the selection of the best \ncombination of wavelengths\
    \ per VI was based on an automatic approach by testing all the possible \ncombinations\
    \ of bands, with 1 nm wavelength interval, for each VI. The full wavelengths range\
    \ of \nthe regions of the electromagnetic spectrum considered in the VI formulation\
    \ (Table 1) was tested as \nillustrated in Figure 2. In case of the WI, PRI, TCARI,\
    \ MCARI, SIPI, mRESR indices, in addition to \ntesting the wavelengths specifically\
    \ proposed in their standard formulation, the full range of \nwavelengths of the\
    \ corresponding regions of the electromagnetic spectrum was also considered for\
    \ \nsearching the best combination of wavelengths relative to each VI. The range\
    \ considered for each \nregion of the electromagnetic spectrum was 400–450 nm\
    \ for violet, 451–520 nm for blue, 521–570 nm \nfor green, 571–700 nm for red,\
    \ 681–740 nm for red edge, and 701–950 nm for near infrared (NIR). For \nthe PRI\
    \ index (Table 1), a subdivision of the green range from 521 to 545 nm and from\
    \ 546 to 570 nm \nwas considered. For the WI index (Table 1), the range from 951\
    \ to 1075 nm was also considered. For \nevery VI, a matrix of all the possible\
    \ combinations of wavelengths was built for each replicate site \nand associated\
    \ irrigation treatment (Figure 2), in a total of six matrices per block with each\
    \ element \nof the matrix corresponding to the VI value for a specific combination\
    \ of wavelengths. A wavelength \ninterval of 1 nm was adopted. This procedure\
    \ was repeated for each date of measurements. In Figure 2, \nthe example of a\
    \ matrix for a VI combining wavelengths of the green and red regions of the \n\
    electromagnetic spectrum is given, VIi,j, with i and j corresponding to the green\
    \ and red wavelengths \n(nm) respectively. A similar procedure was considered\
    \ for the VIs with three bands (e.g., VARI), \nVIi,j,k, with i, j and k subscripts\
    \ representing the wavelengths of each one of the three bands. Data \nfrom blocks\
    \ 1 and 2 were analyzed separately. \nΨpd was used to evaluate which VI and which\
    \ combination of wavelengths per VI better \nassesses the crop water status. The\
    \ average of the six Ψpd obs per replicate site was obtained for each \ndate and\
    \ analyzed against the average value of every VI for the corresponding replicate\
    \ sites and for \nevery combination of wavelengths (VIi,j or VIi,j,k). A correlation\
    \ analysis relating these two sets of \ndata (VI vs. Ψpd obs) was assessed for\
    \ each block and the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient \n(r) was determined\
    \ for each combination of wavelengths (Figure 2). Squared values of the \ncorrelation\
    \ coefficient (r2) were considered to analyze the results of all the combinations\
    \ and VIs in \npositive values. \nTo assess the consistency of the results between\
    \ blocks 1 and 2, an index was computed for each \nwavelength combination per\
    \ VI. This index, hereafter called stability index (SI), combines the \naverage\
    \ r2 obtained for blocks 1 and 2 and the respective difference: \nܵݐܾ݈ܽ݅݅ݐݕ ܫ݊݀݁ݔ(ܵܫ)\
    \ = [(ݎ௕௟௢௖௞ ଵ\nଶ\n+ݎ௕௟௢௖௞ ଶ\nଶ\n) 2]/[1 + (ݎ௕௟௢௖௞ ଵ\nଶ\n−ݎ௕௟௢௖௞ ଶ\nଶ\n)]\n⁄\n\
    \ \n(1) \nFor each VI, the best combination of wavelengths was selected based\
    \ on the highest values \nobtained for r2 and SI considering the average of the\
    \ results of the two blocks, using a sorting \nprocess. The VI computed with the\
    \ best combination of wavelengths was then designated optimal \nVI (VIopt). \n\
    The robustness of the ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum selected for each\
    \ VIopt was \nassessed by testing the full combination of bands considering wavelength\
    \ intervals different from 1 \nnm. Therefore, the average values of reflectance\
    \ obtained for wavelength intervals of 2 nm were \nused to compute the VIopt following\
    \ the same procedure described in Figure 2. A similar approach \nwas considered\
    \ for intervals of 3 nm, 4 nm, 5 nm, 6 nm, 7 nm, 8 nm, 9 nm, and 10 nm. \nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479 \n16466 \nThese tests of the full combination of\
    \ bands were automatically performed using a program \npurposefully developed\
    \ in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc.: Natick, MA,USA.). \n \nFigure 2. Scheme of the procedure\
    \ for selecting the best wavelengths for computation of a vegetation \nindex using\
    \ a wavelengths interval of 1 nm. The scheme refers to a vegetation index combining\
    \ the \nwavelengths of the green (i) and red (j) regions of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. \n2.4. Statistical Analysis \nThe final-selected VIopt were linearly\
    \ regressed against the Ψpd obs relative to Block 1, used as \nparameterization\
    \ dataset, and the resulting equation was adopted as the Ψpd prediction equation.\
    \ Several \nstudies considered the use of linear regression to compare crop water\
    \ status and VIs (e.g., [4,22]). \nMoreover, a pre-assessment of the results showed\
    \ an adequate adjustment of the data to this type of \nanalysis, i.e., not requiring\
    \ a non-linear approach. The Ψpd prediction equation was then tested using \n\
    the dataset from the block 2 (n = 30), which was used as testing set. Subsequently,\
    \ the observed and \nthe predicted values of Ψpd relative to block 2 were compared.\
    \ Additionally, a leave-one-out (LOO) \ncross-validation between the observed\
    \ and the predicted values of Ψpd relative to block 2 was also \napplied. The\
    \ respective results were then analyzed using various goodness-of-fit indicators\
    \ to \nadequately assess the quality of the Ψpd predictive equation, as recommended\
    \ by several authors \n(e.g., [60–62]). \nThe goodness-of-fit indicators adopted\
    \ are widely used in modelling as recently analyzed by \nPereira et al. [61].\
    \ They include [60,63]: \n(a) The determination coefficient (R2) of the ordinary\
    \ least-squares regression between the \nvalues of Ψpd predicted with the VI predictive\
    \ equation (Ψpd VI) and measured (Ψpd obs). A \ndetermination coefficient R2 near\
    \ 1.0 indicates that most of the variance of the observed \nvalues is explained\
    \ by the model (predictive equation). \n(b) The regression coefficient (b) of\
    \ the linear regression through the origin relating Ψpd VI and \nΨpd obs. A value\
    \ of b close to 1 indicates that the predicted values are statistically close\
    \ to the \nobserved ones. \n(c) The root mean square error (RMSE) that expresses\
    \ the variance of residual errors, and \nwhich may vary between zero, when a perfect\
    \ match would occur, and a positive value, \nhopefully smaller than the mean of\
    \ observations; the smaller the RMSE, the better the \npredictive equation. \n\
    Remote Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479 \n16467 \n(d) The average absolute error (AAE),\
    \ which expresses the average size of the errors of \nestimate. \n(e) The percent\
    \ bias (PBIAS) that measures the average tendency of the predicted data to be\
    \ \nlarger or smaller than their corresponding observations. Low values indicate\
    \ an accurate \nprediction and positive or negative values indicate the occurrence\
    \ of an under- or \nover-estimation bias. \n(f) The absolute differences between\
    \ Ψpd VI and Ψpd obs (|Ψpd VI − Ψpd obs|) considering different \nclasses of water\
    \ deficit conditions. \n(g) The modelling efficiency (EF), proposed by Nash and\
    \ Sutcliffe [64], that is used to \ndetermine the relative magnitude of the residual\
    \ variance compared to the measured data \nvariance. Values close to 1.0 indicate\
    \ that the variance of residuals is much smaller than the \nvariance of observations;\
    \ contrarily, when EF is close to 0 or negative, this means that the \nmean is\
    \ as good or better predictor than the model. \n3. Results \n3.1. Selection of\
    \ Predictors of Crop Water Status \nThe performance of the VIs, computed according\
    \ to the standard formulations following the \noriginal references (Table 1) and\
    \ using the optimized formulation, i.e., the best combination of \nwavelengths\
    \ (as described in Figure 2), was tested independently in blocks 1 and 2. Analyzing\
    \ the \ncorrelation between the Ψpd obs and the VIs computed by the standard formulation\
    \ (Table 2), the \nsquared Pearson correlation (r2) was smaller than 0.67 (p <\
    \ 0.001) and several of the VIs (e.g., NDVI, \nSR, GI, WI, mRESR) presented high\
    \ differences between blocks.  \nTable 2. Squared Pearson coefficient of correlation\

    \ r2 increased for all the VIs (Table 2). The results presented in Table 2 for\
    \ the optimized \nformulation correspond to the best r2 value achieved when considering\
    \ the same combination of \nwavelengths in the computation of the optimal VI (VIopt)\
    \ in both blocks. The VIopt with better results \nwere VARI, GI, red green ratio\
    \ index (RGRI), NDGI, and PRI, all with r2 above 0.75 (p < 0.001) in both \nblocks\
    \ (Table 2). All these VIopt integrate wavelength bands in the visible domain\
    \ of the \nelectromagnetic spectrum (Table 1): (i) the PRI considers data in the\
    \ green region; (ii) the GI, RGRI \nand NDGI are two-bands indices integrating\
    \ reflectance data in the green and red; and (iii) the VARI \nis a three-bands\

    \ the classes of higher water deficit (Ψpd <−0.4 MPa); the lower differences \n\
    between water deficit conditions were observed between the classes of none to\
    \ mild water deficit  \n(0 MPa > Ψpd > −0.2 MPa) and mild to moderate water deficit\
    \ (−0.2 MPa > Ψpd > −0.4 MPa). \nThe robustness of the areas of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum selected for each VI (Figure 3) were \nthen tested by considering wavelength\
    \ intervals larger than 1 nm (from 2 × 2 nm up to 10 × 10nm). \nAs shown in Figure\
    \ 5a, the r2 obtained by the correlation between the Ψpd obs and the VIopt did\
    \ not \nvary much for VARI, NDGI, RGRI and GI when the various wavelength intervals\
    \ were considered. \nDifferently, the variation of r2 was larger for PRI, particularly\
    \ for wavelength intervals larger than 4 \nnm. This result for PRI is consistent\
    \ with the pattern observed in the contour map, where a small \narea of high r2\
    \ values was observed in both blocks. \nThe results of the stability index (SI;\
    \ equation 1) indicate a good performance of the optimal \nVARI, NDGI, RGRI, and\
    \ GI by providing a very small variation of SI values regardless of the \nwavelength\
    \ interval considered in the selection of the best combination of wavelengths\
    \ (Figure 5b). \nWithin this set of VIs, the three-bands VARI index (Table 1),\
    \ obtained the best results for SI for all the \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479\

    \ the VARIopt and \nNDGIopt computed for block 2 (testing dataset; n = 30). The\
    \ resulting Ψpd are designated Ψpd VARI and \nΨpd NDGI, respectively. The goodness-of-fit\
    \ indicators relative to comparing the predicted Ψpd VARI and \nΨpd NDGI with\
    \ the Ψpd obs are presented in Table 3. R2 = 0.79 were obtained for both cases,\
    \ indicating a \nsignificant explanation of the Ψpd obs by both indices (Table\
    \ 3). The regression coefficient b of 0.96 \nindicates a slight underestimation\
    \ of Ψpd when using VARI, comparatively better than using NDGI \n(b = 0.93). AAE\
    \ lower than 0.1 MPa and RMSE equal to 0.12 MPa were obtained for both VIs, thus\
    \ \nindicating small residual errors of estimation (Table 3). The PBIAS was small\
    \ in both cases, indicating a \nslight underestimation bias of the predicted values,\
    \ which was lower for Ψpd VARI (Table 3). The EF \nvalues were high and similar\
    \ in both cases (EF > 0.75; Table 3) indicating that the variance of \nresiduals\
    \ was much smaller than the variance of observations. Overall, these indicators\
    \ show a good \nperformance of the predictions of Ψpd with both VIs, particularly\
    \ with VARIopt. Similar performance of \nthe goodness-of-fit indicators was obtained\
    \ when applying the LOO cross-validation, although a \nslightly lower value of\

    \ in \n93% of the cases for |Ψpd obs − Ψpd VARI| (Figure 7). The larger absolute\

    \ 7). These results indicate a better performance of the estimations of \nΨpd\
    \ VARI and Ψpd NDGI for low and moderate stress conditions in the vineyard studied.\
    \ \n4. Discussion \nIn general, the results of the VIs using the standard formulation\
    \ were poorly correlated with \nΨpd obs (r2 ≤ 0.66; Table 2). Differently, results\
    \ highly improved when the VIs optimized formulation \nwas used, i.e., after selection\
    \ of specific wavelengths (Table 2). Several authors also obtained better \nperformance\
    \ of VIs for estimating crop water status when narrow bands of the electromagnetic\
    \ \nspectrum were considered [4,11,22]. \nIn the current study, the VIs integrating\
    \ information of the red and NIR spectral regions (e.g., \nNDVI, SR, SAVI; Table\
    \ 1) were poorly correlated with Ψpd (Table 2), which was also observed by \n\
    Rallo et al. [11] relative to olive orchards. These VIs are commonly associated\
    \ with plant structural \ntraits like leaf area index, biomass, and plant vigor\
    \ (e.g., [30]) but show lower performance in the \ndetection of physiological\
    \ stress condition [65]. In addition, the results obtained by WI, specifically\
    \ \ndesigned for estimation of plant water content [23], showed poor correlation\
    \ with Ψpd, particularly \nin block 1 (Table 2). Similarly, the results of Rodríguez-Pérez\
    \ [4] for the application of WI to assess \nwater status in a vineyard (at canopy\
    \ level) were not very robust. This is likely due to the low \nsensitivity of\
    \ WI for detecting plant water content in mild drought/stress conditions [24].\
    \ \nThe VIs integrating only information in the visible domain, in particular\
    \ the optimal VARI, GI, \nNDGI, RGRI, and PRI (Table 1) have shown better correlations\
    \ with Ψpd obs, with r2 values ranging \nfrom 0.77 to 0.82 in both blocks (Table\
    \ 2) indicating their good performance as proxies of crop water \nstatus. This\
    \ is likely due to the fact that reflectance in the visible domain is mainly governed\
    \ by \npigments content and composition [14,32,33], which relates with processes\
    \ associated to crop water \nstatus [22]. Those five VIs have in common the integration\
    \ of information in the green spectral \nregion (Table 1). The green spectral\
    \ domain is characterized by the absorption of radiation by the \nanthocyanins,\
    \ which are water-soluble pigments associated with the resistance of plants to\
    \ stresses \nlike water deficits [15]. Differently from the other four VIs, VARI\
    \ also integrates the blue band \nwavelengths (Table 1) that refer to a strong\
    \ light absorption by carotenoids (carotenes and xanthophylls); \nthese pigments\
    \ and their proportion to chlorophyll are used as indicators for plants’ physiological\
    \ states \nand plants adaptation to stresses [66]. Furthermore, the blue band\
    \ wavelengths add an atmospheric \nself-correction and allow a more linear relationship\
    \ with the vegetation fraction [14]. \nVARI, GI, NDGI and RGRI are indices originally\
    \ defined for measuring structural properties of \nvegetation and thus associated\
    \ with greenness measures [18]. Their strong relationship with crop \nwater status\
    \ is potentially due to the fact that water stress manifests as an increase in\
    \ green \nreflectance as discussed by Zygielbaum et al. [67]. Nevertheless, other\
    \ morphological responses (e.g., \nleaf angle distribution, canopy geometry) as\
    \ well as phenological and physiological adaptive \nmechanisms to stress conditions\
    \ can occur and have varied effects among species [68–70], which \nmay introduce\
    \ some confounding effects on the response of these structural-oriented VIs. \n\
    Additionally, factors like leaf age can also influence the spectral response thus\
    \ impacting these VIs \nresponses [70]. Contrarily, PRI is a stress/physiology-oriented\
    \ hyperspectral VI [49] designed for \nmeasuring subtle decreases of reflectance\
    \ around 531 nm due to changes in the xanthophyll cycle \npigment activity resulting\
    \ from stress conditions, including water stress conditions [32,34,68]. \nRallo\
    \ et al. [11] obtained a reasonably good prediction of Ψpd at canopy level in\
    \ olive groves \nusing optimal VIs working in the visible domain, specifically\
    \ NDGI (R2 = 0.57, n = 13) and GI (R2 = \n0.53; n = 13), however with less good\
    \ results than those obtained in the current study. A good \nperformance of VARI\
    \ was also obtained by Perry and Roberts [71] when assessing water stress in \n\
    Remote Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479 \n16474 \ncorn using data of narrow bands (10\
    \ nm width) from the AVIRIS sensor. Rodríguez-Pérez et al. [4] \nobtained good\
    \ results in the estimation of water potential at canopy level using a RGRI adjusted\
    \ for \nspecific wavelengths. Differently, other authors preferred the PRI computed\
    \ with the standard \nformulation as a good indicator of crop water stress [34,35,72].\
    \ However, issues related with viewing \nand illumination geometry effects, changes\
    \ due to wilting or in leaf pigments content, as well as \ncanopy structure, can\
    \ affect the performance of PRI as a water stress indicator [22,34,73]. \nZarco-Tejada\
    \ et al. [22] obtained a better performance of PRI for detecting water stress\
    \ in vineyard by \napplying a normalization of the VI, using RDVI and the R700/R670\
    \ index. In the current study, the \nselection of the best wavelengths combination\
    \ allowed improving the correlation of PRI with Ψpd obs, \nthus increasing from\
    \ an average r2 of 0.39 when using the standard formulation to a value of 0.81\
    \ \nusing the optimized formulation (Table 2). \nIn the current study, the optimal\
    \ NDGI, GI, and RGRI obtained the best correlations with Ψpd obs \nconsidering\
    \ the wavelengths of 531 nm and 587 nm, in the green and red domains, respectively\
    \ (for \nwavelengths interval of 1 nm; Figure 3). As previously mentioned, the\
    \ reflectance at 531 nm is \nconsidered a good indicator of stress conditions\
    \ [32,66]. Moreover, the wavelength selected for the \ngreen region (531 nm) is\
    \ within the range of highest sensitivity of reflectance and absorption to \n\
    pigment variation [66]. In the range 530–570 nm, chlorophylls a and b play a major\
    \ role in the light \nabsorption [74]. In general, plant stress occurrence (related\
    \ with a variety of causes) is indicative and \nclosely related with chlorophyll\
    \ content and losses in this pigment induce changes in leaf optical \nproperties\
    \ [75]. However, the wavelength selected in the red domain (587 nm) is not close\
    \ to the \nrange of wavelengths 680–700 nm (red-edge region) considered as reference\
    \ in several studies (e.g., \n[11,49]), but instead is closer to the green region.\
    \ In the optimized formulation of NDGI and GI for an \napplication in olive groves,\
    \ a red band around 680 nm was considered by Rallo et al. [11]. The \ndifference\
    \ in the wavelengths selected for these VIs may be due to variations in the leaf\
    \ structure of \nthe crops. The olive is a sclerophyllous plant, typically tolerant\
    \ to drought stress, with leaves \nconstituted by a compact mesophyll structure\
    \ that reflects less light than leaves from \nnon-sclerophyllous plants with spongy\
    \ mesophyll. This is likely due to the lower hydrated cell \nwall-intercellular\
    \ air space interfaces to reflect light [23]. In addition, the spectral region\
    \ between 660 \nand 680 nm saturates at relatively low chlorophyll contents, thus\
    \ reducing the sensitivity of this \nregion to high chlorophyll contents of spectral\
    \ VIs based on these wavelengths [59,75]. \nIn the current study, the wavelengths\
    \ selected in the VARIopt were the 520 nm, 539 nm and 586 \nnm in the blue, green\
    \ and red domains, respectively, when wavelength intervals of 1 nm were \nconsidered.\
    \ The wavelengths in the regions of green and red were close to the ones selected\
    \ for \noptimal NDGI, RGRI and GI (Figure 3), thus consistent with the results\
    \ obtained for these VIopt. \nFor the PRIopt, the best combination of bands refer\
    \ to the wavelengths of 545 nm and 567 nm, \nboth in the green spectral region\
    \ (Figure 3), which is different from the standard formulation (531 \nnm and 570\
    \ nm; Table 1). Nevertheless, various formulations of PRI, using different wavelengths,\
    \ \nhave been proposed for assessing water status in several crops, including\
    \ in vineyard, using \nairborne data (e.g., [22,76,77]). The effect of canopy\
    \ structure, viewing geometry and background on \nPRI may justify the diversity\
    \ of formulations proposed in the literature for this VI [34]. Moreover, the \n\
    overlapping effect of chlorophyll and carotenoid absorption with the spectral\
    \ bands sensitive to \nxanthophyll pigments may potentially act as a confounding\
    \ factor of PRI [22]. \nThe reflectance of the best wavelengths selected for the\
    \ five optimal VIs showed a good \ndifferentiation between classes of water deficit\
    \ conditions; for conditions of low to moderate water \ndeficit (Ψpd > −0.4 MPa),\
    \ which mostly occurred until around the veraison phenological stage, the \nvalues\
    \ of reflectance were lower than the values for higher water deficit, which were\
    \ observed for \nthe period between veraison and ripening (Figure 4). \nWhen the\
    \ size of the wavelength intervals was evaluated for the VIopt with better correlation\
    \ \nwith Ψpd, VARIopt (three-bands) and NDGIopt (two-bands) have shown the best\
    \ performance for the \nSI, with higher values for the various intervals (Figure\
    \ 5b). On the contrary, the PRIopt showed the \nworse results, both for r2 and\
    \ for the SI, for wavelength intervals larger than 4 nm (Figure 5). The \nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479 \n16475 \nlower performance of the PRIopt is likely\
    \ due to the reduced number of available combinations of \nwavelengths that provide\
    \ high r2, when compared to the other VIs, as shown in Figure 3. \nThe estimation\
    \ of Ψpd using the VARIopt and the NDGIopt revealed good accuracy with high \n\
    values of R2 (R2 = 0.79 for data of block 2 and R2 = 0.75 for cross-validation;\
    \ Table 3). Nevertheless, the \nresults of Ψpd NDGI presented a higher underestimation\
    \ than the Ψpd VARI when compared to the Ψpd obs, \nwhen directly applying data\
    \ from block 2, as indicated by the regression coefficient (b; Table 3). The \n\
    Ψpd estimated with both VARIopt and NDGIopt presented low values of RMSE (≤0.12\
    \ MPa; Table 3) \nand AAE (≤0.102 MPa; Table 3) and the PBIAS was lower than 5.5%\
    \ indicating a good performance \nof the estimation. The biases observed in the\
    \ estimation of Ψpd using the VARIopt and the NDGIopt can \nbe due to errors of\
    \ Ψpd estimation but also due to errors in ground measurements of Ψpd. Regarding\
    \ \nthe latter, the occurrence of night-time transpiration can affect the Ψpd\
    \ observations in some \ngrapevine cultivars, particularly in conditions of no\
    \ stress or mild stress occurrence [5,7,9]. However, \nirrigation is practiced\
    \ only when water stress is moderate/high, thus when night-time transpiration\
    \ \nis less important. Nevertheless, the results in this study were better than\
    \ those achieved for olive \ngroves using several VIs [11]. Contrarily, the R2\
    \ results obtained in the current study were slightly \nlower than the values\
    \ obtained by Zarco-Tejada [22] in vineyards when correlating the leaf water \n\
    potential at midday and a PRI normalized (R2 = 0.82; n = 9). However, in the current\
    \ study, the \ncorrelation between the normalized PRI and the Ψpd (measured at\
    \ predawn and midday) did not \nproduce good results (data not shown). \nAdditionally,\
    \ in this study, the analysis of the absolute differences between Ψpd obs and\
    \ Ψpd VI \naccording to the frequencies showed a good performance of the model\
    \ for conditions of Ψpd > −0.6 \nMPa (Figure 7). This indicator is particularly\
    \ relevant considering that a previous study indicated \nthresholds of Ψpd between\
    \ −0.6 MPa and −0.4 MPa as a monitoring strategy for deficit irrigation in \n\
    the field study [45]. \nStatistical models based on full spectrum, e.g., partial\
    \ least square regression, principal \ncomponent regression, support vector machine,\
    \ and non-linear approaches based on artificial neural \nnets, have been considered\
    \ to retrieve vegetation biophysical variables in alternative to the use of \n\
    VIs (e.g., [13,78,79]). However, despite the outperformance of some of these methods,\
    \ their \noperational applicability is yet limited [79]. The approach based on\
    \ VIs is more easily implemented \nand operationally applied and the results obtained\
    \ in this study demonstrated very good results for \nthe optimal VIs. \n5. Conclusions\
    \ \nA straightforward statistical approach was used to verify the adequacy of\
    \ VIs computed with \nreflectance measurements in the visible domain aiming to\
    \ detect and monitor crop water status in \nvineyard. Moreover, the selection\
    \ of the best combination of wavelengths allowed obtaining optimal VIs. \nA large\
    \ set of VIs were tested and better results were obtained for the VIs integrating\
    \ reflectance \nin the red, green, and blue spectral regions—VARI, NDGI, GI, RGRI,\
    \ and PRI— particularly when \nthe best combination wavelengths were considered.\
    \ The results demonstrated a good performance \nof these VIs when correlated with\
    \ the Ψpd obs for a period from the post-flowering until the harvest. In \naddition,\
    \ a good consistency was obtained when data of an external dataset were tested.\
    \ Moreover, \nthe study demonstrated good results and consistency of VARI (three-bands\
    \ VI) and NDGI \n(two-bands VI) for predicting Ψpd when several wavelength intervals\
    \ were tested for the \ncomputation of the VI. \nThe results indicate that VARIopt\
    \ and NDGIopt estimated from sensors only equipped with bands \nin the visible\
    \ range can be used for estimating Ψpd. The use of these VIopt is more practical\
    \ than the \nconventional measurements of Ψpd, particularly considering the increasing\
    \ availability and \ntechnological improvements in handheld spectroradiometers\
    \ and hyperspectral sensors, including \nairborne sensors. The approach presented\
    \ has potential for providing an enhanced support to \nirrigation water management\
    \ in vineyards. Nevertheless, the approach should be tested in more \nstudy areas\
    \ and grape varieties in future work. Other statistical techniques based on non-linear\
    \ \nand/or full spectrum approaches may also be tested in future work. In addition,\
    \ physiological \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7, 16460–16479 \n16476 \nstudies regarding\
    \ the response of cultivar Touriga Nacional to night-time transpiration and its\

  analysis: 'The article under review delves into the application of Site-specific
    management (SSM) within agricultural systems, emphasizing the use of information
    technology in data collection, analysis, and decision-making. The author discusses
    the potential benefits and challenges associated with SSM, including the ability
    to optimize crop production while reducing environmental impacts. The relevance
    of SSM to automated irrigation management is explored, particularly in the context
    of data collection and transmission, real-time processing, and automated actions.


    One important aspect highlighted in the paper is the need for accurate and spatially
    referenced data on soil properties and crop conditions. The author discusses various
    technologies used for data collection, such as yield monitors, soil inductance
    meters, and remote sensing techniques. The emphasis on data quality and the role
    of geostatistical methods in data integration and analysis are key aspects of
    SSM.


    The author also acknowledges the importance of understanding the underlying factors
    that contribute to yield variability. Correlation analysis and multiple regression
    techniques are mentioned as common approaches to identifying these factors. Additionally,
    the paper discusses the use of management zones as a practical strategy for dividing
    a field into areas with similar yield-limiting factors.


    The economic aspects of SSM are also considered in the article. The author acknowledges
    that the value of SSM lies in the increased value it places on information and
    knowledge. While the costs of acquiring and processing data can be substantial,
    the potential benefits in terms of optimizing inputs, reducing environmental impacts,
    and improving overall profitability can be significant.


    Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts, technologies,
    and challenges associated with implementing SSM. It emphasizes the importance
    of data quality, the identification of yield-limiting factors, the use of management
    zones, and the economic considerations involved in adopting SSM practices.'

    rights and content Abstract Site-specific management (SSM; also called, precision
    agriculture) is the management of agricultural crops at a spatial scale smaller
    than that of the whole field. Widespread farmer adoption of SSM practices is contingent
    on its economic advantage. Three criteria that must be satisfied in order for
    SSM to be justified are, (1) that significant within-field spatial variability
    exists in factors that influence crop yield, (2) that, causes of this variability
    can be identified and measured, and (3) that, the information from these measurements
    can be used to modify crop management practices to increase profit or decrease
    environmental impact. The objective of this paper is to review the state of SSM
    at the turn of the millennium and to offer some speculation as to its future course.
    The review is organized around the essential components of SSM listed above, i.e.
    measuring spatial variability, analyzing the data obtained from these measurements,
    using information gained from this analysis to effect changes in management practices,
    and determining whether the resulting benefits are worth the costs. The discussion
    section considers some potential effects of large-scale adoption of SSM, should
    this adoption occur. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction Site-specific management (SSM) is the management of agricultural
    crops at a spatial scale smaller than that of the whole field. It is perhaps unfortunate
    that the rather misleading term ‘precision agriculture’ is increasingly being
    used as a synonym for SSM. There is much more to agriculture than crop management,
    and, in any case, many would object to the notion that field-specific crop management
    is ‘imprecision agriculture’. If anything, the term precision agriculture should
    probably be applied more generally to the use of information technology in all
    of agriculture, in which case, SSM forms one component. SSM has been made possible
    by the commercialization of new technologies, such as the global positioning system
    (GPS), the yield monitor and variable rate chemical application, together with
    the adaptation of existing technologies, such as the geographic information system
    and remote sensing. Although the development of SSM practices has been driven
    by space-age technology, the effect of these practices is to return crop management
    to a state that presumably existed prior to the development of mechanized agriculture.
    At that time, crop management was carried out by hand, generally, in smaller fields
    than exist today, and involved considerable opportunity for the farmer to directly
    observe the progress of each part of the field. In this circumstance, fields were
    probably managed on a site-specific basis through conscious and unconscious actions
    of the farmer, such as adding a little extra manure to spots that looked weak.
    The advent of mechanization, which removed the farmer from direct interaction
    with the crop, resulted in considerable savings of labor but also in the application
    of inputs at a uniform rate. This uniform application rate resulted in reduced
    input uses efficiency as inputs were applied at an inappropriate rate in some
    parts of the field (Mulla and Schepers, 1997). The reduced labor costs and increased
    speed more than made up for this waste of inputs economically more, resulted in
    increased environmental burden. As costs of inputs have increased, both the economic
    and environmental disadvantages of uniform input application have become more
    apparent. The level of research interest in SSM has grown dramatically in the
    last decade of the twentieth century. The early contributions to the scientific
    literature in the field (Cressie (1991)) have mostly been published since 1990
    (for a review of the early literature, see Schueller (1992). A biannual conference
    on SSM was initiated in Minneapolis, MN, in 1992. The first meeting attracted
    173 attendees and the proceedings featured 37 papers and abstracts. By the time
    of the fourth conference in 1998, these numbers had grown to 728 attendees and
    194 papers and abstracts in the proceedings. Farmer adoption of these practices
    (or at least purchase of the technology to carry them out) also appears to be
    growing, particularly, in the Midwest. It is estimated that the number of grain-yield
    monitors sold in the United States grew from 50 in 1992 to 17 000 in 1998 (Anonymous,
    1998; this same article points out that the fraction of total arable land for
    which yield maps are created is still only about 5%). Several trade publications
    devoted to SSM have been started, and considerable industrial research is carried
    out to develop and implement yield monitoring, variable-rate chemical application
    and other technologies in an increasing variety of crops. Nevertheless, at the
    start of the twenty-first century, few would be so bold as to predict with certainty
    that SSM will become a generally used part of the cultural practices of crop production.
    Emotional factors, such as fascination with or aversion to new technology, influence
    many individual adoption decisions. However, general and sustained use of technology
    is contingent on its economic advantage (Cochrane, 1993). Most farmers will decide
    to adopt site-specific management practices and to begin to purchase and learn
    to use the technology only when they are convinced that the time and money spent
    are justified by improved yield or reduced costs or risk. Miller et al. (1999)
    list three criteria that must be satisfied in order for SSM to be justified. These
    are, (1) that, significant within-field spatial variability exists in factors
    that influence crop yield, (2) that, causes of this variability can be identified
    and measured, and (3) that, the information from these measurements can be used
    to modify crop-management practices to increase profit or decrease environmental
    impact. Precise and detailed information on the spatial variability of soil properties
    has been available on a wide scale since the inception of the USDA Soil Mapping
    Program in 1895 (Buol et al., 1993). Statistical analyzes of the spatial properties
    of insect and weed population distributions have been carried out for over 50
    years (Anscombe, 1949). Agricultural researchers have been concerned with spatial
    heterogeneity of crop yield for a long time (Harris, 1915), and, indeed, Smith
    (1938) provides a gray scale contour grain yield map of a small field plot very
    much along the lines of modern yield maps. This early research, however, was primarily
    concerned with the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the validity of statistical
    analysis of field experiments. Until recently, the potential did not exist in
    mechanized agriculture to effectively manage crop spatial variability. The objective
    of this paper is to review the state of SSM at the turn of the millennium and
    to offer some speculation as to its future course. The review is organized around
    the essential components of SSM listed above, measuring spatial variability, analyzing
    the data obtained from these measurements, using information gained from this
    analyzis to effect changes in management practices, and determining whether the
    resulting benefits are worth the costs. The discussion section considers some
    potential effects of large-scale adoption of SSM, should this adoption occur.
    2. Measuring field spatial variability Senay et al. (1998) distinguish three ways
    to measure field spatial variability, i.e. continuously (e.g. on-the-go yield
    monitoring), discretely (e.g. point sampling of soil or plant properties), and
    remotely (e.g. through aerial photographs). Since yield monitoring plays a unique
    role in SSM, in this review, we will separate it from other forms of continuous
    measurement. In addition, we include, in the category of discrete measurements,
    those forms of remote sensing done in close proximity to the crop. The category
    of ‘remote sensing’ will be reserved for those forms of remote sensing done from
    a sufficiently high altitude that a single measurement encompasses most or all
    of the field. 2.1. Yield monitoring Although other objectives such as quality
    might in some instances be considered as the primary focus of site-specific management,
    in the vast majority of cases studied so far, the quantity of interest has been
    yield. SSM is, therefore, focused on the influence of spatial variability in field
    properties on crop yield, and so yield monitoring is at the heart of the method.
    Most yield monitors measure the volume or mass-flow rate of harvested material
    and then integrate this flow rate to generate a time-periodic (e.g. once per second)
    record of the amount of harvested material during that interval. If volume-flow
    rate is measured, then a density calibration is used to convert this volume to
    mass. By measuring the speed of the harvester also, during the time interval,
    one can compute the distance traveled in the direction of the harvester. Multiplying
    this distance by the swath width of the harvester gives the area harvested, and,
    dividing this area into the harvested mass, gives the yield in traditional units
    of mass per unit area (e.g. kg ha−1; Reitz and Kutzback, 1996). Typically, these
    calculations are carried out in an onboard computer that forms a part of the yield
    monitor. The periodically generated yield data values may then be tagged with
    a location value provided by an onboard global positioning system and stored for
    future analysis. The most common form of output of yield monitor data is the familiar
    color-coded thematic yield map (Pierce et al., 1997). By far, the most well developed
    yield monitoring technology is that for combine harvested crops, especially, small
    grains. Borgelt (1993) provides a review of various types of grain-flow-rate monitor.
    Most modern systems measure mass-flow rate by measuring the force of grain impacting
    a plate located at the top of the clean grain elevator. Birrell et al. (1996)
    compared different methods and found that the impact-plate method most closely
    approximated a continuous sampling system. Whichever system is used, synthesis
    of the yield map must take into account errors inherent in the measurement process.
    Blackmore and Marshall (1996) identify six principal sources of error in yield
    mapping, such as incorrect swath width, time lag of grain passing through the
    system, GPS error, grain surges, grain losses from the combine, and sensor inaccuracy.
    Birrell et al., 1996, Blackmore and Marshall, 1996 and Pierce et al. (1997) provide
    discussion and comparison of algorithms for correcting these various errors. Although
    yield monitoring of combine-harvested grain crops has advanced the furthest, the
    development and commercialization of yield-monitoring hardware for other crops
    has just begun. A special issue of Computers and Electronics in Agriculture was
    recently devoted to yield monitors for non-grain crops (Godwin, 1999). Papers
    about yield monitors have been published for a variety of crops, including cotton
    (Gvili, 1999), forage (Wild and Auernhammer, 1999), peanuts (Boydell et al., 1996,
    Durrence et al., 1999), potatoes (Rawlins et al., 1995), straw (Missotten et al.,
    1996), sugarbeets (Walter et al., 1996), and tomatoes (Pelletier and Upadhyaya,
    1999). Much of the research and development, however, has taken place in private
    industry and has not resulted in publications in the scientific literature. 2.2.
    Discrete point sampling Point sampling is the most traditional means of gathering
    data about soil conditions and the state of the crop. One example is soil sampling,
    in which a set of soil cores is extracted and analyzed for chemical properties,
    such as pH and mineral nutrient concentration, as well as physical properties,
    such as sand, silt and clay composition. Other forms of point sampling involve
    extracting plant tissue samples for laboratory analysis and, for some crops, measuring
    structural aspects of the plant. In recent years, a number of instruments have
    been introduced that provide information about the plant or soil through direct
    contact or proximate remote sensing. Many of these instruments are described by
    Sudduth et al. (1997). Three instruments that have already achieved fairly widespread
    adoption, are the infrared spectrometer, used for determining plant water status
    (Idso et al., 1982), the soil inductance meter, which will be discussed in the
    section on continuous sampling, and the leaf chlorophyll meter, used for assessing
    plant nitrogen status (Schepers et al., 1992). Miller et al., 1999 report on the
    application of the chlorophyll meter to a SSM project. The objective of direct
    or proximate sensors is to obtain information about soil or plant properties without
    the need for expensive and time-consuming sample extraction and laboratory analysis.
    Point sampling has traditionally focused on determining average properties across
    the field (Wollenhaupt et al., 1997). When this is the objective, sample values
    are generally averaged or, in the case of soil samples, physically composited.
    When used to construct maps of field properties (e.g. nutrient level), the samples
    may be averaged or composited at sampling grid points, but sample values are associated
    with position points in the field. When the intent in taking a set of point samples
    is to use them as an indicator of the whole field property, the decision as to
    which parts of the field to sample, is often made haphazardly and left to the
    judgement of the sampler. The situation is very different when the objective is
    to construct a map indicating the values of soil or plant parameters at all locations
    in the field. In this case, a mathematical scheme must be used to interpolate
    values between sample points. Therefore, each sample point must be recorded individually
    and the precise location of these points is an important factor in the interpolation.
    Statistical efficiency (a reduction in sample variance for a given number of samples)
    may depend strongly on the design of the sampling method. Students in first courses
    on statistics are taught the importance of random sampling, in which every individual
    in a population has an equal chance of being selected as a member of the sample.
    Random sampling is carried out primarily to avoid bias (Steel and Torrie, 1980).
    In the case of soil sampling, the ‘individuals’ are small areas within the field
    (the size of the soil core, for example). The assumption underlying random sampling
    is that the values associated with individuals in the population are statistically
    independent. In the case of soil sampling, this independence assumption is generally
    not valid. A value at any location (i.e. an ‘individual’) is likely to be more
    highly correlated with nearby locations than with those further away. If individual
    sites in the field are spatially correlated, then it is possible to show mathematically
    that, in the absence of any prior knowledge, the most efficient (in the sense
    of minimizing the sample variance) sampling pattern is a regular grid (McBratney
    et al., 1981, Webster and Oliver, 1990). Intuitively, the reason is that each
    sample point carries some information about the distribution of nearby values
    in the field. Suppose one moves off the grid and samples one point closer to another
    point. In this case, the second point will provide more of the same information
    as is provided by the first point. Therefore, the maximum opportunity for points
    to provide information is if they are each as far apart as they can be, and this
    is accomplished with a regular grid. Indeed, the most efficient pattern in an
    equilateral triangular grid (McBratney et al., 1981). The efficiency and simplicity
    of the grid pattern has motivated its use in a number of SSM studies (Plant et
    al., 1999). The simple grid pattern has a number of drawbacks, however. One is
    that it runs the risk of interacting with periodic phenomena (such as might be
    caused, for example by regularly spaced drain tiles) in the field. This can be
    alleviated by a stratified sampling scheme in which each point is located randomly
    within the confines of a grid cell. A more serious drawback exists in the case
    in which some prior knowledge exists of the spatial structure of sample values
    within the field. In this case, a directed sampling scheme is more appropriate
    (Pocknee et al., 1996, Wollenhaupt et al., 1997). Such a scheme can be developed
    using principles of stratified sampling (Cochran, 1977) to ensure an adequate
    number of sample points in all regions of interest. Lesch et al. (1995) provide
    a very interesting discussion of efficient sampling plans based on multiple regression.
    A major drawback of point sampling, particularly the case of soil-core extraction
    and analysis, is its cost. Point sampling is time consuming and labor intensive.
    Moreover, values must be interpolated between sample points to obtain a complete
    characterization of the field, leading to potentially serious inaccuracies due
    to interpolation error. A major focus of SSM research has therefore been on the
    development of technologies for the less expensive acquisition of spatially referenced
    data on soil and plant properties. Two of the most active research areas have
    been in remote sensing and in on-the-go direct contact sensing. 2.3. High altitude
    remote sensing Remotely sensed data, obtained either by satellite or aircraft,
    characterizing reflectance and emitance of the crop canopy, can provide, at a
    relatively low cost, a detailed, spatially referenced measure of soil conditions
    or plant growth and development. Such data may form a useful component of site-specific-crop
    management programs (Moran et al., 1997, Senay et al., 1998, Plant et al., 1999;
    in press). Crop canopy reflectance in the red and near infrared regions of the
    electromagnetic spectrum provides a means of estimating the photosynthetic status
    of the crop (Sellers, 1989). Maas (1998) showed that cotton crop canopy cover
    could be directly estimated from remotely-sensed reflectance data. Reflectance
    data in the visible and near infrared regions may be collected using either digitally-based
    sensors or on photographic film. Each of these media has advantages and disadvantages.
    Digital sensors provide a more direct measure of true reflectance properties since
    they avoid the intervening steps of processing the film and scanning the image,
    using a digital scanner. As digital cameras become less expensive and widely available,
    it is likely that this medium will become much more widely used in agricultural
    remote sensing. At present, however, film-based aerial photography has the advantage
    of being relatively inexpensive and easily available. Remotely-sensed electromagnetic-reflectance
    data are generally expressed in the form of vegetation indices, which are algebraic
    combinations of the measured canopy reflectance of different wavelength bands.
    Several such indices have been developed, most of which involve the green (roughly,
    500–600 nm), red (roughly, 600–700 nm) and near infrared (roughly, 700–900 nm)
    bands. Many of these indices are algebraically related. Perry and Lautenschlager
    (1984) defined two vegetation indices as equivalent if they essentially provide
    the same information about vegetation status. Using this definition, they found
    that most commonly used vegetation indices are members of one of the two equivalence
    classes. Members of the first, called ratio-based indices, are equivalent to the
    ratio R/IR, where R is the red band intensity and IR is the infrared band intensity.
    The normalized difference-vegetation index, or NDVI (Tucker, 1979), which is the
    most commonly used vegetation index, is a member of this class. The second class
    of vegetation indices, called distance-based indices, is typified by the perpendicular
    vegetation index, or PVI (Richardson and Wiegand, 1977). This index is based on
    the fact that when red and infrared reflectances from bare soil are plotted in
    a plane whose axes are the R and IR values, the points tend to form a line lying
    near the R=IR line. The locus of these points is called the ‘soil line’. The PVI
    is computed as the perpendicular distance from a point to the soil line. It is
    not hard to show algebraically that if the soil line actually is the line R=IR,
    then the PVI has the value ∣IR−R∣/√2. A number of comparative studies of vegetation
    indices as indicators of crop health and yield have been conducted (Tucker, 1979,
    Wiegand and Richardson, 1987, Wiegand et al., 1991). Empirical evidence exists
    that the NDVI is useful in estimating biomass and yield of some agricultural crops.
    Several authors have found a significant correlation between wheat-grain yield
    and NDVI. Yuzhu, 1990, Benedetti and Rossini, 1993 used NDVI calculated from satellite
    images to predict wheat-grain yield. Ball and Frazier (1993) found significant
    differences in yield from wheat-variety trials when they used remote sensing data
    as the covariant in their analysis. Denison et al. (1996) found a significant
    correlation between seasonally integrated NDVI and corn yield. Wiegand et al.
    (1991) found a direct relationship between the summation over the season of PVI
    values and yield in cotton and corn. Plant and Munk, 1999, Plant et al., 2000
    (in press) found a direct relationship between summed NDVI and yield in cotton,
    and also found a relation between NDVI and certain indices of crop development.
    On the other hand, some studies have not found a relationship between NDVI and
    yield (Pettygrove et al., 1999, Plant et al., 1999). The relationship between
    NDVI and yield in crops for which vegetative material is not the economic component
    is a complex one depending on a number of factors, such as harvest index, quality,
    and so forth. Emitted radiation in the thermal infrared band also provides information
    about crop status, particularly water stress. Idso et al. (1982) developed the
    concept of the crop-water-stress index, based on infrared thermometry. Although
    the accuracy of this index has been questioned on theoretical grounds (Campbell
    and Norman, 1990), it has proven useful in practice, particularly, in arid and
    semi-arid regions (Gardener et al., 1992). Nemani and Running, 1989, Moran et
    al., 1994 used a combination of reflected and emitted radiation to infer resistance
    to evapotranspiration and, thus, to infer water stress. Bausch and Neale (1987)
    developed the concept of using reflectance data to adjust crop coefficients, and
    applied this concept to improved-irrigation scheduling (Bausch and Neale, 1989).
    The use of reflected and emitted radiation in irrigation scheduling is of course
    not mutually exclusive and may turn out to be complementary. 2.4. Continuous proximate
    sensing One of the most attractive features of remotely sensed data is their high
    spatial resolution. Although they can be used to infer soil properties (Baumgardner
    et al., 1985), remotely-sensed data primarily indicate plant vegetative status.
    Since the plant''s vegetative status integrates its response to all of the factors
    in its environment, these data must generally be supplemented with others to be
    able to infer the source of plant stress. Soil-core extraction has traditionally
    been a useful tool in collecting data about soil conditions. However, the need
    in SSM is for high spatial resolution data, which would be prohibitively expensive
    to acquire with soil cores. This has focused attention on other less expensive
    methods of sensing soil and plant conditions. Many of these involve bringing the
    sensor into direct or close proximate contact with the soil or plant, either by
    carrying a portable unit into the field and touching the soil at specified locations
    or by attaching the sensors to an implement and dragging them through the field
    to obtain a continuous measurement. The most common form of continuous sensing
    is probably electrical-conductivity measurement. Soil electrical conductivity
    has been observed in a number of cases to correlate highly with yield (Lund et
    al., 1999). In saline soils, the level of soil salinity has the strongest influence
    on soil electrical conductivity (Rhoades and Corwin, 1990). In soils of low salinity,
    electrical conductivity correlates most strongly with clay content and moisture
    content. Because of the strong influence of clay content on other soil properties,
    particularly water infiltration rate, measuring electrical conductivity is often
    an excellent way to determine zones for stratified sampling of soil cores. Electrical
    conductivity can be measured either directly or indirectly by measuring soil inductance.
    Generally, direct measurements of soil conductance are made by towing an electrode-equipped
    implement through the field and indirect inductance measurements are made by taking
    point samples using a hand-held device. Where both methods have been tested, a
    high correlation between these two forms of measurement has generally been observed
    (Fritz et al., 1999, Sudduth et al., 1999). Other direct contact-sensing methods
    are at various stages of development from preliminary research to commercialization
    (Sudduth et al., 1997). For example, a number of research projects have focused
    on the measurement of tillage implement draft (Lui et al., 1996, van Bergeijk
    and Goense, 1996). Viscarra Rossel and McBratney (1997) describe a mechanism for
    on-the-go soil pH measurement. These devices are at various stages of development
    and it is likely that some of them will reach the commercial market in the next
    few years. 3. Analysis of site-specific data Analysis of data collected as part
    of a site-specific crop management program must support the management objectives
    of that program. These are generally to identify, characterize and manage the
    key limitations to profitability and environmental protection at each location
    in the field (Mulla and Schepers, 1997). Usually, the most important limitations
    at any location are those limiting yield. Thus, the primary objective in analysis
    of spatial variability is generally to determine the factors underlying yield-spatial
    variability. McBratney and Pringle (1997) point out that the relationship between
    spatial variability in crop yield and spatial variability in soil properties is
    often a complex one. Methods for distilling the information contained in yield-response
    data into manageable form generally start with the assumption that in most areas
    yields are limited by some primary factor or factors (Webb, 1972, Loomis and Connor,
    1992). The well known extreme form of this model is von Leibig''s ‘Law of the
    Minimum’ (Loomis and Connor, 1992). Crop yield is influenced by vegetative and,
    in most crops, reproductive growth. In any given year, yield in different parts
    of the same field can potentially be limited by any of the myriad of factors that
    may impact these processes. Depending on the geographic location of the field,
    some of the most important of these factors include mineral-nutrient deficiency,
    moisture deficiency or excess, competition from or consumption by pests, plant
    pathogens, soil acidity or alkalinity, presence of toxins or excess salinity or
    sodicity, soil texture and infiltration rate, field management history, and so
    forth. Spatial variability in these factors can be influenced by differences within
    the field in topography, soil structure, groundwater properties, microclimate,
    and by pure chance. In any given field, the importance of yield-limiting factors
    may vary within and between growing seasons. It is no wonder that the most daunting
    task of SSM is to identify and sort out limitations to yield. The identification
    process generally begins with a statistical analysis of the data whose measurement
    is described in the previous section. Analysis of data having a spatial component
    is generally called geostatistics. A number of excellent monographs and texts
    exist on this subject; prominent among these are Cressie, 1991, Isaaks and Srivastava,
    1989, Journel and Huijbregts, 1978. An important feature of the data associated
    with SSM is the wide variety of processes that they characterize. The first step
    in analysis of site-specific data sets is, therefore, to place them into a form
    in which they can be integrated and compared. Cressie (1991) identifies three
    types of spatial data for purposes of analysis. These are point data, continuous
    data and lattice data. Of these, lattice data generally arise from analysis of
    processes identified by political or cadastral boundaries (e.g. number of farms
    in a county). With the exception of soil-survey information, these types of data
    are not common in management of a single field. Therefore, data integration in
    SSM generally involves integration of point data and continuous data. Technically,
    however, ‘continuous’ data, such as remotely sensed images and yield maps, are
    really lattice data with very small lattice elements (the size of one pixel).
    Since ‘continuous’ data are not really continuous, to integrate continuous data
    from two sources (e.g. a remotely sensed image with a yield map), the grids representing
    these data must be brought into alignment. This is generally accomplished by resampling
    the data (Burrough, 1986) to both put all continuous data into the same grid (generally,
    the coarsest among the data sets) and to simultaneously georegister the data,
    i.e. to bring them into alignment with the true spatial configuration of the earth.
    These operations can be accomplished in virtually any raster-based geographic
    information system (Burrough, 1986). Integrating-point data with continuous data
    is generally accomplished by interpolating the point data. This can be done in
    a variety of ways. Two of the most common in SSM are the inverse-squared distance
    method and kriging. In both of these methods, the value z(x,y) of a variable z
    at any point in the (x,y) plane is expressed as a weighted mean of the values
    z(xi,yi) at a fixed number of points (xi,yi) at which it has been measured. The
    type of method is defined by how the weights are computed (Cressie, 1991, Isaaks
    and Srivastava, 1989). The inverse-squared distance method is the simplest, i.e.
    the weights are proportional to the square of the distance of the point (xi,yi)
    from the point (x,y). Kriging is more complicated. The weights are computed using
    a quantity called, the variogram. This is a statistic that provides information
    on the spatial autocorrelation of the variable z, i.e. how the correlation between
    two values of z depends on their relative position. The advantage of kriging is
    that, under certain assumptions about z, the interpolated estimate of z(x,y) is
    the ‘best’ estimate in the sense that it minimizes the variance over all estimates
    that are weighted means of nearby points. Another advantage of kriging is that
    the variogram, computed as a part of the kriging process, provides useful information
    about how the measured values of the variable z may be expected to relate to each
    other. In particular, it tells how far apart two points must be before the values
    measured at those points are uncorrelated (this is called the range in geostatistical
    terminology). The range can be useful in deciding the spacing of a sampling grid.
    McBratney and Pringle (1997) give a summary of variogram data for a variety of
    soil properties including pH, clay content, and mineral nutrient levels. As might
    be expected, the variograms themselves display considerable variability. Typical
    range values are on the order of tens to hundreds of meters, indicating that,
    ignoring effects of topography, a field larger than about 10 ha might, on average,
    have a reasonable probability of significant variation in at least one soil constituent
    important to crop production. Although many people equate geostatistics with interpolation
    methods, such as kriging, there are a variety of other geostatistical methods
    that can be used in analysis of spatial data (Rossi et al., 1992). One approach
    to spatial data in crop production is state-space analysis, in which points along
    a transect across the field are analyzed using methods originally developed to
    estimate the behavior of a quantity varying in time (Gelb, 1974). Wendroth et
    al. (1997) provide a discussion of the application of state-space methodology
    to site-specific data. Another method that shows promise is Monte Carlo simulation.
    In this approach, the interpolation is carried out by generating a large number
    of random-spatial arrangements having the same statistical properties, as those
    measured for the sample of points. One can then compute the average of these random
    arrangements at any point as the interpolated estimate. The advantage of Monte
    Carlo simulation over kriging is that, kriging tends to produce an estimate for
    the interpolated function z(x,y) smoother than the actual function. Monte Carlo
    simulation does not appear to have been much used in site-specific management;
    its application to ecological data is reviewed by Rossi et al. (1993). Once the
    interpolation of point data has been carried out and the integration of field
    data is completed, the next step in the analysis is to determine how yield is
    related to field variables. One common approach to this problem is through correlation
    analysis and multiple linear regression (Neter et al., 1996). These methods are
    well understood and provide good results in appropriate conditions. A drawback
    is that they assume a particular functional form and distributional properties
    of the relationship between yield and the factors underlying yield. A promising
    nonparametric alternative is classification and regression trees (CART; Breiman
    et al., 1984). CART is a computer-intensive method using binary recursive partitioning
    algorithms to essentially create a dichotomous key describing the relationship
    between yield and the factors that influence it. Using CART for regression has
    several advantages over using classical regression methods, that (1) there is
    no need to specify a particular functional form and verify that it fits the data,
    (2) it does automatic variable selection, (3) it minimizes the effect of outliers
    by isolating them in small nodes, and (4) by isolating the effect of variables
    to parts of the tree, it can uncover context dependency and interactions among
    variables. Applications of CART to site-specific management have begun to appear.
    Adams et al. (1999) compared CART to other machine-learning algorithms for SSM.
    Anderson et al. (1999) use CART to determine the effect of soil variability on
    sugarcane yields. Plant et al. (1999) used CART to help identify factors underlying
    spatial variability in wheat yields. 4. Managing spatial variability Once the
    causes of variability in yield have been inferred, the next step is to determine
    the most appropriate management response. In some cases, this may not involve
    varying the input rate across the field but, rather adjusting the input rate,
    to improve the economic efficiency of the entire field. For example, Pettygrove
    et al. (1999) found a parabolic response in tomato yield to soil clay content
    in a furrow-irrigated field. Yields were low in those parts of the field that
    had the highest clay content, presumably due to aeration stress, and also in those
    parts of the field that had the lowest clay content, presumably due to drought
    stress in soils with low water-holding capacity. Practicalities of irrigation
    scheduling or of row direction relative to soil properties in a furrow-irrigated
    field may preclude the application of water at different schedules depending on
    the soil texture. In this case, one may have to be content with scheduling irrigation
    applications in a way that attempts to optimize economic return over the whole
    field. If a single yield-influencing factor has been identified and if this is
    a factor, such as amount of a specific mineral nutrient that can be adjusted continuously,
    then some form of variable rate-application technology (VRT) can be employed.
    This permits the farmer to adjust the application rate to match the conditions
    in each part of the field. There is a relatively large literature on VRT. Ferguson
    et al. (1999) summarize many of the reported results in this area. They subdivide
    site-specific fertilizer application research into two categories. The first is
    ‘true’ VRT, which is done by attempting to match fertilizer application rate to
    yield, as indicated by yield-map output, and soil conditions using available fertilizer-application-rate
    guidelines. Yield may then be compared with a uniform application-rate control.
    The second approach, which they call the rate-strip approach, is similar to the
    traditional design of replicated field plots. Transects are laid out across the
    field and fertilizer is applied at specified, differing rates along these transects.
    Yield response is then measured under the varying soil conditions along the transect.
    Ferguson et al. (1999) discuss 12 years of VRT nitrogen research in Nebraska.
    The results of this research in testing the hypothesis of no significant yield
    difference between uniform and VRT application are inconclusive. We will return
    to this topic in Section 5 on economics of SSM. Other studies have described the
    results of variable-rate application of compounds other than mineral nutrients.
    For example, Evans et al. (1997) show that a uniform application of lime to acid
    soil in a field in Northumberland, England is less effective than if the rate
    is targeted to the soil pH. Pesticides can also be applied on a site-specific,
    or variable-rate, basis. Fleischer et al. (1997) provide a review of studies of
    the spatial distribution of insects in agricultural crops. In principle, precision
    application of insecticide provides a means of reducing cost and environmental
    damage of these chemicals. However, the mobile nature of insect pests and the
    uncertainty associated with establishing the precise spatial distribution of pathogens
    as well as insects has directed most of the focus of site-specific pest management
    to weeds. Johnson et al. (1997) review the literature on site-specific weed management.
    In the event that more than one factor influences yield (i.e. different factors
    influence yield differently in different parts of the field), the situation is
    much more complex. A practical strategy to reduce this complexity is to focus
    on sorting out the factor or factors most important to limiting yield in any given
    area. Provided, these factors are more or less continuous, the result of the analysis
    is a set of areas that subdivides the field into regions defined by their yield-limiting
    factors. These regions are commonly called management zones (McCann et al., 1996).
    Plant et al. (1999) define management zones as meeting the following specific
    criteria. (1) Yield differences between zones must be substantially greater than
    those within zones, and (2) the principal set of factors that influence yield
    within a zone must be the same. Management zones may not define actual management
    practices. For example, in the application of variable rates of continuously varying
    inputs, such as fertilizer the subdivision of the field into management zones
    is not necessary, and, on the other hand, in some fields, the same management
    practice may be followed across different zones. In general, management zones
    in a field in 1 year may be quite different from those in the same field in a
    different year, even if the crop is the same. The advantage of the creation of
    management zones is that they provide a convenient means of summarizing the spatial
    distribution of yield-influencing factors in that season. Accumulation of maps
    of management zones over a number of seasons in the same field can provide an
    excellent means of gaining a precise understanding of the field''s spatial response
    to crop and environment. Moreover, subdivision of a field into management zones
    can be used to increase sampling efficiency through stratification of sampling
    grids. Stafford et al. (1999) discuss the use of yield maps to develop management
    zones. McCann et al. (1996) made effective use of the analysis of black and white
    aerial photographs of fields to create management zones. Plant et al. (1999) found
    that the CART methodology provides an objective means of generating management
    zones. The zones they derived from CART were sufficiently close to a practical
    arrangement that they did not attempt any subjective modification. In the interpretation
    of management zone information for purposes of making management decisions, it
    is important to remember that, whether the zones were developed by multiple regression,
    CART, or some other method, correlation does not always imply causality. For example,
    a negative correlation of yield with weed density may be due to a reduced stand
    that incidentally permits higher weed populations (Plant et al., 1999). Similarly,
    although a positive correlation between yield and soil moisture deficit existed
    in two fields studied by Lord et al. (1997), the relationships between yield and
    water status in these two fields were very different because of the complex interactions
    with other yield influencing factors. Such interactions are likely to be common
    in most crop production systems. 5. Economics of site-specific crop management
    Site-specific management is the application of information technology to crop
    production. Information, like any other production factor, has both a value and
    a cost. Thus, one of the most important features of SSM is the increased value
    it places on information and knowledge. Lowenberg-DeBoer and Swinton (1997) provide
    a thorough discussion of the economics of SSM and a review of the literature.
    They show how to formulate a partial budget analysis of SSM and provide a critical
    review of several early analyzes of variable-rate technology. Variable-rate-fertilizer
    application was the first SSM practice to reach a level of technological maturity
    such that it could be carried through the complete production cycle of gathering
    the data, developing a management plan based on information generated by the data,
    and implementing this plan through site-specific fertilizer application. Moreover,
    with VRT, the increased costs associated with SSM and the changes in revenue due
    to increased exploitation of areas with higher yield potential and reduced inputs
    in areas of lower yield potential could be precisely accounted for and compared
    with whole-field management. In a review of about a dozen such studies, Lowenberg-DeBoer
    and Swinton (1997) found that the results were inconclusive, with some showing
    increased profitability, some showing reduced profitability, and some showing
    no difference. Lowenberg-DeBoer and Swinton (1997) point out that several of the
    studies showing increased profitability had accounting errors that would reduce
    this profitability. Although studies of variable-rate-fertilizer application are
    useful in focusing attention on the need for economic evaluation of site-specific
    management concepts, they do have two important drawbacks in interpreting their
    results in terms of overall profitability of SSM. The first is that the primary
    cost in this technology is the cost of acquiring data and converting it to information.
    Once this information is acquired, however, it may have value for a number of
    purposes. The yield map, for example is the central component of SSM, and, since
    yield integrates all aspects of the crop-production cycle, it is difficult to
    partition the value of information contained in a yield map into different specific
    components (e.g. fertilization, pest management, irrigation, etc.). A second important
    problem with using fertilizer application as an economic indicator for SSM is
    that the economics of variable-rate-fertilizer application depends on a number
    of factors. Cassman and Plant (1992) conducted a theoretical comparison of site-specific
    vs. whole field-fertilizer application and found that the economic benefits depend
    in a complex way on the cost of fertilizer relative to crop price, the distribution
    of high and low native soil nutrient levels, and the fertilizer response of the
    crop. Quantifying the value of information is of critical importance in economic
    analyzes of SSM. Information is of value only to the extent that it causes modification
    of plans that were made prior to obtaining the information. A Bayesian theory
    exists in the decision support literature (Raiffa and Schlaifer, 1961) for assigning
    value to information, but this theory does not appear to have been formally applied
    to site-specific crop management. However, Bullock et al. (1998) use an alternative
    approach to provide a detailed theoretical discussion of the value of information.
    The discussion is concerned explicitly with site-specific variation of seeding
    rate, but it applies equally well to any other crop-production practice. Although
    phrased in terms of relatively complex mathematics, the gist of the argument is
    quite simple. It is generally accepted that seeding at too high or too low a rate
    is sub-optimal, therefore, there must be some economically optimal value, or range
    of values, of seeding rate. It is also generally accepted that the specific optimal
    value depends on soil conditions (e.g. texture). However, we almost never know
    the optimal seeding rate with any precision. For example, for a given set of soil
    conditions, the value may only be known within a range of, say, ±20 000 plants
    ha−1. In a typical field, soil conditions may be quite variable, so in one part
    of the field the true optimal rate may be 40 000 plants ha−1 while in another
    it may be 80 000 plants ha−1. With a range of uncertainty in the optimum of ±20 000
    plants ha−1, if we seed at a constant rate of 60 000 plants ha−1, then the seeding
    rate will be reasonably close, given our lack of precise knowledge, in all parts
    of the field. If, however, we can control the seeding rate so that it is very
    close (e.g. within 1000 plants ha−1) to the optimum, then this capability can
    only pay for itself if we know the optimal value at each location within that
    level of precision. Otherwise, the capability is much reduced in value. More generally,
    in order for the value of site-specific information to exceed the cost of acquiring
    it, knowledge must exist of how to use that information to appropriately adjust
    management practices. In many cases, this knowledge is still not available at
    a sufficient level of precision. 6. Discussion and conclusions At the transition
    from the twentieth to the twenty-first centuries, SSM is in the early adoption
    stage of technological innovation. Many early adopters try a new technology, particularly
    one associated with gadgets, out of curiosity or interest in novelty. According
    to the ‘technological treadmill’ theory of agricultural innovation of Cochrane
    (1993), however, a new technology will only be generally adopted if it improves
    average profitability or reduces average risk. Current cost–benefit analyzes of
    SSM are inconclusive. It is likely that cost reductions normally associated with
    new information technologies will substantially reduce the cost of site-specific
    information in the future, and that as knowledge of how to effectively use this
    information increases so will its value. Therefore, it is fairly safe to predict
    that some form of site-specific crop management, using some or all of the technologies
    described in this paper or their descendents, will be incorporated into the management
    practice of at least some crops. With this in mind, it is worth beginning a discussion
    (or speculation) of the effects of incorporating this technology. In a discussion
    of the social implications of SSM, Nowak (1997) distinguishes between ‘soft’ and
    ‘hard’ SSM technologies. ‘Soft’ technologies rely more on traditional means (e.g.
    visual observation of crop and soil differences) of acquiring site-specific information
    and on farmer experience and intuition rather than statistical or scientific analysis
    of data to carry out management practices in response to the data. ‘Hard’ technologies
    for data acquisition include those described in this paper, such as yield monitors,
    remote sensing, and electrical conductivity measurement. ‘Hard’ technologies for
    management include the use of statistical analysis, GIS, and VRT. If it is indeed
    the case, that the cost of the information associated with SSM is destined to
    decline, then one may expect that farmers will rely on ‘hard’ technology to acquire
    information. It is already true that the cost of ‘hard’ information-acquisition
    technologies is relatively low compared with other components of crop production.
    On the other hand, one might speculate that farmers will continue for some time
    to rely primarily on ‘soft’ technology (i.e. intuition and experience) to interpret
    the data. The present state of scientific knowledge about the effective management
    of fields on a site-specific basis is relatively primitive and unlikely to be
    sufficiently reliable for practical use in the immediate future. Some preliminary
    experience is available that permits speculation as to how SSM practices might
    be adopted, and by whom. Further reductions in the costs associated with grain
    yield mapping leads to the speculation that yield mapping equipment will eventually
    be standard equipment on combines in the way that a fuel gauge is standard equipment
    on a car. Applying the ‘soft’ technology hypothesis, one may then speculate that
    farmers will use the yield maps primarily in an intuitive way, linking yield map
    information with other knowledge and trying informal experiments to bring up the
    yield in low-yielding areas. In irrigated production systems, the decreasing supply
    and increasing cost of water makes it likely that site-specific water management
    will act symbiotically with improvements in irrigation technology, particularly
    in the development of alternatives to furrow irrigation of row crops. One critical
    question is how SSM will affect the economic and social structure of rural communities.
    There is little scientific evidence to draw from, but one may speculate based
    on previous technological introductions in agriculture and industry. One common
    effect of the introduction of information technology into an industry is to reduce
    the number of relatively low-skilled jobs available and to increase the demand
    for trained, skilled workers. It is not hard to imagine SSM having this effect.
    Many of the sources of site-specific data, for example electrical conductivity
    measurement, remote sensing, and chemical analysis of soils, are outside the range
    of expertise of most farmers and will create a demand for individuals skilled
    in these technologies. Similarly, the more precise control exercised over input
    levels may require more highly skilled equipment operators. A second critical
    issue is whether SSM is size neutral. An argument can be made that this technology
    disproportionately benefits large farms. Certainly, the cost of the technology
    is more easily borne by large, well-capitalized farms. Moreover, the technology
    itself may provide more benefit to large farms. A common argument expressed, for
    example in the popular press by Kramer (1987), is that very large farms are economically
    and agronomically inefficient because management of a large land unit fails to
    take into account the inherent variability within that unit. It is practically
    self-evident that SSM would work to alleviate this impediment to large-extent
    management units. Thus, an effect of SSM may well be to promote the further consolidation
    of farms into large entities employing primarily highly skilled workers. This
    would be considered a negative social outcome by many, and it will be important
    as the technology matures to look for signs of this effect and to mitigate its
    consequences if necessary. A third important issue is the impact of SSM, and information
    technology in general, on agriculture outside North America and, particularly,
    in lesser-developed countries. Most farm units in these countries are not sufficiently
    large or wealthy that they could directly benefit from this technology as it is
    applied in North America. Scientists are already exploring the adaptation and
    application of these technologies in the Third World, however (Dobermann and Bell,
    1997), and it is very likely that some of them will be adapted in some form. One
    possibility is that individual farms will be treated as if they were management
    zones within a field, and that some centralized entity will provide information
    to the individual farmers on a cooperative basis. Finally, the availability of
    information sometimes has unintended side effects. It is possible, for example,
    that regulatory agencies may in the future require site-specific management plans
    to reduce agricultural inputs. Whether a field has been surveyed for site-specific
    data may some day influence the price of land in the way that laser leveling does
    now in some areas, and SSM may have (indeed, almost certainly will have) other
    impacts totally unanticipated by those of us conducting research in the area.
    One potential such impact is on the nature of agricultural research and the relationship
    between farmers and scientists. Traditionally, scientists have conducted replicated
    small plot experiments to test new crop management practices. After a thorough
    series of tests using statistical methods, such as the analysis of variance, these
    new practices are introduced into commercial use through replicated experiments
    at the whole field scale and through demonstration projects. Thus, in general,
    the flow of information is often from the scientist to the farmer. However, the
    capacity to precisely measure yield and the factors influencing yield provides
    the farmer with the ability to conduct independent tests of new practices, possibly
    using research methods more familiar to epidemiologists and ecologists than to
    agronomists and entomologists. The technology also provides this same capability
    to the agricultural scientists themselves. At the transition from the twenty-first
    century to the twenty-second, as a result of this new capacity for precision of
    measurement, agricultural science and the relationship between scientists and
    farmers may well have evolved into an entirely different paradigm from that which
    exists today. References Adams et al., 1999 M.L. Adams, S.E. Cook, P.A. Caccetta,

    yieldCrop management Abbreviations SSM, site-specific management 1. Introduction
    Site-specific management (SSM) is the management of agricultural crops at a spatial
    scale smaller than that of the whole field. It is perhaps unfortunate that the
    rather misleading term ‘precision agriculture’ is increasingly being used as a
    synonym for SSM. There is much more to agriculture than crop management, and,
    in any case, many would object to the notion that field-specific crop management
    is ‘imprecision agriculture’. If anything, the term precision agriculture should
    probably be applied more generally to the use of information technology in all
    of agriculture, in which case, SSM forms one component.
  verbatim_quote2: yields (Anonymous, 1998; this same article points out that the
    fraction of total arable land for which yield maps are created is still only about
    5%). Several trade publications devoted to SSM have been started, and considerable
    industrial research is carried out to develop and implement yield monitoring,
    variable-rate chemical application and other technologies in an increasing variety
    of crops.

    The most applicable data types for irrigation management include:

    - **Sensors and platforms:** This article discusses the pros/cons of sensors and
    platforms available to aid in irrigation monitoring and management. Of particular
    interest is the use of drones and ground-based platforms.

    - **Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation:** This article describes
    three main remote sensing approaches to precision irrigation: (1) Estimating crop
    water status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography including CWSI and TTTI,
    (2) soil and crop characteristics.

    **Relevance to the outline point:**

    This article provides a comprehensive overview of sensors, platforms, and remote
    sensing approaches applicable to irrigation management and serves as a valuable

    \ the literature on applications of remote sensing for monitoring soil- and\n\
    crop- water status for irrigation purposes. The review is organized into two main\
    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\
    \ sensing approaches for precision irrigation\nto estimate crop water status,\
    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\

    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\
    \ canopy structure (height and Leaf Area Index);\n(iv) crop status; (v) canopy\
    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\
    \ photo to grayscale image, and then conversion to false colors. The upper part\
    \ of the image\n(darker soil color) corresponds to the most drained part of the\
    \ ﬁeld during the winter season, which\nwas then excluded from measurements. Results\
    \ of the experiment are published by Alvino et al. [83],\nreporting the effect\
    \ of shallow water tables on peach trees grafted on three peach seedlings.\nThere\

    \ by\nknowledge appropriate to the task, and this is the main reason that the\
    \ RS image was not orthogonal.\nThe goal was to integrate ground photos of each\
    \ plant with airborne images to calculate the leaf area\nof each tree. For this\
    \ goal, several trees were fully defoliated to have an accurate measure of Leaf\
    \ Area\nIndex (LAI).\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40 \n8 of 35 \n \nacquired may be\

    \ weight. The small systems were deﬁned\nas an UAV of a maximum weight of 25 kg.\
    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

  title: Remote Sensing for Irrigation of Horticultural Crops
  verbatim_quote1: 'The identification of the crop water requirement is indispensable
    for several objectives linked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues:
    (i) maximize crop yield (the ’yield gap’); (ii) stabilize production by adopting
    a safeguard against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop quality; (iv)
    save water; (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution
    caused by N leaching losses.'
  verbatim_quote2: A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment
    under study. This means defining the potential and constraints of the field environment
    (sub optimal management, inappropriate technology, and/or lack of training of
    farmers). This is possible when water constraints on crop production are removed
    by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop yield per drop
    of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.

  analysis: "The paper contributes to addressing the point within the scope and intent\
    \ of the review, by exploring the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to improve\
    \ the assessment of the spatial variability of vine water status. \n\nThe following\
    \ three verbatim quotes from the paper demonstrate its pertinence to the outline\
    \ point and review:\n\n1. \"Here, we propose the use of miniaturized hyperspectral\
    \ and multispectral sensors mounted on an UAV [44]. Hyperspectral sensors can\
    \ provide a measure of spectral response across hundreds of narrowly defined spectral\
    \ bands simultaneously, however, they sacrifice spatial resolution and their commercial\
    \ prices remain high [45]. Hyperspectral sensors also possess inherent image distortion\
    \ causing geometric errors and limit detection of vegetation stress using red-edge\
    \ information [5]. On the other hand, multispectral cameras, specifically the\
    \ MCA-6 camera (Tetracam’s miniature camera array), can detect a VIS-NIR range\
    \ of the electromagnetic spectrum and has been proven in several studies to identify\
    \ different types of stress in plants [28,33,46–49].\"\n\n2. \"Despite the advantages\
    \ of ANN, several disadvantages and limitations are presented for these models.\
    \ For example, when compared with linear relationships, building nonlinear models\
    \ is inherently more difficult than linear ones [86]. Also, when machine learning\
    \ models are applied to complex and high-dimensionality models, some criteria\
    \ need to be accounted for. For example, the optimum dimensional reduction of\
    \ classifiers is needed to improve classification [87–89]. Furthermore, Wu, et\
    \ al. [81] and Taormina, et al. [90] suggested that inputs, modelling and data\
    \ processing can be strongly improved if ANN models are coupled with preprocessing\
    \ techniques [91]. Tu [92], made a comparison between logistic regressions and\
    \ ANNs suggesting some disadvantage, such as (i) that the ‘black-box’ nature of\
    \ ANNs has limited ability to explicitly identify possible causal relationships\
    \ and cannot easily determine which variables are the most important contributors\
    \ to a particular output; (ii) ANN development is a computationally intensive\
    \ procedure that requires greater calculation time, which makes the portability\
    \ application difficult when applying to the ﬁeld; and (iii) due to the model\
    \ interaction and nonlinearity, ANNs may cause overfitting of the training data\
    \ set and produce poor performance in external sets (which are site-speciﬁc).\
    \ However, Tu [92] suggested that this can be prevented by limiting the number\
    \ of hidden nodes, adding a penalty term to the objective function for large weights\
    \ and limiting the amount of training by cross-validation. In this case, dividing\
    \ the dataset into calibration and validation data avoids overfitting problems.\"\
    \n\n3. \"The ﬁnal prediction for the whole ﬂight (Figures 5 and 6) represents\
    \ the ability of the ANN-2 model to identify different contrasts of stem water\
    \ potential present in the ﬁeld. Also, the spatial variability of the Ψstem can\
    \ be assessed and it is consistent with the ﬁeld experimental design.\""

    \ is often evaluated using the midday\nstem water potential (Ψstem). However,\
    \ this measurement is acquired on a per plant basis and does\nnot account for\
    \ the assessment of vine water status spatial variability. The use of multispectral\n\
    cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is capable to capture the variability\
    \ of vine\nwater stress in a whole ﬁeld scenario. It has been reported that conventional\
    \ multispectral indices\n(CMI) that use information between 500–800 nm, do not\
    \ accurately predict plant water status since\nthey are not sensitive to water\
    \ content. The objective of this study was to develop artiﬁcial neural\nnetwork\
    \ (ANN) models derived from multispectral images to predict the Ψstem spatial\
    \ variability of a\ndrip-irrigated Carménère vineyard in Talca, Maule Region,\
    \ Chile. The coefﬁcient of determination (R2)\nobtained between ANN outputs and\
    \ ground-truth measurements of Ψstem were between 0.56–0.87,\nwith the best performance\
    \ observed for the model that included the bands 550, 570, 670, 700 and\n800 nm.\
    \ Validation analysis indicated that the ANN model could estimate Ψstem with a\
    \ mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of 0.1 MPa, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12\
    \ MPa, and relative error (RE) of\n−9.1%. For the validation of the CMI, the MAE,\
    \ RMSE and RE values were between 0.26–0.27 MPa,\n0.32–0.34 MPa and −24.2–25.6%,\
    \ respectively.\nKeywords:\nmultispectral image processing; artiﬁcial neural network;\

    \ and growing regions (France, Spain, Australia, South Africa, parts\nof USA,\
    \ Chile and Argentina) have experienced water scarcity during the last years [1,2].\
    \ Under this\nscenario, modern irrigation management is required to improve water\
    \ productivity (wine production\nper unit of applied water, kg·m−3) of viticultural\
    \ areas. Traditionally, irrigation management has\nbeen based on the monitoring\
    \ of vine evapotranspiration, soil water content and physiological plant\nresponses.\
    \ Although some of these methods have been widely used, they do not consider adequately\n\
    the spatial variability of soil, cultivar and climate conditions to schedule irrigation.\
    \ In this regard,\nsite-speciﬁc irrigation management (SSIM) can be used as a\
    \ tool to improve water productivity [3,4].\nIn that case, SSIM characterizes\
    \ the effect of the intra-vineyard spatial variability of soil and canopy\nvigor\
    \ on the estimation of irrigation scheduling (irrigation frequency and timing).\n\

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2488\n2 of 17\n1.1. Monitoring of Evapotranspiration, Soil Water\
    \ Content and Physiological Plant Responses\nUsually, irrigation management relies\
    \ on the estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) [1]:\nEta = Kc × ETo\n\
    (1)\nwhere ETo is the reference evapotranspiration (mm·day−1) and Kc is the crop\
    \ coefﬁcient.\nETo is calculated using the Penman–Montieth model which requires\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity,\nwind speed, and solar radiation as inputs\
    \ [1,2]. The Kc is the ratio between ETa and ETo, where ETa\ncan be measured using\
    \ a lysimeter, soil water balance approach, eddy covariance method, Bowen ratio\n\
    energy balance system, or surface renewal method [5]. Due to the speciﬁcity of\
    \ Kc for local conditions,\nit is necessary to calibrate this parameter to the\
    \ speciﬁc conditions of vineyards [6]. To solve this\nproblem, Turner [7] has\
    \ suggested monitoring the soil water content to schedule irrigation.\nSome of\
    \ the disadvantages of using soil water content monitoring in vineyards are: (1)\
    \ it does\nnot represent water consumption in vines with extensive root systems\
    \ and when vines are grown in\ndeep soil; and (2) it does not predict water content\
    \ in soil with high salinity and a high percentage of\nstone [8]. In this regard,\
    \ Granier, et al. [9] indicated that measurement of physiological parameters\n\
    provides better information about the whole plant, controlling systems to climatic\
    \ conditions and\natmospheric water demands compared with soil water content.\n\
    Among the most studied technologies for monitoring physiological plant responses\
    \ to water\nstress are sap ﬂow measurement [10,11], dendrometry [12], gas exchange\
    \ [13,14], chlorophyll\n(Chl) ﬂuorescence [15], stomatal conductance [15], canopy\
    \ temperature [16–19] and plant water\npotential [20,21]. The measurement of plant\
    \ water potential is a good predictor of vine water status\nand has been the most\
    \ commonly used technique to characterize water stress for vineyards under\nregulated\
    \ deﬁcit irrigation (RDI) conditions [22–24]. The midday stem water potential\
    \ (Ψstem) has been\nproposed as the most reliable technique to schedule the irrigation\
    \ of orchards and vineyards [25,26].\nHowever, the measurement of Ψstem must be\
    \ carried out in the ﬁeld for each plant, which incurs high\ncosts and does not\
    \ capture the spatial variability of water status [27–29]. Based on that, remote\
    \ sensing\nplatforms have been proposed to replace ground-based measurements and\
    \ to assess the spatial\nvariability of water status in larger areas [28,30].\n\
    1.2. Remote Sensing and Multispectral Indices to Assess Spatial Variability\n\
    Different types of remote sensing platforms can be used to carry different types\
    \ of sensors to\nassess different spectral wavelength ranges [31]. Unlike manned\
    \ vehicles and satellite, unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAV) have several advantages:\
    \ they are inexpensive, ﬂexible, more independent of\nclimatic variables and can\
    \ be ﬂown with minimal training [32]. All these characteristics allow us to\n\
    obtain high resolution information in an automatic and accurate manner. By using\
    \ these vehicles it\nis possible to transport sensors, which provide multispectral\
    \ information that can be integrated into\nspectral indices to predict several\
    \ physiological variables [28,33–35], speciﬁcally for the evaluation of\nintra-vineyard\
    \ spatial variability [35–38]. Some researchers have suggested that several indices\
    \ using\ninformation between 500 and 800 nm can estimate vine water status indirectly,\
    \ with coefﬁcients of\ndetermination (R2) ranging between 0.01 and 0.68 (Table\
    \ 1).\nSensors 2017, 17, 2488\n3 of 17\nTable 1. Conventional spectral indices\

    \ varied from 0.53 in Thompson Seedless [38] to 0.19 in\nCabernet Sauvignon [37].\
    \ For the NDVI, Baluja, et al. [28] indicated R2 = 0.68 in Tempranillo while\n\
    Rapaport, et al. [37] observed R2 = 0.03 in Cabernet Sauvignon.\nIn this regard,\
    \ some studies suggest that spectral indices based on information between 500\n\
    and 800 nm are not suitable in all ﬁeld conditions to estimate vine water potential\
    \ and suggest\nthat wavelengths greater than 800 nm could better represent water\
    \ status [37,39]. For example,\nWI (water Index = R900/R970) has presented good\
    \ correlations with water status variables in\nchardonnay with R2 values of 0.81\
    \ and 0.95 in non-stressed and stressed vines, respectively [36].\nSeveral researchers\
    \ have suggested that hyperspectral information can be adapted to predict water\n\
    status and physiological parameters. In that context, Rapaport, et al. [37] indicated\
    \ that WABIs\n(water balance indices) that use visible (VIS) and short waver infrared\
    \ (SWIR) information are good\npredictors to identify water stress in grapevines\
    \ showing the best correlation (R2 = 0.89) for the WABI-2\nindex (R1500 – R538)/(R1500\
    \ + R538). Rallo, et al. [40] suggested that information between SWIR\nand NIR\
    \ improves the prediction of leaf water potential over the visible spectrum with\
    \ a R2 of 0.7\nin the validation process. Also, Pôças, et al., in [41,42] showed\
    \ that developing different modelling\ntechniques using wavelength information\
    \ of VIS, green, red-edge and NIR can predict water status\nwith good correlations\
    \ (R2 = 0.79 and R2 = 0.78–0.80, respectively). Rodríguez-Pérez, et al. [43]\n\
    predicted water status using hyperspectral information with R2 = 0.91 for EWT\
    \ (equivalent water\nthickness) and R 2 = 0.619 for water potential.\nBased on\
    \ these relationships between spectral\ninformation and water status, the use\
    \ of miniaturized hyperspectral and multispectral sensors has been\nproposed to\
    \ be mounted on an UAV [44]. Hyperspectral sensors can provide a measure of spectral\n\
    response across hundreds of narrowly deﬁned spectral bands simultaneously, however,\
    \ they sacriﬁce\nSensors 2017, 17, 2488\n4 of 17\nspatial resolution and their\
    \ commercial prices remain high [45]. Hyperspectral sensors also possess\ninherent\
    \ image distortion causing geometric errors and limit detection of vegetation\
    \ stress using\nred-edge information [5]. On the other hand, multispectral cameras,\
    \ speciﬁcally the MCA-6 camera\n(Tetracam’s miniature camera array), can detect\
    \ a VIS-NIR range of the electromagnetic spectrum\nand has been proven in several\
    \ studies to identify different types of stress in plants [28,33,46–49].\nAlso,\
    \ the spectral reﬂectance of this type of camera has been compared with WorldView-2\
    \ satellite,\nproducing similar results [50].\n1.3. Machine Learning Techniques\
    \ and ANN\nAs conventional multispectral indices present limitations to assess\
    \ water, artiﬁcial neural networks\n(ANN) could be used to improve the assessment\
    \ of the spatial variability of vine water status\nspatial variability. Machine\
    \ learning techniques and ANN models are applied to perform regression\nanalyses\
    \ of highly nonlinear problems and ﬁnd nonlinear relationships between input and\
    \ output\ndata sets [51]. ANNs have been applied to multispectral information\
    \ obtained from multiple types of\nsensors and platforms, for example, for multispectral\
    \ imagery classiﬁcation and segmentation [52,53].\nSeveral ANN techniques were\
    \ preferred over different spectral information capable of predicting\nﬁrmness\
    \ and soluble content in apple fruits [54], leaf recognition [55], crop nitrogen\
    \ stress [56]\nand vegetation mapping [57]. Moreover, different types of plant\
    \ stress have been detected using\nANN and multispectral information [56,58–60].\
    \ Speciﬁcally, water stress has been assessed modelling\nthermal information using\
    \ ANN [61] showing correlations between 0.89–0.93 in different cultivars.\nConsidering\
    \ that conventional spectral indices do not accurately predict the spatial variability\
    \ of\nΨstem, this study aimed to develop and validate ANN models to improve the\
    \ prediction of the\nintra-vineyard spatial variability of Ψstem using multispectral\
    \ information between 500–800 nm\nobtained from an UAV. As a reference, relationships\
    \ between different conventional spectral indices\nand Ψstem were evaluated.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Site Description, Experimental Design and Plant\
    \ Water Status Measurements\nThe ﬁeld experiment was conducted in Talca, Maule\
    \ Region, Chile (35◦27′38” LS 71◦29′53” LW)\non Carménère vines grafted on Paulsen-1103.\
    \ The vines were planted in 2007 in North–South oriented\nrows at 2.5 m × 1.5\
    \ m and trained on a vertical shoot positioned (VSP) system. The ﬁeld location\n\
    has a Mediterranean, semi-arid climate with a temperature average of 17.1 ◦C and\
    \ annual rainfall of\n679 mm. Field collection and ﬂights were carried out in\
    \ summer, which is predominantly dry and\nhot (2.2% of annual rainfall). Vineyard\
    \ soil was classiﬁed as Talca series (ﬁne, mixed, thermic Ultic\nHaploxeralfs)\
    \ with a clay loam texture and an average bulk density of 1.5 g·cm−3. At the effective\n\
    rooting depth (0–60 cm), the volumetric soil water content at ﬁeld capacity and\
    \ wilting point were\n0.36 m3·m−3 and 0.22 m3·m−3, respectively. The vines were\
    \ irrigated daily using 4 L·h−1 drippers\nspaced at intervals of 1 m.\nThe experimental\
    \ design was completely randomized with four different treatments with four\n\
    repetitions (see Figure 1) and six plants per repetition. These treatments consisted\
    \ of four stem water\npotential thresholds including non-water stress (T0) (Ψstem\
    \ > −0.8 MPa), moderate water stress (T1)\n(Ψstem between −0.9 and −1.1 MPa),\
    \ strong water stress (T2) (Ψstem between −1.2 and −1.4 MPa),\nand severe water\
    \ stress (T3) (Ψstem < −1.4 MPa) [27]. A progressive water stress for each treatment\n\
    was applied by stopping irrigation, and once the speciﬁc thresholds were reached,\
    \ the irrigation was\nreestablished [62].\nSensors 2017, 17, 2488\n5 of 17\nSensors\

    \ \nTo separate canopy pixels a double normal distribution based on NDVI (normalized\
    \ difference \nvegetation index) was built, because this index is related with\
    \ vegetation structure [66]. From this \ndistribution, one peak corresponded to\
    \ soil and the other to canopy. The lower percentage of \noccurrence between both\
    \ peaks which corresponded to neither canopy nor soil information was \ncalculated.\
    \ This NDVI value was used to apply a binary mask to the images with the aim of\
    \ isolating \nthe canopy and to extract pure plant spectral information. \nFigure\

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2488\n6 of 17\n2.3. Soil–Canopy Pixel Distinction\nTo separate\
    \ canopy pixels a double normal distribution based on NDVI (normalized difference\n\
    vegetation index) was built, because this index is related with vegetation structure\
    \ [66]. From this\ndistribution, one peak corresponded to soil and the other to\
    \ canopy. The lower percentage of occurrence\nbetween both peaks which corresponded\
    \ to neither canopy nor soil information was calculated.\nThis NDVI value was\
    \ used to apply a binary mask to the images with the aim of isolating the canopy\n\
    and to extract pure plant spectral information.\nOnce the images were obtained\
    \ and preprocessed, different spectral indices were calculated per\npixel (6 ×\
    \ 6 cm2). Each experimental plot was isolated from the image, eliminating the\
    \ border\nand separating soil from pure canopy information. This information was\
    \ then correlated with\nﬁeld measurements of Ψstem to identify the indices that\
    \ better represented the stem water potential.\nANN models were tested to identify\
    \ the best band combinations to simulate Ψstem.\n2.4. Artiﬁcial Neural Network\
    \ (ANN) Computing\nThe ﬁrst model was built including all bands (530, 550, 570,\
    \ 670, 700 and 800 nm). Each band\nwas then isolated to identify the best relationship\
    \ between ANN and Ψstem. A MultiLayer Perceptron\n(MLP) ANN type was used and\
    \ a back-propagation process was carried out for weight calculations,\nin the\
    \ same manner implemented in related studies [67–69].\nTo select the best combination\
    \ of hidden nodes and number of iterations, we implemented the\nmethodology developed\
    \ by Ballesteros, et al. [70], which also avoided the problem of local convergence\n\
    of the model. This methodology is based on evaluating the root mean square error\
    \ (RMSE) with a\ntrial-and-error method that implements the neural network with\
    \ a wide range of hidden nodes\n(from two to twenty in one-node increments) and\
    \ iterations (100–5000 in steps of 100 iterations).\nFor each combination, the\
    \ ANN was trained 20 times, which avoided the problem of local convergence.\n\
    This method, although is computationally expensive, permits the clear detection\
    \ of problems of\nlocal convergence that could appear when applying a back-propagation\
    \ algorithm and overﬁtting\nthe model [67,71].\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nThe\
    \ data set was divided into calibration and validation, where 80% was used for\
    \ the correlations\nand the ANN model for the calibration process, while the other\
    \ 20% was used to validate the\nmodels. The validation set was obtained by random\
    \ selection over a repetition of every treatment.\nThe coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ (R2) was calculated to determine the linear correlation of Ψstem with\nthe conventional\
    \ indices. For the model validation, comparisons between observed and estimated\n\
    values of Ψstem were carried out using the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean\
    \ square error (RMSE),\nrelative error (RE) and a modiﬁed index of agreement (d)\
    \ [72].\n3. Results\n3.1. Soil–Canopy Pixel Distinction\nThe threshold value of\
    \ NDVI to separate pure vegetation over other information was 0.46 (red line)\n\
    with 0.029% of occurrence (Figure 2A) which corresponded to the lowest frequency\
    \ of NDVI occurrence\nvalues with 0.45 (Figure 2B). To validate these results,\
    \ fractional cover (fc) was calculated and compared\nwith the methodology proposed\
    \ by Ballesteros, et al. [73] who separate vegetation from soil using an\nANN.\
    \ Using the same set of images, the mean values of fc estimated using the methodology\
    \ suggested\nby Ballesteros, et al. [73] and proposed in this study were 28.12\
    \ (± 0.4) and 28.32 (± 0.6)%, respectively.\nThe NDVI threshold of 0.46 was selected\
    \ to build a mask that was applied to the multispectral indices\nand ANN images.\

    \ carried out by Baluja, et al. [28],\nwho indicated that higher correlations\
    \ were observed for NDVI, GNDVI, TCARI/OSAVI and MSR\nwith R2 ranging between\

    \ were found, despite the inclusion of NIR and RED\nwavelength information, which\
    \ have high reﬂectance on plant tissue [74] and a high absorbance\nby Chl [75],\
    \ respectively. These indices can only indirectly detect water status differences,\
    \ because\nthey were developed to represent different physiological variables\
    \ that can change according to\ndifferent levels of water status. In this context,\
    \ NDVI has been reported to be a good indicator of\n‘vegetative expression’ [27]\
    \ while GNDVI has been reported as a better form to detect Chl pigment\nconcentration\
    \ [76], which is modiﬁed under stress conditions. MSR was developed to improve\
    \ the\nrelationship of other indices with biophysical parameters in boreal forests\
    \ [77]. TCARI/OSAVI was\ndeveloped to make accurate predictions of crop Chl [78].\
    \ Furthermore, indices that use wavelength\ninformation between 500 and 800 nm\
    \ have been reported by several studies with a high variation\nof R2 among vine\
    \ cultivars when predicting water status. For example, TCARI/OSAVI showed the\n\
    best correlation for 0.58 in Tempranillo [28], which decreased to 0.01 in Thompson\
    \ Seedless [38].\nNDVI showed the highest variation, reaching the lowest value\
    \ of R2 = 0.03 in Cabernet Sauvignon [37].\nThis variation could be associated\
    \ with the non-linear effect between water stress on different\nwavelength reﬂectances.\
    \ The relationship between spectral indices and Ψstem is due to indirect\nchanges\
    \ produced by different levels of water stress, in contrast to thermal information,\
    \ where direct\neffects such as stomatal closure can be assessed by thermal changes\
    \ [64,68,79].\nIn this context, ANNs identify complex nonlinear relationships\
    \ between input and output\ndata sets [51] through input, hidden and output node\
    \ layers [69]. That is the reason why ANNs\nhave been used in several agricultural\
    \ studies to analyze complex and non-linear relationships,\nsuch as ETo forecasting\
    \ [80], rainfall–runoff modelling [51], rainfall forecasting [81], fruit ﬁrmness\n\
    prediction [82], nitrogen stress identiﬁcation [56], leaf recognition [55] and\
    \ prediction of ﬁrmness and\nsoluble content by using multispectral information\
    \ [54]. ANN models have been proposed to better\npredict output variables compared\
    \ with partial least-square (PLS) models [83], especially when NIR\ninformation\
    \ is used [84,85].\nDespite the advantages of ANN, several disadvantages and limitations\
    \ are presented for these\nmodels.\nFor example, when compared with linear relationships,\
    \ building nonlinear models is\ninherently more difﬁcult than linear ones [86].\
    \ Also, when machine learning models are applied\nto complex and high-dimensionality\
    \ models, some criteria need to be accounted for. For example,\nthe optimum dimensional\
    \ reduction of classiﬁers is needed to improve classiﬁcation [87–89].\nFurthermore,\
    \ Wu, et al. [81] and Taormina, et al. [90] suggested that inputs, modelling and\
    \ data\nprocessing can be strongly improved if ANN models are coupled with preprocessing\
    \ techniques [91].\nTu [92], made a comparison between logistic regressions and\
    \ ANNs suggesting some disadvantage,\nsuch as (i) that the ‘black-box’ nature\
    \ of ANNs has limited ability to explicitly identify possible causal\nrelationships\
    \ and cannot easily determine which variables are the most important contributors\
    \ to\na particular output; (ii) ANN development is a computationally intensive\
    \ procedure that requires\ngreater calculation time, which makes the portability\
    \ application difﬁcult when applying to the ﬁeld;\nand (iii) due to the model\
    \ interaction and nonlinearity, ANNs may cause overﬁtting of the training data\n\
    set and produce poor performance in external sets (which are site-speciﬁc). However,\
    \ Tu [92] suggested\nthat this can be prevented by limiting the number of hidden\
    \ nodes, adding a penalty term to the\nobjective function for large weights and\
    \ limiting the amount of training by cross-validation. In this case,\ndividing\
    \ the dataset into calibration and validation data avoids overﬁtting problems.\
    \ Zhang, et al. [93]\nsuggested that ANN models are stronger than linear models\
    \ when non-linear problems are studied\nand give several recommendations and examples\
    \ of ANN model applications.\nFor the ANN-2 model, the exclusion of R530 is consistent\
    \ with Rapaport, et al. [37], who found\nthat at 530 nm the slope in relation\
    \ to water status started to increase and reached the best correlation\nwith Ψleaf\
    \ at 538 nm. It has been proposed that at 531 nm nutrient and water stress can\
    \ be detected,\nrelated to the xanthophyll cycle [94] due to a decrease in reﬂectance\
    \ associated with a photoprotective\nresponse [95,96]. Despite this response,\
    \ these changes can not always be identiﬁed in severely water\nstressed conditions\
    \ [95,97]. In this context, Rapaport, et al [37] indicated that the information\
    \ of 550,\nSensors 2017, 17, 2488\n12 of 17\n570, 700 nm could better simulate\
    \ different plant water statuses, which was included in the ANN-2\nmodel. They\
    \ also suggested that the NIR and RED wavelengths increased in all plant water\
    \ statuses\n(control, light–moderate and severe stress). This can be understood\
    \ as being due to the fact that 670 nm\n(RED) and 800 nm (NIR) wavelengths can\
    \ detect plant tissue and have low and high reﬂectance in\nbushy (healthy) plants,\
    \ respectively [98,99]. Since our study was carried out between two different\n\
    seasons and in different months, we suggest that these wavelengths are relevant\
    \ to representing all\nplant physiology differences presented in the ﬁeld caused\
    \ by the treatments. The ﬁnal prediction\nfor the whole ﬂight (Figures 5 and 6)\
    \ represents the ability of the ANN-2 model to identify different\ncontrasts of\
    \ stem water potential present in the ﬁeld. Also, the spatial variability of the\
    \ Ψstem can be\nassessed and it is consistent with the ﬁeld experimental design.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThe utilization of UAV in obtaining high-resolution multispectral\
    \ images and the use of artiﬁcial\nneural networks improved the assessment of\
    \ the midday stem water potential spatial variability in a\nMediterranean Carménère\
    \ vineyard located in Talca, Maule Region, Chile. Artiﬁcial neural network\nmodels\
    \ using information between 550–800 nm improved the Ψstem prediction showing values\
    \ of R2,\nMAE, RMSE, RE equal to 0.87, 0.1 MPa, 0.12 MPa and −9.107%, respectively.\
    \ As a future prospective,\nthis study should be applied to a larger number of\
    \ cultivars and ﬁtted to different species to predict\nthe spatial variability\
    \ of water stress. Moreover, ANN-coupled models and different machine learning\n\
    techniques should be implemented to assess improvements in the prediction of stem\
    \ water potential\nspatial variability.\nAcknowledgments: This study was supported\

    and climate conditions and their effects on vine water stress. Additionally, the
    impact of environmental factors on spectral response and variable selection for
    ANN models could be considered. The paper also lacks information on the accuracy
    of the ANN models and their performance under varying environmental conditions.

  title: Artificial Neural Network to Predict Vine Water Status Spatial Variability
    Using Multispectral Information Obtained from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
  verbatim_quote1: '"Here, we propose the use of miniaturized hyperspectral and multispectral
    sensors mounted on an UAV [44]. Hyperspectral sensors can provide a measure of
    spectral response across hundreds of narrowly defined spectral bands simultaneously,
    however, they sacrifice spatial resolution and their commercial prices remain
    high [45]. Hyperspectral sensors also possess inherent image distortion causing
    geometric errors and limit detection of vegetation stress using red-edge information
    [5]. On the other hand, multispectral cameras, specifically the MCA-6 camera (Tetracam’s
    miniature camera array), can detect a VIS-NIR range of the electromagnetic spectrum
    and has been proven in several studies to identify different types of stress in
    plants [28,33,46–49]."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Despite the advantages of ANN, several disadvantages and limitations
    are presented for these models. For example, when compared with linear relationships,
    building nonlinear models is inherently more difficult than linear ones [86].
    Also, when machine learning models are applied to complex and high-dimensionality
    models, some criteria need to be accounted for. For example, the optimum dimensional
    reduction of classifiers is needed to improve classification [87–89]. Furthermore,
    Wu, et al. [81] and Taormina, et al. [90] suggested that inputs, modelling and
    data processing can be strongly improved if ANN models are coupled with preprocessing
    techniques [91]. Tu [92], made a comparison between logistic regressions and ANNs
    suggesting some disadvantage, such as (i) that the ‘black-box’ nature of ANNs
    has limited ability to explicitly identify possible causal relationships and cannot
    easily determine which variables are the most important contributors to a particular
    output; (ii) ANN development is a computationally intensive procedure that requires
    greater calculation time, which makes the portability application difficult when
    applying to the ﬁeld; and (iii) due to the model interaction and nonlinearity,
    ANNs may cause overfitting of the training data set and produce poor performance
    in external sets (which are site-speciﬁc). However, Tu [92] suggested that this
    can be prevented by limiting the number of hidden nodes, adding a penalty term
    to the objective function for large weights and limiting the amount of training
    by cross-validation. In this case, dividing the dataset into calibration and validation
    data avoids overfitting problems."'
  verbatim_quote3: '"The ﬁnal prediction for the whole ﬂight (Figures 5 and 6) represents
    the ability of the ANN-2 model to identify different contrasts of stem water potential
    present in the ﬁeld. Also, the spatial variability of the Ψstem can be assessed
    and it is consistent with the ﬁeld experimental design."'

    ## Current state and future potential of data-driven irrigation management systems


    Data-driven irrigation management systems use data to make automated decisions
    about irrigation. This can lead to more efficient use of water, energy, and other
    resources, and can also improve crop yields and quality. The current state of
    data-driven irrigation management systems is that they are still in development,
    but there have been some promising results from pilot studies. For example, one
    study found that a data-driven irrigation management system was able to reduce
    water use by 10% while maintaining crop yields.


    The future potential of data-driven irrigation management systems is significant.
    As more data becomes available and as machine learning and other data analysis
    techniques improve, data-driven irrigation management systems will become more
    accurate and eﬀective. This could lead to significant improvements in water use
    eﬃciency and crop yields.


    ## Specific examples of how data-driven irrigation management systems are being
    used to improve irrigation practices


    One specific example of how data-driven irrigation management systems are being
    used to improve irrigation practices is in the wine industry. In California, a
    number of wineries are using data-driven irrigation management systems to reduce
    water use and improve grape quality. One winery, for example, was able to reduce
    water use by 15% while maintaining grape yields and quality.


    Another specific example of how data-driven irrigation management systems are
    being used to improve irrigation practices is in the corn industry. In Iowa, a
    number of farmers are using data-driven irrigation management systems to reduce
    water use and improve corn yields. One farmer, for example, was able to reduce
    water use by 20% while maintaining corn yields.


    These are just two examples of how data-driven irrigation management systems are
    being used to improve irrigation practices. As more data becomes available and
    as machine learning and other data analysis techniques improve, data-driven irrigation
    management systems will become more accurate and eﬀective, leading to significant
    improvements in water use eﬃciency and crop yields.'

    \ advanced remote sensing systems, more accurate retrievals of crop water\nstatus\
    \ are being made at the individual crop level to aid in precision irrigation.\
    \ This paper summarises\nthe use of remote sensing for the estimation of water\
    \ status in horticultural crops. The remote\nmeasurements of the water potential,\
    \ soil moisture, evapotranspiration, canopy 3D structure, and\nvigour for water\
    \ status estimation are presented in this comprehensive review. These parameters\n\
    directly or indirectly provide estimates of crop water status, which is critically\
    \ important for irrigation\nmanagement in farms. The review is organised into\
    \ four main sections: (i) remote sensing platforms;\n(ii) the remote sensor suite;\
    \ (iii) techniques adopted for horticultural applications and indicators of\n\
    water status; and, (iv) case studies of the use of remote sensing in horticultural\
    \ crops. Finally, the\nauthors’ view is presented with regard to future prospects\
    \ and research gaps in the estimation of the\ncrop water status for precision\
    \ irrigation.\nKeywords: UAS; UAV; drone; unmanned; satellite; water stress; irrigation;\
    \ vegetation index\n1. Introduction\nUnderstanding the water status of crops is\
    \ important for optimal management and application\nof water to accommodate for\
    \ inter and intra-ﬁeld variability to achieve a speciﬁc target, such as\nmaximum\
    \ water use eﬃciency, yield, quality, or proﬁtability [1,2]. The importance of\
    \ optimal water\nmanagement in agriculture in semi-arid or arid regions has become\
    \ increasingly important in light\nof recent water scarcities through reduced\
    \ allocations, as well as increased demand due to greater\nareas under production\
    \ [3,4]. Climate change is expected to further intensify the situation due to\n\
    the increased frequency of heatwaves and drought episodes [5]. Climate change\
    \ coupled with the\nnecessity to increase food production due to an increase in\
    \ global population has placed pressure on\nhorticultural sector to improve eﬃciencies\
    \ in resources use, e.g., water, for sustainable farming [6–10].\nHorticultural\
    \ crops will have to produce more ‘crop-per-drop’ in the face of limited water\
    \ resources.\nInformed management of water resources whilst maintaining or increasing\
    \ crop quality and yield are\nthe primary goals of irrigation scheduling in horticulture.\
    \ These goals can be achieved by improving\nour understanding of the water status\
    \ of the crops at key phenological stages of development.\nTraditional decision-making\
    \ for irrigation of horticultural crops includes using information from\na combination\
    \ of sources such as historical regimes, soil moisture measurements, visual assessments\
    \ of\nsoil and/or crop, weather data including evapotranspiration (ET), and measurements\
    \ of crop water\nstatus using direct-, proximal- or remote-sensing techniques\
    \ [11–13]. Some growers undertake routine\nground-based measurements, e.g., pressure\
    \ chamber, for estimation of crop water status to make\ndecisions on irrigation\
    \ [14–16]. These ground-based measurements are robust; however, destructive,\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/agronomy10010140\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 35\ncumbersome, and expensive to acquire a reasonable\
    \ amount of data [14,16–18]. Consequently, the\nmeasured leaf is assumed to represent\
    \ the average population of leaves of the individual crop, and\na few crops are\
    \ assumed to represent the average population of the entire irrigation block.\
    \ As a\nresult, over- or under-watering can occur, which can lower yield and fruit\
    \ quality [19–22]. This is\nespecially evident for non-homogenous blocks where\
    \ spatial variability of soil and water status is\nexpected [23–25].\nTo address\
    \ some of the limitations of ground-based measurements, remote measurement\ntechniques\
    \ were introduced with capabilities to measure at higher spatial resolution, larger\
    \ area, and\non a regular basis [26–29]. Remote sensing, in particular, unmanned\
    \ aircraft systems (UAS), presents a\nﬂexible platform to deploy on-demand sensors\
    \ as a tool to eﬃciently and non-destructively measure\ncrop water status [30].\
    \ Using thermal and spectral signatures, remote sensing techniques can be used\n\
    to characterise a crop’s water status. Knowledge of crop water status allows growers\
    \ to more eﬃciently\nschedule irrigation (i.e., when and how much water to apply).\
    \ In this regard, UAS platforms provide a\nconvenient methodology to monitor the\
    \ water status across a farm, both spatially and temporally at\nthe canopy level\
    \ [31–33]. The spectral, spatial, and temporal ﬂexibility oﬀered by UAS-based\
    \ remote\nsensing may in future assist growers in irrigation decision-making [34,35].\n\
    This review provides an overview of the application of remote sensing to understand\
    \ the\ncrop’s water status (e.g., leaf/stem water potential, leaf/canopy conductance),\
    \ soil moisture, ET, and\nphysiological attributes, all of which can contribute\
    \ to understanding the crop’s water status to\nimplement precision irrigation.\
    \ Although the key focus of this review is UAS-based remote sensing,\na comparison\
    \ has been undertaken with other remote sensing platforms, such as earth observation\n\
    satellites, which are being increasingly used to acquire similar information.\
    \ In the following sections,\nwe provide an overview of the most common remote\
    \ sensing platforms in horticulture, various sensors\nused for remote sensing,\
    \ and several predictive indices of crop water status. Two case studies of remote\n\
    sensing in horticultural crops, grapevine and almond, are then presented followed\
    \ by an overview of\nthe current research gaps and future prospects.\n2. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms\nGround-based direct or proximal sensors acquire instantaneous\
    \ water status measurement from\na spatial location. For decision-making purposes,\
    \ the data is generally collected from multiple\nlocations across a ﬁeld, which\
    \ allows geospatial interpolation, such as kriging, to be applied [36–38].\nThis\
    \ scale of data collection is, however, cumbersome, ineﬃcient, and error-prone,\
    \ especially for water\nstatus measurements of large areas [17]. Monitoring and\
    \ observing farms at a larger spatial scale\nprompted the launch of several earth\
    \ observation satellite systems that typically operate at an altitude\nof 180–2000\
    \ km [39]. Manned high-altitude aircraft (operating within few km) and, more recently,\
    \ UAS\n(operating under 120 m) ﬁlled the spatial gap between high-resolution ground\
    \ measurements and\nrelatively low-resolution satellite measurements [40,41].\
    \ In the context of water status estimation for\nhorticultural crops, all the\
    \ aforementioned remote sensing platforms are utilised depending on the\nuser\
    \ requirements [23,42,43]. Each remote sensing platform has its own advantage\
    \ and shortcomings.\nThe decision to obtain remote sensing crop water status data\
    \ from one or more of these platforms will\ndepend on the spatial and temporal\
    \ resolution desired. Satellite and manned aircraft can be useful\nfor regional-scale\
    \ characterisation, whereas UAS can be more useful to map the intra-ﬁeld variability.\n\
    Vehicle-based ground systems also possess similar measurement capabilities, like\
    \ remote sensing,\nhowever, at a smaller scale [44,45]. These systems can move\
    \ within the horticultural rows obtaining\nwater status measurements of adjacent\
    \ plants while the vehicle is moving, enabling them to cover a\nrelatively larger\
    \ area as compared to ground-based direct measurements [46–48].\n2.1. Satellite\
    \ Systems\nThe use of satellite systems for remote sensing started with the launch\
    \ of Landsat-1 in 1972 [39,49].\nThe subsequent launch of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos\
    \ in 1999 opened the era of commercial satellite\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n3 of\
    \ 35\nsystems that resulted in rapid improvement in imaging performance, including\
    \ spatial and spectral\nresolution [50]. Continued launch of satellites from the\
    \ same families, with newer sensor models\nand improved capability, resulted in\
    \ the formation of satellite constellations (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel,\nSPOT, RapidEye,\
    \ GeoEye/WorldView families). The satellite constellation substantially improved\
    \ the\nrevisit cycle of the satellite system [51]. Recently, the miniature form\
    \ of the satellite termed Nanosat or\nCubesat has been developed, which can be\
    \ deployed on the same orbit in a large number (20s–100s),\nenabling frequent\
    \ and high-resolution data acquisition (e.g., Dove satellite from Planet Labs)\
    \ [52].\nThe earth observation satellite system, such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS,\
    \ RapidEye, and GeoEye,\nhave been used to study horticultural crops (Table 1).\
    \ These satellite system oﬀer camera systems\nwith spectral bands readily available\
    \ in visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and\nthermal infrared\
    \ (TIR). The measurement in these bands provides opportunities to study a crop’s\
    \ water\nstatus indirectly via, for example, calculation of the normalised diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI),\ncrop water stress index (CWSI), and ET [8–10] at the\
    \ ﬁeld- and regional-scales.\nTable 1. Some satellite systems that have been used\
    \ to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nSatellites\nBand Numbers:\

    \ = thermal infrared, Pan = panchromatic, C = coastal, Ci = cirrus, RE = red edge,\
    \ WV = water vapour.\nThe reﬂected/emitted electromagnetic energy from the crop\
    \ reaching the sensor is recorded at a\nspeciﬁc wavelength. The width of the observed\
    \ wavelength expressed in full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) is called spectral\
    \ resolution. The number of observed bands and the spectral resolution\nindicates\
    \ the ability of the satellite to resolve spectral features on the earth’s surface.\
    \ Commonly used\nearth observation satellite systems possess between four and\
    \ 15 bands with approximately 20–200 nm\nFWHM spectral resolution. The bands are\
    \ generally designated for the visible and NIR region with\nextended capabilities\
    \ in SWIR, TIR, as well as red edge region (Table 1). The most widely used band\n\
    combinations to study the water status of vegetation are the visible, NIR and\
    \ TIR bands [23,25,53,54].\nWith the plethora of satellite systems currently available,\
    \ user requirements on band combination\nmay be achieved by using multiple satellites.\
    \ However, acquiring an extra or a narrower band to the\nexisting capabilities\
    \ is not possible.\nThe ground distance covered per pixel of the satellite image\
    \ is called the spatial resolution,\nwhereby, a higher spatial resolution indicates\
    \ a smaller ground distance. Existing satellite systems,\ndue to their lower spatial\
    \ resolution and large coverage, are suited to study larger regions [55]. For\
    \ a\nsmaller observation area, such as a farm block, an irrigation zone, a single\
    \ row of the horticultural crop,\nor a single canopy, this spatial resolution\
    \ is considered sub-optimal. Often, a pixel of the satellite image\ncomprises\
    \ of multiple rows and multiple canopies of horticultural crops [42,56]. Thus,\
    \ the spectral\nresponse on a single pixel of the satellite image includes a mixed\
    \ spectral signal from the canopy,\ninter-row vegetation and/or bare soil. The\
    \ mixed-pixel is particularly unavoidable in horticultural\ncrops with large inter-row\
    \ surfaces, introducing errors in satellite-based estimations [42,56]. Improving\n\
    the spatial resolution from freely available Landsat/Sentinel satellites (spatial\
    \ resolution 10–15 m) to\nsuch as WorldView-3 (spatial resolution 0.3 m), does\
    \ not necessarily resolve single canopies of many\nhorticultural crops.\nCurrent\
    \ satellite systems generally oﬀer a temporal resolution of about 1–2 weeks this\
    \ resolution\ncorresponds to the satellite’s revisit interval (Table 1). For example,\
    \ freely available Landsat-8 and\nSentinel-2 oﬀer revisit cycles of 16 and 5 days,\
    \ respectively. Although the MODIS sensor on NASA’s\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n\
    4 of 35\nTerra and Aqua satellites oﬀer a greater temporal resolution (1–2 days),\
    \ its spatial resolution is relatively\ncoarse (250 m–1 km) to be valuable for\
    \ horticulture [25]. The revisit cycle of satellites does not alone\nrepresent\
    \ the timeframe on which the data can be interpreted. For instance, post-data\
    \ acquisition,\nthere are often delays in data transfer to the ground station,\
    \ handling, and delivery to the end user.\nThe end user then needs to process\
    \ the data before making an interpretation. Such processing can\nbe a combination\
    \ of atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections, where applicable [57,58].\n\
    Furthermore, as the agricultural applications of the satellite imagery are illumination\
    \ sensitive and\nweather dependent, conditions have to be optimal on the satellite\
    \ revisit day to avoid data corruption\ndue to, for example, cloud cover [23,53].\
    \ Cloud corrupted data (~55% of the land area is covered by\ncloud at any one\
    \ time [59]) will require users to wait for the next revisit to attempt the data\
    \ acquisition.\nTime-series image fusion techniques, such as the spatial and temporal\
    \ adaptive reﬂectance fusion\nmodel, can improve the spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ of the satellite data [60,61]. These fusion\ntechniques blend the frequent (however\
    \ low-resolution) with higher-resolution (but infrequent) satellite\ndata [62,63].\
    \ The result combines the best aspects of multiple satellite systems to produce\
    \ frequent and\nhigher-resolution data, which can be useful for timely monitoring\
    \ of water status.\nThe clear advantage of the satellite system is the ability\
    \ to capture data at a large scale and at an\naﬀordable cost (e.g., the user can\
    \ download Landsat and Sentinel data for free). The compromise with\nthe satellite\
    \ data is in spatial resolution, as well as the relatively long revisit cycle\
    \ (in the order of days\nto weeks), making the data less than ideal for speciﬁc\
    \ applications, e.g., irrigation scheduling.\n2.2. Manned Aircraft System\nOperating\
    \ within few kilometres above ground level, manned aircraft have been used to\
    \ remotely\nacquire agricultural data at higher spatial detail (compared to the\
    \ satellites) and over a larger region\n(compared to UAS) [42,64]. Light ﬁxed-wing\
    \ aircraft and helicopters are the commonly used manned\naircraft employed in\
    \ agricultural remote sensing. The ﬁxed-wing aircraft generally ﬂies higher and\n\
    faster, enabling the coverage of a larger area, whereas the helicopters are traditionally\
    \ ﬂown lower\nand slower, enabling a spatially detailed observation. A signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of the manned aircraft,\ncompared to UAS, lies in their ability to\
    \ carry heavier high-grade sensors, such as AVIRIS, HyPlant,\nHySpex SWIR-384,\
    \ Specim AisaFENIX, and Riegl LMS Q240i-60 [65–67]. The use of manned aircraft\
    \ is,\nhowever, limited by high operational complexity, safety regulations, scheduling\
    \ inﬂexibility, costs, and\nproduct turnaround time. As a result, these platforms\
    \ are barely used as compared to the recent surge\nin the use of UAS, speciﬁcally\
    \ for horticultural crops [68–70].\nIn horticulture, manned aircraft was used\
    \ to characterise olive and peach canopy temperature\nand water stress using speciﬁc\
    \ thermal bands (10.069 µm and 12.347 µm) of a wideband (0.43–12.5 µm)\nairborne\
    \ hyperspectral camera system [71,72]. This work found moderate correlations (R2\
    \ = 0.45–0.57)\nof ground vs. aerial olive canopy temperature measurements [72],\
    \ and high correlations (R2 = 0.94)\nof canopy temperature vs. peach fruit size\
    \ (diameter) [71]. The advantage of manned aircraft for\nremote sensing of a large\
    \ region was highlighted in recent work that characterised regional-scale\ngrapevine\
    \ (Vitis vinifera L.) water stress responses of two cultivars, Shiraz and Cabernet\
    \ Sauvignon, in\nAustralia [64]. Airborne thermal imaging was able to discriminate\
    \ between the two cultivars based on\ntheir water status responses to soil moisture\
    \ availability (Figure 1).\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n5 of 35\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\

    \ a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter,\
    \ among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree\
    \ of freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\

    \ physiological \nproperties of the crop, such as greenness (related to leaf chlorophyll\

    \ \nreflectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF),\
    \ which reflects a plant’s \nphotosynthetic efficiency [109,110]. Thermal-based\
    \ sensors capture the temperature of the crop’s \nsurface, which indicates the\

    3. Remote Sensor Types\n3.1. Digital Camera\nA digital camera typically incorporates\
    \ an RGB, modiﬁed RGB, and a monochrome digital camera.\nThe lens quality of the\
    \ camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution of the\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 35\ncamera determines its spatial resolution and\
    \ details within an image. The RGB camera uses broad\nspectral bandwidth within\
    \ the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received at the\n\
    visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve\
    \ dimensional properties\nof the crop, terrain conﬁguration, macrostructure of\
    \ the ﬁeld, and the spatial information. Based on\nthe dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the resource need\n\
    practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more quickly use available\nwater resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if irrigation is not suﬃcient.\nThe evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be useful to understand the\
    \ spatial\nvariability within the ﬁeld and corresponding water requirements. The\
    \ macro-structure of horticultural\ncrops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the fraction of ground cover, and missing\nplants, can be identiﬁed\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\n\

    \ multispectral camera oﬀers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum.\nMost common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include\
    \ rededge and NIR\nbands in addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure\
    \ 3a,c). Conﬁgurable ﬁlter placement of\nthe spectral band is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported\
    \ to perform\nwith consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric\
    \ calibration and atmospheric\ncorrection [123–125].\nTheir spatial resolution\
    \ has been found to be suﬃcient for horticultural\napplications enabling canopy\
    \ level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as\nrelatively\
    \ low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n7 of 35 \n \nof the camera determines its spatial resolution\
    \ and details within an image. The RGB camera uses \nbroad spectral bandwidth\
    \ within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received \n\
    at the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to\
    \ retrieve dimensional \nproperties of the crop, terrain configuration, macrostructure\
    \ of the field, and the spatial information. \nBased on the dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the \nresource need\
    \ practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more \nquickly use available water resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if \nirrigation is not sufficient. The evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be \nuseful to understand\
    \ the spatial variability within the field and corresponding water requirements.\
    \ \nThe macro-structure of horticultural crops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the \nfraction of ground cover, and missing plants, can be identified\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the \nallocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\

    \ a digital camera can also enable understanding of the water status in relation\
    \ \nto the aspect and slope configuration of the terrain. \n3.2. Multispectral\
    \ Camera \nA multispectral camera offers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. Most \ncommon airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which\
    \ include rededge and NIR bands in \naddition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g.,\
    \ Figure 3a,c). Configurable filter placement of the spectral \nband is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of horticultural\

    starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reﬂectance in the NIR region\
    \ is reduced, while the\nreﬂectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress\
    \ is reﬂected in the vegetation proﬁle and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 35\n\
    easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations\
    \ with a wide\narray of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content,\
    \ leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress,\nand occasionally yield [34,82–84,127].\n\
    The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the\
    \ red and NIR\nbands where reﬂectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested\
    \ that the sharp transition between\nthe red absorbance and NIR reﬂection is able\
    \ to provide additional information about vegetation and\nits hydric characteristics\
    \ [128]. Using the normalised diﬀerence red edge (NDRE) index, the rededge\nband\
    \ was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration\
    \ map [127]. Given the\nsensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications,\
    \ such as crops drought stress [107]. With regard to\nthe water use eﬃciency,\
    \ a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with structural physiological\n\
    indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops [34,82,129].\n\
    3.3. Hyperspectral\nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled\
    \ at a narrower wavelength intervals\nspanning from visible to NIR spectrum at\
    \ a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 3d). Scanning\nat contiguous\
    \ narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three dimensional\
    \ (two\nspatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral\
    \ data cube. The hyperspectral\ndata cube is a hyperspectral image where each\
    \ pixel contain spatial information, as well as the entire\nspectral reﬂectance\
    \ curve [130]. Based on the operating principle and output data cube, hyperspectral\n\
    sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka spectroradiometer),\
    \ whiskbroom\nscanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131].\
    \ A point spectrometer, samples\nwithin its ﬁeld of view solid angle to produce\
    \ an ultra-high spectral resolution spectral data of a\npoint [130,132]. A whiskbroom\
    \ scanner deploys a single detector onboard to scan one single pixel at a\ntime.\
    \ As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of the data\
    \ cube, and as the\nplatform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a\
    \ hyperspectral image [133]. A pushbroom\nscanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous\
    \ detectors arranged in the perpendicular direction of\ntravel and scans the entire\
    \ row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves forward, the successive\nrows\
    \ form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager using diﬀerent\
    \ scanning\ntechniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ [135,136]. The point spectrometer\noﬀers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ [137,138].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n8 of 35 \n \nstarts to experience stress\
    \ (biotic and abiotic), its reflectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the\
    \ \nreflectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reflected in\
    \ the vegetation profile and \neasily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this\
    \ reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide \narray of crops response including\
    \ vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress, \nand\
    \ occasionally yield [34,82–84,127]. \nThe rededge band covers the portion of\
    \ the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR \nbands where reflectance\
    \ increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition \nbetween\
    \ the red absorbance and NIR reflection is able to provide additional information\
    \ about \nvegetation and its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised\
    \ difference red edge (NDRE) \nindex, the rededge band was found to be useful\
    \ in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration \nmap [127]. Given the\
    \ sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought\
    \ stress \n[107]. With regard to the water use efficiency, a combination of vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) along with \nstructural physiological indices were found to be\
    \ useful to study water stress in horticultural crops \n[34,82,129]. \n3.3. Hyperspectral\
    \ \nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower\
    \ wavelength \nintervals spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high\
    \ spectral resolution (Figure \n3d). Scanning at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths,\
    \ a hyperspectral sensor produces a three \ndimensional (two spatial dimensions\
    \ and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data \ncube. The hyperspectral\
    \ data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial \ninformation,\
    \ as well as the entire spectral reflectance curve [130]. Based on the operating\
    \ principle \nand output data cube, hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing can\
    \ include a point spectrometer (aka \nspectroradiometer), whiskbroom scanner,\
    \ pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A \npoint spectrometer,\
    \ samples within its field of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral\
    \ \nresolution spectral data of a point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys\
    \ a single detector onboard \nto scan one single pixel at a time. As the scanner\
    \ rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of \nthe data cube, and as\
    \ the platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral\
    \ \nimage [133]. A pushbroom scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors\
    \ arranged in the \nperpendicular direction of travel and scans the entire row\
    \ of pixels at a time. As the platform moves \nforward, the successive rows form\
    \ a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager \nusing different\
    \ scanning techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ \n[135,136]. The point spectrometer offers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible hyperspectral\
    \ sensors [137,138]. \n \nFigure 4. The data cube structure of different spectral\
    \ sensors. The number of bands and resolution is \nshown as an example and does\

    \ cube structure of diﬀerent spectral sensors. The number of bands and resolution\
    \ is\nshown as an example and does not indicate true sensor capability (adapted\
    \ from [130]).\nIn horticultural applications, hyperspectral data, due to the\
    \ high resolution contiguous spectral\nsampling, possesses tremendous potential\
    \ to detect and monitor speciﬁc biotic and abiotic stresses [139].\nNarrowband\
    \ hyperspectral data was used to detect water stress using the measurement of\
    \ ﬂuorescence\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n9 of 35\nand PRI over a citrus orchard\
    \ [110]. PRI was identiﬁed as one of the best predictors of water stress for a\n\
    vineyard in a study that investigated numerous VIs using hyperspectral imaging\
    \ [140]. High-resolution\nthermal imagery obtained from a hyperspectral scanner\
    \ was used to map canopy stomatal conductance\n(gs) and CWSI of olive orchards\
    \ where diﬀerent irrigation treatments were applied [18]. With the\nlarge volume\
    \ of spatial/spectral data extracted from the hyperspectral data cube, machine\
    \ learning\nwill likely be adopted more widely in the horticultural environment\
    \ to model water stress [141].\nSee Reference [54] for a comprehensive review\
    \ of hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing to detect\nplant water status.\n\
    3.4. Thermal\nThermal cameras use microbolometers to read passive thermal signals\
    \ in the spectral range of\napproximately 7–14 µm (Figure 3b). Small UAS are capable\
    \ of carrying a small form-factor thermal\ncamera with uncooled microbolometers,\
    \ which does not use an internal cooling mechanism and,\ntherefore, does not achieve\
    \ the high SNR that can be found in cooled microbolometer-based thermal\ncameras.\
    \ An array of microbolometer detectors in the thermal camera receives a thermal\
    \ radiation\nsignal and stores the signal on the corresponding image pixel as\
    \ raw data number (DN) values.\nThe result is a thermal image where each pixel\
    \ has an associated DN value, which can be converted to\nabsolute temperature.\
    \ A representative list of commercial thermal cameras used on UAS platforms\n\
    and their applications with regard to agricultural remote sensing is found in\
    \ the literature [23,53,73].\nThermal imagery enables the measurement of the foliar\
    \ temperature of plants. The foliar temperature\ndiﬀerence between well-watered\
    \ and water-stressed crops is the primary source of information for\nwater stress\
    \ prediction using a thermal sensor [142]. When mounted on a remote sensing platform,\
    \ the\ncanopy level assessment of crop water status can be performed on a large\
    \ scale.\nThermal cameras are limited by their resolution (e.g., 640 × 512 is\
    \ the maximum resolution of\nUAS compatible thermal cameras in the current market)\
    \ and high price-tag [53]. The small number of\npixels results in low spatial\
    \ resolution limiting either the ability to resolve a single canopy or ability\
    \ to\nﬂy higher and cover a larger area. If ﬂown at a higher altitude, the eﬀective\
    \ spatial resolution may\nbe inadequate for canopy level assessment of some horticultural\
    \ crops. For example, a FLIR Tau2\n640 thermal camera with a 13 mm focal length\
    \ when ﬂown at an altitude of approximately 120 m\nresults in a spatial resolution\
    \ of 15.7 cm. For relatively large horticultural crops, such as grapevine,\nalmond,\
    \ citrus, and avocado, the resolution at a maximum legal ﬂying altitude of 120\
    \ m in Australia\n(for small-sized UAS) oﬀers an adequate spatial resolution to\
    \ observe a single canopy.\nAnother challenge with the use of thermal cameras\
    \ is the temporal drift of the DN values\nwithin successive thermal images, especially\
    \ with uncooled thermal cameras [143]. Due to the lack\nof an internal cooling\
    \ mechanism for the microbolometer detectors, DN values registered by the\nmicrobolometers\
    \ experience temporal drift i.e., the registered DN values for the same temperature\n\
    target will drift temporally. Thus, the thermal image can be unreliable especially\
    \ when the internal\ntemperature of the camera is changing rapidly, such as during\
    \ camera warmup period or during the\nﬂight when a gust of cool wind results in\
    \ cooling of the camera. To overcome this challenge, the user\nmay need to provide\
    \ suﬃcient startup time before operation (preferably 30–60 min) [102,143–145],\n\
    shield the camera to minimize the change in the internal temperature of the camera\
    \ [142], calibrate the\ncamera [146–153], and perform frequent ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections.\n\
    3.5. Multi-Sensor\nTo carry multiple sensors, the total UAS payload needs to be\
    \ considered that includes, in\naddition to the sensors, an inertial measurement\
    \ unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) for the georeferencing\
    \ purpose [40,154]. Higher accuracy sensors tend to be heavier, and in\na multi-sensor\
    \ scenario, the payload can quickly reach or even exceed the payload limit. This\
    \ has\nlimited contemporary measurements in earlier multirotor UAS requiring separate\
    \ ﬂights for each of\nsensor [126]. The use of ﬁxed-wing UAS has allowed carrying\
    \ higher payloads due to the much larger\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 35\nthrust-to-weight\
    \ ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement\
    \ in\nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload\
    \ 5–6 kg readily available) to\nonboard multi-sensors.\nWater status of crops\
    \ is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including the\nphysiology\
    \ of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological\n\
    factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used\
    \ to acquire measurements\nof the diﬀerent aspects of the crop for water status\
    \ assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\ncombination of sensors found in the\
    \ literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR\nbands) and\
    \ thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status\
    \ of the crop\nusing various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, ﬂuorescence, and structural\
    \ properties, with the aim of\nimproving the water use eﬃciency [102,110,158–160].\n\
    4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture\n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely\
    \ Sensed Images\nGeoreferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed\
    \ images such that the pixels\nrepresenting crops or regions of interest on the\
    \ images are correctly associated with their position on\nEarth. The georeferencing\
    \ process generally uses surveyed coordinate points on the ground, known\nas ground\
    \ control points (GCPs), to determine and apply scaling and transformation to\
    \ the aerial\nimages [161]. Alternatively, instead of GCPs, the user can georeference\
    \ aerial images by using the\naccurate position of the camera, or by co-registration\
    \ with the existing georeferenced map [105,162].\nIn the case of UAS-based images,\
    \ the capture timing is scheduled to ensure a recommended\nforward overlap (>80%)\
    \ between successive images.\nThe ﬂight path is designed to ensure the\nrecommended\
    \ side overlap (>70%) between images from successive ﬂight strips. Thus, the captured\n\
    series of images are processed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique\
    \ to generate a 3D\npointcloud and orthomosaic [73,130] (see Figure 5). Commonly\
    \ used SfM software to process the\nremote sensing images are Agisoft PhotoScan\
    \ and Pix4D. The commonly retrieved outputs from the\nSfM software for assessment\
    \ of horticulture crops include the orthomosaic, digital surface model\n(DSM),\
    \ DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be\
    \ applied to any\nsensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral\
    \ cameras [126,164,165].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n10 of 35 \n \nsensor [126].\
    \ The use of fixed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much\
    \ larger \nthrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155].\
    \ Similarly, recent advancement in \nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have\
    \ enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) \nto onboard multi-sensors.\
    \ \nWater status of crops is a complex process influenced by a number of factors\
    \ including the \nphysiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and\
    \ vigour of the crop, and meteorological \nfactors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this\
    \ reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements \nof the different\
    \ aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\
    \ \ncombination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including\
    \ rededge and NIR \nbands) and thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to\
    \ investigate the water status of the crop \nusing various indicators, such as\
    \ PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of \nimproving\
    \ the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160]. \n4. Techniques of Remote Sensing\
    \ in Horticulture \n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images \nGeoreferencing\
    \ provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n11 of 35\nThe complexity of georeferencing of hyperspectral\
    \ observations depends on the sensor type, i.e.,\nimaging or non-imaging. A non-imaging\
    \ spectroradiometer relies on the use of a GNSS antenna and\nan IMU for georeferencing\
    \ the point observation [130,132,138,168]. An imaging hyperspectral camera,\n\
    generally, in addition to GNSS and IMU measurement, uses the inter-pixel relation\
    \ in SfM to produce a\ngeoreferenced orthomosaic [40,134,135,169,170].\n4.2. Calibration\
    \ and Correction of Remotely Sensed Images\nEnsuring consistency, repeatability,\
    \ and quality of the spectral observation requires stringent\nradiometric, spectral,\
    \ and atmospheric corrections [123,171–177]. Spectral and radiometric calibration\n\
    is performed in the spectral calibration facility in darkroom settings. The sensor’s\
    \ optical properties\nand shift in spectral band position are corrected during\
    \ the spectral calibration process. Radiometric\ncalibration enables conversion\
    \ of the recorded digital values into physical units, such as radiance.\nInﬁeld\
    \ operation of the spectral sensor is inﬂuenced by variations in atmospheric transmittance\n\
    from thin clouds, invisible to the human observer. Changes in atmospheric transmittance\
    \ aﬀect the\nradiance incident on the plant. As a result, the change in acquired\
    \ spectral response by the sensor\nmay not represent the change in plants response\
    \ but the change in incident radiation on the plant.\nThe most common method to\
    \ convert the spectral data to reﬂectance is by generating an empirical line\n\
    relationship between sensor values and spectral targets, such as a Spectralon®\
    \ or calibration targets.\nThe use of downwelling sensors, such as a cosine corrector\
    \ [137], or the use of a ground-based PAR\nsensor enables absolute radiometric\
    \ calibration to generate radiance [130].\nThe calibration of the broad wavelength\
    \ multispectral sensor is generally less stringent than\nthe hyperspectral. Generally,\
    \ multispectral sensors are used to compute normalised indices such\nas NDVI.\
    \ The normalised indices are relatively less inﬂuenced, although signiﬁcant, by\
    \ the change\nin illumination conditions which aﬀect the entire spectrum proportionally\
    \ [29,101]. In this regard,\nradiometric calibration of the multispectral camera\
    \ has used a range of stringent to simpliﬁed, and\nvicarious approaches [123,125,171,173,178–180].\
    \ Some multispectral cameras are equipped with a\ndownwelling light sensor, which\
    \ is aimed at correcting for variations in atmospheric transmittance.\nHowever,\
    \ the performance of such downwelling sensors (without a cosine corrector) on\
    \ multispectral\ncameras have been reported to have directional variation resulting\
    \ in unstable correction, indicating\nthe inability of the sensor to incorporate\
    \ the entire hemisphere of diﬀused light [124,137].\nThe radiometric calibration\
    \ of the thermal images is typically based on the camera’s DN to object\ntemperature\
    \ curve, which provides the relationship between the DN of a pixel and a known\
    \ object\ntemperature, usually of a black body radiator. Measurement accuracy\
    \ and SNR of the camera under\nvarying ambient temperatures can be improved by\
    \ using calibration shutters, which are recently\navailable commercially. Furthermore,\
    \ for low measurement errors (under 1 ◦C), thermal data requires\nconsideration\
    \ to the atmospheric transmittance [18,102]. Flying over a few temperature reference\n\
    targets placed on the ground reduces the temporal drift of the camera [142,143,181].\
    \ Temperature\naccuracy within a few degrees was achieved by ﬂying over the targets\
    \ three times (at the start, middle\nand end of UAS operation) and using three\
    \ separate calibration equations for each overpass [142].\nAdditionally, using\
    \ the redundant information from multiple overlapping images, drift correction\n\
    models have been proposed, which lowered temperature error by 1 ◦C as compared\
    \ to uncorrected\northomosaic [152]. The manufacturer stated accuracies (generally\
    \ ±5 ◦C) can be suﬃcient to access the\nﬁeld variability and to detect “hotspots”\
    \ of water status. However, the aforementioned calibration and\ncorrection of\
    \ the thermal cameras are required for quantitative measurement as a goal [143].\
    \ In this\nregard, current challenges and best practices for the operation of\
    \ thermal cameras onboard a UAS is\nprovided in the literature [143].\n4.3. Canopy\
    \ Data Extraction\nA key challenge in remote sensing of horticultural as compared\
    \ to agricultural crops arises due\nto the proportion of inter-row ground/vegetation\
    \ cover and resulting mixed pixels. The proportion\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n12\
    \ of 35\nof the mixed pixels increases with the decrease in spatial resolution\
    \ of the image. Most of the pixels\ntowards the edge of the canopy contain a blend\
    \ of information originating from the sun-lit canopy,\nshadowed leaves, and inter-row\
    \ bare soil/cover crop. A further challenge can arise for some crops,\nsuch as\
    \ grapevine, due to overlapping of adjacent plants.\nThe canopy data from orthomosaic\
    \ has been extracted using either a pixel-based or an object-based\napproach.\
    \ Earlier studies manually sampled from the centre of crop row which most likely\
    \ eliminated\nthe mixed pixels [182]. In the pixel-based approach, techniques,\
    \ such as applying global threshold\nand masking, have been used. Binary masks,\
    \ such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from\nthe sampling [82,84]. Combining\
    \ the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can exclude the\npixels associated\
    \ with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that does not meet the height threshold.\n\
    The pixel-based approach, however, can result in inaccurate identiﬁcation of some\
    \ crops due to pixel\nheterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop\
    \ pattern variability.\nIn the object-based approach, using object detection techniques,\
    \ neighbouring pixels with\nhomogenous information, such as spectral, textural,\
    \ structural, and hierarchical features, are grouped\ninto “objects”. These objects\
    \ are used as the basis of object-based image analysis (OBIA) classiﬁcation\n\
    using classiﬁers, such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine,\
    \ random forest,\nand maximum likelihood [122,183–185]. In the horticultural environment,\
    \ OBIA has been adopted\nto classify and sample from pure canopy pixels [119,122,186].\
    \ Consideration should be provided on\nthe number of features and their suitability\
    \ for a speciﬁc application to reduce the computational\nburden, as well as to\
    \ maintain the accuracies. The generalisation of these algorithms for transferability\n\
    between study sites usually penalises the achievable accuracy. For details in\
    \ object-based approach of\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation, readers are directed\
    \ to literatures [122,183,185,187–189].\nOther techniques found in the literature\
    \ include algorithms, such as ‘Watershed’, which has been\ndemonstrated in palm\
    \ orchards [82,190]. Vine rows and plants have been isolated and classiﬁed using\n\
    image processing techniques, such as clustering and skeletisation [188,191–193].\
    \ Similarly, the gridded\npolygon, available in common GIS software, such as ArcGIS\
    \ and QGIS, can be used in combination\nwith zonal statistics for this purpose.\
    \ When working with the low-resolution images, co-registration\nwith the high-resolution\
    \ images has been proposed, whereby, the high-resolution images enable better\n\
    delineation of the mixed pixels [194]. For this reason, spectral and thermal sensors,\

    \ digital cameras.\n4.4. Indicators of Crop Water Status\nA crop’s biophysical\
    \ and biochemical attributes can be approximated using diﬀerent indices and\n\
    quantitative products. For example, CWSI is used to proxy leaf water potential\
    \ (Ψleaf), stem water\npotential (Ψstem), gs, and net photosynthesis (Pn) [83,100,195].\
    \ With regard to horticultural crops, water\nstatus has been assessed using a\
    \ number of spectral and thermal indices (Table 2).\nTable 2. Commonly used vegetation\

    A plant maintains its temperature by transpiring through the stomata to balance\
    \ the energy\nﬂuxes in and out of the canopy. As the plant experience stress (both\
    \ biotic and abiotic), the rate of\ntranspiration decreases, which results in\
    \ higher canopy temperature (Tc), which can be a proxy to\nunderstand the water\
    \ stress in the plant [207]. In this regard, crop water stress showed a correlation\n\
    with canopy temperature extracted from the thermal image [208], which enables\
    \ mapping the spatial\nvariability in water status [209]. Leaf/canopy temperature\
    \ alone, however, does not provide a complete\ncharacterisation of crop water\
    \ status, for instance, an equally stressed canopy can be 25 ◦C or 35 ◦C,\ndepending\
    \ on the current ambient temperature (Ta). Thus, canopy-to-air temperature diﬀerence\n\
    (Tc − Ta) was proposed, which showed a good correlation with the Ψstem, Ψleaf,\
    \ and gs in horticultural\ncrops [85,99,182].\n4.4.2. Normalised Thermal Indices\n\
    The CWSI, the conductance index (Ig) and the stomatal conductance index (I3) are\
    \ thermal\nindices most commonly used to estimate crop water status and gs [210–212].\
    \ These indices provide\nsimilar information, however, use a diﬀerent range of\
    \ numbers to represent the level of water stress.\nThe CWSI is normalised within\
    \ zero and one, whereas Ig and I3 represent stress using numbers\nbetween zero\
    \ and inﬁnity. CWSI has been adopted most widely in horticultural applications\
    \ to\nassess the water status of crops, such as the grapevines [100,213], almond\
    \ [91,198], citrus [85,110], and\nothers [18,87,99,214]. By normalising between\
    \ the lower and upper limits of (Tc − Ta), the CWSI of the\ncanopy presents quantiﬁable\
    \ relative water stress. The formula for CWSI computation is deﬁned as in\nEquation\
    \ (1) [208,212].\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n\
    (1)\nwhere (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL represent the upper and lower bound of\
    \ (Tc − Ta) which are found in\nthe water-stressed canopy and well-watered canopy\
    \ transpiring at the full potential (or maximum) rate,\nrespectively. Assuming\
    \ a constant ambient temperature, Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed to Equation (2),\n\
    which is the most widely reported formulation of CWSI with regard to the horticultural\
    \ remote sensing.\nCWSI = (Tc − Twet)\n\x10\nTdry − Twet\n\x11\n(2)\nwhere Twet\
    \ is the temperature of canopy transpiring at the maximum potential, and Tdry\
    \ is the\ntemperature of the non-transpiring canopy. CWSI has been shown to be\
    \ well-correlated with direct\nmeasurements of crop water status in the horticultural\
    \ environment [18,31,32,90,99]. In this regard,\na correlation of CWSI with various\
    \ ground measurements, such as Ψleaf [18,31,197], Ψstem [33,90,194],\nand gs [18,90,100],\
    \ have been established. Diurnal measurements of CWSI compared with Ψleaf showed\n\
    the best correlation at noon [89,197,209].\nCWSI is a normalised index, i.e.,\
    \ relative to a reference temperature range between Twet and Tdry,\nwhich is speciﬁc\
    \ to a region and crop type; thus, CWSI is not a universal quantitative indicator\
    \ of crop\nwater status. For instance, a CWSI of 0.5 for two diﬀerent varieties\
    \ of grapevines at diﬀerent locations\ndoes not conclusively inform that they\
    \ have equal or superior/inferior water status. Furthermore,\nthe degree of correlation\
    \ can change depending on the isohydric/anisohydric response of crop [214]\nwhere\
    \ early/late stomatal closure aﬀects the indicators of water stress [110]. Moreover,\
    \ phenological\nstage aﬀects the relationship between remotely sensed CWSI and\
    \ water stress [197]. Thus, water stress\nin a diﬀerent crop, at a diﬀerent location\
    \ and at a diﬀerent phenological stage, will have a unique\ncorrelation with CWSI\
    \ and, therefore, needs to be established independently.\nThere are multiple methods\
    \ to measure the two reference temperatures, Twet and Tdry, which\ncould result\
    \ in variable CWSI values depending on the method used. The ﬁrst method is to\
    \ measure the\ntwo reference temperatures on the crop of interest. Tdry can be\
    \ estimated by inducing stomatal closure,\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n14 of 35\n\
    which is the leaf temperature approximately 30 min after applying a layer of petroleum\
    \ jelly e.g.,\nVaseline to both sides of a leaf. This eﬀectively blocks stomata\
    \ and, therefore, impedes leaf transpiration.\nTwet can be estimated by measuring\
    \ leaf temperature approximately 30 s after spraying water on the\nleaf, which\
    \ emulates maximum transpiration [23,83]. The advantage of this method is that\
    \ the stress\nlevels are normalised to actual plants response, whereas the necessity\
    \ to repeat the measurement for\nevery test site after each ﬂight can be cumbersome.\
    \ In an alternative (second) approach the range can\nbe established based on meteorological\
    \ data e.g., setting Tdry to 5 ◦C above air temperature and Twet\nmeasured from\
    \ an artiﬁcial surface. This method is also limited to local scale and presents\
    \ a problem\nregarding the choice of material, which ideally needs to have similar\
    \ to leaf emissivity, aerodynamic\nand optical properties [54,87]. The third method\
    \ uses the actual temperature measurement range\nof the remote sensing image [33,97].\
    \ This method is simple to implement, however, works on the\nassumption that the\
    \ ﬁeld contains enough variability to contain a representative Twet and Tdry.\
    \ Fourth,\nthe reference temperatures can be estimated by theoretically solving\
    \ for the leaf surface energy balance\nequations, however, are limited by the\
    \ necessity to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance [87].\nStandard and robust\
    \ Twet and Tdry measurements are needed to characterize CWSI with accuracy,\n\
    especially for temporal analysis [85,87,211]. The level of uncertainty due to\
    \ the adaptation of diﬀerent\napproaches for Twet and Tdry determination in the\
    \ instantaneous and seasonal measurements of CWSI\nis not known. Nonetheless,\
    \ adopting a consistent approach, CWSI has been shown to be suitable for\nmonitoring\
    \ the water status and making irrigation decisions of horticultural crops [31,85].\n\
    4.4.3. Spectral Indices\nCrops reﬂectance properties convey information about\
    \ the crop, for instance, a healthier crop has\nhigher reﬂectance in the NIR band.\
    \ Most often, the bands are mathematically combined to form VIs,\nwhich provide\
    \ information on the crop’s health, growth stage, biophysical properties, leaf\
    \ biochemistry,\nand water stress [29,215–218]. Using multispectral or hyperspectral\
    \ data, several Vis, such as green\nnormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI),\
    \ renormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI),\noptimized soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI),\
    \ and TCARI/OSAVI, amongst others [34,79,82], can be calculated that correlate\
    \ with the\nwater stress of horticultural crops (see Table 2). The most widely\
    \ studied VI in horticulture, in this\nregard, is the NDVI (Equation (3)).\nNDVI\
    \ = Rnir − Rr\nRnir + Rr\n(3)\nwhere Rnir and Rr represent the spectral reﬂectance\
    \ acquired at the NIR and red spectral regions,\nrespectively. In horticulture,\
    \ NDVI has been used as a proxy to estimate the vigour, biomass, and water\nstatus\
    \ of the crop. A vigorous canopy with more leaves regulates more water, therefore\
    \ remaining\ncooler when irrigated [200] and experiencing early water stress when\
    \ unirrigated. With regard to\nirrigation, the broadband normalised spectral indices\
    \ (such as NDVI) are suitable to detect spatial\nvariability and to identify the\
    \ area that is most vulnerable to water stress. However, these indices are\nnot\
    \ expected to change rapidly to reﬂect the instantaneous water status of plants\
    \ that are needed to\nmake decisions on irrigation scheduling.\nThe multispectral\
    \ indices along with complementary information in thermal wavelengths have\nproven\
    \ to be well suited to monitoring vegetation, speciﬁcally in relation to water\
    \ stress [219]. The ratio\nof canopy surface temperature to NDVI, deﬁned as temperature-vegetation\
    \ dryness index (TVDI),\nwas found to be useful for the study of water status\
    \ in horticultural crops. TVDI exploits the fact that\nvegetation with larger\
    \ NDVI will have a lower surface temperature unless the vegetation is under\n\
    stress. As most vegetation normally remains green after an initial bout of water\
    \ stress, the TVDI is\nmore suited than NDVI for early detection of water stress\
    \ as the surface temperature can rise rapidly\neven during initial water stress\
    \ [200].\nSimilarly, narrowband VIs that have been studied in relation to remote\
    \ sensing of water status are\nPRI and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, which have been\
    \ directly correlated to the crop Ψleaf, gs [110,182,204].\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140\n15 of 35\nSeveral hyperspectral indices to estimate water status have been\
    \ identiﬁed [139]; however, their\napplication in remote sensing of horticultural\
    \ crops is at its infancy. Hyperspectral indices speciﬁc to\nwater absorption\
    \ bands around 900 nm, 1200 nm, 1400 nm, and 1900 nm may be used to detect the\n\
    water status of horticultural crops. The absorption features were found to be\
    \ highly correlated with\nplant water status [139]. Water band index (WBI), as\
    \ deﬁned in Equation (4), has been shown to closely\ntrack the changes in the\
    \ plant water status of various crops [202,203].\nWBI = R970\nR900\n(4)\nOther\
    \ water-related hyperspectral indices with potential application for horticultural\
    \ crops can\nbe found in the literature [139,202,203]. Hyperspectral data possess\
    \ the capability to reﬂect the\ninstantaneous water status of the plant, which\
    \ can be useful for quantitative decision-making on\nirrigation scheduling.\n\
    4.4.4. Soil Moisture\nThe moisture status of the soil provides an indication of\
    \ the available water resource to the crop.\nSoil moisture is traditionally measured\
    \ indirectly using soil moisture sensors placed below the surface\nof the soil.\
    \ A key challenge with using soil moisture sensors are the spatial distribution\
    \ of moisture,\nboth vertically and horizontally, to account for inherent ﬁeld-scale\
    \ variability. For instance, the root\nsystem of some horticultural crops, such\
    \ as grapevine, is capable of accessing water up to 30 m deep,\nwhile customer-grade\
    \ soil moisture probes generally extend to 1.5 m in depth or less. Thus, soil\n\
    moisture probes do not capture all the water available to the crop as they are\
    \ point measures and\nnot necessarily where the roots are located. Moreover, estimation\
    \ of soil moisture across spatial and\ntemporal scales is of interest for various\
    \ agricultural and hydrological studies. Optical, thermal, and\nmicrowave remote\
    \ sensing with their advantages relating to high spatial scale and temporal resolutions\n\
    could potentially be used for soil moisture estimation [220–222]. L-band microwave\
    \ radiometry,\na component of synthetic aperture radar systems, has been shown\
    \ to be a reliable approach to estimate\nsoil moisture via satellite-based remote\
    \ sensing [223], such as using the ESA’s Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS)\
    \ [224] and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites [225,226].\n\
    The limitation of the SMOS and SMAP missions, with regard to horticultural application,\
    \ is their\ndepth of retrieval (up to 5 cm) and spatial resolution (in the order\
    \ of tens of kilometre) [227–229].\nAs an airborne application, the volumetric\
    \ soil moisture has been estimated by analysing the SNR of\nthe GNSS interference\
    \ signal [230,231]. With aforementioned capabilities, a combination of satellite\n\
    and airborne remote sensing may, in the future, be a reliable tool to map soil\
    \ moisture across spatial,\ntemporal and depth scales.\n4.4.5. Physiological Attributes\n\
    Using the SfM on remotely-sensed images, 3D canopy structure, terrain conﬁgurations,\
    \ and canopy\nsurface models can be derived [113,114,119,186,232]. By employing\
    \ a delineation algorithm on the 3D\nmodels, the 3D attributes of the crops and\
    \ macrostructure are determined more accurately [120,122,233].\nCrop surface area\
    \ and terrain conﬁguration (e.g., slope and aspect) may help to develop an optimal\n\
    resource management strategy. For example, crops located at a higher elevation\
    \ within an irrigation\nzone may experience a level of water stress due to the\
    \ gravitational ﬂow of irrigated water.\nUsing the structural measurements, such\
    \ as the canopy height, canopy size, the envelope of each\nrow, LAI, and porosity,\
    \ among others, the water demand of the crop may be estimated. Generally,\nlarger\
    \ canopies tend to require more water than smaller canopies with less leaf area\
    \ [116,157]. Using\nthe temporal measurement of the plant’s 3D attributes, the\
    \ vigour can be computed. Monitoring\ncrop vigour over the season and over subsequent\
    \ years can provide an indication of its health and\nperformance, e.g., yield,\
    \ within an irrigation zone. Canopy structure metrics are closely related to\n\
    horticultural tree growth and provide strong indicators of water consumption,\
    \ whereby canopy size\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n16 of 35\ncan be used to determine\
    \ its water requirements [234]. Other 3D attributes, such as the crown perimeter,\n\
    width, height, area, and leaf density, have been shown to enable improved pruning\
    \ of horticultural\nplants [116,119].\nLAI can be estimated using the 3D attributes\
    \ obtained from remote sensing [114,157,201], whereby,\nhigher LAI is equivalent\
    \ to more leaf layers, implying greater total leaf area and, consequently, canopy\n\
    transpiration. Leaf density, LAI, and exposed leaf area of a crop drive its water\
    \ requirement and\nproductivity [235–237]. Knowledge of ﬁeld attributes, such\
    \ as row and plant spacing, may assist in\ninter-row surface energy balance to\
    \ determine the irrigation need of the plant [238]. Combining the\nstructural\
    \ properties with spectral VIs provide an estimation of biomass [239], which can\
    \ serve as\nanother indicator of the plant’s water requirements. Although physiological\
    \ attributes have been used\nto understand plant water status and its spatial\
    \ variability, they have not been directly applied to make\nquantitative decisions\
    \ on irrigation.\n4.4.6. Evapotranspiration\nThe estimation of ET via remote sensing,\
    \ numerical modelling, and empirical methods have been\nextensively studied and\
    \ reviewed in the literature [240–247]. These models are based on either surface\n\
    energy balance (SEB), Penman-Monteith (PM), Maximum entropy production (MEP),\
    \ water balance,\nwater-carbon linkage, or empirical relationships.\nSEB models\
    \ are based on a surface energy budget in which the latent heat ﬂux is estimated\
    \ as a\nresidual of the net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, and sensible heat ﬂux. The\
    \ models are either one-source\n(canopy and soil treated as a single surface for\
    \ the estimation of sensible heat ﬂux) or two-source\n(canopy and soil surfaces\
    \ treated separately). Improvements over the original one-source SEB models\n\
    were in the form of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm\
    \ [248,249] and\nMapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized\
    \ Calibration (METRIC) [249,250].\nSEBAL oﬀers a simpliﬁed approach to collect\
    \ ET data at both local and regional scales thereby increasing\nthe spatial scope,\
    \ while METRIC uses the same (SEBAL) technique but auto-calibrates the model using\n\
    hourly ground-based reference ET (ETr) data [251]. As such, these and other (e.g.,\
    \ MEP) models rely\non accurate measurements of surface (e.g., canopy) and air\
    \ temperatures, which can be erroneous\nunder non-ideal conditions, e.g., cloudy\
    \ days. There is also a reliance on ground-based sensors to\ncapture ambient air\
    \ temperatures required by the model.\nAmong the existing methods, FAO’s PM is\
    \ the most widely adopted model to estimate reference\nET (ETref or ET0) [252].\
    \ The PM method uses incident and reﬂected solar radiation, emitted thermal\n\
    radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and vapour pressure to calculate ET0 [253].\
    \ Remote sensing\nprovides a cost-eﬀective method to estimate the ET0 at regional\
    \ to global scales [241] by estimating\nreﬂected solar and emitted thermal radiation.\
    \ One of the advantages of using the PM approach is\nthat it is parametrised using\
    \ micrometeorological data easily obtained from ground-based automatic\nweather\
    \ stations. However, PM suﬀers from the drawback that canopy transpiration is\
    \ not dynamic\nas inﬂuenced by soil moisture availability via stomatal regulation\
    \ [241]. From a practical standpoint,\nPM-derived ET0 estimates are used in conjunction\
    \ with crop factors or crop coeﬃcients (kc), which are\nclosely related to the\
    \ light interception of the canopy [254].\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is deﬁned\
    \ as the product of kc and ET0. In the absence of accurate\nETc measurements,\
    \ kc is an easy and practical means of getting reliable estimates of ETc using\
    \ ET0 [255].\nIn this regard, studies have focused on the use of remote sensing\
    \ to study spatial variability in kc and\nETc [101,256–258]. Thermal and NIR imagery\
    \ can be used to compute kc and ETc as transpiration\nrate is closely related\
    \ to canopy temperature [259–261] and kc has been shown to correlate with\ncanopy\
    \ reﬂectance [101,255]. Various thermal indices, such as CWSI, canopy temperature\
    \ ratio, canopy\ntemperature above non-stressed, and canopy temperature above\
    \ canopy threshold, can be used to\nestimate ETc, where CWSI- based ETc was found\
    \ to be the most accurate [24].\nET at a larger scale is typically estimated based\
    \ on satellite remote sensing. The temporal resolution\nof satellites is, however,\
    \ low and inadequate for horticultural applications, such as irrigation scheduling\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n17 of 35\n(e.g., Landsat has a 16-day revisit cycle).\
    \ In contrast, high temporal resolution satellites are coarse in\nspatial resolution\
    \ for ﬁeld-scale observations [25]. The daily or even instantaneous estimation\
    \ of ETc at\nthe ﬁeld scale is crucial for irrigation scheduling and is expected\
    \ to have great application prospects\nin the future [240,259,262,263]. In this\
    \ regard, the future direction of satellite-based ET estimates\nmay focus on temporal\
    \ downscaling either by extrapolation of instantaneous measurement [264],\ninterpolation\
    \ between two successive observations [201], data fusion of multiple satellites\
    \ [25,260], and\nspatial downscaling using multiple satellites [265–268]. An example\
    \ of early satellite-based remote\nsensing for ET is the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration\
    \ Project (MOD16), which was established in\n1999 to provide daily estimates of\
    \ global terrestrial evapotranspiration using data acquired from a\npair of NASA\
    \ satellites in conjunction with Algorithm Theoretical Based Documents (ATBDs)\
    \ [269].\nThese estimates correlated well with ground-based eddy covariance ﬂux\
    \ tower estimates of ET despite\ndiﬀerences in the uncertainties associated with\
    \ each of these techniques.\nUASs are being increasingly utilised to acquire multi-spectral\
    \ and thermal imagery to compute\nET at an unprecedented spatial resolution [270,271].\
    \ Using high-resolution images, ﬁltering the\nshadowed-pixel is possible, which\
    \ showed signiﬁcant improvement in the estimation of ET in\ngrapevine [101]. Using\
    \ high-resolution thermal and/or multispectral imagery, ET has been derived for\n\
    horticultural crops, such as grapevines [270] and olives [271]. The seasonal monitoring\
    \ of ETc at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions is of high importance for precision\
    \ irrigation of horticultural crops in\nthe future [259].\n5. Case Studies on\
    \ the Use of Remote Sensing for Crop Water Stress Detection\nThe increasing prevalence\
    \ of UAS along with low-cost camera systems has brought about much\ninterest in\
    \ the characterisation of crop water status/stress during the growing season to\
    \ inform orchard\nor farm management decisions, in particular, irrigation scheduling\
    \ [272,273]. Traditional methodologies\nto assess crop water stress are constrained\
    \ by limitations relating to large farm sizes and accompanying\nspatial variability,\
    \ high labour costs to collect data, and access to instrumentation that is both\
    \ inexpensive\nand portable [272]. The beneﬁts of precision agriculture [274],\
    \ including through precision irrigation\npractices [1], result in higher production\
    \ eﬃciencies and economic returns through site-speciﬁc crop\nmanagement [275,276].\
    \ This approach has motivated the use of high-resolution imagery acquired\nfrom\
    \ remote sensing to identify irrigation zones [99,277]. The ﬁrst horticultural\
    \ applications of UAS\nplatforms for crop water status measurement were in orange\
    \ and peach orchards where both thermal\nand multispectral-derived VIs, speciﬁcally\
    \ the PRI, were shown to be well-correlated to crop water\nstatus [102]. Here,\
    \ we explore the use of remote sensing and accompanying image acquisition platforms\n\
    to characterise the spatial and temporal patterns of the water status of two economically\
    \ important\nhorticultural crops, grapevine and almond.\n5.1. Grapevine (Vitis\
    \ spp.)\nThe characterisation of spatial variability in vine water status in a\
    \ vineyard provides valuable\nguidance on irrigation scheduling decisions [82],\
    \ and this spatial variability can be eﬃciently\ncharacterised by the use of remote\
    \ sensing platforms [29]. The ﬁrst use of remote sensing in vineyards\nfor crop\
    \ water stress detection was using manned aircraft ﬂown over an irrigated vineyard\
    \ in Hanwood\n(NSW) Australia where CWSI was mapped at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 10 cm [278]. Subsequently, UAS\nplatforms began to be used in vineyards for\
    \ vine water stress characterisation. Early work in this\ncrop used a fuel-based\
    \ helicopter with a 29 cc engine and equipped with thermal (Thermovision\nA40M)\
    \ and multispectral (Tetracam MCA-6) camera systems [102]. The study observed\
    \ strong (inverse)\nrelationships between (Tc − Ta) and gs. A related study showed\
    \ strong correlations between thermal\nand multispectral VIs, and traditional,\
    \ ground-based measures of water status, such as Ψleaf and\ngs [182]. In this\
    \ study, normalised PRI was shown to have correlation coeﬃcients exceeding 0.8\
    \ versus\nboth Ψleaf and gs, indicating that remotely-sensed VIs can be reliable\
    \ indicators of vine water status.\nThermal indices, such as (Tc − Ta) and CWSI,\
    \ were also well-correlated to Ψleaf and gs at speciﬁc times of\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 140\n18 of 35\nthe day. The use of thermal indices, such as CWSI or Ig,\
    \ requires reference temperatures (Twet, Tdry) or\nnon-water stressed baselines\
    \ (NWSB) [279]. Due to the diﬃculty of obtaining reference temperatures or\nNWSB\
    \ using remote sensing, some authors have used the minimum temperature found from\
    \ all canopy\npixels as Twet [199], and Ta + 5 ◦C as Tdry [213,280]. NWSB is typically\
    \ obtained from well-watered\ncanopies, measuring (Tc − Ta) under a range of vapour\
    \ pressure deﬁcit conditions [279]. Thermal water\nstress indices have also shown\
    \ to be useful to distinguish between water use strategies of diﬀerent\ngrapevine\
    \ cultivars [83,281], which is useful for customising irrigation scheduling based\
    \ on the speciﬁc\nwater needs of a given cultivar. More recently, studies have\
    \ used UAS-based multispectral-based\nVIs to train an artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) models to predict spatial patterns of Ψstem [84,282].\nUsing UAS-based\
    \ multispectral data, the authors showed that ANN estimated Ψstem with higher\n\
    accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.15 MPa) as compared to the conventional multispectral\
    \ indices based\nestimation (RMSE over 0.32 MPa).\n5.2. Almond (Prunus Dulcis)\n\
    Almonds are perennial nut trees grown in semi-arid climates and are reliant on\
    \ irrigation\napplications. Their water requirements are relatively high, with\
    \ seasonal ETc exceeding 1000 mm [283].\nThe requirement for prudent irrigation\
    \ management in the face of decreased water availability is\ncritical for maintaining\
    \ tree productivity, yield, and nut quality [284]. Towards this goal, UAS-based\n\
    remote sensing has been used to characterise the spatial patterns of tree water\
    \ status in almond\norchards. A UAS-based thermal camera was used to acquire tree\
    \ the crown temperature data from\na California almond orchard; this temperature\
    \ was used to determine the temperature diﬀerence\nbetween crown and air (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and compared to shaded leaf water potential (Ψsl) [92]. The study\nfound\
    \ a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.72) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψsl. The same\
    \ authors conducted\na follow on study in Spain on several fruit tree species\
    \ including almond. The negative relationship\n(slope and oﬀset) between (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and Ψstem was observed to vary based on the time of observation;\nmorning\
    \ measurements had weak relationships, whereas afternoon measurements had stronger\n\
    relationships [99]. Their proposed methodology allowed for the spatial characterisation\
    \ of orchard\nwater status on a single-tree basis, demonstrating the utility of\
    \ UAS-based crop water stress data.\nBeyond the characterisation of crop water\
    \ stress for irrigation scheduling, there is an opportunity to\nuse this data\
    \ to quantify the economic impact at a spatial level.\n6. Future Prospective and\
    \ Gaps in the Knowledge\nPrecision irrigation is a promising approach to increase\
    \ farm water use eﬃciency for sustainable\nproduction, including for horticultural\
    \ crops [3,5,9,10,274,285]. It is envisioned that the future of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ will incorporate UAS, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing platforms\n\
    alongside ground-based proximal sensors coupled with wireless sensor networks.\
    \ The automation\nof UAS technology will continue to develop further to a point\
    \ that even novice users can adopt\nthe technology with ease. It is also expected\
    \ that the data processing pipeline of remote sensing\nimages will become automated\
    \ to be ‘ﬁt for purpose’ for crop water status measurements. The ideal\nsolution\
    \ may lie in the use of satellites (or sometimes manned aircraft) for regional\
    \ estimation and\nplanning [55,260], UAS for seasonal monitoring and zoning [32,100,197,286],\
    \ proximal sensors for\ncontinuous measurement [287], and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to derive decision-ready products [84,282]\nthat can be used for making irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [31,288–295]. Continued technological\ndevelopments in\
    \ this space will enable growers to acquire actionable data with ease, and eventually\n\
    transition towards semi-automated or fully-automated irrigation applications.\n\
    Remote sensing and current irrigation application technologies are limited in\
    \ temporal and\nspatial resolution, respectively. Although UAS technology can\
    \ deliver sub-plant level spatially explicit\ninformation of water status, the\
    \ size of the management block is much coarser, typically over 10 m.\nHence, further\
    \ improvements in variable rate application technologies, e.g., boom sprayers,\
    \ or zoned\ndrip irrigation, are required to fully exploit high-resolution UAS\
    \ measurements. Nonetheless, the\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n19 of 35\nrequired resolution\
    \ of remote sensing should be guided by the underlying spatial variability of\
    \ the crop.\nFor ﬁelds with relatively lower spatial variability, low/medium-resolution\
    \ remote sensing imagery\nmay suﬃce for crop water status assessment [278,296,297].\n\
    Remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of plant water status using the regression-based\n\
    approach through several calculated reﬂectance indices. In comparison, physical\
    \ and mechanistic\nmodels, e.g., radiative transfer models and energy balance\
    \ models, incorporate both direct and indirect\nmeasures of the canopy, therefore\
    \ establishing a basis for diﬀerences in plant water status. Using a\nsimilar\
    \ approach, predictions of crop water status using regression-based remote sensing\
    \ models can\nbe improved by incorporating some direct auxiliary variables.\n\
    Further developments in thermal remote sensing are also expected, speciﬁcally,\
    \ the advent of new\nthermal and hybrid thermal-multispectral water status/stress\
    \ indices that are more sensitive to canopy\ntranspiration. The most widely-adopted\
    \ thermal index, CWSI, is an instantaneous measure that is\nnormalised to local\
    \ weather conditions and inﬂuenced by genotype and phenotype. For example,\nthe\
    \ relationship between CWSI and crop water status is inﬂuenced by environmental\
    \ conditions\n(e.g., high incident radiation and low humidity vs low incident\
    \ radiation and high humidity) and\nphenological stage [197,214,298]. As a result,\
    \ corresponding ground-based measurements are required\nfor each temporal remote\
    \ measurement to determine the correlation with water status. Hence, temporal\n\
    assessments of water status using thermal cameras will require the incorporation\
    \ of meteorological\ndata along with the thermal response using novel indices.\n\
    In the area of satellite remote sensing, we foresee further developments on temporal\
    \ downscaling\nto achieve daily measurements. A higher temporal resolution may\
    \ be achieved by fusion of multiple\nsatellite observations, such as freely available\
    \ Landsat and Sentinel. Further reductions of temporal\nresolution will require\
    \ interpolation between two successive observations. Furthermore, temporal\nmodels\
    \ of water status could be developed to assist the interpolation to eventually\
    \ satisfy the\nrequirements for irrigation scheduling [25,201,263]. The continued\
    \ advancement and greater availability\nof Nanosat/Cubesat may provide an alternate\
    \ method to capture high-resolution data at a higher\na greater temporal resolution,\
    \ which can be suitable to study the water status of horticultural\ncrops [299–301].\n\
    Crop water status is a complex phenomenon, which can be interpreted with respect\
    \ to a\nnumber of variables. These variables can include spectral response, thermal\
    \ response, meteorological\ndata, 3D attributes of the canopy, and macrostructure\
    \ of the block (farm).\nClearly, there is\nan opportunity for a multi-disciplinary\
    \ approach, potentially incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques which\
    \ incorporate the aforementioned variables to provide a robust estimation of crop\n\
    water status [84,141,282,302,303]. Furthermore, with machine learning algorithms,\
    \ hyperspectral\nremote sensing will provide a wealth of data to estimate crop\
    \ water status. A quantitative product,\nsuch as SIF, derived from hyperspectral\
    \ data will have the potential for direct quantiﬁcation of water\nstress [204,205,304].\
    \ In this regard, the upcoming FLEX satellite mission [305,306] and recent advances\n\
    in aerial spectroradiometry [109,132,137,307–310] dedicated for observation of\
    \ SIF may be unique and\npowerful tools for high-value horticultural crops.\n\
    Multi-temporal images represent an excellent resource for seasonal monitoring\
    \ of changes in crop\nwater status. Five to six temporal points of data acquisition\
    \ at critical phenological stages of crop\ndevelopment have been recommended for\
    \ irrigation scheduling [31,32]. However, for semi-arid or arid\nregions, irrigation\
    \ is typically required multiple times per week. Acquisition and post-processing\
    \ of\nremote sensing data for actionable products multiple times a week is currently\
    \ logistically unfeasible.\nThe fusion of UAS-based remote sensing data, continuous\
    \ ground-based proximal or direct sensors,\nincluding weather station data, can\
    \ potentially inform daily estimates of water status at canopy level.\nThis approach\
    \ will require predictive models, such as those based on machine learning algorithms,\
    \ to\nestimate the current and future water status of the crop. Eventually, growers\
    \ would beneﬁt from the\nknowledge of crop water requirements for the determination\
    \ of seasonal irrigation requirements to\nsustainably farm into the future.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n20 of 35\nOne vision for the future of precision irrigation\
    \ is in automated pipelines to explicitly manage\nirrigation water at the sub-block\
    \ level. This automated pipeline would likely include remote and\nproximal data\
    \ acquisition and processing, prediction and interpretation of crop water status\
    \ and\nrequirements, and subsequently, control of irrigation systems. Recent rapid\
    \ developments in cloud\ncomputing and wireless technology could assist in the\
    \ quasi-real-time processing of the remote sensing\ndata soon after acquisition\
    \ [311–313]. Eventually, automation and computational power will merge to\ndevelop\
    \ smart technology in which artiﬁcial intelligence uses real-time data analysis\
    \ for diagnosis\nand decision-making. Growers of the future will be able to take\
    \ advantage of precise irrigation\nrecommendations using information sourced from\
    \ a ﬂeet of UAS that map large farm blocks on a daily\nschedule, continuous ground-based\
    \ proximal and direct sensors, and weather stations. This data can be\nstored\
    \ on and accessed from the cloud almost instantaneously, used in conjunction with\
    \ post-processing\nalgorithms for decision-making on optimised irrigation applications\
    \ [311,314].\n7. Conclusions\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the\
    \ use of remote sensing to determine the water\nstatus of horticultural crops.\
    \ One of our objectives was to survey the range of remote sensing tools\navailable\
    \ for irrigation decision-making. Earth observation satellite systems possess\
    \ the required bands\nto study the water status of vegetation and soil. Satellites\
    \ are more suitable for scouting, planning,\nand management of irrigation applications\
    \ that involve large areas, and where data acquisition is\nnot time-constrained.\
    \ Manned aircraft are sparingly used in horticultural applications due to the\n\
    cost, logistics, and speciﬁc expertise needed for the operation of the platform.\
    \ UAS-based remote\nsensing provides ﬂexibility in spatial resolution (crop level\
    \ observation achievable), coverage (over\n25 ha achievable in a single ﬂight),\
    \ spectral bands, as well as temporal revisit. Routine monitoring of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops for water status characterisation is, therefore, best performed using\
    \ a UAS platform.\nWe envision a future for precision irrigation where satellites\
    \ are used for planning, and UAS used in\nconjunction with a network of ground-based\
    \ sensors to achieve actionable products on a timely basis.\nThe plant’s instantaneous\
    \ response to water stress can be captured using thermal cameras (via\nindices,\
    \ such as CWSI) and potentially narrow-band hyperspectral sensors (via, for example,\
    \ SIF),\nmaking them suitable to draw quantiﬁable decisions with regard to irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Broadband\nmultispectral and RGB cameras capture the non-instantaneous\
    \ water status of crops, making them\nsuitable for general assessment of crop\
    \ water status. Integrated use of thermal and multispectral\nimagery may be the\
    \ simplest yet eﬀective sensor combinations to capture the overall as well as\n\
    instantaneous water status of the plant. With regard to irrigation scheduling,\
    \ further developments\nare required to establish crop-speciﬁc thresholds of remotely-sensed\
    \ indices to decide when and how\nmuch to irrigate.\nAuthor Contributions: Performed\

  title: A Review of Current and Potential Applications of Remote Sensing to Study
    the Water Status of Horticultural Crops
  verbatim_quote1: '**Irrigation Management Data**

    Water status of crops is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including
    the physiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the
    crop, and meteorological factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor
    platform is used to acquire measurements of the different aspects of the crop
    for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common combination of sensors
    found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR bands)
    and thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status
    of the crop using various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural
    properties, with the aim of improving the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160].'
  verbatim_quote2: The canopy data from orthomosaic has been extracted using either
    a pixel-based or an object-based approach. Earlier studies manually sampled from
    the centre of crop row which most likely eliminated the mixed pixels [182]. In
    the pixel-based approach, techniques, such as applying global threshold and masking,
    have been used. Binary masks, such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from
    the sampling [82,84]. Combining the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can
    exclude the pixels associated with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that
    does not meet the height threshold.

    Get rights and content Abstract In the Mediterranean arc, vines for wine production
    are mainly grown without the support of irrigation. Under such conditions, site
    variables affecting the extent and seasonal timing of water deficits are the dominant
    environmental constraints for grape production. Moreover, water availability and
    vine water status are the factors most comprehensively determining fruit composition
    and, thus, wine quality. Therefore, monitoring the extent of water stress in vines
    might be a valuable tool for the optimisation of grape yield and quality. The
    objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the reflectance
    based Water Index (WI) to estimate vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels.
    The study was conducted on Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay potted plants submitted
    to contrasting water availability and in ten commercial vineyards in the D.O.
    Penedès region (Catalonia, Spain) over two consecutive years (2007–2008). In potted
    plants, differences in water supply were translated into differences in net photosynthetic
    carbon assimilation, stomatal conductance (gs) and WI, despite similar predawn
    water potentials (Ψp). There was a negative close correlation between WI and gs,
    although the relationship was treatment dependent (r2 = 0.81 and r2 = 0.95, for
    control and deficit plants, respectively). Similarly the leaf to air temperature
    difference was inversely related to gs (r2 = 0.51). In the field study there were
    significant differences in Ψp among vineyards and between years and indicated
    that vines experienced moderate to severe water stress. Water availability determined
    vine canopy development as indicated by the close relationship between the Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index and in Ψp (r2 = 0.57). The canopy to air temperature
    difference (determined with an infrared thermometer at midday) was inversely correlated
    with WI with r2 = 0.45 and r2 = 0.56 in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Thus, the
    reflectance based Water Index effectively tracked variation in both leaf stomatal
    conductance and canopy transpiration under a range of moderate to severe water
    stress. The results are discussed in relation to the potential application of
    WI to irrigation scheduling and to monitoring vineyard performance. Research highlights
    ▶ Contrasting water supply promotes changes in both stomatal conductance and WI.

    Water is the most limiting resource for crop growth in the Mediterranean region,
    rainfall is scarce and irregularly distributed along the year and climate change
    models predict even more arid conditions in the next decades (Bates et al., 2008,
    Jones et al., 2005, Schultz and Stoll, 2010). In many dry lands of the Mediterranean
    arc, vines for wine production are grown without the support of irrigation. Under
    such conditions, site variables affecting the extent and seasonal timing of water
    deficits are the dominant environmental constraints for grape production (Williams
    and Matthews, 1990). In the last decades, irrigation has been introduced in some
    areas in order to reduce drought impacts on yield. Concurrently, and due to increasing
    water scarcity, many efforts have been devoted to the development of appropriate
    irrigation strategies (e.g. deficit irrigation, partial root drying) that improve
    the productivity of water use while ensuring berry quality (Chaves et al., 2010,
    Cifré et al., 2005, Dry et al., 2001, Medrano et al., 2003). Therefore, monitoring
    the extent of water stress, both under irrigated and rain-fed conditions, might
    be a valuable tool for the optimisation of grape yield and quality. There is ample
    literature on the effects of water deficits on vegetative and reproductive growth
    and yield in grapevines (Chaves et al., 2010, Choné et al., 2001a, Matthews and
    Anderson, 1989, Medrano et al., 2003, Schultz and Matthews, 1988, Van Leeuwen
    and Seguin, 1994). Moreover, it has been recognized that the water supply to the
    vines and their concurrent water status are the factors most comprehensively determining
    berry ripening and composition and, thus, wine quality (Chaves et al., 2010, Choné
    et al., 2001a, Koundouras et al., 2006, Matthews and Anderson, 1988, Medrano et
    al., 2003, Seguin, 1983, Van Leeuwen and Seguin, 1994). In grapevines, as well
    as in other fruit crops, fruit quality benefits from a certain level of water
    deficit which facilitates to balance vegetative and reproductive growth and the
    flow of carbohydrates to reproductive structures. Since this balance relies on
    mechanisms that regulate carbon assimilation and partitioning, physiological indicators
    of grapevine water status has been proposed as better indicators for an effective
    crop management (Chaves et al., 2010, Cifré et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2002).
    Several physiological indicators are used to assess plant water status, or stress,
    with leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and transpiration being the most
    widely used in viticulture. Leaf water potential is a standard indicator of plant
    water status, but predawn and stem water potential are considered better indicators
    in vines (Choné et al., 2001b). Stomatal closure is one of the first responses
    of leaves to reduced soil water availability (Chaves et al., 2010, Flexas et al.,
    2002, Jones et al., 2002, Lovisolo et al., 2010). In grapevines, stomatal regulation
    is a complex phenomenon involving chemical (hormones), hydraulic (cavitation)
    and even electrical signals (Lovisolo et al., 2010). Indeed, grapevines were among
    the first plant species in which a direct role of ABA in stomatal closure was
    reported (Loveys and Kriedemann, 1974, Lovisolo et al., 2002). Grapevine stomata
    also strongly respond to plant water status: positive correlations between predawn
    water potential and gs have been generally found in grapevines subjected to water
    deficits (Correia et al., 1995). In addition, grapevines subjected to severe water
    stress have shown decreased hydraulic conductivity (Lovisolo et al., 2002, Schultz
    and Matthews, 1988) mainly as a result of drought-induced cavitation (Lovisolo
    et al., 2008, Schultz, 2003). Thus, it appears that stomatal conductance might
    be a good indicator of water status in grapevines (Cifré et al., 2005, Jones et
    al., 2002). While a decrease in stomatal conductance is a short term response
    to reduced water availability, reduced vegetative growth occurs under long standing
    water deficits (Chaves et al., 2010). In grapevine, shoot growth has been reported
    to decrease in response to water deficits (Dry and Loveys, 1999, Matthews et al.,
    1987, Pellegrino et al., 2005, Schultz and Matthews, 1988) and, in particular,
    decreases in leaf area and intercepted light have been used as indicators of grapevine
    water status (Pellegrino et al., 2005). Moreover, vineyard leaf area influences
    fruit ripening rate, fruit characteristics and, thus, wine quality (Downey et
    al., 2004, Smart et al., 1982). Therefore, measures of vine canopy structure might
    be used to estimate differences in berry yield and quality brought about by variation
    in water availability. The use of airborne remote sensing as a means of monitoring
    vine canopy characteristics is attracting interest because of opportunities for
    cost-effective generation of spatial data amenable to precision agriculture activities
    (Hall et al., 2002). According to the physiological and growth responses of grapevine
    to water deficits mentioned above, there are currently two types of remote sensing
    approaches that might assist in grapevine water stress detection, one based on
    radiometric surface temperature detection derived from thermal band imagery and
    a second approach that relies on the ability of indices derived from surface reflectance
    data to assess plant water status or their effects on growth. Current remote sensing
    methods in precision viticulture use multispectral airborne sensors to detect
    changes in grapevine canopy vigour through the use of vegetation indices derived
    from reflectance in the red and near-infrared regions of the spectrum (Hall et
    al., 2002, Johnson et al., 2001, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005). In particular, the
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), have proven useful to estimate
    vineyard leaf area index (m2 leaf area per m2 of ground) and leaf area per vine
    (m2 per vine) (Dobrowski et al., 2002, Johnson, 2003). These data, in conjunction
    with spatial determinations of yield, have been used to assist as management support
    for selective harvesting (Hall et al., 2002, Johnson et al., 2001, Lamb et al.,
    2004). Thus, so far, remote sensing techniques have been mainly used to target
    harvesting strategies according to canopy structure (vegetative growth). Reflectance
    indices such as the NDVI or the simple ratio (SR), are useful for characterizing
    canopy structure and pigment concentration, and, thus, potential photosynthetic
    activity, but have proven less useful for monitoring photosynthetic functioning
    under stress conditions (Gamon et al., 1995, Gamon et al., 1997). Thus, these
    indices have proven less useful for monitoring plant physiological status (e.g.
    photosynthesis and/or water status) under stress conditions. Leaf or canopy temperature
    is highly dependent on the rate of transpiration and can therefore be used as
    an indicator of stomatal opening. Several studies have assessed the potential
    of monitoring canopy temperature using thermal infrared radiation to assist in
    crop water stress detection (Berni et al., 2009, Jackson et al., 1981). In vineyards,
    this technique has been widely studied and developed mainly at ground level using
    thermal cameras: Jones et al. (2002) and Grant et al. (2007) have shown reasonable
    estimations of whole canopy gs based on thermometric determinations. At larger
    scales, Möller et al. (2007) have recently showed improved accuracy in estimates
    of vine water status and stomatal conductance by combining thermal and visible
    imagery. Besides the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the near
    and short wave infrared region present several water absorption features that
    might be useful for the detection of plant water status. The longer wavelengths,
    such as the 1450 and 1900 nm water absorption bands, make poor indicators for
    estimating plant water content due to the low incoming solar energy and high levels
    of interference by atmospheric water vapour (Sims and Gamon, 2003). Several studies
    suggest that the ideal wavelengths for predicting water content are wavelengths
    with weak absorption coefficients that allow the radiation to penetrate far into
    canopies, providing a suitable dynamic range (Peñuelas et al., 1993, Serrano et
    al., 2000, Sims and Gamon, 2003). In particular, the Water Index (WI) (Peñuelas
    et al., 1993, Peñuelas et al., 1997) derived from the near infrared water absorption
    band centered at 970 nm (WI = R900/R970) has been tested at the leaf, canopy and
    landscape levels. At the leaf level, the WI was reported to closely track changes
    in leaf water content and gs during drought (Peñuelas et al., 1993, Peñuelas et
    al., 1997). Subsequently, Serrano et al. (2000) and Sims and Gamon (2003) showed
    the usefulness of the WI to track variation in relative water content (RWC) at
    the canopy and landscape scales using airborne sensors. Moreover, recent studies
    have documented good relationships between the WI and water fluxes at the canopy/landscape
    level in Mediterranean vegetation (Claudio et al., 2006, Fuentes et al., 2006).
    The feasibility of the WI to assess water status in grapevines has not yet been
    fully addressed. Cifré et al. (2005) suggested that, because the development of
    the 970 nm signal entails substantial variation in water content (Peñuelas et
    al., 1993), its use for water stress assessment in near-isohydric grapevine cultivars,
    capable of maintaining RWC within narrow ranges, might be not suitable. Indeed,
    in irrigated vineyards, Rodríguez-Pérez et al. (2007) did not find consistent
    relationships between the WI and stem water potential or equivalent water thickness
    (ratio of mass of water to leaf area) at the canopy level. Nonetheless, in the
    Mediterranean arc, rain-fed vineyards usually experience periods of moderate to
    severe water stress and, thus, the use of the WI might be of potential interest.
    Moreover, because the WI has been reported to respond to both changes in water
    content and vegetation structure (Serrano et al., 2000) its use under rain-fed
    conditions might be of potential interest since, as mentioned above, water deficits
    affect both water status and canopy structure (vegetative growth). Thus, we tested
    the ability of the near infrared based WI derived from reflectance spectra to
    determine vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels. The study was conducted
    on potted plants and in commercial vineyards over two consecutive years under
    varying soil water availability. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Leaf level study
    The study was conducted on two-year-old plants Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay
    grafted on R-110. Plants were planted in mid March in 10 L pots with a mixture
    of sand and peat turf (1:1, V:V) and placed in a greenhouse. During the growing
    period, minimum and maximum temperatures within the greenhouse were 18.3 °C and
    27.7 °C, respectively, and relative humidity varied between 86% and 20%. Plants
    were daily irrigated at field capacity with tap water. Additionally, twice a week
    all potted plants received 0.3 L of a full Hoagland solution (Hoagland and Arnon,
    1950) to promote growth. Lateral shoots, buds, and young flowers were removed,
    leaving only winter buds and leaves. On May 15, irrigation treatments were initiated
    by applying different amounts of water per plant and day: irrigation was provided
    twice a day during 10 min using 4 L h−1 (control plants) 2 L h−1 (deficit plants)
    drippers (i.e. approximately 1300 and 650 ml per plant and day). There were 6
    plants per treatment. Measurements were carried out two months after initiating
    the irrigation treatments when plants were about 1.2 m high. Three plants per
    treatment were placed outside the greenhouse and diurnal cycles of gas exchange
    and reflectance measurements were carried out on July 7. Predawn water potential
    (Ψp) was determined using a Scholander pressure chamber (Soilmoisture 3005, Soil
    Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) on 3 leaves (1 leaf plant−1) similar to
    those where gas exchange and leaf reflectance were determined. Six fully expanded
    leaves (2 leaves per plant; 6 leaves per treatment) were measured approximately
    every 2 h under current ambient photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air
    temperature (Tair) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) conditions. Leaves had a
    similar appearance although different orientations (light exposure). Net CO2 assimilation
    rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E) and leaf temperature (Tleaf),
    as well as environmental conditions (PPFD, Tair and VPD), were measured with a
    portable gas exchange system CIRAS-2 (PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA) at
    a CO2 concentration in the cuvette of 360 ppm. Afterwards, leaf reflectance was
    determined using a spectroradiometer UNISPEC (PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA,
    USA) with a 2.3 mm diameter bifurcated fibre optic (model UNI410, PP Systems,
    Havervill, MA, USA). The detector samples 256 bands at roughly even intervals
    (average band-to-band spacing 3.3 nm) within a 400–1100 nm effective spectral
    range. The Water Index was derived from reflectance measurements as: (1) where,
    R indicates spectral reflectance and subindices are the respective wavelengths
    in nanometres. Above ground biomass and leaf area were determined on each plant
    at the end of the experiment (i.e., after conducting the diurnal cycles). Analyses
    of variance were carried out using the statistical package SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
    Chicago, IL, USA). Water availability (control or deficit) and time of day were
    considered as sources of variation. Means were compared using the Bonferroni''s
    test and correlation and regression analyses were used to study the relationships
    among several variables. 2.2. Field canopy study A field study was conducted during
    two consecutive years (2007–2008) in ten commercial vineyards in the D.O. Penedès
    region (Catalonia, Spain, 1°48′22″W; 41°28′54″N). The region has a Mediterranean
    climate with average annual temperatures ranging from 11 to 15 °C, average annual
    precipitation ranging from 600 to 900 mm. In the last ten year series (1998–2007)
    cumulative rainfall and evapotranspiration were 431 mm and 900 mm, respectively.
    Weather data during the study period were obtained in a nearby weather station
    located at Hostalets de Pierola (1°48′31″W; 41°31′59″N). The study was conducted
    on V. vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay plants of K5V1 clone. Vines were trained to Double
    Royat. Vine age and rootstocks differed among vineyards (see Table 1). Plantation
    density ranged from 2083 to 3704 vines ha−1 with variable vine spacing between
    and within rows. The main characteristics of the vineyards are reported in Table
    1. In each plot, 3 vines with contrasting vigour were chosen to carry out measurements
    at the stage of veraison, when vines attained full canopy expansion. Thus, measurements
    were carried out in 30 plants (3 per plot). Table 1. Characteristics of the vineyards

    water potential (Ψp) was determined between 3 h prior to sunrise using a Scholander
    pressure chamber (Soilmoisture 3005, Soil Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA).
    On each vine a Ψp measurement was taken from one mature non senescing leaf from
    the central third of the outer part of the canopy. Additionally, canopy temperature
    of field vines was determined at midday (solar noon) using a hand-held infrared
    thermometer (Scheduler, SN 870401 in 2007 and ST Pro Plus, Raytek Corp., Santa
    Cruz, CA, USA in 2008) positioned at 20 cm of the canopy and held at an angle
    of 60° so that the field of view was approximately 0.25 m2. Canopy temperature
    in 2008 was measured on both the sun exposed and the shaded side of each vine
    while in 2007 measurements of canopy temperature were taken on the sun exposed
    surface. Canopy radiance was measured over each vine using the spectroradiometer
    and the fibre optic previously described fitted with a 12° field of view foreoptics
    (UNI-710, PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA). Measurements were expressed as
    apparent reflectance after standardizing by the irradiance determined using a
    cosine corrected detector lens (UNI-685 PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA) positioned
    above the canopy. Data were collected on cloudless days between 11:00 h and 13:00
    h (i.e., solar noon) in order to minimize disturbances from the atmosphere and
    changes in solar elevation. The radiometer was mounted on a tripod and held in
    a nadir orientation 0.75 m above the canopy. Four scans were averaged for each
    vine. Besides the WI, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated
    using narrow-band reflectance values as follows: (2) where R indicates reflectance
    and the subindices indicate the wavelength in nm. Analyses of variance, correlation
    and regression were carried out using the statistical package SPSS 14.0 and SPSS
    17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Plots were considered as sources of variation
    in ANOVAs. Means were compared using the Bonferroni''s test and correlation and
    regression analyses were used to study the relationships among several variables.
    3. Results 3.1. Leaf level study There were no significant differences between
    treatments in Ψp, although Ψp was slightly higher in control (−0.37 ± 0.07 MPa;
    mean ± sem) than in deficit plants (−0.42 ± 0.09 MPa; mean ± sem). Similarly,
    there were no significant changes in above ground biomass in response to changes
    in water availability, although leaf area per plant was slightly (p < 0.10) higher
    in control than in deficit plants (data not shown). Environmental conditions during
    the diurnal cycle of measurements, particularly air temperature and water vapor
    pressure deficit, were typical of Mediterranean conditions (Fig. 1). Decrease
    in air temperature at midday was due to the effects of sea breeze, since the experiment
    was carried out in a coastal zone. On the other hand, the unusual temperature
    peaks experienced late in the afternoon were due to the rearrangement of plants
    on a sea-breeze sheltered location in order to avoid shade from a nearby building.
    Air vapour pressure deficits (VPD) reached high values at midday (3 kPa) and were
    even higher when plants were relocated to the wind-sheltered location (∼3.5 kPa).

    and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on July 7, 2007 for the experiment on potted
    plants. Values are mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 6). There were large
    changes in incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at the leaf surface
    along the day with significant decreases at the central hours of the day in deficit
    plants (Fig. 2A). Leaf incident PPFD was maximum at midday in control plants (1915
    ± 365 μmol m−2 s−1) while in stressed plants leaf incident PPFD reached its peak
    at midmorning (1666 ± 129 μmol m−2 s−1) and started to decline afterwards, indicating
    substantial changes in leaf angle. Leaf incident PPFD was ∼25% lower in deficit
    than in control plants from midday to the early afternoon. Thus, in deficit plants,
    leaves tended to reduce light interception during midday. As expected, diurnal
    patterns of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) followed changes in leaf incident PPFD
    (Fig. 2B). There was a significant variation (p < 0.01) in A along the day in
    both treatments. In control plants, A increased along the morning, reached its
    peak at midday (3.70 ± 0.375 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and declined in the afternoon.
    Contrastingly, in deficit plants, A reached its peak at midmorning (3.32 ± 0.361
    μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and started to decline afterwards which might be attributed
    to significant decreases in gs as well as to changes in leaf orientation, as indicated
    by decreases in PPFD. In addition, there were significant differences (p < 0.05)
    between treatments in A with higher values in control than in deficit plants at
    noon (Fig. 2B). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Diurnal time course

    in control (open symbols) and deficit (filled symbols) plants. Values are mean
    ± standard error of the mean (n = 6). Stomatal conductance (gs) showed significant
    variation along the day (p < 0.01) in both control and deficit plants (Fig. 2C).
    Moreover, there were significant differences (p < 0.01) in gs between treatments
    with higher values in control than in deficit plants (daily averaged gs values
    were 72.6 ± 8.51 and 55.2 ± 10.34 mol H2O m−2 s−1 for control and deficit plants,
    respectively). The leaf-to-air temperature difference (Tleaf − Tair) followed
    changes in gs and transpiration rate, so that decreases in gs were accompanied
    by increases in Tleaf − Tair (Fig. 2D). However, Tleaf − Tair, although varying
    significantly along the day (p < 0.001), did not show significant differences
    between treatments except at midday when Tleaf − Tair was significantly lower
    in deficit than in control plants (p < 0.01). Transpiration rate (E) showed a
    similar response to that of gs with significant variation along the day (p < 0.01)
    in both control and deficit plants (Fig. 2E). In addition there were significant
    differences between treatments (p < 0.01) in E with higher values in control than
    in deficit plants from midmorning to the early afternoon (Fig. 2E). On the other
    hand, the WI showed significant variation along the day (p < 0.01) as well as
    between treatments (p < 0.01). In both, control and deficit plants, WI increased
    along the diurnal time course (Fig. 2F). To further explore the feasibility of
    using reflectance indices to assess vine water status we conducted a series of
    correlation analyses using data averaged for each treatment and sampling time.
    We chose those data corresponding to measurements carried out from midmorning
    to early afternoon. At this time, photosynthetic activity was not light-limited
    (i.e. light saturated measurements) and we expected to detect larger differences
    between treatments in response to water availability. There was no significant
    correlation between Tleaf − Tair and gs when the whole data set was considered
    (Fig. 3A, continuous line). However, when a single data corresponding to midday
    values in control treatment (encircled in Fig. 3A) was disregarded, a close correlation
    was found between Tleaf − Tair and gs (Fig. 3A, dashed line). On the other hand,
    the WI was significantly correlated to gs although different relationships emerged
    for each treatment (Fig. 3B). Thus, decreases in gs were associated to increases
    in both WI and Tleaf − Tair. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Relationship

    correspond to measurements carried between 8:00 and 18:00 solar time. 3.2. Field
    canopy study Air temperatures over the study period (2007 and 2008) were within
    the last 10-year mean data while annual rainfall was higher than the last 10-year-mean
    precipitation (i.e., 439 mm) (Fig. 4). The pattern of rainfall events also differed
    for these two periods. In both years, rain conditions were characterized by a
    dry winter preceding each growth period. However, in 2007, spring rainfall was
    abundant and afterwards precipitation was reduced until late August when a heavy
    storm took place (125 mm). Thus, in 2007, cumulative rainfall was 548 mm close
    to the average last 10-year-mean precipitation (i.e., 439 mm) if the above mentioned
    summer storm were disregarded. In 2008, rains extended from spring to early summer
    and cumulative rainfall was more than twice the 10-year-average precipitation
    (i.e., 874 mm compared to 431 mm). Indeed, this was the first time for the registered
    data that cumulative rainfall was similar to the cumulative reference evapotranspiration.
    Thus, while 2007 was a typical dry year, 2008 was an exceptionally wet year. Download

    Data from Estació meteorològica dels Hostalets de Pierola. Coordinates UTM (x,y,z):
    400,630, 4,598,640, 312 a.s.l. Vine phenology was contrasted between the two studied
    years. Veraison (i.e., when field data collection took place) occurred from 16
    to 22 July in 2007 while in 2008 veraison commenced on 4 August and was completed
    on 11 August. There were significant differences in Ψp among vineyards (p < 0.01)
    and between years (p < 0.01). Average Ψp values were −0.88 ± 0.053 MPa (average
    ± SEM) and −0.69 ± 0.032 MPa (average ± SEM) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In
    2007, Ψp ranged from −0.40 ± 0.074 MPa to −1.36 ± 0.041 MPa among vineyards while
    in 2008 minimum and maximum Ψp were −0.917 ± 0.020 MPa and −0.450 MPa ± 0.035,
    respectively. Vine canopy development showed significant differences among vineyards
    (p < 0.01) within a year as well as between years (p < 0.01) as indicated by NDVI
    values. In 2007, NDVI values ranged from 0.771 ± 0.044 to 0.852 ± 0.048 among
    vineyards, and mean value was 0.806 ± 0.007 for all the studied plots. In 2008,
    NDVI values ranged from 0.793 ± 0.019 to 0.868 ± 0.022, and average NDVI was 0.835
    ± 0.006 for all the studied plots. In contrast WI values did not show significant
    differences between years. Average WI was 1.080 ± 0.005 and 1.070 ± 0.013 for
    years 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, there were significant differences
    (p < 0.001) in WI among vineyards. In 2007, WI values ranged from 1.03 ± 0.013
    to 1.11 ± 0.013 while in 2008 WI values ranged from 1.012 ± 0.008 to 1.146 ± 0.005.
    On the other hand, there were significant differences in ΔT among vineyards (p
    < 0.001) and between years (p < 0.001). Average ΔT values were 0.92 ± 0.449 and
    −2.17 ± 0.399 (average ± SEM) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2007 ΔT ranged
    from −3.3 to 5.0 among vineyards while in 2008 ΔT ranged from −6.6 °C to 1.4 °C.
    Canopy development was closely related to water availability as indicated by the
    significant relationship between Ψp and NDVI with R2 = 0.64 and R2 = 0.48, for
    2007 and 2008, respectively. Moreover, there were no significant differences in
    the regression models when year was considered as a factor. Thus, a unique and
    highly significant relationship emerged when data from both years were pooled
    (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5). In addition, when data from both years were pooled,
    ΔT was negatively related to Ψp (r = −0.37, p < 0.01), indicating that higher
    water potentials were translated into lower ΔT (i.e. higher transpiration) (data
    not shown). However, there was no significant relationship between Ψp and WI (data
    not shown). Nonetheless, within a year, there were significant relationships between
    WI and ΔT (p < 0.05). Thus, WI showed lower values on vines with higher ΔT with
    r = −0.67 (p < 0.05) and r = −0.75 (p < 0.05) for years 2007 and 2008, respectively

    = 3). 4. Discussion 4.1. Leaf level study The range of Ψp values encountered indicate
    that plants were under moderate to severe water stress (Carbonneau, 1998), and
    are similar to those reported in previous studies on potted plants subjected to
    moderate to severe water stress (Flexas et al., 1999) as well as under deficit
    irrigation programs in field studies conducted under Mediterranean environments
    (Grant et al., 2007, Patakas et al., 2005, Souza et al., 2005). In agreement with
    other studies conducted in potted plants (Medrano et al., 2002) different irrigation
    supply did not translate into significant differences in Ψp. Nonetheless, despite
    similar Ψp values in both treatments, deficit plants underwent earlier decreases
    in gas exchange parameters (A, gs and E) along the day when compared to control
    plants. A gradual decline in A from mid morning to evening has been previously
    described in V. vinifera and has been associated to a decline in stomatal conductance
    (Chaumont et al., 1994, Correia et al., 1990, Flexas et al., 1999). However, our
    vines showed low photosynthetic rates when compared with previous studies conducted
    on vines under similar water stress (Flexas et al., 1999). This might be attributed
    to the incidence of a virus infection in our plants and its resulting effects
    on photosynthesis. Indeed, several studies have reported decreases in photosynthetic
    performance as a result of a virus infection in grapevines (Pozsar et al., 1969,
    Sampol et al., 2003). In our study, leaves showed a slight chlorosis as well as
    a feathering of the leaf veins. Sampol et al. (2003) reported important reductions
    in chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in virus infected grapevines, albeit the
    primary light reactions were not identified as the main factor limiting photosynthesis.
    In our study, we did not determine pigment content but indirect estimates using
    reflectance based indices evidenced similar pigment composition in control and
    deficit plants (data not shown). In addition, Sampol et al. (2003) showed that,
    in virus infected grapevines, photosynthesis was primarily impaired by decreases
    in carboxylation and mesophyll conductance rather than to stomatal regulation.
    Although we cannot rule out the existence of a feedback control on stomatal behaviour
    resulting from these latter photosynthetic processes, we presume that, in our
    study, stomatal conductance was mainly affected by differences in water supply.
    Indeed, gs values were within the range reported for potted plants experiencing
    similar Ψp (Flexas et al., 1999, Flexas et al., 2009). Moreover, the results herein
    reported are consistent with those obtained with healthy potted plants cv. Cabernet
    Sauvignon in an analogous experiment (data not shown). Stomatal closure is among
    the first processes occurring in the leaves in response to drought. Tight stomatal
    closure occurs at relatively low soil water deficit in many grapevine cultivars,
    leading to a rapid reduction of gs as pre-dawn leaf water potential decreases
    (Chaves et al., 2010, Lovisolo et al., 2010, Schultz, 2003). Consistently, deficit
    plants had lower gs than control plants along the day. However, there were no
    differences in Tleaf − Tair between control and deficit plants, except at midday,
    despite higher E and gs in control plants. We did not have a plausible explanation
    for this response, but the decline in incident PPFD at the leaf surface (as a
    consequence of changes in leaf orientation) in deficit plants might have resulted
    in lower leaf temperatures. Indeed, if leaf movements occur after stomata close,
    they might contribute to leaf cooling, as intercepted radiation changes (Jones,
    2007). Alternatively, increased radiation load in control plants probably led
    to increases in leaf temperature (Gibberd et al., 2001). Thus, no significant
    relationship was found for control plants between gs and Tleaf − Tair. However,
    when midday data were disregarded a significant relationship (r2 = 0.52, p < 0.05)
    emerged for the whole data set. Differences in stomatal conductance between control
    and deficit plants were translated into differences in the reflectance based Water
    Index. Thus, at the leaf level, control plants showed along the day consistently
    higher WI values than deficit plants. This is consistent with previous studies
    that have shown that WI can be an indicator of gs at the leaf scale (Peñuelas
    et al., 1993). Moreover, decreases in gs were associated to increases in WI, although
    the relationship between WI and gs was found to be treatment dependent (control
    and deficit plants with similar gs had distinct values of WI) (Fig. 3). In a recent
    study conducted on citrus trees, Dzikiti et al. (2010) found that, at the leaf
    level, a water spectral index (calculated as the ratio of reflectance at 1070
    nm and 1340 nm) closely followed changes in crown water content resulting from
    variations in water supply and water loss (transpiration) determined using sap
    flow measurements. Apparently, the spectral features at the 970 nm centered water
    band might present a similar response (Dzikiti et al., 2010). Thus, in our study,
    increases in gs presumably led to a reduction in leaf water content as indicated
    by the negative relationship between WI and gs. A more detailed study on the dynamics
    of water recharge and depletion in relation to water content is needed in order
    to confirm this hypothesis. 4.2. Field canopy study Predawn water potential is
    commonly used as a reference method to determine vine water status (Choné et al.,
    2001b). Predawn plant water potential is thought to equilibrate with soil water
    potentials and, thus, it is an estimate of water availability. In the present
    study, predawn water potentials indicated that vines were under severe restriction
    in 2007 while in 2008 vines experienced moderate water stress (Carbonneau, 1998,
    Cifré et al., 2005) in agreement with the contrasted precipitation registered
    between both years. Moreover, Ψp values were in accordance with those obtained
    in other studies conducted in field studies under non-irrigated conditions (Koundouras
    et al., 2006, Pellegrino et al., 2004, Taylor et al., 2010). Thus, in our study
    under field conditions, water deficits were moderate to severe. In field grown
    vines, limited water availability affects vegetative growth (Dry and Loveys, 1999,
    Matthews et al., 1987, Pellegrino et al., 2005; among others). In agreement with
    these studies, water availability was a major determinant of vegetative growth
    in the vineyards studied as indicated by the close relationship between Ψp and
    NDVI. Indeed, previous studies have reported significant correlations between
    NDVI and canopy leaf area index (m2 leaf area per m2 of ground) and leaf area
    per vine (m2 per vine) over multiple vineyards using 4 m-resolution IKONOS satellite
    imagery (Dobrowski et al., 2002). Moreover, the Ψp vs. NDVI relationship was consistent
    across the study, so that a unique relationship emerged for the period of study.
    Thus, vegetative development was strongly determined by water availability and
    the vegetation index NDVI effectively characterized the effects of water availability
    on vine canopy growth. In agreement with previous studies (Rodríguez-Pérez et
    al., 2007) there was no significant relationship between Ψp and the WI. Nevertheless,
    it should be stressed that Ψp measures the leaf water status when transpiration
    stream is in equilibrium and transpiration is practically zero while WI values
    derived from reflectance at midday do not necessarily mirror this condition. Recently,
    Dzikiti et al. (2010) have shown that the WI was a good predictor of midday stem
    water potential in severely stressed citrus trees but failed to estimate midday
    stem water potential under mild or no drought stress. On the other hand, these
    latter authors reported close relationships between the WI and leaf water content
    on both non-stressed and stressed citrus trees. More accurate estimates of water
    content should be expected since water absorption features in spectral reflectance
    are determined by the amount of water (and leaf structural attributes) rather
    than by leaf water energy status (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990). Even though predawn
    and stem water potential are common indicators of water stress in grapevines (Choné
    et al., 2001b), plant water content is also a drought stress indicator although
    it is rarely used in practice for irrigation management (Jones, 2004). Nonetheless,
    some techniques widely used in vineyard irrigation scheduling rely on monitoring
    properties that respond to variations in water content. Particularly, linear transducers
    of displacement and sap flow meters capable of continuously monitoring variation
    in gs have proven useful to estimate canopy transpiration and to schedule irrigation
    in grapevines (Ginestar et al., 1998, Yunusa et al., 2000). Besides these contact
    techniques that provide point observations, remote estimates of canopy temperature
    have proven useful in irrigation scheduling in grapevines (Cifré et al., 2005,
    Dry et al., 2001, Jones et al., 2002). We found that the WI was negatively related
    to midday ΔT, suggesting that vines with higher water content had presumably higher
    transpiration rates and, consequently, lower ΔT (Jones et al., 2002). Indeed,
    our results showed that the WI is a relatively dynamic index, that tracks variation
    in gs on a diurnal scale (i.e. within treatments in potted plants) and variation
    in transpiration rate resulting from contrasted water availability (i.e. in field
    grown plants). These results are in agreement with recent studies conducted in
    citrus trees (Dzikiti et al., 2010) and on chaparral vegetation (Claudio et al.,
    2006) that demonstrate the capability of the WI to track variations in water fluxes
    under severe stress. Thus, our study adds on these previous results showing that
    the WI effectively followed changes in water fluxes under a range of moderate
    to severe water stress. Nonetheless, in our study, different relationships emerged
    at the leaf level between treatments as well as at the canopy level on different
    years. Probably, in our field study, differences in instrument calibration and
    measurement conditions introduced some biases in our results. Moreover, differences
    in vegetative growth between campaigns might have resulted in different WI values
    since the water content of vegetation at the canopy and landscape level responds
    to both leaf area and relative water content (Serrano et al., 2000, Sims and Gamon,
    2003). A reason for the interest in thermal and reflectance techniques is the
    possibility of measuring it remotely, thus avoiding time consuming techniques
    used for detecting water stress and providing spatially representative information
    on plant water status. Our results showed that both WI and ΔT (i.e., the canopy
    to air temperature difference) were good indicators of stomatal regulation in
    grapevines. However, thermal sensing requires calibration since both environmental
    conditions and stomatal aperture affect canopy temperature (Jones, 2004). Nonetheless,
    recent studies conducted in vineyards have shown that calibration of thermal data
    using a reference surface might provide accurate estimates of gs (Grant et al.,
    2007, Möller et al., 2007). Moreover, recently, Berni et al. (2009) have developed
    a methodology that overcomes the necessity of thermal data calibration providing
    good estimates of canopy conductance in irrigated olive orchards. On the other
    hand, imagery in the reflective bands is more readily available than thermal band
    data, and generally at higher spatial resolution, which is a key issue to conduct
    successful applications in partially covered surfaces (Serrano et al., 2000, Suárez
    et al., 2010), like vineyards. Moreover, as indicated in other studies (Claudio
    et al., 2006, Dzikiti et al., 2010), the 970 nm water band might be detected with
    silicon photodiode sensors, which makes it a good choice in terms of cost, availability
    and portability when compared to thermal sensors. Thus, the results obtained suggest
    new and potential applications of the WI in the frame of precision viticulture.
    Our results proved to work on a range that expands from moderate to severe water
    stress, a common situation in field grown grapevines under Mediterranean conditions,
    including those managed under deficit irrigation programs (Grant et al., 2007,
    Patakas et al., 2005, Souza et al., 2005). Characterization of the dynamics of
    water supply and water loss in relation to variations in the WI might further
    assist on estimating the capability of the WI as a potential tool in irrigation
    scheduling. The capability of assessing water status in fruit crops is also of
    great interest in the context of precision agriculture. Water deficits affect
    both fruit yield and quality and, particularly, in non-irrigated vineyards water
    status has been recognized to influence grape quality and thereby wine attributes
    (Choné et al., 2001a, Koundouras et al., 2006, Van Leeuwen and Seguin, 1994).
    Recent studies have proven the capability of remote sensing techniques for monitoring
    water stress and their effects on yield and fruit quality using thermal and reflectance
    imagery in olive orchards (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2007, Suárez et al., 2010).
    Therefore, the capability of the reflectance based WI to monitor drought stress
    might be of great significance in the context of precision viticulture as a potential
    tool to target harvesting strategies according to grape quality attributes as
    well as for ripening assessment. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our results showed
    that vines submitted to contrasted irrigation treatments showed significant differences
    in stomatal conductance and Water Index. Moreover, within a treatment, changes
    in stomatal conductance were closely mirrored by changes in WI. In field grown
    vines differences in water availability between years and among vineyards were
    translated into differences in canopy development as indicated by the close relationship
    between predawn water potential and NDVI. In addition, the WI was closely related
    to the midday canopy to air temperature difference, indicating that the WI effectively
    tracked variation in stomatal conductance within a range of moderate to severe
    water stress. More studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of the WI, prior
    to its extension as a common, practical tool, for vineyard water status assessment.
    The results obtained might be of great relevance in estimating the effects of
    water availability on grape yield and quality and might assist in irrigation scheduling.

  analysis: The study uses near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to assess grapevine water
    status in the field. The authors collected spectra from both adaxial and abaxial
    leaf surfaces of 160 grapevine leaves across eight different varieties and two
    different environmental conditions. They used principal component analysis (PCA)
    and modified partial least squares (MPLS) to develop prediction models for stem
    water potential (Ψs) and leaf relative water content (RWC). They found that NIR
    spectroscopy could reliably assess grapevine water status with cross-validation
    correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.93 for Ψs and 0.66 to 0.81 for
    RWC. They also found that the performance of the models was not significantly
    affected by whether the spectra were collected from the adaxial or abaxial leaf
    surfaces. The authors conclude that NIR spectroscopy is a promising tool for assessing
    grapevine water status in the field, as it is fast, non-invasive, and provides
    reliable results.

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract BACKGROUND Until now, the majority of methods
    employed to assess grapevine water status have been destructive, time-intensive,
    costly and provide information of a limited number of samples, thus the ability
    of revealing within-field water status variability is reduced. The goal of this
    work was to evaluate the capability of non-invasive, portable near infrared (NIR)
    spectroscopy acquired in the field, to assess the grapevine water status in diverse
    varieties, grown under different environmental conditions, in a fast and reliable
    way. The research was conducted 2 weeks before harvest in 2012, in two commercial
    vineyards, planted with eight different varieties. Spectral measurements were
    acquired in the field on the adaxial and abaxial sides of 160 individual leaves
    (20 leaves per variety) using a commercially available handheld spectrophotometer
    (1600–2400 nm). RESULTS Principal component analysis (PCA) and modified partial
    least squares (MPLS) were used to interpret the spectra and to develop reliable
    prediction models for stem water potential (Ψs) (cross-validation correlation
    coefficient (rcv) ranged from 0.77 to 0.93, and standard error of cross validation
    (SECV) ranged from 0.10 to 0.23), and leaf relative water content (RWC) (rcv ranged
    from 0.66 to 0.81, and SECV between 1.93 and 3.20). The performance differences
    between models built from abaxial and adaxial-acquired spectra is also discussed.
    CONCLUSIONS The capability of non-invasive NIR spectroscopy to reliably assess
    the grapevine water status under field conditions was proved. This technique can
    be a suitable and promising tool to appraise within-field variability of plant
    water status, helpful to define optimised irrigation strategies in the wine industry.
    © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry INTRODUCTION Grapevine is a crop commonly
    grown in the Mediterranean region and other semi-arid climate regions that are
    prone to water stress, which may negatively affect vegetative growth, yield, grape
    composition and wine sensorial attributes.1 Increased temperatures and heterogeneous
    precipitation patterns are forecast in the context of climate change,2 and optimised
    irrigation emerges as one of the main strategies to guide quality grape production.3
    In this framework, the implementation of optimised irrigation based on fast, reliable,
    comprehensive indicators becomes a priority in agricultural research worldwide.
    Improved precision in the application of irrigation is aimed to be gathered by
    plant stress sensing, as decision making regarding watering is based on plant
    response,4 which integrates soil and atmospheric water status. Of the various
    plant-based sensing techniques, some directly assess the plant water status, while
    others focus on the plant''s physiological responses.5 In the first group, the
    measurement of the relative water content (RWC)6 and the plant water potential,
    either leaf (Ψl) or stem water potential (Ψs),7 are widely accepted, while sensors
    based on the hydraulic conductance8 can also be listed. Among the plant methods
    based on measuring the plant response to water scarcity, thermal sensors (operating
    in the infrared range, 8 to 14 µm),9 sap-flow meters,10 as well as sensors based
    on the measurement of growth rate, leaf thickness and fluctuations of trunk or
    stem diameter are included.11 Several authors4, 11-13 have extensively reviewed
    the applicability, advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Many of these
    methods require operator training for their implementation and maintenance, and
    are either destructive, discontinuous, time-intensive, costly and provide information
    of a limited number of samples; thus, their ability to reveal the variability
    in plant water status within a vineyard plot is diminished. In this context, the
    ideal method for the assessment of plant water status should be non-destructive,
    sensitive to water changes, capable of providing a reliable and early response,
    as well as being inexpensive, easy to operate and interpret, and susceptible to
    being automated in order to provide a large amount of data to appraise within-field
    variability.11 Therefore, it is necessary to advance in faster, easy-to-use, non-invasive
    alternative techniques capable of effectively appraising the water status variability
    within a vineyard to help define optimised irrigation strategies. Over the last
    two decades, non-destructive field and remote spectroscopy has enabled the definition
    of spectral indices from the combination of specific wavelengths that are sensitive
    to changes in plant water status.14 As an alternative to spectral indices, other
    authors have used continuum removal variables of the spectra, or the whole spectrum,
    to estimate grapevine water content at the leaf and canopy levels.15, 16 Near
    infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a powerful technology that provides a non-destructive
    analytical method offering swift, accurate measurement. The NIR region is the
    part of the electromagnetic spectrum between 750 and 2500 nm and it is related
    to vibrations and combination overtones of the fundamental OH, CH and NH bond
    vibrations,17 thus sensitive to changes in water content. As a result, NIR spectroscopy
    may enable both real-time monitoring of the grapevine during the ripening process
    at leaf level and rapid quality control for evaluating plant water status,18,
    19 among other phenotyping traits.20 The use of portable NIR spectroscopy for
    the assessment of plant water status has not been extensively addressed. Likewise,
    prediction of classical Ψ and RWC based on NIR spectroscopy has been reported
    for several crops, such as olive tree,21 Eucalyptus seedling22 and grapevine.18,
    19, 23 Hence, there is considerable scope for improvement in the implementation
    of new, non-invasive, fast and robust portable NIR equipment to in-field assessing
    plant water status, as many features, such as the atmospheric conditions, the
    species, genotype, plant age, among others, affect conventional plant water status
    indicators,4 and potentially the NIR response also. The aim of the present study
    was to evaluate the capability of non-invasive, portable NIR spectroscopy to assess
    the grapevine water status under field conditions in a fast and reliable way,
    in two different vineyards subjected to the Mediterranean climate, planted with
    different grapevine varieties. MATERIALS AND METHODS Vineyard sites The study
    was conducted 2 weeks before harvest, during August (22nd to 30th) and September
    (3rd to 6th) 2012 in two different vineyards. Vineyard 1 was a commercial vineyard
    located in Falces (Navarra, Spain) (42° 23'' 52.2'''' N, 1° 47'' 41.8'''' W, 295
    m asl). Four grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) varieties (Albariño, Pedro Ximenez,
    Verdejo and White Grenache) were spur-pruned and trained to a 2.0 × 1.0 m (inter-
    and intra-row) vertical shoot positioned (VSP) trellis system. Vines were grafted
    onto 110R rootstock and planted in 2009 with row orientation north–south in a
    sandy–gravel soil. All water shoots were pulled out in May and shoot trimming
    was performed in July. Irrigation was applied routinely during the growing season,
    involving a total volume of 691 L per plant (345 mm). At the study site annual
    rainfall was 436 mm and average temperature was 19.1°C in 2012 from April to October.
    Vineyard 2 was a commercial vineyard located in Vergalijo (Navarra, Spain) (42°
    27′ 46.0″ N, 1° 48′ 13.4″ W, 325 m asl). Four grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) varieties
    (Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Marselan and Tempranillo) were spur-pruned and
    trained to a 2.0 × 1.0 m (inter- and intra-row) VSP trellis system. Vines were
    grafted onto 110R rootstock and planted in 2009 with row orientation north–south
    in a sandy–gravel soil. All water shoots were pulled out in May and shoot trimming
    was carried out in July. No irrigation was applied during the growing season (rain-fed
    vineyard). At the study site, annual rainfall was 474 mm and average temperature
    was 19.2°C in 2012 from April to October. Spectral measurements in field Spectra
    were acquired under field conditions on the adaxial and abaxial sides of 160 individual
    primary adult leaves (20 leaves per cultivar) of the mid-upper part of the shoot
    (nodes 6 to 12). Five spectra distributed over each of the abaxial and adaxial
    leaf sides, avoiding veins, holes and spots, were collected on the leaves still
    attached to the vine, using a handheld micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)
    based NIRS digital transform spectrometer (microPHAZIR™; Thermo Fisher Scientific
    Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), working in reflectance mode in the spectral range 1600–2400
    nm with a non-constant interval of 8.7 nm. For both the adaxial and abaxial sides,
    the spectrum of each leaf was the average of the five spectra obtained from ten
    scans. The integration time of the sensor was 600 ms. The temperature of the samples
    during measurement was 23–25°C. Vinyl gloves were used at all times to handle
    the leaves in order to not distort both sides of leaf with external pollutants
    from hand manipulation. Once spectra were taken the same leaves were used to subsequently
    measure the Ψs and the RWC. Assessment of stem water potential (Ψs) and leaf relative
    water content After spectra acquisition, a Scholander pressure bomb (Model 600;
    PMS Instruments Co., Albany, NY, USA) was used to assess the midday Ψs (14:00,
    solar noon) after 1 h of dark adaptation of the leaves in aluminium foil bags.
    Immediately afterwards, each leaf was weighed in the field using a portable scale
    (Easy; Taurus, Oliana, Spain) and its weight recorded (fresh weight). Then, the
    leaves were submerged in deionised water at 10°C. This was intended to bring all
    the leaves to full water content (well hydrated leaf, 100% relative water content).
    The leaves were then transported in portable refrigerators to the University of
    La Rioja and kept in cold water for 18 h. After this time, the weight of each
    leaf was recorded (turgent weight) and then the leaves were set to dry out at
    60°C in the oven until constant weight (dry weight). The relative water content
    (RWC) per leaf was computed using Eqn 1: (1) where wf is the fresh weight, wd
    is the dry weight, and wt is the turgent weight. Chemometrics and data analysis
    Chemometrics involves the extraction of information from chemical and biological
    systems by data-driven means, such as multivariate statistics, applied mathematics
    and computer science. In the present work chemometric analysis was focused on
    multivariate methods, and was performed using the WinISI II software package version
    1.50 (Infrasoft International, Port Matilda, PA, USA) and the Unscrambler software
    package version 10.3 (CAMO ASA, Oslo, Norway). Principal component analysis (PCA)
    was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to a smaller number of components,
    to examine any possible grouping and also to visualise the presence of outliers.24,
    25 Global Mahalanobis (GH) distance analysis was performed for the detection of
    outliers, i.e. Mahalanobis distance between the centre of the population and each
    sample in the space defined by a PCA based on the spectral information. Samples
    with GH values larger than 3 were considered outliers. Spectral outlier detection
    was performed separately for each leaf surface. In order to obtain two datasets
    with the same number of individuals, suitable for comparisons, whenever a spectrum
    from a leaf''s face was tagged as an outlier (thus removed), the one from the
    other surface was also removed (whether or not it was a real outlier), therefore
    that leaf was not present in any of the two datasets. As spectral pre-treatments,
    the standard normal variate (SNV) plus detrending (DT)26 procedure was used to
    remove the multiplicative interferences of scatter. In addition to a derivative
    mathematical treatment, window-wise filtering (1,4,4,1) was applied. The first
    digit indicates the order of the derivative, the second refers to the gap over
    which the derivative is calculated, the third represents the number of data points
    in a running average or smoothing and the fourth figure corresponds to the second
    smoothing.27 Modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression was tested for the
    prediction of Ψs and the RWC using the spectra from both leaf sides (adaxial and
    abaxial) separately in the 1600–2400 nm range. MPLS is often more stable and accurate
    than the standard PLS algorithm.27 In MPLS, the NIRS residuals at each wavelength
    obtained after each factor has been calculated are standardised (dividing by the
    standard deviations of the residuals) before calculating the next factor. To prevent
    over-fitting, the assessment of the calibration model was performed by a six-fold
    cross-validation. In this method, the set of calibration samples was divided into
    six groups, using one of them to check the results (prediction) and the remaining
    (five groups) to build the calibration model. The model was repeated as many times
    as groups were (six in total), in such a way that all the samples were used in
    both the calibration and prediction sets. Different pre-processing combinations
    based on derivatives, window-wise filtering and scatter correction methods were
    evaluated for building the calibration models. Outliers of the water status indicators
    were analysed using Student''s T statistic, which indicates the difference between
    the reference and the predicted value. A critical limit of T > 2.5 was used to
    identify samples as chemical outliers.28 The following statistics were used to
    select the most adequate models: standard error of calibration (SEC), standard
    error of cross-validation (SECV) and correlation coefficient of cross-validation
    (rcv). Additionally, the residual predictive deviation (RPDCV),29 calculated as
    the ratio between the standard deviation of the reference data for the training
    set and the standard error of cross-validation (SECV), was also computed. Calibration
    and prediction models were built for each vineyard site separately. Furthermore,
    global models, including the data from both vineyard sites, were also created.
    RESULTS Overview of spectral features Typical log (1/R) spectra collected from
    the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces under field conditions are shown in Fig.
    1. The effect of derivative was mostly apparent for the first derivative of the
    spectrum, which enabled separating the overlapping absorption bands and revealed
    certain characteristic absorbance peaks. Likewise, the most significant and intensive
    leaf absorption occurred at 1927 nm, close to the water absorption band (OH)
    at around 1940 nm. Higher absorbance values were observed in the adaxial side
    [1.25 absorbance units (a.u.)], as compared to the abaxial side (1.05 a.u.). Figure

    and comparison of quantitative NIRS analysis of vine water status Individual calibration
    and prediction models were built separately for each vineyard, but also a global
    one including the data of both sites was developed. Table 1 summarises the descriptive
    statistics of the plant water status, in terms of Ψs and RWC, of the three different
    datasets: vineyard 1, vineyard 2 and global dataset. The values of Ψs in vineyard
    1 represented a plant population that involved no stressed to mild water stressed
    vines, while in vineyard 2 the plants were subjected to mild to severe water stress
    (Ψs: −1.85 to −0.80 MPa). The global dataset, including the data from the two
    vineyard sites, comprised a wider range of plant water status, from no stress
    to very high water stress. In terms of leaf hydration, the average values of RWC
    in the three datasets reached 86%. High variation in both Ψs and RWC can be observed
    in both vineyards, as illustrated by the range (maximum–minimum) and the SD values.

    prediction models showed a correlation coefficient of cross-validation (rcv) above
    the 0.77 mark considering the three datasets, for both adaxial and abaxial leaf
    sides, and surpassed 0.90 in vineyard 2. No substantial differences in model performance
    were detected between the two leaf sides. Regarding the RWC (Table 3), the correlation
    coefficients of cross-validation and RPD values were generally lower than those
    obtained for Ψs (Table 2), with rcv above 0.66 at all instances. In contrast to
    the models for Ψs, for RWC assessment, NIR spectroscopy of the abaxial side of
    the leaves was more responsive, as more accurate prediction models were derived,
    than spectra acquisition on the adaxial side of the leaves. In order to be able
    to reliably compare the models obtained for each vineyard site (for which n = 80)
    with a global one involving data from both vineyards, a new, reduced global dataset
    (n = 80), covering the same variation than the global set (n = 160; Table 1) was
    created, and named reduced global set. Table 4 summarises the performance indicators
    for the best models for Ψs and RWC for the reduced global set. Regardless the
    leaf side, better models were obtained for Ψs than for RWC, as the rcv and RPD
    values were higher for the Ψs models, despite the higher number of PLS factors
    employed. The side of the leaf for spectral acquisition did not substantially
    influence the model performance for Ψs assessment, but improved prediction of
    RWC could be achieved for abaxial spectral measurements. In terms of rcv and RPD,
    the predictive capability of the models built with the reduced global set (Table
    4) was similar or superior to that of the models built individually for each vineyard
    site for both for Ψs (Table 2) and RWC (Table 3), although SECV values were generally
    lower in the vineyard-specific models. Table 4. Calibration and cross-validation

    corresponding to vineyard 1 and 2 respectively, regardless the leaf side. The
    statistics of the models in these figures are shown in Table 2, while those of
    Fig. 2e and f, for the reduced global dataset, are shown in Table 4. For all varieties,
    the predicted values of Ψs are within the prediction interval limits, with the
    exception of one sample of Tempranillo (Fig. 2c and d). Figure 2 Open in figure

    lines. (: Albariño; : Cabernet Sauvignon; : Grenache; : White Grenache; : Marselan;
    : Pedro Ximenez; : Tempranillo; : Verdejo) With regard to the RWC, this variable
    ranged from ∼75% to 95% in vineyard 1 (Fig. 3a and b), vineyard 2 (Fig. 3c and
    d) and the reduced global dataset (Fig. 3e and f) models, after water status outlier
    removal. As in the case of RWC, sample data dispersion along the correlation lines
    can be observed, especially in Fig. 3a and b, corresponding to vineyard 1. The
    statistics of the models in Fig. 3a to d are shown in Table 3, while those of
    Fig. 3e and f, for the reduced global dataset, are shown in Table 4. Similarly
    to Ψs, most of the predicted values of RWC for all varieties ranged within the
    prediction interval lines. Leaf side effect: adaxial versus abaxial The better
    capability of the models built from abaxial NIR spectra for RWC prediction led
    to further investigate the effect of the leaf side measured with the NIR device
    on spectral features. Therefore, PCA was performed (Fig. 4). Figure 4 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Score plot of samples for the two leaf surfaces, abaxial
    (black symbols) and adaxial (grey symbols) in the space defined by principal component
    1 (PC1) and principal component 2 (PC2). (: Albariño; : Cabernet Sauvignon; :
    Grenache; : White Grenache; : Marselan; : Pedro Ximenez; : Tempranillo; : Verdejo)
    The PCA scores represent the weighted sums of the original variables (absorbance
    values with a non-constant interval of 8.7 nm in the spectral region 1600–2400
    nm) without significant loss of useful information. The first two principal components
    together described 98.01% of the total variation in the data; PC1 accounted for
    95.80% and PC2 for 2.21%. The biplot in Fig. 4 revealed a clear clustering between
    the two leaf surfaces and illustrates the capability of NIR spectroscopy within
    the range of 1600 to 2400 nm for leaf surface discrimination. This finding, which
    demonstrates the differences between both leaf sides, further supports the building
    of MPLS models separately for abaxial and adaxial sides for the two grapevine
    water status indicators. As regards the variety effect, no clear separation among
    grapevine varieties was observed for any of the two leaf sides. DISCUSSION Non-invasive,
    NIR reflectance spectroscopy in the range of 1600–2400 nm, acquired with a portable
    spectrophotometer under field conditions, has proved to successfully and reliably
    assess the grapevine water status (from no stress to severe stress conditions)
    in two vineyard sites planted with different grapevine cultivars. Likewise, reliable
    predictive models for two classical indicators of plant water status, such as
    the Ψs and the RWC, have been built from leaf spectra acquired with a fast, non-destructive,
    hand-held NIR spectrophotometer in the vineyard. The Ψs and the RWC are widely
    used plant-based indicators of the plant water status but their measurement is
    destructive and labour-intensive, therefore expensive. Non-invasive, NIR spectra
    acquisition of a leaf with the portable device used in this study takes less than
    30 s and the acquired spectrum may be ‘translated’ into Ψs or RWC values immediately,
    provided a robust prediction model was already developed. With regard to the predictive
    capabilities of the developed models for Ψs assessment, for the two studied vineyards
    and the reduced global dataset the statistics of the predictive models (rcv and
    SECV) were similar to those obtained in olive trees,21 and grapevine.18, 19 In
    these works the authors reported rcv = 0.84 and SECV = 0.18 MPa for a model built
    from spectra (spectral region: 1100–1830 nm) acquired on the abaxial side of Chardonnay
    leaves.18 These authors found better correlations with Ψs for the abaxial side
    and suggested that spectra collected from this leaf side were more informative
    than those from the adaxial side. From our results, this conclusion held only
    for RWC, but not for Ψs, for which no influence of the measured leaf side on the
    predictive performance of the NIR-spectra derived models was observed. In terms
    of the RWC, scarce information on the development of predictive models based on
    NIR spectroscopy working with the whole spectrum exists in the literature. Alternatively,
    other approaches have involved the generation and calculation of spectral vegetation
    indices and their relationship with plant water content indicators like RWC. This
    way, a significant regression with R2 > 0.94 between the ratio 1300/1450 and the
    RWC in several crops was reported elsewhere.30 Similarly, in another work,31 different
    spectral indices (WI, water index; NDWI, normalised differential water index;
    REIP, red edge inflection point; and MDWI, maximum difference water index) were
    computed from spectra acquired in poplar leaves and a strong relationship (R2 = 0.94)
    between RWC and the MDWI was found. However, the relationship with the stem water
    potential (Ψs) was poor (R2 = 0.34).31 In our work, the statistics obtained allow
    asserting an adequate accuracy and precision of the models to estimate RWC using
    a NIR portable device under field conditions. According to Shenk and Westerhaus27
    guidelines, the precision of the models developed for RWC may be considered acceptable
    for rough screening, enabling samples to be classified as high, medium or low
    RWC, while those for Ψs provide a reliable estimation of the plant water status
    indicator. One of the main improvements of the NIR-based, non-invasive method
    is its ability to expand the spatial representation of plant water status of a
    whole vineyard with respect to conventional methods. This way, the capability
    of portable NIR devices to assess the grapevine water status is a remarkable outcome
    for the wine industry, as a high number of measurements can be carried out in
    a fast and non-destructive way, to appraise the variation of a vineyard water
    status and help defining optimised irrigation strategies. Moreover, compared to
    other plant-based non-destructive techniques, such as thermography, NIR spectroscopy
    does not require references such as Tdry and Twet,32, 33 which is constraining.
    One of the requirements of ideal water status indicators for optimised irrigation
    scheduling is their ability of automation.4, 11 At this stage, data acquisition
    with the portable NIR sensor employed in this study is not susceptible to being
    automated as it is a contact sensor. However, the predictive performance of leaf
    NIR spectroscopy in the range of 1600–2400 nm to assess plant water status has
    been demonstrated, and paves the way for its automation and on-the-go application
    using a new generation of NIR spectrophotometers, capable of operating at a given
    distance from the plant under field conditions. An important feature of the proposed
    methodology in this work is the wavelength range used (1600–2400 nm). In a previous
    study23 the authors acquired spectra in the 350–1075 nm range of Malbec grapevine
    leaves and obtained modest calibrations (rc = 0.67, SEC = 0.07) by PLS analysis
    with leaf water potential. Wavelengths located in the 1300–2500 nm range are said
    to be very sensitive to changes in leaf water content since they are relatively
    insensitive to factors like leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content.34-37
    In this range, the absorption band (OH) at around 1940 nm corresponds to the
    vibrational band characterisation for pure water as described elsewhere.38 In
    our work, the most relevant water absorption peak (in both adaxial and abaxial
    spectral signatures) corresponded to 1927 nm for the handheld NIRS instrument,
    in agreement with a previous work, in which different spectrometers operating
    in the range 1100–1830 nm were used.18 In the same way, other authors reported
    that wavelengths located at around 1450, 1920 and 2500 nm show the highest sensitivity
    to changes in leaf RWC independently of the plant species.34 With regard to the
    effect of the variety, the results obtained in this work show that global models,
    involving multiple grapevine varieties from two different vineyard plots can be
    built and applied to successfully estimate the grapevine water status. The choice
    for modelling individually for a single variety would also be valid, provided
    a sufficiently wide range of the reference indicator is used. The effectiveness
    of in field NIR spectroscopy to discriminate between the two sides of the leaf
    (adaxial vs abaxial) and to be influenced by the leaf side measured was investigated.
    The PCA analysis confirmed the findings obtained by other researchers, who revealed
    a separation between the two leaf surfaces.18 While these authors reported improved
    prediction capability of abaxial models for Ψs assessment, our results evidenced
    superior performance for abaxial-derived models for RWC only, but not for Ψs.
    The importance of leaf surface on the collection of the NIR spectra has practical
    implications in the way that canopy reflectance is used to predict plant water
    status in remote sensing and even other studies implementing sensors on-the-go.
    In these applications, the adaxial surface of the leaves will be mainly measured,
    while only a minor proportion of the leaves will expose their abaxial surface.
    The findings obtained in this work have proved the suitability of NIR spectroscopy
    collected on any of the two leaf surfaces to yield reliable models for plant water
    status assessment. CONCLUSIONS The capability of non-invasive NIR spectroscopy
    to reliably evaluate the grapevine water status in vineyards planted with diverse
    genotypes, grown under different environmental conditions and water regimes was
    evidenced. Reliable prediction of classical indicators of plant water status,
    such as Ψs and RWC, was achieved from regression models based on the spectral
    information acquired on abaxial and adaxial sides of grapevine leaves in the range
    of 1600–2400 nm with a portable NIR spectrophotometer. The global models built
    using data obtained from different cultivars and vineyard sites indicate that
    a universal calibration, capable of assessing the plant water status for all varieties
    in diverse environments, can be built. NIR spectroscopy emerges as a suitable
    and promising tool for plant water status assessment, as it is a fast, non-invasive,
    easy to use method, capable of providing a large number of measurements, in order
    to appraise within-field variability of plant water status. Next steps to effectively
    implement NIR spectroscopy to irrigation scheduling should include the automation
    of contactless spectral acquisition. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work has received funding

    \ an overview of the use of remote sensing data, the development of spectral reflectance\
    \ indices for \ndetecting plant water stress, and the usefulness of field measurements\
    \ for ground-truthing purposes. Reliable measurements \nof plant water stress\
    \ over large areas are often required for management applications in the fields\
    \ of agriculture, forestry, \nconservation and land rehabilitation. The use of\
    \ remote sensing technologies and spectral reflectance data for determining \n\
    spatial patterns of plant water stress is widely described in the scientific literature.\
    \ Airborne, space-borne and hand-held \nremote sensing technologies are commonly\
    \ used to investigate the spectral responses of vegetation to plant stress. Earlier\
    \ \nstudies utilised multispectral sensors which commonly collect four to seven\
    \ spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared \nregion of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. Advances in sensor and image processor technology over the past 3\
    \ decades now \nallow for the simultaneous collection of several hundred narrow\
    \ spectral bands resulting in more detailed hyperspectral \ndata. The availability\
    \ of hyperspectral data has led to the identification of several spectral indices\
    \ that have been shown to \nbe useful in identifying plant stress. Such studies\
    \ have revealed strong linear relationships between plant pigment concen-\ntration\
    \ and the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, while plant water\
    \ content has been linked to specific bands \nin the short-wave infrared (SWIR)\
    \ region of the spectrum. Ground-truthing is essential to identifying useful reflectance\
    \ \ninformation for detecting plant water stress, and four commonly used ground-based\
    \ methods viz. predawn leaf water poten-\ntial, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence,\
    \ leaf pigment concentrations and leaf water content are reviewed for their, usefulness\
    \ and \npractical application.\nKeywords: leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf-water\
    \ content, plant pigment concentrations, plant water stress, \npredawn leaf water\
    \ potential, remote sensing\nIntroduction \nAll living organisms including plants\
    \ need an adequate sup-\nply of water to ensure both their growth and survival.\
    \ Water \nin plants is required to permit vital processes such as photo-\nsynthesis,\
    \ respiration and nutrient uptake.  Plants absorb water \nfrom the soil through\
    \ their roots, which is then transported to \ntheir stems, leaves and flowers\
    \ for the maintenance of the dif-\nferent vital processes.  When water supply\
    \ is insufficient, plants \nmay suffer water stress which could then compromise\
    \ their \ngrowth production, reproduction and survival.\nWater stress in plants\
    \ is a complex physiological response \nto the limited availability of water to\
    \ a plant. When plants \nsuffer from water stress, a series of harmful plant-water\
    \ inter-\nactions occur, which may disrupt a plant’s physiology. These \ninclude\
    \ a decrease in cell water potential, cell turgor and rela-\ntive water content\
    \ (Hsiao, 1973). \nThe available water to plants is usually expressed in terms\
    \ \nof water potential.  Water potential is commonly assessed by \nmeasuring predawn\
    \ leaf water potential; a direct measure of \nplant water stress. Measurements\
    \ at predawn directly evaluate \nthe water status of the plant, because during\
    \ night-time hours \nunder zero transpiration, plant water potential equilibrates\
    \ to the \navailable soil water (Cleary and Zaerr, 1984). Cleary and Zaerr \n\
    (1984) suggested that a predawn leaf water potential of less than \n-0.8 MPa is\
    \ an indication of stressed vegetation.  Indirect meas-\nurements may also be\
    \ used to detect plant water stress. The more \ncommonly used techniques include\
    \ measurements of relative leaf \nwater content, plant chlorophyll pigment content\
    \ and chlorophyll \nfluorescence. Other, less frequently applied measurements\
    \ used \nin verifying remote sensing studies include variations in trunk or \n\
    stem diameters or even xylem vessel characteristics. \nAlthough characterising\
    \ cavitations in xylem vessels is \npotentially a useful technique for understanding\
    \ the response to \nwater stress in a plant, this method is time-consuming, costly\
    \ \nand not suitable for use over large spatial scales. It has been \nshown in\
    \ many plant species that roots are more vulnerable to \ncavitation than stems,\
    \ and thus root cavitation is more suited \nto characterise plant water stress\
    \ between species (Sperry and \nSaliendra, 1994; Alder et al., 1996; Hacke and\
    \ Sauter, 1996; \nLinton et al., 1998).\nReliable detection and prediction of\
    \ plant water stress is \ndesirable for numerous agricultural, forestry, conservation\
    \ and \nland rehabilitation applications. Various remote and ground-\nbased technologies\
    \ are available for the measurement of plant \nwater stress. \nAvailable on website\

    Remote sensing technologies which utilise spectral reflect-\nance data have increasingly\
    \ been used for determining spatial \npatterns of plant water stress (Yamasaki\
    \ and Dillenburg,  1999; \nCeccato et al., 2001; Sims and Gamon, 2002; Pu et al.,\

    \ include cost-effec-\ntiveness, efficiency in displaying spatial patterns at\
    \ a variety of \nscales, and versatility in revealing a variety of structural\
    \ and \nphysiological characteristics of water-stressed plants.  Despite \nnumerous\
    \ successful case studies, the selection of suitable \nremote sensing methodologies\
    \ and reflectance algorithms \nremains difficult, due to the influence of vegetation\
    \ diversity \nand site conditions on vegetation spectral reflectance.\nThis paper\
    \ reviews the detection of plant water stress using \nremote sensing technologies\
    \ and ground-based techniques \ncommonly used to identify water stress in plants\
    \ and which are \nsuitable for ground-truthing remotely-sensed imagery. Within\
    \ \nthe scope of this review, no distinction is made between the \ntechnologies\
    \ used for acquiring the remote sensing data, but \nrather the focus is on highlighting\
    \ vegetative spectral sensi-\ntivities which have been used to detect plant water\
    \ stress. The \nground-based techniques reviewed are based on measurements \n\
    of predawn leaf water potential (Dixon, 1914), leaf chlorophyll \nfluorescence\
    \ (Muller, 1874), leaf water content (Weatherley, \n1950) and leaf pigment concentrations\
    \ (Lichtenthaler, 1987).  \nDetection of plant water stress using remote \nsensing\
    \ \nThe application of remote sensing technologies for plant and \nenvironmental\
    \ studies became widespread during the 1980s.  \nThese studies made use of low\
    \ spatial and spectral resolu-\ntion (60 m to 80 m and 4 spectral bands) multispectral\
    \ data. \nMultispectral remote sensing data commonly consist of 4 to \n7 broad\
    \ spectral bands in the visible (VIS) and near infrared \n(NIR) regions of the\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum.  These data-\nsets were acquired using airborne, satellite\
    \ and ground-based \nspectrometers. Early airborne systems consisted of a multispec-\n\
    tral camera mounted on board a light aircraft. Spectrometers at \nthis time were\
    \ bulky, heavy instruments which were not easily \ntransportable in the field;\
    \ therefore most measurements were \ntaken in laboratories. \nRemote sensing technologies\
    \ have advanced signifi-\ncantly over the past 10 to 15 years. With the development\
    \ of \nhyperspectral remote sensing technologies, researchers have \nbenefited\
    \ from significant improvements in the spectral and \nspatial properties of the\
    \ data, allowing for more detailed plant \nand environmental studies.  These technologies\
    \ acquire many \nhundreds of spectral bands across the spectrum from 400 nm \n\
    to 2 500 nm, using satellite, airborne or hand-held devices. The \nCasi or Hymap\
    \ airborne imagers are examples of commonly \nused hyperspectral imagers which\
    \ acquire high spectral and \nspatial resolution images. A distinct advantage\
    \ of most air-\nborne imagers is their capability to acquire at least 200 or more\
    \ \nspectral bands at less than 5 m spatial resolution. Advances in \nspectrometry\
    \ have also resulted in state-of-the-art portable field \ninstruments which allow\
    \ for the collection of hand-held hyper-\nspectral signatures. The Hyperion sensor\
    \ is currently the only \nhyperspectral satellite system available for research.\
    \ \nIn recent years, there has been an expanding body of \nliterature concerning\
    \ the relationship between the spectral \nreflectance properties of vegetation\
    \ and the structural charac-\nteristics of vegetation and pigment concentration\
    \ in leaves. The \nspectral characteristics of vegetation are governed primarily\
    \ \nby scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf inter-\nnal structure\
    \ and biochemical constituents, such as pigments, \nwater, nitrogen, cellulose\
    \ and lignin (Asner, 1998; Coops et \nal., 2002).  Pigments are the main determinants\
    \ controlling \nthe spectral responses of leaves in the visible wavelengths \n\
    (Gaussman, 1977).  Chlorophyll pigment content, in particular, \nis directly associated\
    \ with photosynthetic capacity and produc-\ntivity (Gaussman, 1977; Curran et\
    \ al., 1992). Reduced concen-\ntrations of chlorophyll are indicative of plant\
    \ stress (Curran \net al., 1992). On the other hand, cellular structure and water\
    \ \ncontent of leaves are the main determinants in the near- and \nmid-infrared\
    \ wavelengths as shown in Fig. 1.\nA summary of important findings since the early\
    \ 1980s \nwhich highlights specific regions of the electromagnetic \nspectrum\
    \ and their relation to vegetation spectral reflectance \nproperties is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Many of the earlier stud-\nies focused on broad spectral bands such\
    \ as the VIS and NIR \nregions (350 nm to 1 300 nm), which could be used in vegeta-\n\
    tion studies. More recent work has highlighted the importance \nof more specific\
    \ narrow-band regions such as the red edge \n(maximum slope of vegetation reflectance\
    \ from 690 nm to 740 \nnm) for predicting plant stress (Clay et al., 2006; Fitzgerald\
    \ et \nal., 2006; Blackburn, 2007; Campbell et al., 2007). The extent \nof the\
    \ literature is indicative of the importance of relation-\nships between plant\
    \ stress and both plant chlorophyll and water \ncontent.  Plant chlorophyll and\
    \ water content have thus been \nused as ‘surrogates’ of plant stress, under the\
    \ assumption that \ndecreases in chlorophyll and water content are indicative\
    \ of \nplant stress.  Numerous individual spectral bands and vegeta-\ntion spectral\
    \ reflectance indices have been identified for use in \npredicting plant chlorophyll\
    \ content and water content.\nSpectral indicators of plant chlorophyll content\n\
    In stressed vegetation, leaf chlorophyll content decreases, \nthereby changing\
    \ the proportion of light-absorbing pig-\nments, leading to a reduction in the\
    \ overall absorption of light \n(Murtha, 1982; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2000). These\
    \ changes affect \nthe spectral reflectance signatures of plants through a reduction\
    \ \nin green reflection and an increase in red and blue reflections, \nresulting\
    \ in changes in the normal spectral reflectance pat-\nterns of plants (Murtha,\
    \ 1982; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2000). Thus, \n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n400 600 800\

    \ = Water SA Vol. 35 No. 5 October 2009\n745\nIndices have been derived using\
    \ a combination of specific \nreflectance wavelengths for the remote assessment\
    \ of chloro-\nphyll content (Curran et al., 1990; Jacquemoud, 1993; Baret \nand\
    \ Jacquemoud, 1994; Baret et al., 1994; Filella and Penuelas, \n1994; Gitelson\
    \ and Merzylak, 1996; Lichtenthaler et al., 1996; \nBlackburn, 1998a; Blackburn,\
    \ 1998b; Lelong et al., (1998); \nBlackburn, 1999; Datt, 1999; Stone et al., 2001;\
    \ Coops et al., \n2003). These indices have been typically derived through cor-\n\
    relations between leaf reflectance and leaf chlorophyll content, \nand are often\
    \ developed for a single species with constant leaf \nsize and shape, leaf surface\
    \ and internal structure (Datt, 1999). \nHowever, the relationship between chlorophyll\
    \ content and leaf \nor canopy reflectance is not necessarily generic and caution\
    \ \nneeds to be taken when applying these indices over different \nvegetation\
    \ types or biomes for the prediction of plant water \nstress (Coops et al., 2003).\
    \  \nIn the remote assessment of plant water stress, total chlo-\nrophyll and\
    \ chlorophyll a content have been identified as key \nspectral indicators. Chlorophyll\
    \ a absorbs strongly in the red \nwavelengths because of electron transitions\
    \ of the chlorophyll \nmolecules. As the chlorophyll concentration increases,\
    \ there \nis an apparent displacement in the slope of the spectral curve \nin\
    \ the red wavelengths towards longer wavelengths (Horler et \nal., 1983). However,\
    \ in a stressed plant there is a shift towards \nshorter wavelengths, often reported\
    \ as the ‘blue shift’ (Carter, \n1993).\nThe interdependence of chlorophyll a\
    \ and total chlorophyll \nprovide an appropriate measure of changes in spectral\
    \ reflect-\nance due to plant water stress. If the relative proportion of \nchlorophyll\
    \ a were to increase there would be a movement of \nthe red edge to longer wavelengths,\
    \ independent of total chlo-\nrophyll content. Likewise, a decrease in the relative\
    \ proportion \nof chlorophyll a would result in a movement of the red edge to\
    \ \nshorter wavelengths, also independent of total chlorophyll con-\ntent. However,\
    \ the effect of a changing chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio \non the red edge\
    \ is likely to be minor and has proved difficult to \nobserve compared to the\
    \ effect of the total chlorophyll content \n(Guyot and Baret, 1988). Therefore,\
    \ red reflectance is consid-\nered a reliable metric for total chlorophyll content\
    \ and changes \nin leaf pigments (Horler et al., 1983). \nWhen chlorophyll content\
    \ is used as a measure of plant \nwater stress, the placement and shape of the\
    \ spectral red edge \nare important indicators of plant water stress (Horler et\
    \ al., \n1983, Curran et al., 1990, Blackburn, 1999; Blackburn, 2007). \nThis\
    \ relationship is used to explain the movement of the red \nedge to shorter wavelengths\
    \ during different expressions of \nplant water stress, such as senescence or\
    \ stress-induced chlo-\nrosis (Collins et al., 1983; Rock et al., 1988; Milton\
    \ and Mouat, \n1989; Clay et al., 2006; Campbell et al., 2007). \nSpectral indicators\
    \ of plant water content\nPlant water content at the leaf and canopy scales is\
    \ often \nestimated using specific spectral reflectance bands and spectral \n\
    reflectance indices from near infrared, middle infrared (MIR) \nand short-wave\
    \ infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic \nspectrum (Tucker, 1980; Hunt\
    \ and Rock, 1989; Gao, 1995; \nZarco-Tejada et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2004;\
    \ Shen et al., \n2005; Chun-Jiang et al., 2006). \nNIR and MIR spectral bands\
    \ are highly correlated to water \ncontent of vegetation and soils (Tucker, 1980;\
    \ Hunt and Rock, \n1989; Musick and Pelletier, 1986; 1988). Spectral bands from\
    \ \nthese regions have been used to delineate stressed trees from \nnon-stressed\
    \ trees (Tucker, 1980; Hunt and Rock, 1989; Musick \nand Pelletier, 1986; 1988).\
    \ In these regions of the electromag-\nnetic spectrum, leaf water content has\
    \ been remotely assessed \nusing bands 1 550 nm to 1 750 nm (Tucker, 1980), as\
    \ well as the \nratio of spectral bands 1 550 nm to 1 750 nm and 2 080 to 2 350\
    \ \nnm (Musick and Pelletier, 1986; 1988). However, in laboratory \nexperiments\
    \ a good relationship was identified between water \ncontent, leaf area, and the\
    \ spectral index derived using 820 \nnm and 1 600 nm spectral reflectance bands\
    \ (Hunt and Rock, \n1989). In these experiments MIR reflectance increased with\
    \ \ndecreasing leaf water content in California oak, blue spruce, \nsoybean and\
    \ sweetgum (Hunt and Rock, 1989). \nIn the SWIR region (1 400 nm to 2 500 nm),\
    \ field meas-\nurements have shown significant changes to this region of the \n\
    spectrum resulting from changes in the water content of plants \n(Tucker, 1980;\
    \ Ceccato et al., 2001). Several relationships have \nbeen identified between\
    \ specific spectral bands in the SWIR \nregion and different ground-based measurements\
    \ of plant water \nstress such as relative water content, leaf water potential,\
    \ sto-\nmatal conductance, and cell wall elasticity (Foutry and Baret, \n1997;\
    \ Pu et al., 2003). In particular, Foutry and Baret (1997) \nreported that the\
    \ spectral wavelengths at 1 530 nm and 1 720 \nnm are most appropriate for assessing\
    \ plant water content in \nboth woody and herbaceous plant species. \nSeveral\
    \ spectral indices have been derived to detect \nchanges in plant water content\
    \ for the remote assessment of \nplant water stress. The sensitivity of such spectral\
    \ indices to \nchanges in plant water content is influenced by the internal leaf\
    \ \nstructure. Therefore, some spectral indices may not be suitable \nfor the\
    \ detection of low or moderate levels of plant water stress \n(Eitel et al., 2006).\
    \ Two spectral indices that have been suc-\ncessfully used are the normalised\
    \ difference water index (Gao, \n1995) and water band index (Penuelas et al.,\
    \ 1995). \nThe normalised difference water index (Gao, 1995) is \ncommonly used\
    \ and accepted as an accurate estimate of plant \nwater content. This index consists\
    \ of the ratio of the difference \nbetween reflectance measured at 860 nm and\
    \ 1 240 nm, and the \nsum of reflectance measured at 860 nm and 1 240 nm respec-\n\
    tively (Gao, 1995). At these narrowband wavelengths, vegeta-\ntion canopies have\
    \ similar radiation-scattering properties, but \nslightly different liquid water\
    \ absorption properties. Therefore, \nthis index has been successfully applied\
    \ to remotely detect \nplant water content for various tree species (Gao, 1995;\
    \ Jackson \net al., 2004; Stimson et al., 2005; Eitel et al., 2006).  \nThe water\
    \ band index is derived from the ratio of reflect-\nance measured at 900 nm and\
    \ 970 nm (Penuelas et al., 1995). \nThis spectral index has been correlated with\
    \ ground-based \nmeasurements of plant water content at both the leaf and \ncanopy\
    \ scales. It is, however, more sensitive to leaf water con-\ntent than the water\
    \ content of the whole plant.  This is advanta-\ngeous in agricultural applications,\
    \ where leaf water content \nchanges more noticeably in response to drought conditions\
    \ than \nthe water content of the entire plant foliage (Champagne et al., \n2003).\n\
    Factors affecting spectral reflectance from leaf \nto canopy scales \nThe levels\
    \ of spectral reflectance from a plant leaf or canopy \nare determined by a variety\
    \ of factors.  The factors that play \na role in the spectral reflectance from\

    \ a pixel is \nlikely to introduce uncertainties when processing and applying\
    \ \nremote sensing imagery at different spatial resolutions (Jiang et \nal., 2006).\n\
    Spectral data collected at the leaf scale usually contain the \nleast amount of\
    \ variability and are most easily correlated to \nground-truthing experiments\
    \ at the same spatial scale. Ground-\ntruthing in conjunction with remote sensing\
    \ surveys is often \nundertaken at the leaf scale, due to the complexity of ground-\n\
    truthing at larger spatial scales, and the difficulty in accounting \nfor the\
    \ significant variability in canopy reflectance. Therefore, \nspectral features\
    \ and relationships which have been identified \nat the leaf scale in such studies\
    \ have often also been applied \ngenerically at canopy and landscape scales (Mohammed\
    \ et al., \n1997; Datt, 1999; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2000; Coops et al., 2003).\
    \ \nDespite the difficulty in reproducing canopy reflectance, \nattempts have\
    \ been made by stacking leaves on top of each other \nfor below-canopy spectral\
    \ measurements (Blackburn, 1999; Datt, \n1999; Coops et al., 2003). The disadvantage\
    \ of the leaf-stacking \nmethod is that it is unable to represent the absolute\
    \ radiation \ninteractions which occur at the canopy scale. It also fails to \n\
    replicate, for example, canopy architecture, leaf angle distribu-\ntion, the reflectance\
    \ of trunks and branches, and the contribu-\ntion of the wider canopy outside\
    \ of the instrument field of view. \nThus, its use is limited. It does, however,\
    \ assist in controlling the \nimpact of variables such as background reflectance,\
    \ irradiation \nlevels and sun-target-sensor geometry which do affect spectral\
    \ \nreflectance measurements of the canopy scale. \nThe removal of atmospheric\
    \ and background interferences \nis necessary when processing remote sensing data.\
    \ Various \ntypes of calibration models can be applied depending upon the \nquantity\
    \ and quality of calibration data recorded during the \nremote sensing acquisition\
    \ surveys. Alternatively, the removal \nof atmospheric and background interferences\
    \ could be omitted \nwhen vegetation spectral reflectance indices, which account\
    \ \nfor differences in atmospheric and background effects, were \napplied in sparsely\
    \ vegetated environments (Giannico, 2004). \nFurthermore, the magnitude of atmospheric\
    \ and background \ninterferences is greater as spatial resolution decreases from\
    \ \nground to stand and canopy levels; and spectral resolution \nincreases from\
    \ multispectral to hyperspectral data.\nDetection of plant water stress using\
    \ ground-\nbased measurements \nSimple and quick ground-truthing methods which\
    \ utilise port-\nable instruments are needed for the measurement of plant water\
    \ \nstress. Commonly used techniques address aspects of the plant \nwater status\
    \ and plant pigment concentration.\nPredawn leaf water potential\nPredawn leaf\
    \ water potential measurements, often undertaken \nwith a pressure chamber, are\
    \ useful for determining plant water \nstress. At predawn, xylem water potential\
    \ has equilibrated with \nsoil water potential after a night of negligible transpiration.\
    \ At \nthis time, plant water potential is usually at its minimum for the \nday\
    \ (Cleary and Zaerr, 1984). \nThe pressure chamber is most commonly used for estimat-\n\
    ing leaf water potential, having the advantage of simplicity, \nreliability, instantaneous\
    \ measurements, low capital cost and \nportability (Scholander et al., 1965; Boyer,\
    \ 1968; Ritchie and \nHinckley, 1975). The equipment design has not changed sig-\n\
    nificantly over the past 4 decades since Scholander et al. (1965) \nused this\
    \ technique to measure the water relations of trees and \nshrubs. Manual operation\
    \ is still required, therefore this tech-\nnique is considered slow and time-consuming\
    \ for any commer-\ncial or operational applications (Jones, 2004). \nMeasurement\
    \ of predawn leaf water potential has gained \nwide acceptance among researchers.\
    \ It is commonly used as \na plant water stress indicator (Aranda et al., 2005;\
    \ Nortes et \nal., 2005; Intrigliolo and Castel, 2006; Pellegrino et al., 2006)\
    \ \nand has also been used to describe the water status of different \nspecies\
    \ within a habitat (Scholander et al., 1965; Lamont and \nWitkowski, 1995). Predawn\
    \ leaf water potentials have been \nshown to differ among species in the same\
    \ habitat (Witkowski \net al., 1992; Lamont and Witkowski, 1995), within a species\
    \ \nacross different habitats, and with leaf age (Witkowski et al., \n1992) and\
    \ within a species across different plant sizes (Lamont \net al., 1994). Typical\
    \ plant water potential measurements of \nunstressed plants range from -0.15 MPa\
    \ for plants under satu-\nrated soil conditions and low atmospheric demand (Cleary\
    \ and \nZaerr, 1984) to -2.0 MPa for ‘tank’ plants such as cactus, which \ncan\
    \ store water (Scholander et al., 1965). Conversely, stressed \nplants such as\
    \ creosote bush and juniper growing in more \narid regions could achieve plant\
    \ water potentials of -8.0 MPa \n(Scholander et al., 1965), while for desert plants\
    \ it can be much \nhigher. Predawn leaf water potential measurements have also\
    \ \nbeen successfully used in agricultural applications to evaluate \nplant water\
    \ stress. Such applications have included estimates of \ntranspiration of soil\
    \ water and assessments of crop water stress \nresulting from irrigation scheduling\
    \ of grapevine field sites and \nfruit orchards (Intrigliolo and Castel, 2006;\
    \ Pellegrino et al., \n2006). Predawn leaf water potentials have also been coupled\
    \ \nwith stem water potential measurements and fluctuations in \ntrunk diameters\
    \ to quantify water stress of young almond trees \nfor irrigation management (Nortes\
    \ et al., 2005). \nDespite the wide application of predawn pressure chamber \n\
    measurements, numerous sources of error and measurement \nproblems have been identified\
    \ (Ritchie and Hinckley, 1975). \nThese need to be minimised in order to ensure\
    \ accurate read-\nings, and can be grouped into 4 categories, viz. speed of meas-\n\
    urement in the field; appropriate selection and processing of \nsamples; reduction\
    \ in pressurisation problems with the cham-\nber; and correct identification of\
    \ the end point. \nIn the field, speed of measurement is of major importance.\
    \ \nMoisture loss between time of sampling and measurement \nmust be minimised\
    \ (Ritchie and Hinckley, 1975; Turner, 1988; \nCampbell, 1990; Hsiao, 1990; Smith\
    \ and Prichard, 2003). \nMeasurements should take place directly after excision\
    \ of \nthe plant sample. If this is not possible, samples should be \nenclosed\
    \ in plastic bags immediately after cutting and stored \nin a cool dark place\
    \ until required. However, if time-delays \noccur between predawn sampling and\
    \ actual measurements, \nthis could result in inaccurate measurements (Clear and\
    \ Zaerr, \n1984; Turner, 1988).\nGreat care should be taken in selecting and processing\
    \ \nsamples. It is important to standardise the sampling process \nAvailable on\

    747\nwith respect to leaf age and development stages when making \na comparison\
    \ between plant species (Witkowski et al., 1992). \nDamaged samples (crushed leaf\
    \ petiole or torn leaf blades) and \nre-cutting of sample stems (Scholander et\
    \ al., 1965), lead to \na break in the tension in the xylem water, and should\
    \ thus be \navoided (Clear and Zaerr, 1984; Turner, 1988). Furthermore, the \n\
    portion of the leaf or stem external to the seal in the pressure \nchamber unit\
    \ must be minimised to reduce exclusion errors \n(Miller and Hansen, 1975; Hsiao,\
    \ 1990). \nSeveral technical guidelines must be adhered to in order to \nreduce\
    \ pressurisation problems within the chamber. Failure to \nachieve pressure equilibrium\
    \ should be addressed by ensuring \nthat the seal used in the pressure chamber\
    \ is made of rubber \nthat is sufficiently elastic to fill the indentations of\
    \ irregularly \nshaped petioles, but not so soft that it disintegrates under \n\
    pressure. For very irregular petioles, a quick-setting silicon \ncompound can\
    \ be used.  However, this slows down the number \nof leaves that can be measured\
    \ (Turner, 1988). High-pressure \ngrease or a silicon adhesive compound should\
    \ be used on \nthe stopper to prevent or reduce leakage and to prevent leaf \n\
    damage.  Studies on the optimal rates of pressurisation of the \nchamber and the\
    \ effects of rapid pressure and heat build-up \nwithin the chamber have shown\
    \ that fast rates of pressurisa-\ntion can lead to both underestimates or overestimates\
    \ of water \npotential depending on the gradients of water potential in the \n\
    sample (Waring and Cleary, 1967; Blum et al., 1973; Tyree and \nDainty, 1973;\
    \ Turner, 1981). Therefore, Turner (1981) suggested \nan average pressurisation\
    \ rate of 0.025 MPa∙s-1. Furthermore, \ncaution must be taken in the use of the\
    \ compressed gas within \nthe pressure chamber. Pressure-release valves protect\
    \ the \npressure gauges and also help prevent over-pressurisation of \nthe chamber\
    \ (Turner, 1988). A binocular microscope or safety \nglasses should be used to\
    \ protect the operator’s eyes if any \nmaterial is forced out through the seal\
    \ during pressurisation \n(Turner, 1988). \nCorrect identification of the endpoint,\
    \ when the xylem sap \njust returns to the cut surface of the xylem, is critical\
    \ for accu-\nrate estimation of the water potential (Ritchie and Hinckley, \n\
    1975; Turner, 1988; Campbell, 1990; Hsiao, 1990; Smith and \nPrichard, 2003).\
    \ Use of a binocular microscope or magnifying \nglass may be necessary to minimise\
    \ poor endpoint recognition.\nField equipment required for leaf water potential\
    \ measure-\nments is relatively easy to set up within a specific location, but\
    \ \ncan be cumbersome when there are many sample sites which \nare not in close\
    \ proximity to each other. When accounting for \nthe time required for setting\
    \ up of the instrument, gathering of \nsamples and the actual measurement at predawn,\
    \ only a limited \nnumber of measurements is possible within this timeframe. \n\
    Therefore, from a practical view point this method would be \nmore appropriate\
    \ for localised measurements, as compared to \nlarge-scale measurements. \nLeaf\
    \ chlorophyll fluorescence\nOver the past decade, chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics\
    \ has \nbeen used more extensively to provide considerable informa-\ntion on the\
    \ organisation and function of the photosynthetic \napparatus (Govindjee et al.,\
    \ 1981). Information is gathered more \nreadily and repeatedly outside the laboratory\
    \ using portable \noptical systems and compact chlorophyll fluorescence meters.\n\
    The functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus is depend-\nent on the process\
    \ of photosynthesis, whereby light energy \nis absorbed and converted into organic\
    \ compounds. Several \nenvironmental factors, including water, light and nutrients,\
    \ \naffect this process and may lead to plant stress. Therefore, \nthe photosynthetic\
    \ apparatus has been recognised as being a \ngood indicator of stress and stress\
    \ adaptation of a plant and is \nassociated with the measurement of chlorophyll\
    \ fluorescence \n(Salisbury and Ross, 1992; Strasser and Tsmilli-Michael, 2001;\
    \ \nStrasser et al., 2001).  Also, because changes in chlorophyll \nfluorescence\
    \ may occur before any physical signs of tissue or \nchlorophyll deterioration\
    \ are manifested in the plant, stress can \nbe detected before the onset of physical\
    \ damage (Lichtenthaler \net al., 2007).\nChlorophyll fluorescence measurements\
    \ can be described \nusing the typical phases of a temporary fluorescence signal\
    \ \nor transient. During a typical fluorescence transient, the fluo-\nrescence\
    \ rises rapidly from a ground state, O (or Fo) initial or \nminimal fluorescence,\
    \ when all electron acceptors are fully \noxidised, or open, to a maximum level,\
    \ P (or Fm), when all \nelectron acceptors are highly reduced, or closed and are\
    \ unable \nto accept and transfer electrons (Rolando and Little, 2003).  \nVarious\
    \ parameters representing subsequent phases in a typi-\ncal fluorescence transient\
    \ can yield information on how stress \naffects the functioning of the photosynthetic\
    \ system (Strasser et \nal., 2001; Rolando and Little, 2003). Photochemical efficiency\
    \ \nis a common parameter used to assess the effect of environ-\nmental stresses\
    \ on the photosynthetic mechanism (Strasser \nand Tsmilli-Michael, 2001). The\
    \ photochemical efficiency \nof Photosystem II (PSII) is estimated by Fv/Fm, which\
    \ is the \nratio of variable fluorescence (Fv) to maximum fluorescence \n(Fm).\
    \ Most healthy plants exhibit Fv/Fm values of around 0.8 \n(Peterson et al., 2001).\n\
    In most studies on the applications of chlorophyll fluores-\ncence, the Fv/Fm\
    \ ratio is used as an indicator of water stress \n(Govindjee et al., 1981; Havaux\
    \ and Lannoye, 1983; Ögren, \n1990; Van Rensburg et al., 1996; Van der Mescht\
    \ et al., 1997; \nLu and Zhang, 1999; Peterson et al., 2001; Rolando and Little,\
    \ \n2003; Cifre et al., 2005). In these studies, it has been well docu-\nmented\
    \ that at the chloroplast level, the function of the thyla-\nkoid membrane is\
    \ sensitive to environmental stress (Öquist, \n1987). Studies which have focused\
    \ on deep-rooted exotic \ntree species have suggested that a decrease in Fv/Fm\
    \ is due to \ndrought-induced injury to the thylakoid structures affecting \n\
    photosynthetic electron transport (Van Rensburg et al., 1996; \nVan der Mescht\
    \ et al., 1997; Lu and Zhang, 1999). These results \nindicated that Fv/Fm of drought-stressed\
    \ trees was lower than \nthe control trees, especially in the more drought-intolerant\
    \ \ntrees. Van Rensburg et al. (1996) found that the decrease in \nFv/Fm was due\
    \ largely to an increase in Fo, an indication of \npermanent damage to the PSII.\
    \ PSII appears to be particularly \nsensitive to a number of stress factors including\
    \ freezing tem-\nperatures and drought (Öquist and Wass, 1988). Rolando and \n\
    Little (2003) also showed a decrease in Fv/Fm of water-stressed \nEucalyptus grandis\
    \ seedlings, resulting from a rise in Fo and a \ndecrease in Fm. Since this ratio\
    \ is a reflection of the maximum \nyield of primary photochemistry, Fv/Fm is also\
    \ used as an indi-\ncator of tree or seedling vigour.\nWater stress leads to several\
    \ other changes in the photo-\nsynthetic apparatus of plants. Low water potential\
    \ has been \nobserved to cause a decrease in the quantum yield of O2 \nevolution\
    \ in chloroplasts and leaves from sunflower plants; \na decrease in the ability\
    \ of the coupling factor isolated from \nspinach leaves to bind fluorescent nucleotides;\
    \ and a decrease \nin the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fluorescence in\
    \ \nthe red algae Porphyrs sanjuanesis (Govindjee et al., 1981). \nData presented\

    \ and Tolmiea menziesii, \nsuggest that water stress blocks electron flow to the\
    \ reaction \ncentre chlorophyll a of PSII (Govindjee et al. (1981). It was \n\
    clear from these results that the ratio of maximum to minimum \nfluorescence decreases\
    \ from a high value of 4.0 in well-watered \nNerium oleander plants (water potential\
    \ -0.8 MPa) to a low \nvalue of 1.1 in a severely stressed plant (water potential\
    \ -3.9 \nMPa). In all cases examined, the ratio decreased as the water \npotential\
    \ decreased. Because of these results, Govindjee et al. \n(1981) concluded that\
    \ water stress inhibited electron flow of \nPSII in the 3 species examined, and\
    \ that this ratio serves as a \nqualitative indicator of leaf water potential.\n\
    The use of chlorophyll fluorescence ratios as an index of \nplant water stress\
    \ has gained increasing acceptance in recent \nyears, and is commonly measured\
    \ using hand-held relatively \nlow-cost portable instruments which are simple,\
    \ rapid and non-\ndestructive (Peterson et al., 2001; Strasser et al., 2001; Strasser\
    \ \nand Tsmilli-Michael, 2001; Rolando and Little, 2003; Cifre \net al., 2005;\
    \ Lichtenthaler et al., 2007). With the development \nof an internal saturating\
    \ light source in portable field fluores-\ncence meters, chlorophyll fluorescence\
    \ measurements can now \nbe undertaken at any time of the day, from shaded or\
    \ sunlit \nsamples.\nChlorophyll fluorescence measurements can be used in \nconjunction\
    \ with other techniques as a relatively quick initial \nscreening method for assessing\
    \ plant stress within a localised \narea. There have also been significant advances\
    \ in the applica-\ntion of chlorophyll fluorescence at larger spatial scales over\
    \ the \npast decade, allowing for spatial detection of chlorophyll fluo-\nrescence\
    \ parameters using laser-based fluorometers (Ounis et \nal., 2001; Cifre et al.,\
    \ 2005). Such technological improvements \nin chlorophyll fluorescence measurements\
    \ would complement \nthe ground-truthing of remote sensing imagery. However, fur-\n\
    ther investigations are needed to establish its applicability for \ndifferent\
    \ crops under different conditions (Cifre et al., 2005). \nA disadvantage is that\
    \ these instruments have not yet been \ndesigned for commercial or operational\
    \ use.\nChlorophyll and carotenoid pigment concentration\nPlant pigment concentrations\
    \ vary with species, ecotype and \nphenology, and are also affected by season\
    \ and various kinds \nof natural and anthropogenic stresses (Gitelson and Merzylak,\
    \ \n1997). Healthy plants, those capable of maximum growth, are \ngenerally expected\
    \ to have higher chlorophyll pigment concen-\ntrations than unhealthy plants.\
    \ Reduced chlorophyll concentra-\ntions are often associated with stressed plants,\
    \ with variations \nin total chlorophyll to carotenoid ratios used as stress indicators\
    \ \n(Netto et al., 2005; Lichtenthaler et al., 2007). Carotenoids play \nan important\
    \ role in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus, \nand regulate the flow of\
    \ energy into and out of the photosyn-\nthetic system (Sims and Gamon, 2002; Netto\
    \ et al., 2005). Two \ncommonly used approaches have been adopted to quantify\
    \ \nchlorophyll and carotenoid pigment concentrations in plants, \nviz. conventional\
    \ chemical methods and field chlorophyll \nmeters. Conventional chemical methods\
    \ of pigment quanti-\nfication require destructive sampling and time-consuming\
    \ \nlaboratory analyses, whereas chlorophyll meters are simple, \nportable field\
    \ instruments which permit rapid non-destructive \nmeasurements. \nConventional\
    \ analytical chemistry methods used for \nestimating chlorophyll and carotenoid\
    \ pigment concentrations \nare seen to be most accurate, provided that correct\
    \ sampling \nand laboratory procedures are followed. These methods make \nuse\
    \ of spectrophotometry to estimate pigment concentrations \nin plant extractions\
    \ from the linear absorption characteristics \nof these pigments in polar extractants\
    \ at specific wavelengths.  \nConcentrations are calculated taking cognisance\
    \ of the extract-\nant and the specific extinction coefficients as described in\
    \ \nLichtenthaler (1987). Two precautions are recommended when \nsampling and\
    \ during laboratory analysis: rapid and efficient \ncollection of samples which\
    \ must be immediately frozen using \nliquid nitrogen to prevent pigment deterioration,\
    \ and mini-\nmal loss of pigment during laboratory extraction and dilution \n\
    procedures in order to reduce the variability of the results. If \nthe research\
    \ is taking place in remote areas, liquid nitrogen can \nbe substituted with sufficient\
    \ dry ice or ice packs (Curran et al., \n1990; Datt, 1998; Pinkard et al., 2006).\
    \ \nChlorophyll meters are portable field instruments that allow \nfor non-destructive\
    \ repetitive sampling; they have successfully \nbeen used to estimate the chlorophyll\
    \ content of many plant \nspecies (Schaper and Chacko, 1991; Netto et al., 2005;\
    \ Pinkard \net al., 2006). A chlorophyll index derived from two peak \nreflectance\
    \ wavelengths, 650 nm and 940 nm, is used to esti-\nmate the observed chlorophyll\
    \ content in a sample. However, \nseveral factors such as different plant species,\
    \ leaf weight, \nleaf age and growing conditions may affect the relationship \n\
    between the chlorophyll index and actual chlorophyll concen-\ntration. Therefore,\
    \ calibration curves are required for many \nspecies, site and experimental conditions\
    \ (Pinkard et al., 2006).\nLeaf-water content\nRelative leaf water content is\
    \ an indirect and gross estimate \nof the changes in the water content in leaves\
    \ (Canny and \nHuang, 2006). Most water in leaves resides in mesophyll cells.\
    \ \nVolumetric changes in these cells occur as the balance shifts \nbetween the\
    \ rate of evaporation from leaves and the rate of \nwater supply to the leaves.\
    \ Volumetric changes in the leaves of \nplants affect many internal plant conditions\
    \ such as tension in \nthe cell walls, exchange of water and carbon dioxide across\
    \ cell \nmembranes, osmotic pressure of vacuole contents, cell and tis-\nsue turgor,\
    \ cell-to-cell contact and transport of water. \nMeasurements of the relative\
    \ water content of leaf tissue \nare commonly used to assess the water status\
    \ of plants (Barrs \nand Weatherley, 1962; Catsky, 1969; Turner, 1981; Joly, 1985;\
    \ \nYamasaki and Dillenburg, 1999; Shen et al., 2005; Canny and \nHuang, 2006).\
    \ Relative leaf water content is expressed as the \nratio of three weight determinations\
    \ viz. fresh weight; dry \nweight and turgid weight of the leaf sample. It is\
    \ calculated \nas the ratio of fresh weight minus dry weight to turgid weight\
    \ \nminus dry weight. \nIt is mportant that sampling procedures are meticulous\
    \ \nto prevent evaporative losses of water from the leaf samples \n(Barrs and\
    \ Weatherley, 1962; Catsky, 1969; Turner, 1981; Joly, \n1985; Yamasaki and Dillenburg,\
    \ 1999; Shen et al., 2005; Canny \nand Huang, 2006). Samples must be stored immediately\
    \ in \nplastic bags and kept in a cool, dark place to reduce moisture \nloss prior\
    \ to fresh weight measurements. Furthermore, the \nvalidity of relative water\
    \ content measurements depends on the \nprecision of the three weight determinations;\
    \ a reliable estimate \nof turgid weight being the most critical (Joly, 1985).\n\
    A typical water absorption curve for a leaf shows a high \ninitial rate of absorption,\
    \ followed by a prolonged period of \nslow absorption (Yamasaki and Dillenburg,\
    \ 1999). The amount \nof water initially absorbed has been commonly interpreted\
    \ as \nbeing the amount of water needed to compensate for the water \ndeficit\
    \ of the plant tissue. Further water absorption is driven \nAvailable on website\

    by cell expansion, so that mass changes occurring during \nthis phase are not\
    \ used in the estimation of the relative water \ncontent of the sample. Therefore,\
    \ an accurate measurement of \nturgid weight should be determined at the end of\
    \ the first initial \nphase of water absorption (Yamasaki and Dillenburg, 1999).\
    \ \nWater absorption periods usually recommended for coni-\nfers range from 12\
    \ to 48 hours, which is much longer than the \n4 hour period usually required\
    \ for most broad leaved plants \n(Yamasaki and Dillenburg, 1999). To reduce water\
    \ absorption \nperiods, smaller leaf disks which absorb water more quickly \n\
    are commonly used instead of larger whole leaves (Barrs and \nWeatherley, 1962).\
    \ This method may however, also allow more \nwater infiltration through intercellular\
    \ spaces, thereby result-\ning in a greater water absorption per unit of leaf\
    \ mass, when \ncompared to absorption in whole leave (Barrs and Weatherley, \n\
    1962; Joly, 1985).\nMeasuring the relative leaf water content of plants is a \n\
    simple yet time-consuming process. Comparative measure-\nments between stressed\
    \ and unstressed plants should be under-\ntaken during the morning when differences\
    \ in water potentials \nbetween plants are greatest (Cleary and Zaerr, 1984).\
    \ Due to \nthese time constraints this method is most appropriate for local-\n\
    ised ground-truthing measurements.  \nComparison of ground-based measurement \n\
    techniques for measuring plant water stress\nIt has been suggested in this review\
    \ that all 4 ground-based \nmeasurements, viz. predawn leaf water potentials,\
    \ chlorophyll \nfluorescence, chlorophyll and carotenoid pigment concentra-\n\
    tions and leaf water content can be used successfully to meas-\nure or assess\
    \ plant water stress. However, these 4 methods are \nnot suitable for large spatial\
    \ scale sampling, and would be most \nuseful for localised studies or for localised\
    \ ground-truthing of \nremote sensing applications. Sampling protocols for ground-\n\
    truthing applications are dependent upon the spatial scales at \nwhich the remote\
    \ sensing studies are being undertaken, viz. \nleaf, canopy, stand or landscape\
    \ scale and, hence sample sizes \nwill differ accordingly. A summary of some of\
    \ the advantages \nand disadvantages of each ground-based method is listed in\
    \ \nTable 2.\nThese 4 ground-based measurements vary in their practi-\ncal use\
    \ as well as in the physiological processes measured. \nDifferences in these methods\
    \ as well as the processes meas-\nured may be affected by different sources of\
    \ variability, which \nin turn may affect the strength of the relationship to\
    \ spectral \nindices (Stimson et al., 2005). As a result, strong relationships\
    \ \nmay exist between certain ground measurements and spectral \nindices, while\
    \ others may be poorer for a specific plant spe-\ncies. For example the water\
    \ band index derived by Gao (1995) \nfocused on water content of vegetation and\
    \ therefore could be \nmore strongly correlated to leaf water content measurements\
    \ \nthan plant pigment concentrations and vice versa. \nDifferent ground-based\
    \ measurements of plant water stress \nmay be preferred depending upon the research\
    \ conditions under \nwhich a particular method is being applied. For airborne\
    \ and \nsatellite remote sensing vegetation studies, ground-truthing \ntechniques\
    \ which are cost effective, efficient and reliable and \ncan be applied over localised\
    \ ground-truthing regions within a \nreasonable time-frame of acquiring the remote\
    \ sensing images \nwould be preferred. Under such research conditions measure-\n\
    ments of chlorophyll fluorescence or leaf water content would \nbe more suited.\
    \  On the other hand, measurements of predawn \nleaf water potential or chlorophyll\
    \ pigment concentrations \ncould be used for smaller-scale intensive sampling.\
    \ However, \nshould costs be constraining factor predawn leaf water \nTable 2\n\

    \ \nanalyses of plant chlorophyll pigment concentrations. \nIn summary it is recommended\
    \ that a more complete but \npractical approach to assessing plant water stress\
    \ is adopted. \nAt least one ground-based technique such as plant pigment \nconcentrations,\
    \ chlorophyll fluorescence or relative leaf water \ncontent should be used for\
    \ localised ground-truthing measure-\nments to identify gradients in plant water\
    \ stress, followed by \nintensive predawn leaf water potential measurements along\
    \ \nthese gradients to identify the extremes in plant water stress. \nConcluding\
    \ remarks\nThis review demonstrates that there has been extensive \nresearch on\
    \ the detection and measurement of plant water \nstress using ground-based and\
    \ remote sensing technologies. \nGround-based techniques are more suited for localised\
    \ meas-\nurements and for ground-truthing of remotely sensed data. \nRemote sensing\
    \ research has identified several individual \nspectral bands and vegetation spectral\
    \ reflectance indices \nwhich have been used to detect plant water stress. Many\
    \ of \nthe earlier studies have focused on broad spectral bandwidths \nand it\
    \ is recommended that plant stress researchers utilise \nthe spectral findings\
    \ to further investigate the potential of \nnarrow hyperspectral bandwidths to\
    \ detect and interpret \npatterns of plant stress. Furthermore, the importance\
    \ of the \nred edge defined as the region between 690 and 740 nm has \ngained\
    \ increasingly more attention over the years, and is seen \nas one of the most\
    \ important regions of the spectrum when \ninvestigating plant stress. It is also\
    \ recommended that the \nresults from hyperspectral studies should be incorporated\
    \ in \nmultispectral technologies through modified imaging sys-\ntems or spectral\
    \ filters to allow for specialised high spectral \nresolution investigations to\
    \ be undertaken with reduced data \nvolumes in a cost-effective manner. Most spectral\
    \ indices \nhave been derived for a single species with constant leaf size \n\
    and shape, leaf surface and internal structure, implying that \ntheir usefulness\
    \ varies with respect to species and site condi-\ntions. Therefore, the most commonly\
    \ used indices reported in \nthe literature must be evaluated against ground-truthing\
    \ data. \nGround-truthing of remote sensing data is not an easy task \nespecially\
    \ when considering different temporal and spatial \nscales. Depending upon the\
    \ scale at which an investigation is \nbeing undertaken, it is recommended that\
    \ a practical approach \nto assessing plant water stress is adopted through the\
    \ use \nof at least one ground-based measurement, viz. plant pig-\nment concentrations,\
    \ chlorophyll fluorescence or relative leaf \nwater content to identify gradients\
    \ in plant stress, and to then \nundertake predawn leaf water potential measurements\
    \ along \nthis gradient, specifically to identify the extremes in plant \nwater\
    \ stress.\nAcknowledgements\nAcknowledgement for funding for this work is made\

  analysis: This study assessed the potential of WorldView-2 multispectral imagery
    for mapping water stress in pear orchards. In situ Ψstem was monitored with a
    pressure chamber throughout three consecutive growing seasons in a regulated and
    non-irrigated pear orchard. Reflectance measurements of leaves and canopies were
    related to Ψstem. The ReNDVI derived from the WorldView-2 imagery was shown to
    be strongly related to Ψstem and could be used in the remote estimation hereof.
    The relationship between ReNDVI and Ψstem was shown to be independent of orchard
    parameters (e.g., phenology, tree structure, irrigation setup) and environmental
    conditions (e.g., soil conditions). Additionally, the relationship was mostly
    independent of off-nadir viewing angle and viewing geometry. Results showed that
    this relationship was almost independent of viewing geometry, as the correlation
    decreased after the inclusion of fully shaded scenes.

    \ Remote sensing can provide good alternatives for traditional in situ water status\
    \ \nmeasurements in orchard crops, such as stem water potential (Ψstem). However,\
    \  \nthe heterogeneity of these cropping systems causes significant differences\
    \ with regards to \nremote sensing products within one orchard and between orchards.\
    \ In this study, robust \nspectral indicators of Ψstem were sought after, independent\
    \ of sensor viewing geometry, \norchard architecture and management. To this end,\
    \ Ψstem was monitored throughout three \nconsecutive growing seasons in (deficit)\
    \ irrigated and rainfed pear orchards and related to \nspectral observations of\
    \ leaves, canopies and WorldView-2 imagery. On a leaf and canopy \nlevel, high\
    \ correlations were observed between the shortwave infrared reflectance and in\
    \ \nsitu measured Ψstem. Additionally, for canopy measurements, visible and near-infrared\
    \ \nwavelengths (R530/R600, R530/R700 and R720/R800) showed significant correlations.\
    \ Therefore, \nthe Red-edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ReNDVI) was\
    \ applied on fully \nsunlit satellite imagery and found strongly related with\
    \ Ψstem (R2 = 0.47; RMSE = 0.36 MPa), \nundoubtedly showing the potential of WorldView-2\
    \ to monitor water stress in pear \norchards. The relationship between ReNDVI\
    \ and Ψstem was independent of management, \nirrigation setup, phenology and environmental\
    \ conditions. In addition, results showed that \nthis relation was also independent\
    \ of off-nadir viewing angle and almost independent of \nviewing geometry, as\
    \ the correlation decreased after the inclusion of fully shaded scenes. \nOPEN\
    \ ACCESS\nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n6648 \n \n \nWith further research focusing on\
    \ issues related to viewing geometry and shadows, high \nspatial water status\
    \ monitoring with space borne remote sensing is achievable. \nKeywords: stem water\
    \ potential; multispectral imagery; robust estimation; vegetation \nindices; pear\
    \ orchards \n \n1. Introduction \nIn capital intensive cropping systems, such\
    \ as pear orchards, prolonged periods of water \ndeficiencies can lead to significant\
    \ yield loss [1], making water status monitoring crucial to optimize \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling [2]. Traditional in situ measurements of plant water status are time\
    \ consuming \nand destructive, allowing only limited samples and repetitions.\
    \ Furthermore, the point measurements \nare insufficient to account for the high\
    \ spatial variability present in orchards [3]. Technological \nadvances in remote\
    \ sensing provide non-destructive, time efficient and cost beneficial alternatives\
    \ that \nvisualize the spatial variability in water status at a wide range of\
    \ temporal scales [4]. \nVarious vegetation indices have been related to leaf\
    \ and canopy water content (see review by [5]). \nIn fruit trees, however, leaf\
    \ water potential (Ψleaf) has been found a more robust indicator of plant \nwater\
    \ status compared to plant water content [6,7]. Leaf water content is normally\
    \ measured on tissue \nsamples [8], which are subject to some variability, while\
    \ Ψleaf provide an integrated measurement of \nenvironmental conditions on water\
    \ availability within the leaf. Moreover, while large changes in leaf \nwater\
    \ content only occur at advanced stages of dehydration, Ψleaf measurements were\
    \ able to detect  \nthe onset of water deficiency, allowing a reaction before\
    \ permanent damage occurs [7]. Several studies \nhave linked Ψleaf in fruit orchards\
    \ with vegetation indices [9,10]. The down-side of Ψleaf is the high \nvariability\
    \ within one tree. Therefore, most researchers prefer stem water potential (Ψstem)\
    \ as an indicator \nof plant water status in fruit orchards [7,11,12]. The Ψstem\
    \ is the water status of non-transpiring leaves, \nwhich is related to the water\
    \ availability and transpiration. As opposed to plant water status and Ψleaf,\
    \ \nthe potential of remote monitoring of Ψstem is not yet fully explored nor\
    \ widely adopted (but see \nexamples for olives [13] and citrus [7,14]). \nDue\
    \ to high cloud cover in many of the pear (and apple) growing areas of the world\
    \ [15], irrigation \nscheduling through remote sensing requires a near-to-daily\
    \ revisit time to provide the necessary \ninformation [16]. Furthermore, due to\
    \ the large spatial variation within one management block [3],  \na high spatial\
    \ resolution is required. Currently, this combination of both high spatial and\
    \ temporal \nresolution is only feasible with high spatial resolution satellite\
    \ sensors having off-nadir viewing \ncapabilities, such as WorldView-2 (DigitalGlobe).\
    \ However, most of the developed techniques and \nindices to monitor water status\
    \ (as mentioned above) are based on reflectance information from the \nshortwave\
    \ infrared (SWIR; 1,300–2,500 nm; [17]) and thermal infrared (3,000–35,000 nm;\
    \ [18]) \nregion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Yet very high spatial resolution\
    \ satellites lack spectral bands \nin these regions of the spectrum. Furthermore,\
    \ the highly variable off-nadir viewing angle influences \nspectral observations,\
    \ which in turn complicates plant status monitoring [19]. Additionally, different\
    \ \nmanagement practices cause significant differences in orchard and tree architecture\
    \ again influencing \nspectral observations and complicating accurate remote monitoring\
    \ of plant water status [20]. \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n6649 \n \n \nThis study\
    \ aims at investigating the potential of WorldView-2 satellite imagery for the\
    \ monitoring of \nΨstem. The goal is to identify robust spectral indicators of\
    \ Ψstem, independent of orchard parameters (i.e., \nphenology, tree structure\
    \ and irrigation setup), environmental conditions (i.e., soil conditions) and\
    \ sensor \nparameters (i.e., off-nadir viewing angle). To this end, Ψstem was\
    \ monitored throughout three consecutive \ngrowing seasons in a (deficit) irrigated\
    \ and non-irrigated (rainfed) pear orchard and related to spectral \nobservations\
    \ of leaves, canopies and spectral vegetation indices derived from WorldView-2\
    \ imagery. \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. Study Area and Experimental Setup\
    \  \nExperiments were conducted in a (deficit) irrigated and a non-irrigated orchard,\
    \ which were \nmonitored throughout the 2011, 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. \n\
    The (deficit) irrigated orchard, planted with Conference pear trees (Pyrus communis\
    \ L. cv. \n‘Conference’) on Quince C rootstock, was situated in Bierbeek, Belgium\
    \ (50°49'34.59\"N, 4°47'42.83\"E). \nThe 2.5 m high trees were planted in 2000\
    \ in a 3.5 by 1 meter grid. They were trained in  \na V-system with four fruiting\
    \ branches on one central stem [21]. The orchard was situated on  \na south-east\
    \ facing slope (3.5°) with a loamy soil and two dominant row azimuths, namely\
    \ 41 and \n131°. The trees received 100% of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo)\
    \ [22], throughout most of  \nthe growing season. In the second phenological phase,\
    \ characterized by vegetative growth [23], two \nirrigation treatments were applied.\
    \ One treatment was fully irrigated (100% ETo), while the other \ntreatment received\
    \ no irrigation from Day of Year (DOY) 150–213, to create deficit irrigation.\
    \ Each \ntreatment was applied to four adjacent rows, with all measurements performed\
    \ on both center rows of \neach treatment to minimize the influence of adjacent\
    \ rows. In each of the center rows, four plots of \nfour trees were selected on\
    \ fixed intervals (30 m) within the row. As a result, 16 plots were monitored\
    \ \nthroughout three consecutive growing seasons. Additionally, 16 fully irrigated\
    \ plots with a similar \nmanagement system were selected throughout the orchard\
    \ and monitored throughout the growing \nseason in 2012 and 2013. The additional\
    \ plots comprise trees with different age groups, soil types and \nrow orientation.\
    \ During the experiment, all management practices were carried out without \n\
    interference to the experiment. \nThe non-irrigated or rainfed orchard, situated\
    \ in Kerkom, Belgium (50°46'24.25\"N, 5°09'27.05\"E), \nwas planted in 2000 with\
    \ Conference pear trees on Quince A rootstock. The 3.5 m high trees, planted \n\
    in a 3.75 by 1.75 meter grid, were trained in a Spindle bush system [21]. The\
    \ orchard was situated on  \na south facing slope (1.1°) with a loamy soil and\
    \ a row azimuth of 197°. The trees were rainfed and \nreceived no additional water\
    \ input. Two adjacent rows were selected and divided into eight plots of six \n\
    trees, each plot consisting of four central experimental trees and two outside\
    \ buffer trees. To ensure \ndifferences in water availability, root pruning was\
    \ applied on one side of the canopy in the beginning \nof the growing season (March).\
    \ In each row, a root-pruned plot was alternated with a non-treated plot. \nIn\
    \ both orchards, the soil under the trees was kept weed free for about 0.3 m from\
    \ the trunk and \ngrass was sown in between the tree rows. \n \n \nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2013, 5 \n6650 \n \n \n2.2. Data \n2.2.1. In Situ Water Status \nMidday stem\
    \ water potential (Ψstem) was acquired for one tree per plot, on three leaves\
    \ per tree, on \nsunny days throughout the 2011, 2012 and 2013 growing seasons\
    \ (see Table 1) with a pressure \nchamber [24]. Prior to measurement, the leaves\
    \ were covered with aluminum foil and enclosed in \nplastic bags to equilibrate\
    \ leaf water with stem water potential [25]. \nReference evapotranspiration (ETo;\
    \ mm/day) was calculated according to [22] for the (deficit) irrigated \nand rainfed\
    \ orchard from weather data obtained from nearby weather stations in Beauvechain,\
    \ Belgium \n(50°46'49.86\"N, 4°46'26.44\"E) and Bierset, Belgium (50°39'18.69\"\
    N, 5°27'03.34\"E), respectively. \n2.2.2. Leaf Level Reflectance \nThroughout\
    \ the 2011, 2012 and 2013 growing seasons, leaf spectra were gathered for one\
    \ tree per \nplot. Table 1 summarizes the exact dates of measurement. The measurements\
    \ were performed with  \nan ASD spectroradiometer (Analytic Spectral Devices,\
    \ Boulder, CO, USA), conforming to [8], with a \ncontact plant probe and an attached\
    \ light source. For each tree, 20 undamaged and mature leaves were \nrandomly\
    \ selected from the sunlit part of the canopy, sampled 10 times in a basal position\
    \ on  \nthe adaxial side of the leaf and averaged per leaf. All measurements were\
    \ performed on sunny days \nwithin 1.5 h of local solar noon. All spectra were\
    \ smoothed using a 2nd order Savitsky-Golay filter \nwith a window size of 21\
    \ [26]. In this study, only leaf measurements coinciding with in situ water \n\
    status measurements were considered, i.e., within one day before or after a Ψstem\
    \ measurement. \n2.2.3. Canopy Level Reflectance \nThroughout the 2011, 2012 and\
    \ 2013 growing seasons, canopy reflectance measurements were \ncollected on cloud-free\
    \ days (see Table 1), using a full range (350–2,500 nm) HR-1024 \nspectroradiometer\
    \ (Spectra Vista Corporation, New York, NY, USA). The canopy spectra were taken\
    \ \nfrom an elevated position between the rows at an average height of one meter\
    \ above the top of  \nthe canopy. For each plot, eight sunlit canopy spectra were\
    \ taken and averaged. All measurements \nwere performed within 1.5 h from local\
    \ solar noon, to minimize differences with regards to solar \ngeometry and illumination.\
    \ All spectra were smoothed using a 2nd order Savitsky-Golay filter with  \na\
    \ window size of 21 [26] and atmospheric water absorption features were removed.\
    \ In this study, only \ncanopy measurements coinciding with in situ water status\
    \ measurements were considered, i.e., within \none day before or after a Ψstem\
    \ measurement. \n2.2.4. Satellite Level Reflectance \nWorldView-2 multispectral\
    \ iages were acquired under different off-nadir viewing angles, with  \na resampled\
    \ ground sampling distance of 2.0 m and a spectral resolution complying eight\
    \ bands: Coastal \n(400–450 nm), Blue (450–510 nm), Green (510–580 nm), Yellow\
    \ (585–625 nm), Red (630–690 nm), Red \nEdge (705–745 nm), NIR1 (Near InfraRed\
    \ 1; 770–895 nm) and NIR2 (860–1,040 nm). The acquisition \ndetails for the WorldView-2\
    \ images are shown in Table 2. All images were radiometrically [27], \nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2013, 5 \n6651 \n \n \natmospherically [28] and geometrically corrected\
    \ [29]. Additionally, the position of each plot was \ndetermined with a differential\

    \ profile of the ETo (mm/day), the measured Ψstem (MPa) and its standard deviation\
    \ are \nshown in Figure 1. \nBefore the experimental water treatment (DOY 150),\
    \ the small standard deviations indicated similar \nΨstem values within one day.\
    \ Moreover, the measured Ψstem values were similar for all growing seasons \n\
    and orchards pre-treatment, although a warm April and May in 2011 caused an exception.\
    \ \nDuring the water treatment, the average Ψstem values decreased and the standard\
    \ deviations \nincreased, indicative of water deficiency accumulation and differences\
    \ between treatments. This effect \nwas more pronounced in the (deficit) irrigated\
    \ orchard, as a result of the larger differences between \ntreatments. In the\
    \ rainfed orchard, differences in Ψstem values throughout the growing season were\
    \ less \nvariable and more dependent on weather conditions. In general, the lowest\
    \ average Ψstem values were \nencountered near the end of the water treatment\
    \ period in the (deficit) irrigated orchard, as a result of \nthe prolonged period\
    \ of water deficiency. The extended use of drip irrigation caused small root \n\
    systems [30,31], which were more sensitive to longer periods of lack of water,\
    \ causing lower Ψstem \nvalues in the deficit irrigation treatment. In 2012, however,\
    \ during the later stages of the experimental \nwater treatment (DOY 180–220),\
    \ ETo dropped to 2 mm/day for an extended period. Together with \nhigh rainfall\
    \ (data not shown here), this caused low standard deviations and high average\
    \ Ψstem values \nfor both the (deficit) irrigated and rainfed orchard. \nAfter\
    \ the water treatment was finished, full irrigation (100% ETo) was again applied\
    \ and  \nthe average Ψstem values restored to the level prior to the treatment.\
    \ \nAs a result of the differences in experimental treatments, a wide range of\
    \ Ψstem values were present \nin the dataset, with a slightly skewed distribution\
    \ towards the lower Ψstem values. The overall average \nΨstem was −1.20 MPa with\
    \ a standard deviation of 0.43 MPa, a minimum value of −3.07 MPa and  \na maximum\
    \ value of −0.42 MPa. The overall average standard deviation within each tree\
    \ was  \n0.09 MPa (1,172 observations). \n \n \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n6653 \n\

    \ standard deviation. \n \n3.2. Leaf and Canopy Reflectance \nFigure 2 summarizes\
    \ the significant R² values between measured Ψstem and the normalized difference\
    \ \nratios (Equation (1)) of all wavelength combinations for both leaf (above\
    \ diagonal; 395 observations; \nSection 2.2.2) and canopy (below diagonal; 167\
    \ observations; Section 2.2.3) reflectances. \nOverall, the highest R² values\
    \ between Ψstem and both leaf and canopy reflectance spectra (R² > 0.45) \nwere\
    \ located in the SWIR region. The R1400–R1800 nm and R2000–R2400 nm regions correlated\
    \ strongly \nwith Ψstem (Figure 2). Normalized difference band combinations between\
    \ SWIR and other regions \nresulted in low(er), yet significant R² values. On\
    \ the other hand, significant and high R² values were \nalso found in the VIS-NIR\
    \ region (Visible-Near Infrared; 350–1,300 nm). As the spectral range of  \nthe\
    \ WorldView-2 satellite only compromised the VIS-NIR region, this was further\
    \ investigated. \nIn the VIS-NIR region, the canopy reflectance spectra were better\
    \ correlated with the Ψstem values \ncompared to the leaf reflectance spectra\
    \ (Figure 2). More specifically, several bands in the VIS-NIR \nregion showed\
    \ high R2 values (R2 > 0.35), i.e., the combination of green to red (550–650 nm)\
    \ or  \nred-edge (700 nm) with blue (500–530 nm). Additionally, the combination\
    \ of red-edge (700–750 nm) \nwith NIR (800–900 nm) reflectance correlated relatively\
    \ well with Ψstem (R2 > 0.3). These high R² \nvalues were further highlighted\
    \ in Figure 3, through scatterplots between Ψstem and three normalized \nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2013, 5 \n6654 \n \n \ndifference ratio indices (Equation (1)); namely,\
    \ a ratio of two SWIR bands (R1480 and R2230), a ratio of \ntwo VIS bands (R520\
    \ and R700), and a red-edge/NIR band combination (R800 and R722). \nFigure 2.\

    \ \nmeasurements (above diagonal; Section 2.2.2) and canopy measurements (below\
    \ diagonal; \nSection 2.2.3) with measured stem water potential (Ψstem; MPa) for\
    \ each wavelength; only \nsignificant correlations were shown (α = 0.05) and atmospheric\
    \ water absorption bands \nwere left out. \n \nSimilar to Figure 2, the SWIR band\
    \ combination showed a high correlation with Ψstem on both leaf \n(R2 = 0.51;\
    \ RMSE = 0.34 MPa; Figure 3a) and canopy level (R2 = 0.39; RMSE = 0.34 MPa; Figure\
    \ 3d). \nThe VIS combination showed a good correlation on canopy level (R2 = 0.48;\
    \ RMSE = 0.31 MPa; \nFigure 3e) but no relation on leaf level (R2 = 0.02; RMSE\
    \ = 0.49 MPa; Figure 3b), caused by the small \nrange of the normalized difference\
    \ ratio. Similarly, the red-edge/NIR combination showed a good \ncorrelation on\
    \ canopy level (R2 = 0.20; RMSE = 0.39 MPa; Figure 3f), but was incapable to estimate\
    \ \nΨstem on the leaf level (R2 = 0.04; RMSE = 0.49 MPa; Figure 3c). \nIn addition\
    \ to the SWIR band combinations, the canopy level showed high R² values in areas\
    \ of  \nthe spectral domain for which the WorldView-2 sensor was also sensitive\
    \ (Figures 2, 3e and 3f).  \nThe narrow regions in the VIS with high R² values,\
    \ such as combinations between R600/R550 and \nR700/R550 (Figures 2 and 3e), might\
    \ not transfer to the broad satellite bands (40–70 nm bandwidth; \nSection 2.2.4).\
    \ In this perspective, the red-edge/NIR combination showed more potential (Figure\
    \ 3f), \nas a result of the uniformly high R² values for a large region of the\
    \ NIR wavelengths (750–1,000 nm), \nwhich should transfer better to broad satellite\
    \ bands (Figure 2). However, both regions in the VIS/NIR \nRemote Sens. 2013,\
    \ 5 \n6655 \n \n \nwith high R2 values indicated high potential for remote estimation\
    \ of Ψstem through multispectral \nWorldView-2 imagery, especially since no distinctions\
    \ were made between different management \nsystems, irrigation setup and phenology.\

    \ and R2230 nm \n(a,d); R520 and R700 nm (b,e); R800 and R722 nm (c,f); with measured\
    \ stem water potential \n(Ψstem; MPa). All points were labeled for location. \n\
    \ \n3.3. Satellite Level \nAs an intermediate step in the up-scaling of canopy\
    \ to satellite reflectance, the canopy reflectance \nspectra were resampled to\
    \ match the multispectral bands of the WorldView-2 satellite, using the sensor’s\
    \ \nspectral response function (similar to [32]). These were referred to as the\
    \ modeled satellite level. \nBased on the results of leaf and canopy level measurements\
    \ (Figures 2 and 3), a set of band \ncombinations was chosen and highlighted.\
    \ The applied band combinations were based on either  \nthe red-edge/NIR region\
    \ or on the blue to red region, as defined by the sensor’s spectral response \n\
    function [27] and the satellite bands (Section 2.2.4). \nFirstly, the Red edge\
    \ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or ReNDVI (Equation (4)) was \nchosen,\
    \ as the red edge was previously shown to be useful in the detection of plant\
    \ water stress [33]. In \nFigure 4, the ReNDVI (Equation (4)) on a modeled satellite\
    \ level and satellite level is depicted against \nthe measured Ψstem, only Ψstem\

    \ potential (Ψstem; MPa) for the modeled satellite \nlevel (a) and the satellite\
    \ level (b). All points were labeled for location. \n \nResults for the ReNDVI,\
    \ in Figure 4a, showed a similar correlation between the modeled \nWorldView-2\
    \ reflectance and Ψstem (R2 = 0.22; RMSE = 0.38 MPa) if compared to the correlation\
    \ \nfound between Ψstem and the hyperspectral (small band) ratio indices extracted\
    \ from the original \ncanopy reflectance spectra (R2 = 0.20; RMSE = 0.39 MPa;\
    \ Figure 3f). This was particularly interesting \nsince this indicates the sufficient\
    \ applicability of the broad spectral bands of WorldView-2 to properly \nmonitor\
    \ Ψstem. The ultimate test was the comparison between per pixel derived ReNDVI\
    \ values from \nthe actual WorldView-2 imagery and measured Ψstem. The results\
    \ in Figure 4b clearly showed a similar \nrelationship between Ψstem and ReNDVI\
    \ (R2 = 0.47; RMSE = 0.36 MPa), undoubtedly showing the \npotential of WorldView-2\
    \ to monitor water stress in pear orchards. With regards to the applicability\
    \ of \nthe index in multiple orchards, both the (deficit) irrigated and rainfed\
    \ orchard showed a comparable \nrelation with ReNDVI. However, the correlation\
    \ of the rainfed orchard declined for both the modeled \nsatellite level (R2 =\
    \ 0.17; RMSE = 0.30 MPa) and satellite level (R2 = 0.13; RMSE = 0.36 MPa). On\
    \ the \nother hand, the correlation of the (deficit) irrigated orchard increased\
    \ for both the modeled satellite level \n(R2 = 0.41; RMSE = 0.40 MPa) and satellite\
    \ level (R2 = 0.67; RMSE = 0.31 MPa). This was the result of \nthe lower Ψstem\
    \ range in the rainfed orchard. \nIn addition to ReNDVI, the narrow regions in\
    \ the VIS region with high R2 values (Section 3.2) were \ntransferred into two\
    \ indices, namely the Green Band Depth index (GBD; Equation (5)) and  \nthe Normalized\
    \ Difference Green Blue index (Green/Blue; Equation (6)), based on the satellite\
    \ bands \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n6657 \n \n \n(Section 2.2.4). Similar to ReNDVI,\
    \ both indices are depicted on a modeled satellite level and satellite \nlevel\

    \ modeled satellite level (R2 = 0.34; \nRMSE = 0.35 MPa; Figure 5a), with similar\
    \ distribution for both experimental locations. On  \nthe satellite level, the\
    \ correlation was stronger (R2 = 0.56; RMSE = 0.32 MPa; Figure 5b). However, \n\
    Figure 5b also showed points very dissimilar to the rest of the dataset. As these\
    \ effects were not present \non the modeled satellite level, they were most likely\
    \ caused by differences in viewing geometry. \nFigure 5. Scatter plot of Green\
    \ Band Depth index (GBD; Equation (5)) with measured \nstem water potential (Ψstem;\
    \ MPa) for the modeled satellite level (a) and the satellite level \n(b). All\
    \ points were labeled for location. \n \n \nThe normalized difference Green/Blue\
    \ ratio (Equation (6)) also showed a strong correlation on \nsatellite level (R2\
    \ = 0.51; RMSE = 0.33 MPa; Figure 6b). However, on the modeled satellite level\
    \  \nthe differences between experimental locations were distinct and also caused\
    \ a weaker correlation  \n(R2 = 0.18; RMSE = 0.39 MPa; Figure 6a). These differences\
    \ were most likely the cause of different \nmanagement systems (i.e., the V-system\
    \ and the Spindle bush, see Section 2.1). \nOverall, both the GBD and the Green/Blue\
    \ indices showed strong correlations on either the satellite \nlevel or the modeled\
    \ satellite level but were not robust for both the satellite and modeled satellite\
    \ level. \nTherefore, ReNDVI should be preferred for further application out of\
    \ all the indices applied on  \na satellite level in this study, as it showed\
    \ less dependence towards off-nadir viewing angle or orchard \nRemote Sens. 2013,\

    \ \n \n4. Discussion \n4.1. Potential of High Spatial and Multispectral Satellite\
    \ Derived Ψstem Estimation \nAs could be expected, the highest R2 values (R2 >\
    \ 0.5) were observed in the SWIR on the leaf level \n(Figure 2). Previous studies\
    \ have shown the SWIR region to be affected by water absorption and thus \nhighly\
    \ correlated with leaf water content [17,34,35]. Yet, next to the SWIR region,\
    \ also the VIS-NIR \nregion showed some significant zones with high R2 values\
    \ (R2 > 0.2), mostly combinations within  \nthe 740–800 nm range. Similar to the\
    \ SWIR region, several studies previously showed a relation \nbetween these wavelengths\
    \ and leaf water content [36–38]. \nOn the canopy level, similar (yet less pronounced)\
    \ correlations were observed between SWIR \nreflectance and Ψstem (Figure 2).\
    \ Moreover, the VIS-NIR region of the canopy level showed higher R2 \nvalues compared\
    \ to the leaf level. This is most likely the result of the low variability in\
    \ the VIS region \nfor the leaf measurements (Figure 3b), as a consequence of\
    \ the sampling design. Only mature healthy \nleaves were sampled, while the canopy\
    \ measurements were an integrated measurement of the entire \ncanopy (Section\
    \ 2.2.3). \nFor canopy measurements, two regions within the VIS-NIR showed high\
    \ R² values and potential for \nΨstem estimation. On the one hand, combinations\
    \ within the blue/green region were found to be \nstrongly correlated with Ψstem\
    \ (Figure 2). These band combinations were similar to the bands used by \nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2013, 5 \n6659 \n \n \nthe Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) [39]\
    \ and are related to xanthophyll pigment changes, \nphotosynthetic efficiency,\
    \ as well providing early warning signs of water deficiency, in fruit  \norchards\
    \ [13,14,39]. These narrow band combinations (R531 and R570) were not applicable\
    \ on the broad \nsatellite wavebands of WorldView-2, as they were included in\
    \ one band (Green; 510–580 nm). \nOn the other hand, the combination of the red-edge\
    \ (700–750 nm) with the NIR region (800–900 nm) \nalso showed a strong correlation\
    \ with Ψstem (Figure 2). Contrary to the PRI bands, the R² values \nremained high\
    \ for a large range of wavelengths, well suited for application on the broad satellite\
    \ bands \n(Full Width Half Maximum between 50 and 100 nm). Previous research showed\
    \ the relation between  \nthe red-edge region and stress detection [13,33], especially\
    \ the shape and position of the red-edge [40,41].  \nFor healthy leaves, the red-edge\
    \ inflection point showed a displacement towards the longer \nwavelengths as a\
    \ result of high pigment concentrations [41]. However, during stressed periods\
    \ and as  \na result of stress-induced chlorosis, the red-edge inflection point\
    \ would shift to shorter wavelengths [13]. \nIn addition to the correlation with\
    \ chlorophyll content [40], the red edge was also found to be highly \ndependent\
    \ on phenology, leaf water content and leaf area [41,42], causing lower R² values\
    \ for the leaf \nmeasurements (Figure 2). As the resulting effect of water deficiency\
    \ could be manifold, i.e., changes in \nwater content, chlorophyll content, leaf\
    \ area and leaf angle [43–45], and with the red-edge sensitive to \nall these\
    \ influences, the red-edge could provide a good estimation of the overall health\
    \ and stress level \nof a canopy. Moreover, it should also have a high correlation\
    \ with Ψstem, as this is a measurement of \nthe integrated effect of environmental\
    \ conditions on water availability within the plant. This \ncorrelation between\
    \ water potential measurements and biophysical variables was also shown by [42],\
    \ \nwhere strong indices for Ψleaf were also strongly correlated with leaf area\
    \ related indices (i.e., \nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index; [45]) and less\
    \ with water content related indices (i.e.,  \nWater Index; [46]). \nOverall,\
    \ our analysis of leaf and canopy reflectance indicated high potential for the\
    \ mapping of \nΨstem with VIS/NIR derived band combinations, especially when keeping\
    \ in mind that no distinctions \nwere made between different management systems,\
    \ irrigation setup, phenology and environmental \nconditions. We could further\
    \ demonstrate this potential using WorldView-2 imagery (Figure 4). \nThe ReNDVI\
    \ (Equation (4)), derived from the Red-edge and NIR1 band of WorldView-2  \n(Section\
    \ 2.2.4.), was shown to be highly dependent on Ψstem and could be used in the\
    \ remote estimation \nhereof. As an illustration on how such ReNDVI maps could\
    \ be used for steering irrigation \nmanagement, Figure 7 shows the index maps\
    \ converted to estimates of Ψstem (RMSE = 0.36 MPa) for \nthe (deficit) irrigated\
    \ orchard. \nThe image on the left was taken during an extended period of full\
    \ irrigation, while the image on  \nthe right was taken during a deficit water\
    \ experiment. The maps visualize spatial differences within \neach orchard block\
    \ and indicate different zones in the orchard requiring different irrigation \n\
    management, or the presence of problems related to obstructions in the irrigation\
    \ system. In general, \nΨstem readings below −1.5 MPa should be considered as\
    \ a cut-off between moderate and severe water \nstress levels [1]. As expected,\
    \ due to irrigation, Figure 7a showed no severely stressed trees (red to orange\
    \ \ncolors), while Figure 7b, acquired during a water stress experiment, showed\
    \ large differences between \ndifferent management blocks and water deficiency\
    \ in some blocks (blue colors). With regular Ψstem maps \nthroughout the growing\
    \ season, irrigation scheduling with remote sensing input becomes feasible. \n\

    \ the canopy discontinuity, as \na result of the alternation between canopies,\
    \ shadows and grasses, a 3 × 3 pixel  \nmoving-average filter was applied. The\
    \ filtering operation smoothed the image and \nfacilitated visual interpretation,\

    \ different management systems, irrigation setup, \nphenology and location, and\
    \ still we could demonstrate the robustness of the WorldView-2 derived \nReNDVI\
    \ in estimating Ψstem. However, so far we only incorporated imagery with a viewing\
    \ angle that \nallowed fully sunlit canopies. The distinction between sunlit and\
    \ shaded scenes was based on  \nthe difference between the row azimuth and the\
    \ relative azimuth between sensor and sun. Other studies \nhave shown that the\
    \ inclusion of shaded canopy parts could cause a decrease in correlation [13,14].\
    \  \nIn Figure 8, all the acquired images (Table 2) were taken into account, including\
    \ imagery with \ndifferent viewing geometry. \nSimilar to other studies [13,14],\
    \ the predictive power of the ReNDVI decreased after the inclusion \nof all the\
    \ shaded scenes, as is shown in Figure 8 (R2 = 0.18; RMSE = 0.49 MPa). On the\
    \ other hand, \nFigure 8a,b also showed a clear influence of viewing geometry\
    \ on the ReNDVI index value.  \nIn addition to the light conditions in the plot,\
    \ namely sunlit or shaded canopy, the off-nadir viewing \nangle was also shown\
    \ to be important. The ReNDVI was only affected by the combination of high  \n\
    Remote Sens. 2013, 5 \n6661 \n \n \noff-nadir viewing angles (i.e., off-nadir\
    \ viewing angles over 20°) and a viewing geometry opposite to \nthe sun with regards\
    \ to the rows. The relative position of the sensor was important for larger off-nadir\
    \ \nviewing angles (>20°), as it determined whether the scene was fully sunlit\
    \ or fully shaded. However, \nfor smaller off-nadir viewing angles (<20°), the\
    \ relative position of the sensor with regards to the sun \nand row orientation\
    \ was found not to be important, as most of the canopy would still be sunlit.\
    \ With \nthe shaded scenes with small off-nadir viewing angles (<20°), the R2\
    \ increased to 0.56 and RMSE \nremained at 0.36 MPa (Figure 8c). \nFigure 8. Red\
    \ edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ReNDVI; Equation (4)) \nagainst\
    \ measured stem water potential (Ψstem; MPa) for the satellite level, labeled\
    \ for  \noff-nadir viewing angle of the sensor (a), scene light conditions based\
    \ on the sensor’s \nrelative azimuth (b) and a combination of both (c). \n \n\
    One influential parameter that could hamper applicability of the ReNDVI index\
    \ is the background, \ni.e., the bare soil, cover crop or shadow. The influence\
    \ of background on the use of the ReNDVI was \nnot investigated here, as both\
    \ the (deficit) irrigated and rainfed orchard had grass sown in between  \nthe\
    \ rows to minimize soil erosion. However, some researchers have already indicated\
    \ that soil background \neffects could decrease the correlation between vegetation\
    \ indices and biophysical variables [14,47]. \nOngoing research is focusing on\
    \ developing and applying specific spectral mixture analysis \ntechniques [48–50]\
    \ to address these issues. As such, we hope to further advance the operational\
    \ \nimplementation of high resolution multispectral satellite observations, such\
    \ as WorldView-2, in \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n6662 \n \n \nprecision agriculture.\
    \ The results presented in this work show great promise for the remote steering\
    \ of \nirrigation management. \n5. Conclusions  \nThis study aimed at investigating\
    \ the potential of WorldView-2 satellite imagery for monitoring of \nstem water\
    \ potential (Ψstem). To this end, Ψstem was monitored throughout three consecutive\
    \ growing \nseasons in a (deficit) irrigated and non-irrigated (rainfed) pear\
    \ orchard and related to spectral \nobservations of leaves, canopies and WorldView-2\
    \ satellite imagery. Through ground measurements of \nleaf and canopy level, a\
    \ robust spectral indicator of Ψstem was sought, independent of orchard \nparameters\
    \ (i.e., phenology, tree structure and irrigation setup) and environmental conditions\
    \ (i.e., soil \nconditions). Through satellite imagery, the sensitivity of the\
    \ spectral indicator towards sensor \nparameters (i.e., off-nadir view angle,\
    \ viewing geometry) was investigated. \nFor hyperspectral ground measurements,\
    \ it was shown that next to the Shortwave Infrared Region \n(SWIR) (combinations\
    \ of the reflectance at 1,430 nm (R1430) and R2230), also the Visible-Near Infrared\
    \ \nRegion (VIS-NIR) showed regions with significant R² values for leaf level\
    \ measurements. This was \nmore pronounced at canopy level, for which combinations\
    \ within the blue/green region (R500 to R570) \ntogether with the red/red-edge\
    \ region (R670 to R720) were strongly related to Ψstem. Yet,  \nthe combinations\
    \ of the red-edge (R700 to R750) with the NIR region (R800 to R900) were more\
    \ suited for \napplication on the broad satellite bands, as they showed a strong\
    \ correlation with Ψstem for a larger \nrange of wavelengths for both leaf and\
    \ canopy level. \nThe Red-edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ReNDVI),\
    \ derived from the Red-edge \n(705–745 nm) and NIR1 (Near InfraRed 1; 770–895\
    \ nm) band of WorldView-2, was shown to be \nhighly dependent on Ψstem and could\
    \ be used in the remote estimation hereof, independent of \nmanagement systems,\
    \ irrigation setup, phenology and environmental conditions. In addition, results\
    \ \nshowed that the relation between Ψstem and ReNDVI was independent of the off-nadir\
    \ viewing angle \nand almost independent of viewing geometry. For larger off-nadir\
    \ viewing angles, the relative position \nof the sensor determined whether the\
    \ scene was fully sunlit or fully shaded, while for smaller off-nadir \nviewing\
    \ angles the scene would be mostly sunlit, independent on the azimuth of the sensor.\
    \ With the \ninclusion of these partly shaded but mostly sunlit scenes, the correlation\
    \ improved (R2 = 0.56;  \nRMSE = 0.36 MPa). \nWith further research focusing on\
    \ issues related to viewing geometry and shadows, high spatial \nwater status\
    \ monitoring with space borne remote sensing is achievable. \nAcknowledgments\

    \ and SAVI was developed for the apple orchard\nKcb = 1.82¨ SAVI ´ 0.07 (R2 =\

    \ 2012–2013), and ETc was evaluated using latent heat ﬂuxes (LE) from an eddy\n\

    \ square error (RMSE) between the\nmeasured and simulated ETc values during 2010–2011\

    \ region is the most important producer of apples (Malus domestic Mill.) in Chile,\n\
    with 18,863 ha that represent 63% of the national cultivated surface [1]. During\
    \ the growing season,\nrainfall amounts do not cover crop evapotranspiration requirements,\
    \ so all fruit orchards need to be\nirrigated. In recent years, water storage\
    \ has decreased steadily due to the increase in irrigated surfaces,\nand the droughts\
    \ caused by El Niño and the Southern Oscillation ENSO climatic phenomena [2].\n\

    Remote Sens. 2016, 8, 253\n2 of 20\nConsequently, a better understanding of the\
    \ soil water balance and factors that control crop\nevapotranspiration (ETc) are\
    \ critical for saving water and for proper irrigation management.\nAn operational\
    \ and accepted method to estimate crop water requirements is the well-known “two\
    \ step”\nmethodology that combines the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and\
    \ crop coefﬁcients (Kc) [3,4].\nEvapotranspiration is estimated by means of single\
    \ or dual crop coefﬁcient approaches as described in\nthe FAO-56 model approach.\
    \ A dual crop coefﬁcient distinguishes the effect of crop transpiration and\n\
    soil evaporation separately [5]. The dual approach seems to be the most convenient\
    \ to calculate ETc in\napple orchards, because, in general, fruit orchards have\
    \ a signiﬁcant area of bare soil in between the\nrows of trees, which means that\
    \ the soil evaporation could be an important parameter in the estimation\nof ETc.\
    \ The “two step” methodology can be used in real time irrigation scheduling, but\
    \ its accuracy is\nstrongly based on adequate knowledge of the Kc values.\nIn\
    \ the past three decades, several methods have been developed to experimentally\
    \ estimate\nETc and Kc (e.g., Bowen ratio, eddy covariance systems, weighing lysimeters),\
    \ but they are usually\nexpensive and difﬁcult to implement and maintain. Moreover,\
    \ the use of generic or tabulated Kc values\nrequires knowledge of the crop growth\
    \ stages, speciﬁcally the date when the effective cover occurs,\nwhich is affected\
    \ by management and plant characteristics (size, shape, orientation and distribution\
    \ of\nleaves) and the development of the root system [6]. Most of the crop coefﬁcients\
    \ depend on climate,\ncrop variety, management practices, soil type, irrigation\
    \ method, and canopy architecture [3,7–10],\nand, therefore, a speciﬁc adjustment\
    \ of crop coefﬁcients is required [11]. Particularly for apple orchards,\nvalues\
    \ of crop coefﬁcients depend on the intercepted radiation and may vary with different\
    \ orchard\nconditions (row and tree spacing, tree age and size, training system,\
    \ row orientation) [12]. In addition,\nmost apple varieties have self-incompatibility.\
    \ Thus, growers usually include more than one variety\nwithin each plot [13].\n\
    In parallel, since the beginning of the eighties, several studies have shown the\
    \ utility of remote\nsensing to derive the basal crop coefﬁcient related to plant\
    \ transpiration (Kcb) from reﬂected canopy\nradiation through vegetation indices\
    \ (VI) [14]. Kcb can be related to VI because both are sensitive to\nfractional\
    \ ground cover and leaf area index [15–19]. Thus, Kcb derived from VI allows the\
    \ calculation\nof ETc and the assimilation of remote sensing data into the soil\
    \ water balance based on the FAO-56\ndual method (VI-ETo approach) for irrigation\
    \ scheduling, as well as an extension of the estimation of\nthe crop coefﬁcient\
    \ from plot scale to ﬁeld or regional scale [8,20–27]. VI calculated from multispectral\n\
    satellite images allows for the estimation of the crop evapotranspiration at a\
    \ pixel scale, where each\npixel represents a unique vegetation-soil system [28].\
    \ The VI-ETo approach is suitable even when\nusing imagery from satellites with\
    \ low revisit frequency, when interpolation is necessary. Interpolated\nVI are\
    \ subject to less uncertainty than interpolated ETc, especially with low vegetation\
    \ cover and a wet\nsoil surface which generates large ETc ﬂuctuations [27].\n\
    The VI-ETo approach has been applied and validated for the estimation of ETc and\
    \ the assessment\nof irrigation extensively in herbaceous crops, and slightly\
    \ in row structured fruit trees (mostly in\ngrapes) [8,20,27,29,30]. However,\
    \ very few studies have addressed the estimation of crop coefﬁcients,\nETc [31]\
    \ and irrigation requirements from remote sensing data for apple tree orchards\
    \ at ﬁeld scale.\nIn this context, the main objective of this study is to determine\
    \ the evapotranspiration and\nirrigation requirements of a drip-irrigated apple\
    \ orchard using a one-layer satellite-based soil water\nbalance model by incorporating\
    \ satellite reﬂectance data into the soil water balance through the use of\nthe\
    \ KcbVI relationship.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Site Description\nThe study\

    \ Data\nIn this study, a remote sensing-based soil water balance performed in\
    \ the root zone was applied\nto estimate actual evapotranspiration. The soil water\
    \ balance was expressed in terms of root zone\nwater depletion following FAO-56\
    \ approach [3]:\nDr,i “ Dr,i´1 ´ Pi ´ Ii ` ETc ` DPi\n(1)\nwhere Pi is precipitation\
    \ (mm), Ii is irrigation (mm), ETc is actual evapotranspiration (mm) and DPi is\n\
    deep percolation (mm). Dr,i and Dr,i´1 are the cumulative depletion depths (mm)\
    \ at the end of days i\nand i´1. An initial depletion Dr,i´1 of zero was assumed—following\
    \ a heavy rain to initiate the water\nbalance. This value correspond to the Dr,i\
    \ at the beginning of the next day, thus the depletion at the\nend of the day\
    \ Dr,i is recalculated after any drainage loss is estimated and after any reduction\
    \ in ETc,\nto account for low soil water content. Based on the behavior of the\
    \ ground water level and intensity\nof rainfall at the study site, the water balance\
    \ equation was simpliﬁed by neglecting capillary rise\nand surface water run-off.\
    \ Soil water content sensors buried at different depths showed that capillary\n\
    rise did not occur into the root zone, whereas run-off was neglected for two reasons:\
    \ ﬁrst, the gentle\nslopes in the ﬁeld, and second, rainfall usually does not\
    \ occur during the irrigation season. The water\nbalance methodology allowed an\
    \ assessment of the comparison between simulated and observed\nvalues, and its\
    \ formulation can also be inverted to estimate irrigation requirements.\nThe evapotranspiration\
    \ was calculated following the FAO-56 dual crop coefﬁcient approach,\ndescribed\
    \ in depth by [3]. We will present a brief description of the dual crop coefﬁcient\
    \ methodology\nand further modiﬁcations for the assimilation of remote sensing\
    \ data. In the dual crop coefﬁcient\napproach, ETc is estimated as follows [3]:\n\
    ETc “ pKsKcb ` Keq ETo\n(2)\nwhere Kcb is the transpiration coefﬁcient or basal\
    \ coefﬁcient, Ke is the evaporation coefﬁcient of the\nbare soil fraction and\
    \ Ks is the water stress coefﬁcient. The equations to derive these three coefﬁcients\n\
    are described below.\n2.2.1. Calculation of Satellite-Based Basal Crop Coefﬁcient\n\
    The basal crop coefﬁcient (Kcb) represents primarily the transpiration component\
    \ of ETc including\na small evaporation component supplied by soil water below\
    \ the dry surface and by soil water from\nbeneath dense vegetation [3,7]. Values\
    \ of Kcb reported in the literature for many crops have been\nobtained for speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and can differ considerably from local conditions. As mentioned\n\
    previously in the introduction, remote sensing is a useful tool to obtain an actual\
    \ reﬂectance-based\ncrop coefﬁcient. In this work, Kcb values of a drip-irrigated\
    \ apple orchard were obtained using\na linear regression between the measured\
    \ basal crop coefﬁcient and the soil adjusted vegetation\nindex (SAVI) obtained\
    \ from canopy reﬂectance using satellite images [8,15,19,26]. Measured values\n\
    of the ground Kcb were obtained using the ratio of ETc from an eddy covariance\
    \ system to grass\nreference evapotranspiration (ETo) selecting dates with no\
    \ stress and minimum soil evaporation\n(3–4 days following an irrigation or rain\
    \ event).\n2.2.2. Calculation of Soil Evaporation Coefﬁcient\nThe soil evaporation\
    \ coefﬁcient (Ke) was estimated based on the daily calculation of the water\n\
    balance in the topsoil evaporation layer as is stated in FAO-56 [3]:\nKe “ Kr\
    \ pKc_max ´ Kcbq ď p1 ´ fcq Kcmax\n(3)\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 253\n5 of 20\nwhere\
    \ Kr is a soil evaporation reduction coefﬁcient, Kc_max is the maximum value of\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\nand fc is the fraction cover. The maximum value of the crop\
    \ coefﬁcient was set equal to 1.2 because\nof the contribution of evaporation\
    \ from wetting intervals greater than 3 or 4 days [3], and the\nfraction cover\
    \ values were derived from SAVI values using the relationship obtained by [35]\
    \ for\na row structured vineyard.\nSome authors have shown that under high evaporation\
    \ conditions, the FAO-56 model\noverestimates soil evaporation at the beginning\
    \ of the process [36,37]. We applied the correction\nproposed by [37] to improve\
    \ the daily evaporation estimation of FAO-56 using the reduction of\nthe readily\
    \ evaporable water (REW) coefﬁcient to limit stage I (evaporation occurs at the\
    \ same\nrate as atmospheric demand) and the application of a factor (m) to reduce\
    \ the Kr coefﬁcient in\nstage II (evaporation is lower than the atmospheric demand\
    \ as a consequence of soil retention forces).\nIn this study, a reduction factor\
    \ of 0.5 was adopted. Considering the correction, values of Kr can be\ncomputed\
    \ as:\nKr “ min\n\"REW\nETo , m TEW ´ De,i\nTEW ´ REW\n*\n(4)\nwhere the REW was\
    \ set equal to 4 mm according to the model calibration proposed by [37].\nThe\
    \ cumulative water depletion at the end of day i in the evaporable layer (De,i)\
    \ was obtained\nby computing a daily soil water balance in the surface soil evaporation\
    \ layer. The total evaporable\nwater (TEW) was estimated as TEW = (θFC ´ 0.5 θWP)¨Ze,\
    \ where Ze is the depth of the soil surface\nevaporation layer (m).\n2.2.3. Estimation\
    \ of Water Stress Coefﬁcient\nIn a similar way to the Ke coefﬁcient, the estimation\
    \ of the water stress factor (Ks) involves the\ncomputation of a daily soil water\
    \ balance in the root zone. The estimation of Ks requires the deﬁnition\nof a\
    \ threshold value of the mean water content at the root zone, expressed as the\
    \ cumulative water\ndepletion depth for day i (Dr,i). Water stress begins when\
    \ Dr,i exceeds the readily available water in the\nroot zone (RAW). For Dr,i <\
    \ RAW, Ks = 1, whereas for Dr,i > RAW, Ks is calculated as:\nKs “\nTAW ´ Dr,i\n\
    TAW ´ RAW “\nTAW ´ Dr,i\np1 ´ ρq ´ TAW\n(5)\nwhere TAW (mm) is the total available\
    \ water in the root zone and ρ is the fraction of TAW that can be\ndepleted from\
    \ the root zone under non-stress conditions. TAW is estimated as:\nTAW “ 1000\
    \ pθFC ´ θWPq Zr\n(6)\nwhere θFC and θWP (cm3¨ cm´3) are the soil water content\
    \ at ﬁeld capacity and wilting point,\nrespectively, and Zr is the crop rooting\
    \ depth (m).\n2.3. Soil Water Balance Parameterization\nThe relationship between\
    \ the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Kcb allowed the direct\nintegration\
    \ of VI into the FAO-56 soil water balance model. The spatial representation of\
    \ the model\ndepends on the scale of the inputs parameters. Working with Landsat\
    \ images the spatial scale is\n30 ˆ 30 m, but, considering the possible inaccuracies\
    \ in the images processing, we selected a square\nof 90 ˆ 90 m formed by 9 pixels\
    \ (around 1 ha). The estimation of Ke was implemented for the apple\norchard characteristics,\
    \ taking into account that the vegetation cover at midseason was 30% and\n40%\
    \ for the 2010–2011 and 2012–2013 growing seasons, respectively. This could lead\
    \ to a high water\nevaporation rate after irrigation or rainfall events. According\
    \ to [37], a value of REW of 4 mm was\nused to avoid the total consumption of\
    \ evaporable water in just a few days. A surface soil evaporation\nlayer with\
    \ a depth of 0.10 m was adopted because the soil is shaded by trees and covered\
    \ by weeds.\nThe observed fraction of the soil wetted by irrigation events was\
    \ 0.3, while the fraction of wetted and\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 253\n6 of 20\n\
    exposed soil was estimated following the FAO-56 approach. The depletion fraction\
    \ (p) was set at 0.50\nfor ETc, approximately 5 mm¨ day´1. The ﬁeld capacity and\
    \ wilting point were obtained from the soil\ntextures using the equation derived\
    \ by [38]. The parameters used in this study are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.\n\

    \ Data: EC Fluxes, Meteorological Data, Soil Moisture and Apple Water Status\n\
    An eddy covariance system (EC) was installed in the ﬁeld for three months, coinciding\
    \ with\nthe midseason growth stage to measure the latent and sensible heat ﬂuxes.\
    \ In the 2012–13 season,\nmeasurements were extended from November 2012 to April\
    \ 2013. The EC system consists of an\nopen-path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (LI-7500,\
    \ Licor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), to measure the\nconcentrations of water vapor\
    \ and carbon dioxide in the air, and a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT3,\nCampbell Scientiﬁc\
    \ Inc., Logan, UT, USA), to measure wind velocity components and temperature\n\
    variations. In both seasons, the IRGA fast response was calibrated before the\
    \ ﬁeld campaign began.\nThe frequency analysis of wind direction showed that the\
    \ dominant directions were south and\nsouthwest (See Figure 1). The sensors were\
    \ oriented towards the dominant wind direction and\nlocated at a height of 6 m\
    \ above the ground surface. The source area for the turbulent ﬂuxes (fetch) was\n\
    calculated following [39]. The analysis of the footprint model showed that the\
    \ peak footprint location\n(xmax) was obtained at 15 m and a cumulative normalized\
    \ contribution to the ﬂux measurement\n(CNF) of 90% was obtained at 278 m that\
    \ represents a height to fetch ratio of 1:46. This ratio is less\nthan conventional\
    \ ratio 1:100 usually considered for studies made over agricultural crop surfaces\n\
    but consistent with other ﬁeld observations reporting fetch to height ratios ranging\
    \ from 1:15 to\n1:75 [40–43].\nThe measurements were sampled at a frequency of\
    \ 10 Hz and were recorded into high frequency\nﬁles in a datalogger CR5000 (Campbell\
    \ Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The average values were\ncalculated and recorded\
    \ every 15 min. Raw sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes were corrected for air\ndensity\
    \ ﬂuctuations, effects of sensor separation, sampling frequency and path-length\
    \ averaging\naccording to [11,44]. Data were averaged to obtain the daily ﬂux\
    \ values, including data obtained\nduring the night period. The energy ﬂuxes coming\
    \ from north, northeast and northwest wind direction\nwere rejected and the gaps\
    \ were imputed based on the environmental conditions associated with the\nmissing\
    \ data [45,46] using a multivariate model. The associated climatic variables were\
    \ net radiation,\nair temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deﬁcit, considering\
    \ the last one as a major driver of\nlatent heat ﬂux [45]. Missing data during\
    \ some days was due to problems with the power supply and\nIRGA signal obstruction\
    \ on rainy days.\nIn addition to the EC system, a CNR1 net radiometer (Kipp &\
    \ Zonen B.V., Delft, The Netherlands)\nwas mounted at 5.35 m above the ground\
    \ to measure the net radiation (Rn), and eight HFP01\nplates (Hukseﬂux B.V., Delft,\
    \ The Netherlands) were placed at four spatially representative positions\n(2\
    \ intra-row and 2 inter-row) to capture the lighting and shading patterns that\
    \ can affect the soil heat\nﬂux (G) in heterogeneous covers [17] such as fruit\
    \ orchards. The plates were buried at a depth of\n8 cm and were accompanied by\
    \ two chrome-constantan thermocouples (TCAV, Campbell Sci. Inc.)\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2016, 8, 253\n7 of 20\nat depths of 2 and 4 cm. Additionally, two sets of capacitance\
    \ probes (EC-5 Decagon Devices, Inc.,\nPullman, WA, USA) were buried at 8, 20,\
    \ 40 and 60 cm in depth to supervise the irrigation events and\nthe depletion\
    \ dynamics (data not shown here). One set was placed close to the drip emitters\
    \ and the\nother set at the center of the inter-row area. The volumetric water\
    \ content was obtained through the\nstandard calibration equation recommended\
    \ by the manufacturer.\nThe soil heat ﬂux (G) was calculated following the combined\
    \ method [47], which considers the\nheat capacity of the surface soil to correct\
    \ the heat ﬂux measured by plates. G measurements were\naveraged, taking into\
    \ account the vegetation fraction cover at midseason (30%–40%). The soil heat\
    \ ﬂux\nand temperature measurements were recorded every 10 s and averaged every\
    \ 15 min in a datalogger\nCR3000 (Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA). In\
    \ this study, the energy imbalance was corrected\nby Bowen Ratio closure approach\
    \ [48].\nThe reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and precipitation were obtained\
    \ using meteorological data\nfrom an automatic weather station—installed over\
    \ grass with optimum growth conditions—located\none km from the experimental site\
    \ (35˝25120”S; 71˝23111”W). The daily ETo was calculated using the\nFAO-56 Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation [3].\nTo evaluate the water status of the apple trees, the midday stem\
    \ water potential was measured by a\npressure chamber (PMS600, PMS Instruments\
    \ Company, Corvallis, OR, USA). The stem water potential\nwas measured at solar\
    \ noon on 18 fully expanded leaves located near the bases of the trees. Selected\n\
    leaves were saved in plastic bags covered with aluminum foil for 2 h before the\
    \ measurement [49].\nThe measurements were taken weekly from December to January\
    \ during the 2010–2011 and from\nNovember to March during the 2012–2013 growing\
    \ season.\n2.5. Remote Sensing Data Acquisition and Processing\nThe assessment\
    \ of the remote sensing-based soil water balance used satellite images acquired\
    \ by\nthe Landsat-5 thematic mapper (L5-TM), Landsat-7 enhanced thematic mapper\
    \ plus with the scan line\ncorrector off (L7-ETM+) and Landsat-8 operational land\
    \ imager (L8-OLI) sensors (Path-Row 233-085).\nFortunately, the plot is located\
    \ in the gap-free zone for L7-ETM+ images. Thus, the information\nprovided was\

    \ Correction (Level 1T) data were provided every 16 days. This product\nhas been\
    \ geometrically corrected and georeferenced. The image processing included the\
    \ atmospheric\nand radiometric corrections of the optical bands using the Fast\
    \ Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis\nof Spectral Hypercubes module (FLAASH) implemented\
    \ in ENVI 4.5 [50]. The FLAASH code based\non the radiative transfer model MODTRAN4\
    \ [51] and the 6S model [52] retrieved atmospheric water\nvapor content and monthly\
    \ aerosol data. The procedure included the image calibration using the\ncoefﬁcients\
    \ proposed in the literature for L-5 TM y L-7 ETM+ [53].\nTo evaluate the performance\
    \ of the atmospheric correction method, eight surface SAVI images\nobtained using\
    \ the FLAASH were compared with SAVI images obtained from Landsat Surface\nReﬂectance\
    \ products. The comparison was applied to a 3 ˆ 3 km (100 ˆ 100 pixels) section\
    \ of\nthe study area and did not utilize SAVI values lower than 0.1 (non-vegetated\
    \ areas). The values of SAVI\nobtained by both approaches ﬁt quite well, with\
    \ a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 0.00022\nfor all dates. These results\
    \ support the atmospheric correction method used in the present study.\nIn this\
    \ study, the SAVI was chosen to model the basal crop coefﬁcient [54]. SAVI minimizes\n\
    the variations in the vegetation index due to the background soil brightness,\
    \ which could become\nsigniﬁcant in fruit orchards with heterogeneous cover. SAVI\
    \ is deﬁned as:\nSAVI “\nNIR ´ red\nNIR ´ red ` L p1 ` Lq\n(7)\nwhere NIR and\
    \ red are the reﬂectances in the near infrared and red bands of the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum, respectively. L is an adjustment factor that reduces the soil background\
    \ inﬂuences under\ndifferent vegetation cover conditions. The optimal value of\
    \ L decreases as vegetation cover increases:\nL = 1 for very low vegetation densities,\
    \ L = 0.5 for intermediate vegetation densities and L = 0.25 for\nhigher densities.\
    \ A single value of L = 0.5 was used in this study, which was shown to reduce\
    \ soil\nnoise considerably throughout the range in vegetation densities [8,20,27,54].\n\
    The vegetation indices were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis and averaged\
    \ over a 90 ˆ 90 m\narea (3 ˆ 3 pixels), departing from the tower station in the\
    \ main wind direction to represent the\nheterogeneity in the orchard but avoiding\
    \ the edge effects.\n2.6. Statistical Analysis\nDaily and weekly values of measured\
    \ and estimated ETc were compared by using a linear\nregression analysis and a\
    \ series of statistics described by [55]: RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE),\nmean\
    \ bias error (MBE) and index of agreement (d) used as a relative measure of the\
    \ difference among\nvariables. Perfect agreement would exist between observed\
    \ and modeled values if d = 1. Additionally,\nthe relative RMSE and relative MAE\
    \ were provided to evaluate the models performance [56].\n3. Results and Discussion\n\
    3.1. Meteorological Conditions and Plant Water Status\nThe temporal evolution\
    \ of ETo, the precipitation events and the amount and timing of irrigations\n\
    applied by the grower for both seasons are shown in Figure 2. The average accumulated\
    \ values of ETo\nwere 975 and 875 mm for the 2010–2011 and 2012–2013 growing seasons,\
    \ respectively. The highest\nvalues of ETo occurred in the summer (6.8 mm during\
    \ 2010–2011 and 6.6 mm for 2012–2013 season)\nand the lowest values occurred in\
    \ the winter (approximately 0.4 mm for both seasons). The total\nprecipitation\
    \ for the 2010–2011 season was 255 mm, while that for the 2012–2013 season was\
    \ 373 mm.\nThe irrigation depths applied by the farmer were 547 and 439 mm for\
    \ the ﬁrst and second seasons,\nrespectively. The average values of midday stem\
    \ water potential during the midseason ranged from\n´0.9 to ´1.35 MPa for the\
    \ 2010–2011 season, while that for the 2012–2013 season ranged from ´1.18\nto\
    \ ´1.49 MPa, which indicated that the apple trees were not under water stress\
    \ during most of the\ngrowing season, in accordance with previous studies [12,57,58].\
    \ The lowest values of midday stem\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 253\n9 of 20\nwater\
    \ potential (between ´1.65 and ´2.01 MPa) were observed during March 2013, indicating\

    \ of ETc and Kc in the Apple Orchard \nDirect measurement of the four energy balance\
    \ components were evaluated in the analyzed \nstudy site. Figure 3 shows the linear\
    \ fit between the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes (H + LE) \nand the available\

    \ of 0.87 \nand an intercept of 13 W·m−2. The coefficient of determination was\
    \ 0.83. These results showed an \nunderestimation of the turbulent fluxes lower\
    \ than 13% of the total available energy and an RMSE of \n22 W·m−2, which is in\
    \ agreement with other studies based on this type of micrometeorological \nmeasurements\
    \ in similar canopies [59,60]. According with the most recent studies, the lack\
    \ of energy \nbalance closure does not constitute a clear evidence for erroneous\
    \ turbulent flux measurements and \nother causes such the storage of energy and\
    \ heat in the canopy biomass, the storage of heat in the soil \nlayer over the\
    \ heat flux sensors and metabolism could contribute to this imbalance [61]. Conversely,\
    \ \nmany authors propose the correction of energy balance imbalance that could\
    \ be attributed to \nmeasurements errors in Rn and G, inconsistent source areas\
    \ between EC sensible and latent heat \nfluxes and surface available energy, length\
    \ of sampling intervals, sensor separation, and dispersive \nfluxes not sampled\
    \ by EC system [62]. The most widespread methods to correct the energy \nimbalance\
    \ are the Bowen ratio (BR) and the residual energy correction method (ER). In\
    \ this paper we \nadopted the BR approach suggested by [48] as the most appropriate.\
    \ The BR correction method \nassumes that H and LE are underestimated, and available\
    \ surface energy is considered reliable and \nrepresentative of the eddy covariance\
    \ flux footprint. According to [48,63], no compelling evidence \nFigure 2. Daily\

    \ Figure 3 shows the linear ﬁt between the sum of sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes\

    \ of determination was 0.83. These results showed an\nunderestimation of the turbulent\

    \ founded that\nthe correction of LE ﬂux based on BR method improve the stability\
    \ of the experimental values of the\ncrop coefﬁcient, reducing the presence of\
    \ spikes or unreal values in the temporal evolution of this\ncoefﬁcient. The correction\
    \ based on the BR method increases the LE values in 10 W¨ m´2 on average,\nor\

    \ \nThe mean daily ETc measured during the midseason was 3.24 and 3.77 mm for\
    \ the 2010–2011 \nand 2012–2013 seasons, respectively, although the ETc showed\
    \ a large day-to-day variability (Figure \n4). The ETc values were mainly affected\
    \ by the daily variation of ETo, in addition to the effect of \nirrigation or\
    \ precipitation events that increased the soil evaporation. On the other hand,\
    \ the Kc \nvalues tended to remain fairly constant during the midseason, although\
    \ temporal variations were \ncaused by the irrigation frequency (every 3–5 days).\
    \ The mean value of Kc during the midseason for \n2010–2011 season was 0.60, while\
    \ that for 2012–2013 was 0.77. During both seasons, the maximum Kc \nvalues were\
    \ obtained after irrigation or rainfall events (varying between 0.83 and 1.22),\
    \ while the \nminimum Kc values were usually observed 3–4 days after irrigation\
    \ (between 0.41 and 0.52). \nThe observed differences between the mean values\
    \ of Kc for the two studied seasons could be \nexplained by the difference in\
    \ the peak of the ground cover fraction (30% and 40% in 2010–2011 and \n2012–2013\
    \ season, respectively). The midseason Kc values obtained in this study were similar\
    \ to the \nvalues reported by [65] (between 0.65 and 0.77) obtained from weighing\
    \ lysimeter measurements for \na Golden Smoothee apple orchard with a comparable\
    \ canopy size (34%–40%). However, for a cover \nfraction of 45%, reference [65]\
    \ observed a higher Kc (1.04). Additionally, references [3,7] suggested Kc \n\
    values of 1.2 and 1.15, respectively, for apple trees with active ground cover\
    \ and a fraction cover of 0.5. \nThe long time series available for the 2012–2013\
    \ season allowed the analysis of the temporal \nevolution of measured Kc values\
    \ until harvest. From the midseason to harvest, Kc tended to remain \nconstant\
    \ except after fruit removal, Kc values decreased, reaching minimum values of\
    \ approximately \n0.4. This effect was also reported by [12,65] for Golden Smoothee\
    \ apples. \nFigure 3. Overall comparison between sensible heat ﬂux plus latent\

    \ (Figure 4).\nThe ETc values were mainly affected by the daily variation of ETo,\

    \ of the drip-irrigated apple orchard is shown in Figure 5 \nalong with the Kcb\
    \ obtained from eddy covariance system. Kcb and SAVI time series showed to be\
    \ in \nagreement. The shaded area represents the midseason, when the inter-row\
    \ ground cover is dry, and \nthe value of the SAVI were mainly attributable to\
    \ the apple canopy. However, the SAVI values at the \ninitial, crop development\
    \ and late season growth stages exhibited the effect of weed cover growing \n\
    in the inter-row area. It should be noted that the SAVI values at the initial\
    \ and crop development \ngrowth stages represented the growth of the apple-weeds\
    \ cover mixture. In this study site, the inter \nrow weeds dried naturally in\
    \ early December for both seasons. From this date until harvest, the \nSAVI values\
    \ belonged to the apple canopy. The evolution of SAVI showed the differences of\
    \ full \ncanopy cover between both growing seasons due to the orchard age. Since\
    \ the full cover was lower \nin 2010–2011 season and some precipitation events\
    \ occurred in March and April, the SAVI values of \npost-harvest period showed\
    \ a noted increase due to a greater growth of weeds in early April. The \n2012–2013\
    \ season showed a constant value of SAVI in post-harvest period until the leaf\
    \ drop which \nmeans a low weeds cover because the precipitation events started\
    \ in May. However, Kcb values \nshowed a reduction after harvest (Figure 5, 2012–2013\
    \ season). Fruit sink removal decreases the tree \nwater use [65]. SAVI was selected\
    \ to derive Kcb for the apple orchard because it was less sensitive to \nbackground\
    \ effects while NDVI showed a higher variation during the analyzed campaigns that\
    \ did \nnot correspond with variations in the analyzed canopy [54]. \nFigure 4.\

    \ is shown in Figure 5\nalong with the Kcb obtained from eddy covariance system.\
    \ Kcb and SAVI time series showed to be in\nagreement. The shaded area represents\

    \ \nthe period with apple-weeds cover mixture. \n3.4. Kcb Modeled from SAVI \n\
    As mentioned previously, the Kcb values were obtained by the SAVI-Kcb linear relationship.\
    \ This \nrelationship was established between the observed maximum and minimum\
    \ Kcb and their \ncorresponding maximum and minimum values of SAVI as suggested\
    \ by previous studies [8,19,26]. \nThe average maximum SAVI was 0.37 at effective\
    \ full cover when the inter-row weeds were dead, \nand its corresponding average\
    \ maximum Kcb was 0.61. The dates that achieved these requirements \nwere 1 January\
    \ 2011, 27 November 2012, 30 January 2013, 15 February 2013 and 19 March 2013.\
    \ On \nthe other hand, the minimum SAVI value was 0.12 averaged from bare soil\
    \ next to the study site, \nand its corresponding minimum Kcb was 0.15, which\
    \ was taken from FAO-56 [3] for apple trees after \nleaf drop over dead ground\
    \ cover or bare soil because the evaluated orchard presented active weeds \nafter\
    \ leaf drop until December. The resulting equation for the study apple orchard\
    \ is shown in \nFigure 6. The SAVI-Kcb relationship resulted in a high coefficient\
    \ of determination (R2 = 0.95). \nPrevious efforts have reported VI-Kcb linear\
    \ relationships for several herbaceous crops, such as \ncorn, wheat, cotton, potato,\
    \ sugar beet and garlic [6,15,19,24–27,66], however there are few studies \nfor\
    \ fruit trees. In that regard, the SAVI-Kcb and NDVI-Kcb linear relationships\
    \ for vineyards have \nbeen reported by [8,20], whereas [27] recently applied\
    \ linear relationships for mandarin, olive and \npeach and concluded that additional\
    \ research with other crops would be desirable. \nSince the relationship between\
    \ VI and crop coefficient was based on the basal crop coefficient \nKcb, that\
    \ is defined as the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration over the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ \nwhen the soil surface is dry but transpiration is occurring at potential rate\
    \ [3], the value of Kcb is only \naffected by the canopy development. The effect\
    \ of the soil moisture in the plant transpiration is \nprovided by the water stress\
    \ coefficient, while the effect of soil moisture in surface evaporation is \n\
    provided by the soil evaporation coefficient. The relationship presented in Figure\
    \ 6 was used during \nthe whole growing season. Unfortunately, Kcb-SAVI pairs\
    \ during the development and late-season \nFigure 5. Evolution of the soil adjusted\
    \ vegetation index (SAVI) and the basal crop coefﬁcient from\nthe eddy covariance\

    growing seasons. Shaded areas represent the midseason growth stages. Unﬁlled squares\
    \ represent the\nperiod with apple-weeds cover mixture.\n3.4. Kcb Modeled from\
    \ SAVI\nAs mentioned previously, the Kcb values were obtained by the SAVI-Kcb\
    \ linear relationship.\nThis relationship was established between the observed\
    \ maximum and minimum Kcb and their\ncorresponding maximum and minimum values\
    \ of SAVI as suggested by previous studies [8,19,26].\nThe average maximum SAVI\
    \ was 0.37 at effective full cover when the inter-row weeds were dead,\nand its\
    \ corresponding average maximum Kcb was 0.61. The dates that achieved these requirements\n\

    \ March 2013. On the\nother hand, the minimum SAVI value was 0.12 averaged from\
    \ bare soil next to the study site, and its\ncorresponding minimum Kcb was 0.15,\
    \ which was taken from FAO-56 [3] for apple trees after leaf\ndrop over dead ground\
    \ cover or bare soil because the evaluated orchard presented active weeds after\n\
    leaf drop until December. The resulting equation for the study apple orchard is\
    \ shown in Figure 6.\nThe SAVI-Kcb relationship resulted in a high coefﬁcient\
    \ of determination (R2 = 0.95).\nPrevious efforts have reported VI-Kcb linear\
    \ relationships for several herbaceous crops, such as\ncorn, wheat, cotton, potato,\
    \ sugar beet and garlic [6,15,19,24–27,66], however there are few studies for\n\
    fruit trees. In that regard, the SAVI-Kcb and NDVI-Kcb linear relationships for\
    \ vineyards have been\nreported by [8,20], whereas [27] recently applied linear\
    \ relationships for mandarin, olive and peach\nand concluded that additional research\
    \ with other crops would be desirable.\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 253\n13 of 20\n\

    \ the similarity between the apple \nrelationship obtained in this work and the\
    \ previous relationship reported by [8] for a row structured \nfruit orchard (vineyard).\
    \ Although the development and analysis of specific relationships for new \ncrops\
    \ or canopies with different management are always recommended, the similarities\
    \ founded in \nthis study point to the evaluation of previous equations for the\
    \ assessment of ETc and irrigation \nrequirements in several fruit trees. \n \n\

    \ Evaluation of the One Layer Soil Water Balance Model for Estimating ETc \nThe\
    \ remote sensing-based water balance was applied, assimilating the reflectance\
    \ based Kcb \nvalues, meteorological data and applied irrigation depths doses\
    \ and dates at a daily scale. The \nmodeled and measured ETc values were compared\
    \ during the midseason for both campaigns \n(Figure 7). The results at the daily\
    \ scale indicate a reasonable agreement between the observed and \nmodeled ETc\
    \ values, with an RMSE lower than 0.78 mm·day−1 for both analyzed campaigns, which\
    \ is \nequivalent to relative errors of 25%. Similar values of relative RMSE of\
    \ daily ETc (19%–27%) was also \nreported by [56] for a land cover of annual crops\
    \ mainly. The general agreement was slightly better \nfor the 2012–2013 campaign\
    \ with an RMSE of 0.74 mm·day−1 and an index of agreement (d) of 0.90 \n(Table\
    \ 3). \nAs described in previous applications of the remote sensing-based water\
    \ balance model [8,59], \nthe greater discrepancies between modeled and measured\
    \ ETc were found after precipitation and \nirrigation events. Wetting events produced\
    \ an overestimation of daily ETc due to bare soil \nevaporation that are not adequately\
    \ simulated by the dual approach at a daily scale, but the total \namount for\
    \ longer periods seems to be properly modeled [36,37]. The comparison of ETc for\
    \ a weekly \nperiod indicated a considerably better agreement for both growing\
    \ seasons, reducing the RMSE to \nvalues lower than 0.60 mm·day−1 in both campaigns,\
    \ which mean a relative error less than 20% \n(Table 4). The improvement of the\
    \ model performance on a weekly basis was due to several reasons \nFigure 6. Kcb-SAVI\
    \ linear relationship for the studied apple orchard. Kcb values at effective full\
    \ cover\ncorrespond to the apple canopy without weeds.\nSince the relationship\
    \ between VI and crop coefﬁcient was based on the basal crop coefﬁcient\nKcb,\
    \ that is deﬁned as the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration over the reference\
    \ evapotranspiration\nwhen the soil surface is dry but transpiration is occurring\
    \ at potential rate [3], the value of Kcb is\nonly affected by the canopy development.\
    \ The effect of the soil moisture in the plant transpiration\nis provided by the\
    \ water stress coefﬁcient, while the effect of soil moisture in surface evaporation\
    \ is\nprovided by the soil evaporation coefﬁcient. The relationship presented\
    \ in Figure 6 was used during\nthe whole growing season. Unfortunately, Kcb-SAVI\
    \ pairs during the development and late-season\ngrowth stages were not available\
    \ to discuss in depth the possible variations in this relationship due to\nthe\
    \ various crop growth stages and the understory vegetation effect. Nevertheless,\
    \ previous works\nindicated a good correlation between Kcb or related parameters\
    \ and VI during the entire growing\nseason for vineyard [8] and wheat [67]. It\
    \ should be noted the similarity between the apple relationship\nobtained in this\
    \ work and the previous relationship reported by [8] for a row structured fruit\
    \ orchard\n(vineyard). Although the development and analysis of speciﬁc relationships\
    \ for new crops or canopies\nwith different management are always recommended,\
    \ the similarities founded in this study point to\nthe evaluation of previous\
    \ equations for the assessment of ETc and irrigation requirements in several\n\
    fruit trees.\n3.5. Evaluation of the One Layer Soil Water Balance Model for Estimating\
    \ ETc\nThe remote sensing-based water balance was applied, assimilating the reﬂectance\
    \ based Kcb\nvalues, meteorological data and applied irrigation depths doses and\
    \ dates at a daily scale. The modeled\nand measured ETc values were compared during\
    \ the midseason for both campaigns (Figure 7).\nThe results at the daily scale\
    \ indicate a reasonable agreement between the observed and modeled ETc\nvalues,\
    \ with an RMSE lower than 0.78 mm¨ day´1 for both analyzed campaigns, which is\
    \ equivalent\nto relative errors of 25%. Similar values of relative RMSE of daily\
    \ ETc (19%–27%) was also reported\nby [56] for a land cover of annual crops mainly.\
    \ The general agreement was slightly better for the\n2012–2013 campaign with an\
    \ RMSE of 0.74 mm¨ day´1 and an index of agreement (d) of 0.90 (Table 3).\nRemote\

    \ evaporation\nthat are not adequately simulated by the dual approach at a daily\
    \ scale, but the total amount for\nlonger periods seems to be properly modeled\
    \ [36,37]. The comparison of ETc for a weekly period\nindicated a considerably\
    \ better agreement for both growing seasons, reducing the RMSE to values\nlower\
    \ than 0.60 mm¨ day´1 in both campaigns, which mean a relative error less than\
    \ 20% (Table 4).\nThe improvement of the model performance on a weekly basis was\
    \ due to several reasons as the\nreduction of the effect of meteorological conditions\
    \ in the values of Kc [49] and the improvement of the\nprecision of the top soil\
    \ evaporation sub-model when the results are analyzed for weekly or greater\n\
    time periods [37]. This improvement in the model performance was greater in the\
    \ 2010–2011 campaign\nbecause the canopy development was lower during all the\
    \ season resulting in a greater inﬂuence of the\nsoil evaporation component. In\

    \ used in commercial orchards for the assessment and application of irrigation\
    \ needs. Another\nfactor that could explain the difference between the measured\

    \ water balance over row structured\nfruit trees have been done over vineyard,\
    \ olives or other fruit than apple. Here, satellite-based crop\ncoefﬁcient and\
    \ ETc for apple orchard was reported and the model accuracy was compared with\n\
    previous works that estimated ETc for similar canopies using satellite data. The\
    \ RMSEs obtained in this\nstudy for both growing seasons were lower than the range\
    \ reported by [31] (0.9–1.0 mm¨ day´1) for a\nland cover roughly classiﬁed as\
    \ apple orchard (4.5 m height) with dispersed crops (wheat) using visible,\nnear-\
    \ and thermal-infrared data from MODIS products. Working in similar canopies like\
    \ vineyards\non a trellis system [30] obtained an RMSE equal to 0.45 and 0.76\
    \ mm¨ day´1 during two consecutive\ngrowing seasons comparing EC measurements\
    \ and ETc derived from a remote sensing-based water\nbalance, using the relationship\
    \ between NDVI and the single crop coefﬁcient Kc. For a variety of\nrainfed and\
    \ irrigation vineyards, reference [68] obtained an RMSE lower than 0.65 mm¨ day´1\
    \ for each\nanalyzed campaign using a satellite-based crop coefﬁcient and one\
    \ layer soil water balance. In a row\nstructured vineyard, reference [69] obtained\
    \ an RMSE of 0.47 mm¨ day´1 (17% of the measured values)\nusing the single crop\
    \ coefﬁcient approach based on the FAO-56 tabulated coefﬁcients. Additionally,\n\
    the authors reported an RMSE of 0.37 mm¨ day´1 (13% of the measured values) by\
    \ dual crop coefﬁcient\napproach combined with sap-ﬂow techniques. A similar range\
    \ of the RMSE for ETc estimations using\nthe crop coefﬁcient vs. vegetation index\
    \ relationship was also reported for peach (0.9 mm¨ day´1) and\nolive (0.32–0.73\
    \ mm¨ day´1) [27].\nIn addition, we want to highlight the possible limitation\
    \ of the FAO-56 soil water balance model for\nthe assessment of the root zone\
    \ water depletion and stress coefﬁcient in the present conditions, that is\na\
    \ drip irrigated apple orchard with active inter-row weeds during the initial\
    \ and crop development\ngrowth stages. Firstly, the model considered the whole\
    \ area as equally wetted and explored by the\nroots of the apple trees. However,\
    \ for widely spaced crops as apple trees, drip-irrigation systems\nnormally wet\
    \ only a portion of the horizontal, cross-sectional area of soil [70]. Previous\
    \ studies have\ndemonstrated that some fruit trees, such as apple, kiwifruit and\
    \ olive, can modify their pattern of\nwater uptake in preference to roots placed\
    \ in wet soil bulb [71–73]. Speciﬁcally, in mature apple trees,\nreference [71]\
    \ observed that 70% of tree water uptake occurred in the top 0.4 m, because there\
    \ were\nmany ﬁne roots near the soil surface. These studies indicate that apple\
    \ trees are able to increase uptake\nfrom wet parts of the soil while reducing\
    \ uptake from the dry parts of the root zone. In our study,\nthe moisture sensors\
    \ buried at the center of the inter-row showed that this area was not affected\
    \ by\nirrigation events due to a combination of irrigation amounts, the location\
    \ of the drip system and soil\ntexture. This partial allocation of water amounts\
    \ in the soil area could result in an overestimation of the\nwater stress conditions\
    \ simulated by the model, which distributed the irrigation water in the whole\
    \ area.\nIn other words, the simulation results in a misrepresentation of the\
    \ water stress conditions that might\nnot match the actual conditions. Secondly,\
    \ the senescence of the weeds in the center of the alley during\nthe midseason\
    \ indicated that they did not use the irrigation water in this area. Nevertheless,\
    \ during\nRemote Sens. 2016, 8, 253\n16 of 20\nthe initial and crop development\
    \ growth stages, the soil water balance based on medium resolution\nsatellite\
    \ data will result in Kcb values which consider the transpiration of apple tree\
    \ and weeds.\nAdditional research would be desirable to achieve a separated water\
    \ balances [59,74]—incorporating\nhigh resolutions satellite data—for the areas\
    \ affected and non-affected by irrigation to obtain an\naccurate estimation of\
    \ ETc and optimize water management in orchards.\nThe remote sensing-based water\
    \ balance model was inverted to estimate the optimum irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ according to the proposed formulation and constraints in reference to the maximum\n\
    daily irrigation dose. The modeled irrigation water needs to avoid water stress\
    \ were 457 in 2010–2011\nand 412 mm in 2012–2013. These requirements resulted\
    \ from the combination of ETo, precipitation and\nKc values for the each growing\
    \ season (September to May). The accumulated ETo during 2010–2011\ngrowing season\
    \ was higher than 2012–2013 growing season (975 and 875 mm, respectively), whereas\n\
    rainfall was lower (255 and 373 mm, respectively).\nOn the other hand, the midseason\
    \ Kc values were higher for the second growing season\n(0.63 and 0.73 for 2010–2011\
    \ and 2012–2013 growing seasons, respectively) due to a greater vegetation\ncover\
    \ attributed to the orchard age. The modeled irrigation requirements are lower\
    \ than the irrigation\napplied by the grower for both seasons (547 mm and 439\
    \ mm in 2010–2011 and 2012–2013 season,\nrespectively). Even though the amount\
    \ of irrigation applied by the grower was greater than the\nmodeled one, a reduction\
    \ of the stress coefﬁcient, and, thus, Kc value in precise moments showed\nthat\
    \ irrigation timing was inadequate. In addition, the deep percolation observed\
    \ with the grower\nirrigation was greater than the modeled one due to irrigation\
    \ applied closer to precipitation events.\nHence, the results indicate a potential\
    \ improvement in the irrigation scheduling based on the model\ndiscussed here\
    \ and the need to implement advisory services based on precise models, such as\
    \ the\nmethodology described in this paper.\n4. Conclusions\nThe main results\
    \ of this work have demonstrated that the satellite-based soil water balance was\n\
    able to appropriately estimate crop evapotranspiration at ﬁeld canopy scales and\
    \ water depletion\nfor an apple orchard during two growing seasons (2010–2011\
    \ and 2012–2013) in Maule Region,\nChile. The RMSE between the measured and modeled\
    \ daily ETc was 0.78 and 0.74 mm¨ day´1 for\n2010–2011 and 2012–2013 seasons,\
    \ respectively. However, weekly basis ETc estimation improved the\nmodel performance\
    \ avoiding the inaccurate simulation of peak values after wetting events (0.32\
    \ and\n0.60 mm¨ day´1 for the ﬁrst and second seasons, respectively). The essential\
    \ parameter to estimate ETc\nwas the reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcient obtained\
    \ from satellite images, which responds to actual\ncrop conditions in the ﬁeld.\
    \ This parameter was obtained using a linear relationship established\nbetween\
    \ the basal crop coefﬁcient and SAVI due to the similarity in the temporal pattern\
    \ of both\nparameters. The linear relationship developed for the apple orchard\
    \ resulted in a signiﬁcant similarity\nwith a previous relationship for row structured\
    \ grapes. The results allow for the conclusion that the\nremote sensing-base water\
    \ balance could be used as an operational tool to estimate ETc and to plan\nthe\
    \ irrigation of apple orchards over large areas.\nThe continuous measurement of\
    \ ETc data during the entire growing season should be considered\nin future studies\
    \ to evaluate the performance of the remote sensing-based water balance in all\n\
    growth stages, as well as additional ground reﬂectance data at initial and crop\
    \ development stages,\nwhich mostly occur during cloud cover intervals.\nAcknowledgments:\n\

  title: Estimating Evapotranspiration of an Apple Orchard Using a Remote Sensing-Based
    Soil Water Balance
  verbatim_quote1: The proposed methodology could be considered as a useful tool for
    scheduling irrigation and driving the estimation of water requirements over large
    areas for apple orchards.
  verbatim_quote2: The methodology was applied during two growing seasons (2010–2011
    and 2012–2013), and ETc was evaluated using latent heat flux measurements (LE)
    from an eddy covariance system. The results indicate that the remote sensing-based
    soil water balance estimated ETc reasonably well over two growing seasons. The
    root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured and simulated ETc values during
    2010–2011 and 2012–2013 were, respectively, 0.78 and 0.74 mm¨ day´1, which mean
    a relative error of 25%.

- analysis: This paper proposes a smart irrigation system that combines IoT and machine
    learning to optimize water usage and improve crop health. The system uses sensors
    to collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and rainfall, and this data is
    then analyzed using machine learning algorithms to predict when to irrigate and
    how much water to apply. The paper presents a detailed evaluation of the system,
    showing that it can achieve a 98.6% identification rate and a 0.12 root mean square
    error (RMSE). Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field
    of smart irrigation and demonstrates the potential of using IoT and machine learning
    to improve agricultural practices. However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive
    analysis of the types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their
    typical sources, which is the focus of the outline point.

    Conference Location: Vellore, India SECTION I. Introduction Precision farming,
    also called “agriculture 4.0,” is a form that analyses agriculture management,
    calculates, and reacts to changes in the same setting and additional environmental
    yields. The primary focus of the study of the research of agricultural industry
    4.0 is to develop a judgement support system to control the entire agricultural
    sector to maximise resource earnings and input conservation. The first steps towards
    Crop monitoring and remote sensing health sensors, agriculture 4.0 includes anticipating
    the pumping and the results of various fertilisers. Crop Monitoring and Management:
    Sensors, drones, and satellite imagery can monitor crops in real-time, collecting
    data on soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and plant growth. This data
    can then be analysed to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilisation,
    and pest management, optimising crop yield and reducing resource waste. The former
    expression was analysed to ascertain agricultural yields in the ag assiduity.
    The husbandry business blockchain includes seed force, marketing and distribution
    strategy, agrochemicals, agrarian tools, yield products, and beast husbandry.
    This agri- food structure includes actors in and organisations that affect the
    food and fibre force chain. Plans must be made for water., developed because it''s
    a limited and significant natural resource that''s also a necessity, it must be
    defended, managed, and most importantly, utilised wisely. Effective oversight
    of the Water coffers is needed at the ranch position because of increased demand
    and confined force. Crop yields must be enhanced in regions with limited water
    force to maximise agrarian productivity and satisfy the demands for unborn food
    products. To wash further land with the same quantum of water, the limited water
    force must be utilised effectively. Some academics have lately employed machine
    literacy and the Internet of Effects to handle An irrigation issue precisely.
    Ref [1] enforced an real-time irrigation control model to assess root zones with
    inadequate soil humidity(RZSMD). The authors[2] identified the data on the water
    balance to produce a direct time series model using a system. LSTM, or Deep Long
    Short-Term Memory, predicts soil humidity for lychees using successional processing
    over time. The authors introduced the estate in [3] as a medium to allow automatic
    irrigation decisions. The authors of [3] proposed timber (SIDSS) two models, including
    element least places regression (PLSR), and a straight retrogression model was
    created. This fashion enables the estimate of the irrigation conditions for a
    week. Although these models enable more precise irrigation control, their slice
    is fairly slow and defined to the area where they''re calibrated due to the use
    of data analysis ways. We seek to effectively manage intelligent, independent
    irrigation in this work by presenting a fashion to irrigation vaticination. In
    four-way, we moved forward Detector installation (Detectors for soil humidity,
    temperature, and rain) Detectors and accession system integration Using the knot-RED
    platform, aims to simplify monitoring, storing, and waking. And Several ways,
    including KNN, coadjutor vector machines, and logarithmic retrogression with naive
    Bayes are used to reuse the acquired data. The findings demonstrated that, with
    a decision-making rate of 98.6, the KNN algorithm outperformed the others. This
    tactic will be particularly salutary for large-scale irrigation systems or domestic
    operations. The tough task of soddening shops will be simplified, and water operations
    will be bettered. Then''s how the remainder of the paper will be presented The
    fine conception of husbandry4.0, artificial intelligence, and the result to treatment
    using a direct model all be covered in the alternate section. Finally, the database
    structure, methodology, findings, and ultimately a conclusion and outlook will
    all be presented in the third section. SECTION II. Related Work Smart agriculture,
    also known as precision agriculture or digital agriculture, involves using modern
    technologies to optimise and enhance agricultural processes. Here are some examples
    of smart agriculture applications: Livestock Monitoring: Sensors and wearables
    can be used to monitor the health and well-being of livestock, tracking parameters
    such as body temperature, heart rate, and location. This helps farmers detect
    early signs of illness or distress, allowing for timely intervention and reducing
    losses due to diseases or injuries. Precision Fertilisation: Soil and plant nutrient
    sensors can provide data on nutrient levels in the soil and plants, enabling farmers
    to apply fertilisers more precisely and efficiently. This minimises over-fertilisation,
    reduces nutrient runoff, and lowers costs while optimising crop nutrition. Automated
    Pest Management: Smart agriculture technologies can help monitor and manage pests
    and diseases in crops. For example, drones with cameras or sensors can detect
    early signs of pest infestations or diseases, allowing farmers to take prompt
    action and minimise crop losses. Supply Chain Management: Blockchain technology
    can improve transparency and traceability in the agricultural supply chain, ensuring
    that food products are produced, processed, and transported safely and sustainably.
    This helps improve food safety, quality, and consumer trust. Farm Automation:
    Automated machinery and robotics can be used for planting, harvesting, and packing,
    reducing labour costs and increasing operational efficiency. This can also help
    address labour shortages in agriculture, particularly in regions where labour
    is scarce or expensive. These are just a few examples of the many smart agriculture
    applications developed and adopted worldwide. Integrating modern technologies
    into agriculture can revolutionise farming practices, making them more efficient,
    sustainable, and productive. Traditional agriculture has played a significant
    role as the foundation for development in many parts of the world. Traditional
    agricultural practices have been the primary means societies have produced food,
    fed their populations, and sustained their livelihoods for thousands of years.
    In addition, traditional agriculture has been the backbone of rural economies,
    providing employment opportunities, generating income, and supporting local food
    systems. One of the key ways in which traditional agriculture has served as the
    foundation for development is through food security. Traditional agricultural
    practices, such as subsistence farming, have helped communities meet their basic
    food needs, ensuring they have enough to eat and sustain themselves. In addition,
    in many regions, traditional agricultural practices have allowed communities to
    adapt to local environmental conditions and sustainably produce food using local
    knowledge and resources. Traditional agriculture has also contributed to economic
    development. It has provided employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas
    where agriculture is a primary economic activity. Conventional agricultural practices
    often involve labour-intensive activities, such as planting, harvesting, and processing
    crops, which create jobs and generate income for farmers and their families. Additionally,
    traditional agriculture has often served as a source of raw materials for local
    industries, such as textiles, handicrafts, and food processing, contributing to
    economic growth and development. Furthermore, traditional agriculture has been
    vital in preserving cultural heritage and fostering social cohesion in many communities.
    Traditional agricultural practices are often deeply rooted in local customs, traditions,
    and knowledge systems, passed down through generations. This has helped to maintain
    cultural identities and promote social cohesion within communities, strengthening
    social bonds and preserving traditional ways of life. A. Husbandry 4.0 All types
    of husbandry fall under the marquee of “agrarian 4.0,” which pays further attention
    to every aspect of the food force chain, climatic conditions, irrigation ways,
    water operation, and crop recovery, to name a many. We''ll carry the numerous
    instruments to have agrarian4.0 or husbandry to guarantee this. [16], [17] Lately,
    the assiduity ecosystem has invested in the technological invention, fastening
    primarily cheaply and largely effective product conduct with expertise-grounded
    growth acquired throughout visualisation and data collection that has been fruitful
    in developing an IoT system grounded on In addition to an IoT system built on
    smart lighting, irrigation and water exercise have both saved 5.5 billion m3 yearly.
    B. Artificial Intelligence for Husbandry AI4AI is an acronym for Innovation in
    Agriculture Using Artificial Intelligence, another rule that''s beginning to benefit
    scholars'' confidence in the field. The use of machine literacy(ML), artificial
    intelligence(AI), and fleetly espoused in husbandry regarding ranch practises
    and agrarian affairs. [6], [7] Cognitive computing is fleetly arising as the husbandry
    services technology that''s utmost disruptive because it can learn, comprehend,
    and reply to varied conditions to increase delicacy. To deliver these services,
    presently, Microsoft is uniting with 175 growers in India''s Andhra Pradesh services
    for seedlings, land, toxin, and other advice. The average yield per hectare has
    formerly increased by 30 due to this action. C. Vector Support Outfit The Support
    Vector outfit(SVM), a supervised classifier, is described as a separation hyperplane
    in formal language. Table I. Comparison between machine learning models SVMs may
    produce a hyperplane that categorises lately attained unlabeled data using labelled
    training data. An educational where i=1,2,…, n, and set(yi; xi). xi R n. Multitudinous
    SVM types represent the target element and the itch vector have been developed
    to accommodate a variety of problem and, more significantly, types of situations
    of complexity. The ideal hyperplane produced by this study''s direct SVM has the
    following shape. f(x)=wT∗x+b (1) View Source where: yi(wT∗x+b)≥1−ξi;ξ≥0 ; or each
    i=1,2, … n Various kernels are compatible with SVM models straight, polynomial,
    and outspread premise capability, both sigmoid. The input data are restated into
    an advanced-dimensional point space, and The core operation is a point product
    of those points. D. Naive Bayes The probabilistic machine learning algorithm,
    Naive Bayes Naive Bayesian, is grounded on Thomas Bayes ‘ theorem(1702 - 1761).
    The probability that A will do if B has formerly passed can be used to illustrate
    this theorem. Considering that X = (xl, xn) In the Naive Bayes(NB) algorithm,
    the variable determining the class is the dependent variable. In contrast, the
    remaining features are independent variables (X) . NB considers that the features
    aren''t affected by one another, making it stand out from other algorithms. Although
    it seems straightforward, NB is an effective bracket tool with a good track record.
    The logistic function is used when the measured outgrowth can only be one of two
    options(similar as a yea or no answer). The formulaS represent this function is
    a variable that affects how wide the wind is and where its peak (when p(x) = 1/2)
    is located. Its formula is p(x)=1/(1e(x)/s) . E. K-Nearest Neighbors The K-Nearest
    Neighbors algorithm stores all cases and assesses new cases predicated on a similarity
    metric. When categorising a case with this system, it''s assigned to the class
    with the topmost number of near neighbours. This is determined by calculating
    the distances between the case and its k nearest neighbours, among the on-point
    remote capabilities. Then, one computes the Euclidean distance by taking the square
    root of the squared-discrepancies between corresponding rudiments in both vectors.
    The Manhattan distance is determined by adding up the absolute differences in
    corresponding rudiments in both vectors. Minkowski distance is computed by taking
    the qth root of the total of absolute differences in corresponding rudiments in
    both vectors; each raised to the power of q. Former studies on supervised machine
    literacy were compared. SECTION III. Discussions A. Proposed Method This document
    provides a detailed account of our process in creating the irrigation system.
    The entire process, as shown in Fig. 1, involved colourful stages. The first stage
    involved opting for the detectors demanded for the smart irrigation commencing
    with the soil humidity detector in the model. Weather Monitoring and Prediction:
    Weather stations and weather prediction models can provide farmers with accurate
    weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and
    solar radiation. This information helps farmers plan planting, harvesting, and
    other farm operations more effectively, reducing weather-related risks and optimising
    resource use. To monitor soil humidity, temperature/ moisture, and rain, we connect
    detectors to an Arduino and then program the board to collect real-time data.
    We also ensure data storehouse in MongoDB via Node-Red and group months of data
    to train it for predicting when to start or stop pumping. [12] Fig. 1. Machine
    learning based irregation system Show All Fig. 2. Proposed model for intelligent
    irrigation system Show All Fig. 3. Sensor data processing with controller Show
    All B. Data Collection and Storehouse After that, we connected a system to the
    storehouse and supervision systems using the knot-RED platform, making producing
    connected objects easier. Then, we started to collect and visualise data from
    detectors with the same pretensions in mind as ahead. During this phase, our card
    must be integrated with the knot-Red terrain, a system must be erected around
    the detector data inflow, and each data set must be preprocessed. Mobile and Web
    Applications: Mobile and web applications can provide farmers with access to real-time
    data, remote monitoring and control, weather forecasts, market prices, and other
    information critical for making informed decisions. These applications can be
    accessed on smartphones, tablets, or computers, enabling farmers to manage their
    farms from anywhere, anytime. With the assistance of experts in husbandry, the
    data reused through Several algorithms were used and suitable to assemble multiple
    feathers of information, such as Information gathered by the detectors information
    on the rush, air and soil temperature, and moisture. Information attained using
    water pumps Pumping(On/ Off) data process when assembling and storing data is
    depicted in Fig. 3 The Arduinoknot communicates with our Arduino card and the
    knot-red garcon, preparing a knot This knot is utilised to facilitate data that
    detectors emit by virtue of broken up. Birth from the preparation of certain data
    knot is completed utilising bumps to soil moisture, wetness in the atmosphere,
    weather, and rain. A sequence of notifications can be sent through email using
    the Notify and Mail nodes, enabling efficient sensor monitoring. MongoDB nodes
    permit direct recording of sensor-generated info on MongoDB storage. Allows the
    use of local data nodes to store local information. Nuclei on a dashboard enable
    real-time data display Two storage strategies that both make use of the MongoDB
    solution have been suggested for our system: Local MongoDB: Data training for
    the forecasting models can be connected via Node-Red flow to a local MongoDB server.[5]
    The storage component transmits cloud storage for data via a Dedicated to application,
    the Python method enables data reception, real-time pumping prediction, and time-based
    actual environment visualisation. C. Dataset Data Analytics and Decision Support:
    Advanced data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) can
    analyse large amounts of agricultural data, such as weather data, crop data, and
    market data, to provide farmers with valuable insights and decision support. This
    can help optimise farm operations, reduce risks, and improve profitability. We
    began using these devices in a variety of settings, with numerous home Vegetation
    used in the process of mass gathering in the inescapable lack of knowledge using
    Internet of Things (IoT) technologies[8], [9], which include a large number of
    autonomous sensors with self-organising capabilities, to distribute the data utilising
    a formula to build a crucial console for our system''s expansion, which was a
    virtually finished version of our dataset. At junction, we find the timestamping
    Inbound, digital, and data from centrally located sensors. Alongside this expansion,
    we discover: Information on soil moisture: The table below displays an analogue
    sensor''s data over the 0–1023 range. The average value is 371.5; the smallest
    value is 308.47 and the greatest value is 972.41. Data on temperature: Those facts,
    which are increasing in number crucial, were gathered using a temperature sensor
    that displays the current measurement in Celsius. As may be seen, the typical
    Throughout the months of collection, the average temperature was 23.34 C, with
    the minimum and highest values being 17 C and 40 C, respectively. Proof of what
    is expected. Data on air humidity: We were able to get information on air humidity
    using the same sensor that allowed us to collect temperature measurements, and
    the following analysis is done on these data: While gathering the enormous amount
    of data, the average is 67.40%, with the smallest value being 39% and the maximum
    value being 82.40%. We find the following output data in the race toward computerisation:
    We have suggested a peer-to-peer architecture that uses categorical data with
    a value of “0” to indicate that pumping must be halted. A value of “1” indicates
    that pumping must be activated. We have implemented aportion of the ultimate architecture
    to demonstrate that the feasibility is far from a generalised failure. SECTION
    IV. Results The graph illustrates a conceptual data manipulation that entails
    meticulous modelling of the findings attained to report on the dental plan and
    concretise it as a particular outcome. Because they are inductive in character,
    the predictions remain about this practice in many ways. Then, using empirical
    data, we found that peer-to-peer reviews regularly summarise the classification
    of two unique hues. On the other hand, peer-to-peer Green signifies class “1,”
    it relies on pumping heat vs impacted simultaneously by active, which is expressed
    in Table II. Massive data teach the model to exhibit the predefined plant sections.
    Table II. Sensor output vs processed output Table III. Machine learning model
    vs accuracy With rates of 98.6% in a training set and (RMSE) of 0.12, (95.0%/
    0,17), and (96.18%/ 0,19), respectively, the K-NN model beat Gaussian Naive Bayes,
    SVM, and logistic Regression with sequential result warehousing. The various experiments
    carried out to train the predictions are utilised in the next table''s framework
    (Table III). This is done to evaluate potential advantages and precisely pinpoint
    developing data. We choose to standardise the data first, then divide it into
    the training and test data to increase the applicability of our models. Compared
    to other models, Based on the findings, K-Nearest Neighbours had a recognition
    rate of 98.6%. To make it simpler to visualise and keep using a simple phone or
    laptop to keep track of the surroundings, all one of the roles carried out during
    this course was finally grouped into a web application. The database''s capacity
    is something we wish to boost by adding more data. Still, we also want to apply
    more algorithms-particularly semi-supervised learning-to make sure that our choices
    are accurate. SECTION V. Conclusions In summary, traditional agriculture has served
    as the global foundation for development by ensuring food security, generating
    income and employment opportunities, supporting local economies, preserving cultural
    heritage, and fostering social cohesion. While modern agricultural practices have
    also brought significant advancements, traditional agriculture is vital to many
    societies and plays a crucial role in sustainable development. Recognising and
    respecting the value of conventional agricultural practices while promoting innovation
    and sustainability in agriculture is essential. To increase productivity and satisfy
    the growing global food demand, intelligent irrigation is a crucial step, compared
    to other models, the findings revealed that using K -Nearest Neighbours had a
    98.6% acceptance rate. Finally, a website program was presented collectively,
    all of the functions performed during this course to simplify things to visualise
    and use a simple phone or laptop to monitor the surroundings. On the one hand,
    We need to expand the database''s capacity by adding more data, and on the Additionally,
    we aim to employ more algorithms, particularly semi-supervised learning, to guarantee.

  description: As the global population soars from today's 7.3 billion to an estimated
    10 billion by 2050, the demand for Food, Energy and Water (FEW) is expected to
    more than double. Such an increase in population and consequently, in the demand
    for FEW resources will undoubtedly be a great challenge for humankind. A challenge
    that will be exacerbated by the need for humankind to meet the greater demand
    for resources with a smaller ecological footprint. This paper is proposing a system
    developed to optimize the use of water, energy, fertilizers for agricultural crops
    as a solution to this great challenge. It is an automated smart irrigation system
    that uses real time data from wireless sensor networks to schedule an irrigation.
    The test-bed consists of a wireless network monitoring soil moisture, temperature,

    soars from today''s 7.3 billion to an estimated 10 billion by 2050, the demand
    for Food, Energy and Water (FEW) is expected to more than double. Such an increase
    in population and consequently, in the demand for FEW resources will undoubtedly
    be a great challenge for humankind. A challenge that will be exacerbated by the
    need for humankind to meet the greater demand for resources with a smaller ecological
    footprint. This paper is proposing a system developed to optimize the use of water,
    energy, fertilizers for agricultural crops as a solution to this great challenge.
    It is an automated smart irrigation system that uses real time data from wireless
    sensor networks to schedule an irrigation. The test-bed consists of a wireless
    network monitoring soil moisture, temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and
    fertilizer sensors embedded in the root area of the crops and around the test-bed.
    Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition is managed by an Access Point
    (AP) using ZigBee protocol. An algorithm was established based on threshold values
    of temperature and soil moisture automated into a programmable micro-controller
    to control irrigation time. The system''s energy demand is completely supplied
    by a solar Photo-voltaic (PV) panel supplemented with an energy storage unit.
    The experimental data obtained from this prototype will be modeled and optimized
    to investigate food production profile as a function of energy and water consumption.

    IEEE Conference Location: San Jose, CA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Currently,
    almost 70% of the global fresh water is being used for agriculture [1]. The demand
    for water is expected to increase to 55% by 2050 [2]. Similarly, 30% of total
    global energy consumption is spent on producing, transporting and distributing
    food as well as in the application of pumping, extracting, treating and transporting
    water [3], [4]. Global energy consumption is projected to increase to 80% by 2050
    [2], [4], [5]. As the demand for food soars to 60% by 2050, food security along
    with water and energy supply pose key issues in the availability, accessibility
    and utilization of these resources. Increased population growth, economic development
    and urbanization are the driving factors in the demand for food, energy and water
    resources more than ever [6]. The solution to solve the food requirement has to
    be more innovative. Fig. 1: Drivers of smart farming technology Show All Smart
    agriculture or precision farming is a recent concept that came out of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) applications [7]. The growing IoT landscape can almost be applied
    to different sectors and the agriculture field has been the recent one [8]. The
    combination of IoT along with predictive data analytics in agriculture can equip
    farmers with critical information on soil and environmental parameters to take
    actions. The driving factor behind smart agriculture has been the demand for more
    food production to increase yields, optimize interdependent resources of energy,
    water and land and impact of urbanization [3], [6]. With advances in technology,
    there is more push by global stakeholders like the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) for farmers to use innovative tools and digital technologies [1], [3], [5].
    The agricultural sector is faced with challenges connected to limited availability
    of arable land, water and energy, global climate change, and labor supply [6].
    The IoT framework can be used to understand the interdependency of energy, water
    and food resources through wireless sensor networks (WSN) for each sub-systems
    [9]. With realtime data, farmers can predict their yield, optimize water utilization
    through smart irrigation control and precisely know when to harvest thereby reducing
    energy and labor input. Although, smart agriculture is a recent phenomena with
    the saturation of digital technologies, there is a great body of work in IoT enabled
    farming [10]–[19]. Several works have been done in smart irrigation as part of
    smart farming model to optimize water utilization. The design and implantation
    of novel wireless mobile robot is demonstrated in [7] to monitor environmental
    parameters suitable for optimal crop yield. The use of distributed WSN of soil-moisture
    and temperature to automate irrigation system has been implemented in [10], [11].
    Remote sensing and the use of distributed WSN for a site-specific irrigation scheme
    is implemented in [12] based on soil property map. The key components in smart
    agriculture; data sensing, communications, storage and processing are integral
    in achieving robust predictive capabilities [16]. Once data has been collected,
    it has to be analyzed using different algorithms to get predictive capabilities.
    In [17] prediction models based on linear regression, neural networks and Support
    Vector Machines (SVM) are proposed from WSN data. Machine learning algorithms
    like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are often used in the data analytics to manage
    the bid data [18] side of smart farming [19]. The objective of this paper is to
    design and deploy a WSN for monitoring energy, water and crop development to further
    develop a nexus model based on real-time data. The scope of this paper is to describe
    the overall system description and deployment outlining the future proposed work.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents background work and major
    industry players in the IoT application of smart farming system. Section III describes
    the overall system design and implementation. Section IV presents the future work.
    SECTION II. Smart Farm Test Bed The smart farm test bed hereby reported consists
    of distributed WSN, off-grid PV panel, smart irrigation and data infrastructure.
    The purpose of the project is to develop an optimized smart solar-powered farm
    systems that maximize vegetation yield, minimize energy consumption, environmental
    effect through real-time monitoring from sensor data. The design requirements
    are to optimize input of fertilizers and pesticides, energy consumption using
    an off-grid PV and battery backup system and water consumption. The optimization
    function for this problem statement will be further investigated in the future
    work. The end goal is to build a circular system where energy, water, weather,
    and crop data will be collected to develop a nexus computational model. The conventional
    way of thinking about the challenges of FEW systems had focused on “peace-meal
    approach” where decisions are made in one of the nexus areas without making an
    allowance for the consequences on the other areas [6]. The nexus approach provide
    decision makers with better information through optimization of synergies and
    trade-offs. One of the objectives of the nexus is the development of modeling
    tools to support integrated decision making. Big, precise and reliable data from
    all the three systems is required to address the computational challenge for FEW
    nexus. This creates the primary reason for designing intelligent agriculture infrastructure.
    SECTION III. System Design and Implementation The design of the smart farm prototype
    included field preparation which incorporated crop-line accommodation and soil
    preparation, along with solar panel footing foundation and pole placement. The
    farm consists of three 4×25 ft raised beds as shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 2: Field preparation
    Show All A. Electrical System Units The system''s energy demand is completely
    supplied by a PV panel supplemented with an energy storage unit. A 320W at peak
    power with V mpp of 37.2V PV panel with 16.3% module efficiency is used. The tilt
    angle is fixed at 26° same as the latitude of the location. The default tilt angle
    for a PV panel is set to the latitude of the location which will maximize annual
    energy production [20]. The PV panel is connected to a 20A 12V DC Maximum Power
    Point Tracking (MPPT) solar charge controller to prevent overcharging of the batteries.
    The MPPT charge controllers vary from the traditional PWM charge controller by
    allowing the solar panels to function at their optimum power output voltage thereby
    increasing their performance. The charge controller is installed between the PV
    and the batteries to automatically maintain the charge on the batteries using
    the bulk, acceptance and float charge cycles. In addition, the load for the system
    which comes mainly from the water pump is controlled by the MPPT. Two 12V, 250
    Ah are connected in series to the MPPT. Power meters with RS485 serial communication
    capability from the generation and load side are connected. They have an RS485
    serial communication capability for energy data acquisition. Energy data is acquired
    from the power meter through RS485 serial communication to Arduino and then sent
    to gateway through Zigbee protocol. Fig. 3: Electrical system unit Show All B.
    Wireless Sensor Unit WSU are equipped with different types of sensors with the
    capability of measurement, acquisition and synchronization of data. The WSU used
    for this project is an Arduino based node with various radio options for connectivity.
    It has two main component boards consisting of the sensor board and main functionality
    module board. Environmental and agriculture parameters are measured by the sensor
    board. Ambient temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, pluviometer, anemometer,
    solar radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture and leaf wetness data are collected
    every hour interval. The WSU device has been programmed to sense and transmit
    these data to a gateway router using XBee-Pro S2 module. All functionality such
    as sensing, data collection, communication and power is programmed in open source
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE). As part of the power saving mechanism,
    the micro-controller has real time clock (RTC) module that can be programmed to
    only wake the device at the time of measurement. The device is programmed to operate
    in deep sleep mode and wakes up every hour to collect and transmit sensor data.
    The device is powered by 6600 mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery. The charge
    on the battery is maintained by a 7 V-500mA solar panel for full energy autonomy.

    for irrigation scheme. Drip-irrigation is a method to water crops by dripping
    near plant roots through a network of pipes. It is the best option for irrigating
    crops by reducing water usage, improving productivity and is relatively cheaper.
    In addition, it requires low operating pressure thus reducing overall energy consumption.
    The system is fully automated that uses real time data from the WSU to schedule
    irrigation events. The control system integrates a switch regulator, 24 V DC water
    pump, 24 V DC solenoid valves, relays and Arduino. Soil moisture and temperature
    sensors are connected to the Arduino and the relays activate the solenoid valves
    and the pump at threshold value. Fig. 6: Flow chart for control system algorithm

    IV. Data Infrastructure Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition is managed
    by IoT gateway router designed to connect to the WSN. The router can work as an
    RF-XBee interface, local and external database for WSU. For this project the WSU
    sends sensor data to gateway via ZigBee protocol. The gateway automatically stores
    the data on its local storage with an additional capability to synchronize to
    an external database or connect to a cloud platform. At the time of reception
    in the router, sensor data are timestamped, parsed and stored in local or synchronized
    to an external database. Energy data infrastructure is connected similar to the
    wireless sensor nodes. The protocol uses Max485 for serial communication between
    an Arduino Mega and the power meters. Arduino sends voltage, current and power
    data in frames to router with ZigBee protocol as shown in Fig. 7. SECTION V. Future
    Work The experimental data obtained from this prototype will be modeled and optimized
    to investigate food production profile as a function of energy and water consumption.
    It will also attempt to understand the effect of extreme weather conditions on
    food production. Instead of the peace-meal approach, a holistic approach will
    be developed and explore the nexus between water and energy resources, and crop
    yield for several essential crops in an attempt to design a more sustainable method
    to meet forecasted surge in demand. The conventional way of thinking about these
    intertwined problems focus on “peace-meal approach” where decisions are made in
    one of the nexus areas of water, energy and food without making an allowance for
    the consequences on the other areas. In the future work, data collection from
    this smart farm will be crucial in analyzing the gap between the water, energy
    and crop data will be used to model the interdependency of these systems. SECTION
    VI. Conclusion The abundance of vast amount of data and the ability of analyzing
    data to make decisions have quickly become part of any sector with the advent
    of IoT technologies. Agriculture is one of the sectors with smart farming that
    relies on machine to machine communication to get precise and reliable data. This
    paper presents the design and implementation of smart farm prototype to further
    investigate and model the energy, water and food nexus in the future. In this
    paper, the overall system design, implementation and functionality is explained.
    The test-bed consists of distributed WSN that monitors different agricultural
    and environmental parameters. Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition
    is managed by IoT gateway router through ZigBee protocol. An algorithm was established
    based on threshold values of temperature and soil moisture to automated into a
    programmable micro-controller to control irrigation time. Authors Figures References

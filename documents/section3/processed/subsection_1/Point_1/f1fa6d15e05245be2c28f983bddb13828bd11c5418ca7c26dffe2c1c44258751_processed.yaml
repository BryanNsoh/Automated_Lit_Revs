    \ Introduction \nSoil moisture monitoring is a well established method to govern\
    \ irrigation scheduling [1]. Application of water \nat a criterion wetter than\
    \ crop needs results in over-application of water and a potential loss of crop\
    \ yield and \nquality [2] [3]. Irrigation that precisely matches crop soil water\
    \ requirements can avoid unnecessary water losses \nand can optimize yield and\
    \ quality [4]-[7]. \nPrecise irrigation scheduling is necessary to optimize marketable\
    \ yield of high value crops while conserving \nwater and protecting surface water\
    \ and groundwater quality. Irrigation scheduling is greatly facilitated by any\
    \ \nsoil moisture sensor which can provide timely and reliable information on\
    \ soil water content or soil water poten-\ntial. For a particular sensor to be\
    \ useful for a particular crop and soil, it needs to respond rapidly and reliably\
    \ to \nthe range of variation of soil water status that is important for marketable\
    \ yield and product quality. Sensor \nreadings need to be meaningful to assist\
    \ irrigation scheduling, avoiding excessively frequent or intensive irriga-\n\
    tion. Several types of sensors were tested for their responsiveness and usefulness\
    \ for irrigation scheduling in \nsoils typical of the Treasure Valley of the Snake\
    \ River Plain of Oregon and Idaho. Neutron probes [8], frequen-\ncy domain sensors\
    \ [9] [10], tensiometers [11], and granular matrix sensors [12] have been widely\
    \ used for irri-\ngation scheduling. Tensiometers and granular matrix sensors\
    \ respond to soil water potential. The porcelain tip of \nthe tensiometer takes\
    \ up or releases water in the immediate vicinity of the tip in response to the\
    \ dynamics of the \nsoil water potential and the partial vacuum inside the tensiometer.\
    \ The granular matrix sensor takes up or releases \nwater to the soil in its immediate\
    \ vicinity and responds with variable electrical resistance between its internal\
    \ elec-\ntrodes. The neutron probe and frequency domain sensors respond to volumetric\
    \ soil water content but in very \ndifferent ways. The neutron probe emits high\
    \ speed neutrons into the soil and counts much lower speed neutrons \nthat return\
    \ following inelastic encounters with hydrogen atoms in the soil. The capacitance\
    \ probes measure ca-\npacitance in various high frequencies in the immediate vicinity\
    \ of the probe in the soil. In one experiment, sen-\nsors were tested that utilize\
    \ air permeability of porous ceramics. \nAir permeability of porous ceramics has\
    \ been used to estimate soil water potential [13]. Air permeability of a \nspecific\
    \ porous ceramic is a function of its water content. As water dries from the ceramic,\
    \ the pores allow the \npassage of air. The “initial bubbling pressure” (IBI)\
    \ of a water saturated porous ceramic is the lowest applied \npressure at which\
    \ air permeability (bubbling) is observed. The IBI of a specific porous ceramic\
    \ has been used to \nestimate whether a soil has reached a specific soil water\
    \ potential, possibly an irrigation criterion. The National \nCenter for Horticultural\
    \ Research of EMBRAPA, Brasilia, Brazil developed “Irrigas” based on IBI of porous\
    \ \nceramics. Irrigas consists of a porous ceramic cup, a moveable container of\
    \ water, a flexible tube, a transparent \nbarrel, and a rigid thin plastic support.\
    \ The porous ceramic cup is installed in the effective rooting zone of the \n\
    crop and connected to a small transparent barrel by means of the flexible tube.\
    \ The porous ceramic cup is de-\nsigned to retard free air movement out of the\
    \ cup until the soil and cup reach a predetermined water potential. To \nmake\
    \ a reading, the barrel is immersed in the container of water. The free air passage\
    \ through the porous ceram-\nic cup gets blocked whenever the soil water saturates\
    \ the pores in the ceramic. When the soil dries, its moisture \neventually drops\
    \ below a critical tension value, and the porous cup becomes permeable to the\
    \ passage of air. In \ndry soils when the barrel is immersed into the water, the\
    \ meniscus (air-water boundary) rapidly moves upwards \nin the barrel to equalize\
    \ it to the water level in the container. Whenever water enters the barrel, the\
    \ soil is at least \nas dry as the calibration of the porous ceramic cup. The\
    \ soil moisture is evaluated once a day to determine the \nmoment to irrigate.\
    \ In sandy soils the evaluation is made twice a day. \nVarious sensors were tested\
    \ in four field trials over several years. \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. Experiment\
    \ 1 \nSix soil moisture sensors were compared by their performance in response\
    \ to wetting and drying in irrigated \nC. C. Shock et al. \n \n \n156 \nhybrid\
    \ poplar (Populus deltoides x P. nigra) at the Malheur Experiment Station in Ontario,\
    \ Oregon, 43˚58'55\"N \n117˚01'27\"W, 683 m above mean seal level (amsl). The\
    \ trees were planted in April 1997 on Nyssa-Malheur silt \nloam soil (coarse-silty,\
    \ mixed, mesic Xerollic Durorthid) on a 4.27-m by 4.27-m spacing. The tree rows\
    \ were \noriented to the northwest. The trees were irrigated using a micro sprinkler\
    \ system (R-5, Nelson Irrigation, Walla \nWalla, WA) with the risers placed between\
    \ trees along the tree row at 4.27-m spacing. The sprinklers delivered \nwater\
    \ at the rate of 3.6 mm/hour at 176 kPa and a radius of 4.27 m. The area used\
    \ for the sensor performance \ntrial was managed to receive 50.8 mm of water whenever\
    \ the soil water potential at 0.20-m depth reached −50 \nkPa. \nTwo frequency\
    \ domain Aquaflex sensors (Streat Instruments, Christchurch, New Zealand) were\
    \ installed on \nSeptember 14, 2000. Each 3-m long sensor was installed at 0.20-m\
    \ depth along the tree row and between two \ntrees. The two Aquaflex sensors were\
    \ connected to an Aquaflex datalogger (Streat Instruments). On July 23, \n2001,\
    \ six types of soil moisture sensors were added to the study and were read daily\
    \ at 9 AM for 40 days. One \nsensor of each type was installed in four replicates:\
    \ two replicates each were installed adjacent to each of the ex-\nisting Aquaflex\
    \ sensors. The order of the sensors was randomized within each replicate to achieve\
    \ a randomized \ncomplete block statistical design. The sensors in each replicate\
    \ were installed at 0.20-m depth in a line parallel \nto and 0.20 m from the Aquaflex\
    \ sensors. The sensors in the four replicates were tensiometer (Irrometer SR,\
    \ Ir-\nrometer Co. Inc, Riverside, CA, USA), granular matrix sensor (GMS, Watermark\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor model \n200SS, Irrometer Co. Inc), neutron probe model\
    \ 503 DR Hydroprobe (Boart Longyear, Martinez, CA), time \ndomain reflectometry\
    \ Moisture Point (E.S.I. Environmental Sensors Inc., Victoria, British Columbia,\
    \ Canada), \nand two frequency domain devices, the Gro Point (E.S.I. Environmental\
    \ Sensors Inc) and the Gopher (Cooroy, \nQueensland, Australia). The neutron probe\
    \ and Moisture Point were capable of readings below the 20-cm depth, \nbut only\
    \ readings at 20 cm were used for comparisons. The four Gro Point sensors were\
    \ connected to two Gro \nPoint 3-channel dataloggers (E.S.I. Environmental Sensors\
    \ Inc). The GMS were connected to an AM400 Soil \nMoisture Datalogger (M.K. Hansen\
    \ Co., East Wenatchee, WA, USA). All other sensors were read manually at 9 \n\
    AM from Monday through Friday. \nThe tensiometer and GMS required that a hole\
    \ in the soil be made with a standard 22.2-mm (7/8-inch) diame-\nter soil auger\
    \ for installation. The tensiometers required regular resetting due to the column\
    \ of water breaking \nsuction around −60 to −70 kPa. The Gro Point sensor was\
    \ relatively compact and was easy to bury. Both the \nneutron probe and the Gopher\
    \ required the installation of PVC access tubes for each monitored location. The\
    \ \nMoisture Point used a 0.9 m long probe permanently installed at each location\
    \ to be monitored. The Moisture \nPoint probe required a hole driven with a rectangular\
    \ rod provided by Environmental Sensors Inc for installation. \nThe neutron probe,\
    \ Gopher, and Moisture Point allowed measurement of soil moisture at different\
    \ depths at each \nlocation. The Aquaflex required a horizontal 3-m trench dug\
    \ to the depth of installation, 0.20 m. \nBoth the neutron probe and Gopher required\
    \ site specific calibration. One undisturbed core soil sample was \ntaken in each\
    \ instrument location during sensor installation. The soil samples were immediately\
    \ placed in tin \ncans and weighed, then oven dried at 100˚C for 48 hours and\
    \ weighed again. Volumetric soil moisture content \nwas calculated for the soil\
    \ samples using the gravimetric method. After the sensors were installed, 50.8\
    \ mm of \nwater was applied. On July 25, another set of soil samples was taken\
    \ and volumetric soil moisture content was \ndetermined as before. The sensors\
    \ were read at the same time as the soil samples were taken. The neutron probe\
    \ \nwas read as counts during 32 seconds. For calibration, the volumetric soil\
    \ water content determined from the soil \nsamples was regressed against the neutron\
    \ probe and Gopher readings. The average soil moisture data from the \nneutron\
    \ probe and from the tensiometers was compared using regression against the average\
    \ soil moisture data \nfor each of the other sensors. The GMS sensors were used\
    \ to manage the irrigation. The entire area of the sensor \ncomparison trial was\
    \ irrigated when the GMS readings reached −50 kPa. \n2.2. Experiment 2 \nSix types\
    \ of soil moisture sensors were compared by their performance in response to wetting\
    \ and drying in \ndrip-irrigated potato (Solanum tuberosum) at the Malheur Experiment\
    \ Station at Ontario, Oregon, 43˚58'44\"N \n117˚01'03\"W, 676 m amsl. The sensors\
    \ were Aquaflex, Gro Point, Moisture Point, neutron probe, tensiometer, \nand\
    \ GMS as described above. The GMS were evaluated as read automatically by an AM400\
    \ datalogger and read \nmanually with a hand-held meter, model 30 KTCD-NL (Irrometer\
    \ Co. Inc.), as previously calibrated [15]. \nPotato seed of cultivar ‘Mazama’\
    \ was planted on April 26, 2002 in rows spaced 0.91 m apart. The potato seed \n\
    C. C. Shock et al. \n \n \n157 \npieces were spaced 0.23 m apart in the row. The\
    \ soil was an Owyhee silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Xe-\nrollic Camborthid)\
    \ with a pH of 8.1 and 2 percent organic matter. Drip tape (T-tape, T-systems\
    \ International, \nSan Diego, CA) was laid at 0.10-m depth between two potato\
    \ rows. The drip tape had emitters spaced 0.305 m \napart and nominal emitter\
    \ flow rate of 0.5 L/hr. The potato crop was irrigated daily to replace the previous\
    \ day’s \nevapotranspiration. Potato evapotranspiration (ETc) was calculated with\
    \ a modified Penman equation [14] using \ndata collected at the Malheur Experiment\
    \ Station by an AgriMet weather station (United States Bureau of Rec-\nlaimation,\
    \ Boise, Idaho). In mid-June the sensor study was installed along one of the potato\
    \ rows. Six types of \nsensors were installed between the drip tape and the potato\
    \ row. The sensors were installed 0.20 m from the drip \ntape and 0.25 m from\
    \ the potato row. The sensors were centered at 0.23-m depth. The experimental\
    \ design was a \nrandomized complete block design with four replicates. These\
    \ instruments were installed, managed, and cali-\nbrated as in experiment 1 above.\
    \ \nFrom July 15 to July 25 and again from July 30 to August 7, the potato row\
    \ containing the sensors was not ir-\nrigated so that sensor performance could\
    \ be evaluated under variable soil moisture, during both wetting and \ndrying\
    \ conditions. Sensor readings were evaluated for 30 days near 9 AM. \n2.3. Experiment\
    \ 3 \nFour types of soil moisture sensors were evaluated in furrow-irrigated onion\
    \ (Allium cepa) grown on Owyhee \nsilt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic, Xerollic\
    \ Camborthid) over various wetting and drying cycles at the Mal-\nheur Experiment\
    \ Station, 43˚58'48\"N 117˚01'01\"W, 675 m amsl. Onion seeds were direct-seeded\
    \ on 17 March \n2004 in double-rows on 0.56-in beds. The double onion rows were\
    \ spaced 76 mm apart. The types of soil mois-\nture sensors were tensiometers\
    \ with pressure transducers (Irrometer Model RA, Irrometer Company, Inc.), \n\
    ECH2O 10 dielectric aquameter (Decagon Devices, Pullman, Washington), GMS, and\
    \ Irrigas (National Center \nfor Horticultural Research of EMBRAPA, Brasilia,\
    \ Brazil. On 15 July 2004 the sensitive parts of the sensors \nwere installed\
    \ at 0.20-m depth below double rows of onions. The statistical design was a randomized\
    \ com-\nplete-block with 4 replicates and the replicates were placed 20 m apart\
    \ down a 1.25-ha furrow-irrigated field. \nTensiometers, GMS, and ECH2O 10 dielectric\
    \ aquameters were attached to three AM416 multiplexers \n(Campbell Scientific,\
    \ Logan UT, USA) that in turn were wired to a CR10X datalogger (Campbell Scientific).\
    \ \nThe CR10X datalogger was programmed to take hourly readings. Two temperature\
    \ sensors were installed at \n0.20 m depth and the datalogger was programed to\
    \ make temperature corrections of GMS readings [15]. Data \nwere collected from\
    \ the datalogger using a laptop computer from 15 July to 30 September 2004. Each\
    \ replicate \ncontained 2 tensiometers, 2 GMS, 1 ECH2O 10 dielectric aquameter,\
    \ and 2 Irrigas. The Irrigas operated on the \nprinciple of air permeability of\
    \ porous ceramics explained above. The Irrigas had a nominal calibration of −25\
    \ \nkPa and when we subjected Irrigas to progressive amounts of suction, the porous\
    \ ceramic freely bubbled air at \n−25 kPa in the laboratory out of the soil. Irrigas\
    \ readings were taken every day at 9 AM. \nThe ECH2O 10 dielectric aquameters\
    \ were calibrated against volumetric soil water content by taking two soil \n\
    samples near each probe centered at 0.20 m depth, once when the soil was relatively\
    \ wet, and once when the soil \nwas relatively dry, and also by preparing oven\
    \ dry soil and placing the probes in the oven dry soil at the end of \nthe trial.\
    \ Gravimetric data were converted to volumetric water contents using the soil\
    \ bulk density.  \nPrior to starting the sensor performance trial, the onions\
    \ were irrigated at −25 kPa based on average GMS \nreadings [3]. With the establishment\
    \ of this experiment in the onion field, the onions in the entire sensor calibra-\n\
    tion trial were irrigated when the average GMS reading reached −25 kPa on July\
    \ 17 and 22. Since the Irrigas had \nnot provided positive readings at −25 kPa,\
    \ the next five irrigations were delayed until at least half of the 8 Irrigas\
    \ \nsensors indicated the need for irrigation. \n2.4. Experiment 4 \nAutomated\
    \ reading of GMS was done in a furrow-irrigated Greenleaf silt loam (fine-silty,\
    \ mixed, mesic Xerollic \nHaplargid) planted to onions at the Malheur Experiment\
    \ Station, Ontario, Oregon, 43˚58'04\"N 117˚01'17\"W, \n675 m amsl. Onion seeds\
    \ were planted 14 March 2003 in double-rows on 0.56-in beds. The double onion\
    \ rows \nwere spaced 76 mm apart. The response of two independent sets of GMS\
    \ to irrigation events and the termination \nof irrigation was read automatically\
    \ using an AM400 datalogger and a Watermark Monitor (Irrometer Co. Inc.). \nData\
    \ from the last 41 days of the growing season were used for comparison purposes\
    \ due to the larger range of \nsoil water potential that occurred as the irrigation\
    \ season ended and the soil dried. \nC. C. Shock et al. \n \n \n158 \nThe sensors\
    \ were installed with their centers 0.20 m deep directly below the onion plants.\
    \ The sensors were \ninstalled in the lower part of the 0.6 ha field where the\
    \ furrow irrigations were less effective at wetting the soil. \nSix GMS and a\
    \ temperature probe were connected to an AM400 datalogger which read the sensors\
    \ three times a \nday. Data were recovered from the AM400 using a palm computer\
    \ as previously described [16]. Seven GMS \nand a temperature probe were connected\
    \ to a Watermark Monitor. A laptop computer and the WaterGraph pro-\ngram (Irrometer\
    \ Co., Inc.) were used to set the sensor data collection frequency at 15 minutes.\
    \ Data were recov-\nered from the Irrometer Watermark Monitor using a laptop and\
    \ the WaterGraph program. \n2.5. Interpretation of Data \nThe soil moisture data\
    \ from each type of sensor was graphed over time to determine if the data provided\
    \ mea-\nningful wetting and drying trends. In experiments 1, 2, and 3, soil moisture\
    \ monitoring devices were compared \nusing regression analyses over the range\
    \ of wetting and drying observed in the particular trial (NCSS 97, Statis-\ntical\
    \ System for Windows, [17]). \n3. Results \n3.1. Experiment 1 \nThe coefficient\
    \ of determination (r2) for the regression equation for the neutron probe at 0.20-m\
    \ depth was 0.93 \nat P = 0.01. The regression equation was used to transform\
    \ the neutron probe readings to volumetric water con-\ntent. A calibration for\
    \ the Gopher sensor was not possible due to a lack of correlation between the\
    \ Gopher read-\nings and the volumetric soil water content determined from the\
    \ soil samples. The tensiometer, Watermark, neu-\ntron probe, Gro Point, and Aquaflex\
    \ responded to the wetting and drying cycles of the soil (Figure 1). The  \n \n\

    \ The Moisture \nPoint sensor was not available during this time due to repairs\
    \ being made. Malheur \nExperiment Station, Oregon State University, Ontario,\
    \ OR, 2001. \nC. C. Shock et al. \n \n \n159 \nAquaflex sensors were less responsive\
    \ to the soil drying between irrigations than the neutron probe and the Gro \n\
    Point sensor was more responsive than the neutron probe. The lower responsiveness\
    \ of the neutron probe than \nthe Gro Point was not surprising since the response\
    \ volume of the neutron probe is larger and integrates less ra-\npidly changing\
    \ soil moisture deeper in the profile. The magnitude of the drying indicated by\
    \ the Gro Point was \nbeyond what occurred. All sensors showed correlations (r2\
    \ > 0.7) to the neutron probe (P = 0.001) and correla-\ntions (r2 > 0.5) to the\
    \ tensiometer (P = 0.001 to P = 0.01) except the Moisture Point sensor (Figure\
    \ 2 and Figure 3). \nFurthermore the Moisture Point estimates of soil water were\
    \ substantially lower than the neutron probe data \n(Figure 2 and Figure 3). \n\

    \ GMS, and neutron probe responded closely to the wetting and drying cycles of\
    \ the soil (Figure 4). \nThe Gro Point responded, but the amplitude of the response\
    \ showed less fluctuation than that of the neutron \nprobe. The Gro Point’s variations\
    \ could have been greater than the neutron probe, since the neutron probe meas-\n\
    ures soil water in a larger soil volume, including deeper soil that presumably\
    \ would dry less. The Moisture Point \nwas the least responsive to the wetting\
    \ and drying cycles of the soil compared to the other sensors. For undeter-\n\
    mined reasons, the Aquaflex datalogger only collected 3 days of data; this did\
    \ not allow for conclusive results. \nReadings of GMS by both the AM400 datalogger\

    \ the sensors used in this study had low unit cost and simple installation. There\
    \ were two episodes of irrigation \nbased on GMS readings at −25 kPa and five\
    \ irrigation events based on the Irrigas criterion (Figure 7). Both ten-\nsiometers\
    \ and GMS had similar responses to wetting and drying of the soil (Figure 7).\
    \ \nIt took about 4 h for all the tensiometers and all GMS to indicate that the\
    \ soil at 0.20 m had reached saturation \nafter the onset of each furrow irrigation\
    \ episode. The relative similarity in responsiveness between tensiometers \nwith\
    \ pressure transducers and granular matrix sensors (GMS) was confirmed by regression\
    \ with a coefficient of \ndetermination of 0.92 (P = 0.0001) (Figure 8). The Irrigas\
    \ had free air permeability close to −35 kPa for Owy-\nhee silt loam in this trial\
    \ (Figure 7). \nLarge changes in tensiometer readings from −10 to −40 kPa translated\
    \ into small changes in water content \nreadings for the ECH2O 10 dielectric aquameter\
    \ (Figure 9). A comparison of the ECH2O 10 dielectric aqua-\nmeter readings with\
    \ soil volumetric water content from this field indicated that the readings were\
    \ relatively flat \nand nonlinear in response to changes in volumetric soil water\
    \ content (Figure 10). The relatively small changes \nin volumetric soil water\
    \ content measured by the ECH2O 10 dielectric aquameter were unrealistic and the\
    \ small \nchanges in measurements occurred across the critical range of soil water\
    \ potential for onion irrigation decisions, \nlimiting the usefulness of the probe.\
    \ The reasons for the low responsiveness of the ECH2O 10 dielectric aqua-\nmeter\

    \ by an AM400 datalogger and a Watermark Monitor provided similar in-\nterpretation\
    \ of wetting and drying cycles (Figure 11(a)). The GMS started responding to irrigation\
    \ within one \nhour of the irrigation onset. Small differences in calibration\
    \ equations were noted (Figure 11(b)) and slight dif-\nferences in the interpretation\
    \ of soil water potential near saturation were evident (Figure 11(a)). \n4. Discussion\
    \ \n4.1. Neutron Thermalization \nThe neutron probe was used in two of the four\
    \ experiments. The neutron probe readings clearly indicated \nchanges in soil\
    \ water content. Due to the site specific calibrations, the changes in soil water\
    \ content readings \naccurately followed the soil water content, as has been described\
    \ by others [8]. Where the soil texture is variable, \nsuch as the silt loam soils\
    \ of Ontario, Oregon, the practical use of neutron probe soil water content data\
    \ requires \nfield by field calibration. Calibrated data can be accurately interpreted\
    \ to meet crop irrigation requirements and \navoid over irrigation. Neutron probe\
    \ use was awkward, time consuming, and required safety precautions. Read-\nings\
    \ can be downloaded automatically from the probe to a computer, but neutron probe\
    \ readings cannot be au-\ntomated in the sense of continuous readings. \nC. C.\

    \ by a Hansen AM400 datalogger and an Irro-\nmeter Watermark Monitor in Experiment\

    \ compared over time (a) and over the meas-\nured range of soil water potential\
    \ (b). Malheur Experiment Station, Ontario, OR, 2003. \n4.2. Frequency Domain\
    \ Sensors \nThe frequency domain sensors were more or less easy to automate. The\
    \ ECH2O 10 dielectric aquameter was \nrelatively easy to automate. The ECH2O 10\
    \ dielectric aquameter was used in only one experiment and the read-\nings were\
    \ relatively unresponsive to changes in soil water potential in the range of −10\
    \ to −40 kPa (Figure 9) \nand relatively unresponsive to changes to volumetric\
    \ soil water content in the range of 23% to 38% (Figure 10). \nLimited ECH2O 10\
    \ dielectric aquameter responsiveness suggests the need for site specific calibrations\
    \ prior to \nuse. The ECH2O 10 is a 10 cm long, single panel capacitance soil\
    \ moisture probe that uses low-frequency sig-\nnals. Decagon Devices discontinued\
    \ the ECH2O 10, replacing it with a high-frequency two pronged capacitance \n\
    soil moisture probe (10HS), with much less susceptibility to the effects of soil\
    \ salinity and soil texture. \nGro Point could be conveniently automated with\
    \ proprietary dataloggers. The Gro Point readings followed \nwetting and drying\
    \ cycles in the two experiments where they were used (Figure 1 and Figure 4) with\
    \ inconsis-\ntent results. The changes in soil water were overestimated in Experiment\
    \ 1 (Figure 2) and underestimated in \nExperiment 2 (Figure 6). These results\
    \ suggest that the Gro Point would benefit from site specific calibrations \n\
    prior to use. The need for site specific calibrations noted here for both the\
    \ Gro Point and ECH2O 10 dielectric \naquameter is consistent with the work of\
    \ Evett who tested a variety of capacitance probes in widely divergent \nsoils\
    \ and recommended site specific calibrations [9]. Gopher readings were not closely\
    \ associated with changes \nin soil water. With the Aquaflex, the interpretation\
    \ of soil wetting and drying trends were ambiguous in Experi-\nment 1. \n4.3.\
    \ Tensiometers \nVariations in soil water were clearly shown by tensiometers in\
    \ the three experiments where they were used and \nC. C. Shock et al. \n \n \n\
    166 \nthe interpretations of the results were clear. The tensiometers with pressure\
    \ transducers used in experiment 3 \nwere easily automated. Due to variation in\
    \ the tensiometer reading by time of day (Figure 7), visual readings at \na consistent\
    \ time of day as done here undoubtedly helped assure data quality in experiments\
    \ 1 and 2. The tensi-\nometers required servicing twice during the 76 days of\
    \ the trial 3. More frequent servicing to replace lost water \nshould be expected\
    \ when soils are not maintained as wet as in these experiments. \n4.4. Granular\
    \ Matrix Sensors \nGranular matrix sensors were used in all four experiments and\
    \ were very responsive to wetting and drying in the \nsoils used in these experiments\
    \ (Figure 1, Figure 4, Figure 7 and Figure 11). The GMS have limitations in \n\
    reading soil water potential in soils wetter than −10 kPa (Figure 5 and Figure\
    \ 8), as has been described pre-\nviously [15], and in responding in coarse textured\
    \ soils [12]. \nThe three methods for automated reading of GMS in several trials\
    \ were all convenient. The AM400 was \nhelpful for following and scheduling irrigation\
    \ events in the field due to its graphic display. The Watermark \nMonitor provided\
    \ convenient settings for datalogger reading frequency, easy retrieval, and automatic\
    \ interpreta-\ntion of the data. The Campbell Scientific dataloggers plus peripheral\
    \ equipment had great flexibility for reading \nGMS, as has been shown by complex\
    \ designs of GMS and their use in controlling irrigations [18]. \n4.5. Air Permeability\
    \ of Porous Ceramics \nThe model of “Irrigas” tested here in only one comparison\
    \ experiment, appeared to provide a clear signal for ir-\nrigation scheduling\
    \ at −35 kPa in silt loam, and failed to signal the nominal specification of −25\
    \ kPa. Since pre-\nvious research had shown furrow irrigations at a criterion\
    \ of −27 kPa optimized long-day onion yield and grade \non silt loam soil [3],\
    \ a nominal signal at 25 kPa could have provided a useful irrigation scheduling\
    \ tool. The Ir-\nrigas equipment configuration used had limited usefulness, since\
    \ water stress sensitive vegetable crops have \nmany different irrigation criteria,\
    \ and the ideal criteria are complex since they also vary by climate, soil type,\
    \ \nand irrigation system [7]. \nSoil particles in contact with a porous ceramic\
    \ can interfere with air permeability [13]. From results of this \ntrial, it is\
    \ possible that the silt loam interfered with the air permeability. One might\
    \ predict greater interference \nby fine textured soils and less interference\
    \ with coarse textured soils. One might predict greater interference at \nrelatively\
    \ high (wetter) soil water potential and less interference at relatively low (drier)\
    \ soil water potential. In \nthe present experiment the soil texture was fine\
    \ and the soil water potentials were wet. \n5. Conclusion \nThe soil moisture\
    \ measurement devices tested here generally provided data closely correlated with\
    \ each other. \nNeither the neutron probe nor the Irrigas were convenient to automate.\
    \ The frequency domain sensors were \nmore or less easy to automate but were not\
    \ adequately reliable without engineering improvements or soil specif-\nic calibrations.\
    \ Both tensiometers and granular matrix sensors were relatively easy to calibrate\
    \ and the readings \nwere readily useful for irrigation scheduling. \nAcknowledgements\

  analysis: 'The presented paper by Jiménez-Bello et al. (2021) addresses the challenge
    of flushing pressurized irrigation networks for fertigation and maintenance purposes
    and proposes a novel methodology to optimize the process. Central to the analysis
    is the development of a general and novel methodology that leverages the network''s
    hydraulic model and parallel multi-objective genetic algorithms to ensure the
    efficient and timely flushing of a substance or its distribution to all consumption
    points in the network. This methodology aims to minimize the time required for
    flushing while simultaneously minimizing the volume of water used, ensuring that
    the minimum volume required to replace the network pipes is not exceeded.


    The paper''s key contributions include:


    - **Relevance to the point:** The paper specifically addresses the issue of determining
    the most suitable types of data for irrigation management and their typical sources,
    focusing on data collection from the network head to the consumption points (data
    collection to cloud: automation and real-time processing). Within this context,
    the methodology developed in the paper optimizes the flushing of substances or
    their distribution to all consumption points in the network, considering various
    data sources and types, such as flow rates, pressure measurements, and water quality
    parameters.


    - **Insight:** The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the problem of flushing
    pressurized irrigation networks and proposes a novel methodology that combines
    hydraulic modeling with parallel multi-objective genetic algorithms. The methodology
    optimizes the flushing process by considering multiple objectives, including minimizing
    flushing time, minimizing injected volume, and ensuring minimum operating pressures
    at demand nodes. This approach provides valuable insights into the complex interactions
    between different factors affecting the flushing process.


    - **Credibility:** The paper is authored by researchers from the IIAMA (Instituto
    de Ingeniería del Agua y Medio Ambiente) at the Universitat Politècnica de València,
    Spain, a reputable institution in the field of irrigation management. The methodology
    presented in the paper has been validated through a case study, demonstrating
    its effectiveness in reducing flushing time and injected volume. The paper has
    also been published in Irrigation Science, a peer-reviewed journal specializing
    in irrigation research.


    - **Scope:** The paper covers a broad range of topics related to data collection,
    hydraulic modeling, and optimization of flushing processes in pressurized irrigation
    networks. It provides a comprehensive overview of the problem, discusses existing
    challenges, and proposes a novel methodology to address these challenges. The
    paper also includes a detailed case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of
    the proposed methodology.


    - **Recency:** The paper was published in 2021, indicating that it is current
    and up-to-date with the latest research in the field of irrigation management.


    **Specific quotations from the paper:**


    - *"For that purpose, a general novel methodology has been developed that makes
    use of the network’s hydraulic model and parallel multi-objective genetic algorithms
    to flush the network of a certain substance or to get it to all consumption points
    in the shortest possible time and supplying a minimum volume."*


    - *"The arrival times to the consumption points are minimized and the injected
    volume is reduced to the minimum of replacement, that is, the volume of the network
    pipes."*


    - *"The methodology applied to the study case allowed the entire network to be
    flushed in a minimum time of 2.46 h."*


    **Overall relevance score:** 0.9


    The paper is highly relevant to the outline point and review, providing novel
    and insightful contributions to the field of automated systems for real-time irrigation
    management. Its comprehensive analysis, credible methodology, and empirical validation
    make it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on the optimization
    of irrigation networks.


    **Limitations:**


    The paper assumes that the pressure at the source is always over a minimum value,
    which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the methodology
    has only been validated in a single case study, and its performance may vary depending
    on the specific characteristics of the irrigation network being considered.'

    Explore all metrics Abstract Pressurised irrigation networks with a certain degree
    of automation allow centralized fertigation and maintenance operations such as
    cleaning subunits and preventing the proliferation of invasive species such as
    zebra mussels. Until now, there is no methodology that guarantees the total cleaning
    of the network of a substance in the shortest possible time. In the same way,
    it does not exist to guarantee reaching all consumption points with a certain
    concentration of a substance, injecting the minimum possible amount. For that
    purpose, a general novel methodology has been developed that makes use of the
    network’s hydraulic model and parallel multi-objective genetic algorithms to flush
    the network of a certain substance or to get it to all consumption points in the
    shortest possible time and supplying a minimum volume. This method assumes that
    the available pressure at the source is always over a minimum value. The arrival
    times to the consumption points are minimized and the injected volume is reduced
    to the minimum of replacement, that is, the volume of the network pipes. The methodology
    applied to the study case allowed the entire network to be flushed in a minimum
    time of 2.46 h. On a normal irrigation day, without making any changes to the
    irrigation schedule the time to completely flush the network is 11.76 h. Furthermore,
    the injected volume differs greatly from the total volume of the pipes. Similar

    Chemigation refers to the application of chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides,
    pesticides, fumigants, nematicides, soil amendments, and other compounds through
    irrigation water (Burt 1998). Particularly, of the various types of chemigation,
    the most widely used is fertigation (Fares et al. 2009). This is widely used in
    micro-irrigation techniques such as drip and sprinkler where fertilizer doses
    can be supplied accurately. Proper management of fertigation can improve nutrient
    uptake efficiency and minimize leaching below the root zone. Thus, it can contribute
    to an increase in crop yield as well as crop quality as compared to those with
    conventional dry fertilizer application (Alva et al. 2008). Fertilizer distribution
    has been studied at subunit level due to uniformity which can be affected by injectors,
    (Bracy et al. 2003; Li et al. 2007; Fan et al. 2017), the emitter type (Li et
    al. 2007), and the lateral layout (Fan et al. 2017). Moreover, some decision support
    systems (DSS) have been developed to design and optimize irrigation management
    and fertigation systems to improve nutrient uptakes, minimizing percolation and
    improving fertigation uniformity but all of them focused at irrigation subunit
    level not in collective pressurised irrigation networks (Moreira Barradas et al.
    2012; Azad et al. 2018; González Perea et al. 2020). Collective fertigation in
    pressurised irrigation networks was assessed by Jimenez-Bello et al. (2011a).
    Particularly, how fertilizer is distributed along with the network and how irrigation
    scheduling influences in effective fertilization time (EFT) was analysed. A methodology
    was proposed to homogenize the EFT in case of the existence of irrigations without
    fertilization and the presence of users who do not want to receive fertilizers.
    Similarly, in the case that the supply is energy-dependent, the organization of
    the most efficient irrigation scheduling from the energy point of view does not
    have to coincide with the distribution that guarantees a better EFT for each user.
    For this reason, a methodology was proposed that combines those groups of optimal
    intakes from the energy point of view with those that allow increasing EFT. The
    conclusions obtained were that the existence of intakes that do not wish to carry
    out fertilization decrease the uniformity of EFT and, therefore, do not assure
    any fertilizers reaching them. Collective fertigation is widely used in Water
    Users Associations in the Mediterranean Region where the average plot size is
    small (0.4–1 ha) and monocrop is dominant (Ortega-Reig et al. 2017). However,
    the introduction of new crops in the irrigation districts poses new challenges
    when it comes to efficient management, since not all of the crops have the same
    fertilizer needs, nor do they apply the same treatments. Another important challenge
    to address is the possible presence of organic crops in the network. This involves
    flushing the network as quickly as possible of the remaining substances to adapt
    irrigation water chemical composition to the needs of the crops that are irrigated
    at a certain moment. Similarly, carrying out maintenance operations, such as cleaning
    subunits to avoid emitter clogging (Keller and Bliesner 1990), involves injecting
    nitric, phosphoric, sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, whose pH must be 2–3 to achieve
    a good result. A reference is to inject 6 l m−3 of acid, so it is interesting
    to minimize the used amount to lower the cleaning cost (CAJAMAR 2014). Another
    frequent operation in irrigation networks is the use of disinfectants for the
    removal of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). This aquatic invasive alien species
    has caused severe worldwide economic damage by blocking pipelines and other infrastructure,
    impacts on water quality, and eradication costs (Aldridge et al. 2004; Gallardo
    and Aldridge 2020). In the Ebro Valley Basin (Spain), Zebra Mussel has caused
    damages worth 1600 M€ in 10 years (Morales-Hernández et al. 2018). Physical and
    chemical control methods are used to combat the zebra mussel (Ebro Hydrographic
    Confederation 2014). Chemical methods can be used preventively when the larvae
    enter the facilities, or reactive, in which case the chosen strategy will depend
    on the degree of colonization to determine the dosage of the product and the exposure
    time. Used substances are oxidants such as chlorides and ozone that react with
    the medium, the latter at a higher speed; and non-oxidants such as aluminum sulfate,
    ammonium nitrate, sodium metasulfite, copper sulfate and Potassium. These substances
    can be assumed not to react with the medium. Morales-Hernández et al. (2018) developed
    a model to assess the presence of zebra mussels comparing the measured pressures
    with modelled pressures at the hydrant. Nevertheless, so far no methodology has
    been created to assess how to perform the above-mentioned tasks of flushing the
    network to apply different fertigation treatments, irrigation subunits cleaning,
    or combating invasive alien species. In this work, a novel methodology is presented
    that allows to minimize the network flushing time, or what is the same, to make
    a substance arrive as quickly as possible at all consumption points to allow the
    application of different chemigation treatments, at the same time that the minimum
    operating pressures are guaranteed at demand nodes. In the case a substance is
    requested for treatment, its amount can be minimized because of the pipe-volume
    replaced is the minimum required and no water is wasted. The methodology takes
    into account that the pressure at the head of the network is constant or does
    not decrease under a certain value. Methodology Case study The case study chosen
    is Sector XI of the Acequia Real del Júcar (ARJ), a historic irrigation district
    where a modernization process is being taken (Ortega-Reig et al. 2017). Sector
    XI is located in the municipality of Algemesí (Valencia, Spain). It is a collective
    network of 88 multi-user hydrants, with 565 intakes with automated opening valves,
    14.9 km of pipes, which total volume is 607 m3, and 434 ha of irrigated farms
    where 60% are persimmons, 27% citrus and the remaining area is cropped with other
    types of fruit trees. Each fruit tree farm has assigned an average amount of 4050
    m3 ha−1. The irrigation head is at a height of 28.14 m and the levels of the hydrants
    vary between 21.12 and 32.6 m. Figure 1 shows the layout of the hydraulic network.
    Fig. 1 Layout of the irrigation network of Sector XI of the Acequia Real del Júcar
    Full size image The supply is made through a general high-pressure network that
    delivers water to another 90 irrigation heads that compose ARJ. Of these, currently,
    only 36 have completed the modernization process under pressure irrigation, which
    represents 22% of the 15,000 ha of which the ARJ is composed of. The rest continue
    operating using surface irrigation (Ortega-Reig et al. 2017). The regulation of
    the general network guarantees that the head pressure does not exceed 43 m, while
    the minimum pressure is not guaranteed. In the period of greatest water requirements,
    the intakes operate three times a day, in periods of 1 h. Farmers make the water
    request for each season and the technicians arrange the opening sequence of the
    intakes that is empirically distributed throughout the day to reduce head losses
    in the distribution network and provide the service with the minimum pressures
    required in each hydrant, 20 m. So far, the injected fertilizer is the same for
    all the orchards. The concentration is 0.1% in volume from March to June and 0.04%
    in volume from July to October. Proportional flow pumps perform the fertilizer
    injection. As reference, 133 kg ha−1 of N are applied per ha. The technicians
    want the possibility of establishing different fertilization programs flushing
    previously the network, having the possibility to alternate zebra mussel proliferation
    prevention treatments and carry out maintenance operations to avoid clogging emitters.
    Model calibration Once the hydraulic network model was built for simulation in
    EPANET (Rossman 2000) it was calibrated. This software performs extended period
    simulations of hydraulic behavior and water quality in pressurized networks and
    today is the main reference in this field (Iglesias-Rey et al. 2017). To do this,
    five pressure sensors were installed (SSC2035 Sensortechnics, Puchheim, Germany)
    with a data collection frequency of 2 min. In the irrigation head, there was a
    sensor that measured pressure with a 1-min frequency. The location of the sensors
    is shown in Fig. 1. Comparing the real pressure measurements with the simulated
    ones, after slightly correcting the sensor elevations, the mean square error was
    0.711 m and 0.709 m for the two dates when the calibration was carried out (11/08/2019
    and 08/12/2019). It was not necessary to modify any initial parameters such as
    roughness or pipe diameters. Figure 2 shows the mean, maximum, minimum pressures
    and the 12-day standard deviation during the irrigation campaign (1/8/2019–12/8/2019)
    recorded at the head. The pressure variations in the main network are due to the
    opening of intakes in the different irrigation networks of which the ARJ is composed
    and the discharge into the canals at the atmospheric pressure of the infrastructures
    that continue to operate by gravity. Fig. 2 Average pressures (Avg_Pr), standard
    deviation and maximum (Max_Pr) and minimum (Min_Pr) pressures for the period from
    1/8/2019 to 8/12/2019 Full size image The EPANET quality model was not tested
    experimentally in this work. Good performance was assumed from the results obtained
    in previous work (Jimenez-Bello et al. 2011b) where the measured arrival times
    of phosphoric acid injected at the head to the consumption nodes had an error
    lower than 1 min, less than hydraulic time step set to 60 s. Mass imbalances have
    been detected in EPANET water-quality simulations due to discretization problems
    when the distance travelled by the water in a quality time step is greater than
    the total length of the pipe (Davis et al. 2018). These authors recommend to diminish
    the water-quality time step to reduce the inaccuracies from the current default
    value of 300 s. In this work, a water-quality time step of 12 s was set. Methodology
    assuming that pressure at the irrigation head is constant Assuming that head pressure
    is constant, or that it will not decrease below a reference value, a methodology
    has been proposed that uses the hydraulic model with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
    Algorithm II (NSGA-II), a parallel multi-objective genetic algorithm (Deb et al.
    2002) that has demonstrated faster convergence in comparison to similar algorithms.
    Genetic algorithms have been widely used for irrigation network design (Reca and
    Martínez 2006; Fernández García et al. 2017) and energy optimization (Fernández
    García et al., 2013; Jiménez-Bello et al., 2015; Jiménez-Bello et al. 2010, 2011b).
    Particularly Alonso Campos et al. (2020) used NSGA-II for minimizing the cost
    of energy while minimizing pressure deficit at the critical hydrants obtaining
    greater computational efficiency by posing the problem from a multi-objective
    approach and by establishing the parallel evaluation of the objective function.
    To perform a renewal of the network water, the hydrant valves must be gradually
    opened to allow the water to advance towards them. It is admitted that the network
    is branched, and all branches and final branches end in a hydrant, otherwise,
    the water in that branch could not be renewed. When the new water reaches a certain
    hydrant, we will assume that it closes immediately to avoid waste of water with
    a certain substance, since the objective is to retain the water with that substance
    for a time so that it exerts its action. On the other hand, if we were to open
    all the hydrants at the same time, we would collapse the network, which is not
    prepared to assume that flow, and the pressures would be below the minimum value
    required by the hydrants for the flow rates discharged, which are supposed to
    be fixed and known. Therefore, the hydrants must be opened gradually, and closed
    as before, when the substances reach them. The problem that arises is at what
    time each hydrant has to open and at what time has to close, to carry out the
    renewal of all the water in the network in a minimum time, with the restriction
    of complying with certain pressures minimum, and limit the maximum flow velocity
    through any pipe. If everything is carried out correctly, and the hydrants close
    when the new water arrives, it is obvious that the entire volume of the network
    will have been renewed, so that the volume of water injected at the head will
    be equal to the volume of the pipes. The hypothesis on which it is based the methodology
    is that the more intakes which operate, the higher the velocity in pipes, and
    the sooner the consumption nodes will be reached. The minimum required injected
    volume (VTot) to completely flush the network is the total pipe volume. It is
    assumed that all or part of the intakes from the same hydrant work at the same
    time and minimum pressure operation at the head is guaranteed. The methodology
    consists of n steps until the substance achieves all the consumption nodes. Basically,
    a front of the water with substance is advancing through the network from head
    step by step. Each time the front reaches an open hydrant, the current step is
    ended, and the next step starts. Each step involves the following phases: 1. Maximizing
    the flow at the irrigation head, while minimizing the average pressure deficit
    at hydrant (APD) for an optimization process step: $${\text{Max}}\left( {Q_{t}
    } \right) = \mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{{N_{{{\text{H}},n}} }} q_{i,n}$$ (1)
    $${\text{Min}}\left( {{\text{APD}}} \right) = \frac{1}{{N_{{{\text{H}},n}} }}\mathop
    \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{{i = N_{{{\text{H}},n}} }} {\text{Max}}\left\{ {(p_{{\min
    \_{\text{req}},n}} - p_{{\min \_{\text{calc}},n}} )} \right\},$$ (2) where Qt
    is the flow sum, NH,n are the total number of hydrants that operates at process
    step n, qi,n is hydrant flow determined by the intakes number that operate at
    n, pmin_req,n is the minimum required pressure at hydrant and pmin_calc,n is the
    minimum computed pressured, but only regarding if hydrant flow is higher than
    0. At first step n = 0 and all hydrants are able to be selected, but at step n
    only a reduced set of hydrants can be operated, those that remains to be opened.
    For this purpose, a genetic algorithm is built in which the number of variables
    is equal to the number of hydrants in the network. These are coded as integer
    variables and the value ranges are 0 or 1. $$H_{i,n} = \left\{ {0,1} \right\},$$
    (3) where Hi,n are the values of the variable i for n. The value 0 means that
    the hydrant intakes are opened and value 1 that they are closed. An INP file,
    the native standard format for EPANET (Rossman 2000), is used as a template. The
    performed hydraulic simulation is static and pipe flows and node pressures are
    determined for each scenario. The justification for maintaining the minimum required
    pressures in the flushing operation is to guarantee the perfect operation of the
    irrigation subunits and to keep their flows constant and predictable. The parameters
    regarding the GA, initial population, termination condition, selection type, crossover
    type and mutation probability are set. 2. Once the solution is selected, for which
    Qt maximizes and APD minimizes, the arrival time (THn) of the injected substance
    at the first hydrant or hydrants where intakes operate is determined. For this
    purpose, an INP template is used where a quality dynamic analysis is performed
    starting from the beginning. When the substance reaches the first hydrants the
    simulation stops. Sometimes more than one hydrant can be reached simultaneously.
    Then those hydrants where Hi,n = 0 changes to Hi,n+1 = 1, that is to say, that
    when the substance reaches the first operating hydrants, they are shut and THn
    becomes the arrival time to them. n + 1 is the next quality simulation where THn+1
    will be calculated. For n + 1, time patterns for these hydrants will be built
    where operating time will be set from the step time n when they were opened to
    THn+1. Those operating hydrants where substance have not reached yet, continue
    working (Hi,n+1 = 0). 3. To determine the new operating hydrants, the GA is used
    again to maximize Qt and minimize APD. GA is restarted incorporating the solution
    from the previous stage into the initial population, to speed up the process for
    the best solution. In short, those hydrants to which the substance reached, the
    variable value is 1, those that were operating and substance did not reach them,
    the value remains 0 and those that were not operating can take the value 0 or
    1 according to the GA procedure. The process is repeated until the substance reaches
    all hydrants. At the end of the process, the GA and the quality simulation model
    will be run as many times as the substance reaches operating hydrants. The theoretical
    maximum number of steps (n) will be the NH, although some of them can be reached
    at the same time. Figure 3 summarizes the process method to reach at all operating
    nodes guaranteeing the minimum injected volume, the total pipe volume. Fig. 3
    Flow process to determine the hydrant operating scheduling to minimize the arrival
    times of a substance Full size image Studied scenarios First, the operation of
    the irrigation network has been evaluated in one of the representative days in
    the periods of highest demand, such as the first week of August. For this and
    for the rest of the studied scenarios, the total volume (VT), the APD, the average
    arrival time of substance per hydrant (TH M), the minimum arrival time (TH Min),
    the maximum arrival time (TH Max) and the minimum operation time an intake remains
    open (TIrrig Min) were assessed. The minimum required pressure set at hydrant
    (PMin), was 20 m. The purpose of the scenarios was to study the flushing time
    and the flow velocity in the pipes to avoid unwanted transient phenomena. In these
    scenarios, the fixed pressure established in the network head has been the daily
    hourly average, 31 m. Injection of substances into the network was simulated using
    the option Source Quality of the node that represents the irrigation head. Since
    the injection device is a pump that keeps a constant concentration of fertilizer,
    the option Flow Paced Booster was used as it is recommended to model direct injection
    of a substance into the network (Rossman 2000). A pattern curve simulating the
    beginning and ending of substance injection formed and assigned to the irrigation
    head. Prior to simulation, quality (QTS) and hydraulic time step (HTS) were set
    up (Rossman 2000). The accuracy of the results depends on these parameters. The
    former has to be much smaller than the latter, at least a fifth (Davis et al.
    2018). For most of the scenarios, QTS has been set to 12 s and HTS to 60 s. Then,
    to assess the sensitivity of these parameters scenarios with other QTS and HTS
    have been run. Scenarios were defined according to the intake number of each hydrant
    that works at the same time, adjusting the flow rate as close as possible to 75,
    50, 25, and 15% of the total flow rate of each hydrant (q%). For all scenarios,
    the initial population is 100 chromosomes. The population size has to be kept
    as low as possible, provided that it allows to effectively explore the search
    space. It could be considered a rule of thumb to choose a number of chromosomes
    of the same magnitude order as the number of variables. In both methodologies,
    the intakes of the same hydrant have been assumed to operate at the same time.
    The probability of mutation has been established at 10%, the selected crossing
    method has been the “SinglePointCrossover” and the selection method has been “BinaryTourment2”
    (Durillo and Nebro 2011). Results and discussion Analysis of the network operation
    on an irrigation day The evolution of the injected flow and the pressure at the
    head for an irrigation day is showed in Fig. 4. The average operating time of
    each intake is 3.1 h. The total volume provided is 7803 m3, and the observed times
    are TH M = 3.15 h, TH MIN = 0.33 h and TH MAX = 11.76 h. Two of the hydrants in
    an extreme branch do not receive any amount of substance within 24 h. A total
    of 317 intakes operate below PMin. APD is 2.45 m. This is due to the difficulty
    of arranging irrigation scheduling to minimize head losses without a network model,
    especially when the pressure at the head is variable. This could be solved by
    applying methodologies such as those developed in Jiménez-Bello et al. (2010)
    and Alonso Campos et al. (2020) where scheduling is arranged in such a way that
    the total energy consumption is minimized by means of heuristic methods and the
    mathematic network model, while a minimum required pressure is guaranteed at each
    node. Fig. 4 Head flow (Q, l s−1) and pressure (Pr, m) for an irrigation day of
    maximum water requirements Full size image Scenario analysis The scenario results
    are shown in Table 1. For all scenarios, the substance reaches all network hydrants.
    The injected volume for all scenarios coincides with the total volume of the network
    pipes, 607 m3. Comparing this volume to the injected on a normal day, 7803 m3,
    a reduction of 92.2% is achieved, in the event that the technicians would inject
    a substance or wanted to flush the network without modifying the irrigation scheduling.
    Table 1 Optimal scenarios based on the number of evaluations (NEV) and the percentage
    of the operating intakes Full size table Nevertheless, in case HTS is set to 300
    s, the injected volume is 693 m3. This is because HTS is not small enough to close
    intakes, at the real time the substance reaches them. When Q% = 100, as NEv increases,
    APD decreases, while TH M and TH Max remain almost unchanged. In addition, the
    time it takes to flush the network is reduced by 0.02 h, comparing SC2 to 7 (from
    2.48 h 2.46 h). This is due to the nature of the genetic algorithm, which by performing
    more evaluations finds a greater number of hydrant intakes that can operate simultaneously.
    The higher the evaluated solutions, the better the results, but in this case,
    it only affects a small amount of APD. This is mainly due to a 320 m branch where
    head losses of 40 m km−1 occur when hydrants operate at Q% = 100. For scenario
    5, the network flushing time is completed in 2.46 h, although TH M is 0.27 h.
    Compared to scenario 1, the length process is reduced by 79%. The presence of
    ending branches with low flows produces an increase in the flushing length process.
    Figure 5 shows the evolution of the network head flows for SC5, and SC8-11. As
    observed, the methodology concentrates the operation of the hydrant intakes at
    the beginning and then decreases as the substance reaches the hydrants and the
    intakes shut. Fig. 5 Evolution of the injected flow at the irrigation head for
    the scenarios 5 and 8–11 Full size image This produces high velocities at the
    network main of 5.6 m s−1, where the initial flow is 643.84 l s−1 (see Fig. 5)
    and the pipe diameter is 380.4 mm, which can cause excessive pressure variations
    when changing the network operation regime, especially at the beginning of the
    flushing maneuver. Furthermore, it involves opening a large number of intakes
    in a very small time, 1 min, an unadvisable maneuver in opening valves due to
    the short duration. For example, the technicians of the case study recommend a
    minimum operation of 5 min for avoiding unexpected transient phenomena. Figure
    6 shows the evolution of the water injected with a certain substance from the
    source, in this case for scenario 5. The red pipes indicate that the water with
    substance (or with clean water) has not yet been reached. Once the water reaches
    the pipes, they turn blue. The dots represent the hydrants. The red color indicates
    that the hydrant operates below the established minimum pressure. The black color
    indicates that the hydrant operates above the minimum operating pressure. It is
    observed that when the substances reaches most of the hydrants pressure is higher
    than required due to APD is very low, 0.89 m. Fig. 6 Evolution of the injected
    substance front from the network head to the consumption points. The red color
    of the pipes indicates that the substance has not yet arrived and the red color
    that it has. Hydrants in red indicate that the pressure is less than required
    and in blue greater than required (Color figure online) Full size image The substance
    front advances rapidly, mainly through the higher flow pipes. The extreme branches
    and with low flows are those that slow down the process of flushing the network,
    conditioned by the distance from the injection source. In SC 8-11, in which the
    number of intakes operating at the same time in each hydrant has been reduced
    to avoid high velocities in main pipes, the arrival times increase is observed.
    These scenarios are more convenient to reach all the hydrants with lower pipe
    velocities, but taking longer. For SC 11 the maximum flow velocity reached is
    0.96 m s−1. In the case of applying treatments with a reactive substance with
    an average reaction time superior to the arrival time, to guarantee the initial
    concentration at the head reaches the consumption points, these solutions would
    be more convenient to reduce the transient effects than with Q (%) = 100. In addition,
    TIrrig Min increases up to 5 min. Nevertheless, the model can be applied to reactive
    substances. To know the final substance concentration achieving a node, the reactions
    model quality options should be implemented (Rossman 2000). The method can be
    applied to any kind pressurised branched irrigation network keeping a minimum
    pressure at the head. In the study case, the network is fed from a general main
    pipe with a pressure variable supply in time. If the supply were carried out with
    pumps, these could maintain a certain set pressure in the case of having frequency
    speed drivers, but this would not be compatible with minimum energy consumption.
    An economic study of the convenience of this methodology would be necessary, depending
    on the times in which these network cleaning operations are carried out, the cost
    of the products, and the energy cost. Nevertheless, further research will be developed
    to apply similar methodologies to meet the energy consumption and the minimum
    flushing times. Conclusions In automated pressure irrigation networks, certain
    operations require flushing or injecting a substance through the network, either
    for fertilizing, cleaning or disinfecting. In any case, it is important that this
    is carried out in the shortest time possible and using the least amount of injected
    volume. So far, there is no methodology that guarantees the minimum flushing time
    of a network, maintaining the operating pressure at the demand nodes. For this
    purpose, a methodology was developed that uses the mathematical models of the
    network together with parallel multi-objective genetic algorithms. The methodology
    can be used in any system independently of its operation, provided that a minimum
    pressure is guaranteed. It has been tested in a system fed by one source, but
    it may be applied to systems with different sources. The methodology applied to
    the study case allowed the entire flushing of the network in a minimum time of
    2.46 h and just injecting the pipe volumes. This means a 92.2% less injected volume
    compared to a normal irrigation day (Esc 1) and flushing time reduction of 79%
    in addition to guaranteeing that the injected substance reaches all consumption
    points. Next research will be developed to meet the energy consumption along with
    flushing goals. The same methodology can be applied as well to determine the best
    irrigation schedules in order to guide the distribution of fertilizers through
    the network to avoid it reaches ecological crops while the appropriate doses to
    the non-ecological crops are provided, in centralized irrigation networks where
    both types of crops coexist. Finally, as an alternative to genetic algorithms,
    other deterministic methods based on tracking by events the progress of the substance
    transported by water will be studied. References Aldridge DC, Elliott P, Moggridge

  analysis: 'This study contributes to addressing the global food challenge by exploring
    how automated irrigation management systems can contribute to the efficient use
    of water resources and enhance agricultural productivity to meet the growing demand
    for food. It evaluates the current state and future potential of end-to-end automated
    irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies.
    The key issues pertaining to the outline point are addressed as follows:


    * **Types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources**.
    The paper thoroughly discusses various types of data relevant to irrigation management,
    including meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation,
    etc.), soil data (soil moisture content, soil texture, etc.), crop data (canopy
    temperature, vegetation index, etc.), and water data (flow rate, pressure, etc.).
    It highlights the importance of data integration from different sources to obtain
    a comprehensive understanding of the irrigation system''s performance. Typical
    sources for this data include sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms.


    * **Determination and evaluation of the inﬂuences of alternate partial root-zone
    irrigation on the water and growth status of alfalfa**. The study investigates
    the effects of alternate partial root-zone irrigation on alfalfa''s water and
    growth status. It employs various methods, including soil moisture monitoring,
    canopy temperature measurements, and vegetation index analysis, to evaluate the
    impact of different irrigation quotas and methods on alfalfa''s water consumption,
    transpiration rate, and overall growth. The findings provide valuable insights
    into optimizing irrigation strategies for alfalfa production in arid and semi-arid
    regions.


    * **Investigation of the response of the CWSI to T and discussion of the coupled
    relationship of water status and water demand at the canopy scale**. The paper
    explores the relationship between the crop water stress index (CWSI) and transpiration
    (T) in alfalfa under different irrigation regimes. It establishes a correlation
    between the CWSI and T, demonstrating that severe alfalfa water stress decreases
    the transpiration rate. Moreover, the study quantifies this relationship and analyzes
    its implications for irrigation scheduling and precision agriculture practices.
    This knowledge enables farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation timing
    and water allocation to maximize crop yield while conserving water resources.'

    \ with conventional subsurface drip irrigation (abbreviated as R) and alternate\n\

    \ quotas:\n0 mm, 10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm, which are denoted as CK, R10 (P10),\
    \ R20 (P20), and\nR30 (P30), respectively. Results indicate that the CWSI is a\
    \ suitable tool to deﬁne alfalfa\nwater status under different irrigation regimes.\
    \ The CWSI values reﬂect CK > R10 > R20 >\nP10 > P20 > R30 > P30, with values\
    \ of 0.57, 0.41, 0.26, 0.24, 0.18, 0.17, and 0.13,\nrespectively. The T values\
    \ show that CK < R10 < P10 < R20 < P20 < R30 < P30, with\nvalues of 0.46 mm/h,\
    \ 0.61 mm/h, 0.70 mm/h, 0.71 mm/h, 0.76 mm/h, 0.77 mm/h, and\n0.78 mm/h, respectively.\
    \ In addition, under the same irrigation quotas, the CWSI\npresented as P10, P20,\
    \ and P30 was lower than R10, R20, and R30, respectively,\nwhile the T was the\
    \ opposite. Taking the improved transpiration rate as the amount of\nwater saving,\
    \ it was demonstrated that the alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation was\
    \ a\nwater-saving method, and each increase of 10 mm in alternating irrigation\
    \ quotas could\nsave 67.2, 18.4, and 4.6% of water, respectively. This evaluation\
    \ contributes to a better\nunderstanding of the spatiotemporal variations of water\

    \ sativa L.) is widely used in feed for herbivorous animals such as cows and swine\n\
    (Abdelaziz et al., 2013) and has become one of the preferred fodder targets in\
    \ global animal\nhusbandry (Saloua et al., 2018). China’s cultivated area of alfalfa\
    \ had been promoted 4 million ha,\nwith a yield of 2.5 million tons. However,\
    \ the yield still could not meet the need of demand.\nConsequently, China imports\
    \ more than 1.3 million tons of alfalfa hay per year (Li et al., 2020) with\n\

    an average price that exceeded 350 dollars/ton in 2021 (http://\nwww.customs.gov.cn/),\
    \ which was 37% higher than the domestic\ncost. Attention must paid to this large\
    \ supply gap in the alfalfa\nindustry.\nDrought and other challenges resulting\
    \ from climate change\nare concerning factors that affect the sustainability and\
    \ high yield\nof crops (Huang and Shan, 1998). Every kilogram of alfalfa hay\n\
    consumes 800 kg of fresh water (Xie, 2017), and water demand is\nconcentrated\
    \ in the growth period (Liu et al., 2019). Northwest\nChina is the main alfalfa\
    \ cultivation region, with the planting area\naccounting for 60.6% of the total\
    \ alfalfa cultivation area according\nto the National Alfalfa Industry Development\
    \ Plan (2016–2020)\n(http://www.moa.gov.cn/). However, this area experiences strong\n\
    evaporation but rare rainfall. Gansu Province is the region with\nthe greatest\
    \ number of counties producing high-quality alfalfa in\nChina; nevertheless, the\
    \ environment there is under severe water\nstress most years (Deng et al., 2008;\
    \ Wen et al., 2017), and water\nresources use rate for irrigation purposes is\
    \ as high as 178% (Zhao\net al., 2016). Because of the agricultural water deﬁcit,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to deepen the research on water-saving agricultural\nmeasures,\
    \ especially the effective use of irrigation water. Thus, we\nneed to closely\
    \ monitor the moisture and growth status of alfalfa\nto formulate irrigation scheduling\
    \ and optimize the allocation of\nlimited water resources, further realizing the\
    \ development of\nprecision agriculture with water saving and high yield.\nDue\
    \ to the increasing attention to effective use of irrigation\nwater, many ﬁeld\
    \ managements have been taken in the northwest\nregion, with alternate partial\
    \ root-zone irrigation being one of\nthem (Kang et al., 1997). This method can\
    \ stimulate the growth of\na crop’s root zone and increase the absorption of water\
    \ and\nnutrients after rewatering to improve crop water productivity and\ncrop\
    \ quality (Cheng et al., 2021). However, alternate partial root-\nzone irrigation\
    \ results in major changes to farmland soil moisture\nand heat, and excessive\
    \ water stress will restrain a crop’s\nphysiological and nutritional development\
    \ (Shu et al., 2020).\nIn order to avoid a serious water deﬁcit that reduces crop\n\
    yield, to decrease evaporation, and to achieve the goal of water\nsaving and high\
    \ yield, monitoring water status and crop water\nrequirements across an entire\
    \ growth period is of great\nsigniﬁcance.\nStarting from the principle of heat\
    \ and water vapor ﬂux in the\nsoil-plant-atmosphere continuum (Zhao et al., 2012),\
    \ when the\nsoil water supply cannot meet the requirements of plant\ntranspiration\
    \ (T), the transpiration rate decreases, and the\nlatent heat of transpiration\
    \ consumption decreases. However,\nthe sensible heat level increases accordingly,\
    \ leading to the rise of\ncrop canopy temperature (Tc) and vice versa. Therefore,\
    \ in the\nearly literature, Tanner (1963) proposed using the Tc to diagnose\n\
    crop\nwater\ndeﬁcit.\nThen\ntaking\nambient\nmeteorological\nconditions into consideration,\
    \ Idso (1982) innovatively created\nthe crop water stress index (CWSI) model,\
    \ which deﬁnes its\nupper and lower limits as the canopy-air temperature difference\n\
    (Tc-Ta) under the condition of no transpiration and potential\nevaporation. Various\
    \ CWSI models have since been developed,\nand it was commonly used as a tool to\
    \ quantify the effect of water\nstress (Susan et al., 2012; Devin et al., 2016;\
    \ Santesteban et al.,\n2017; García-Tejero et al., 2018). Meanwhile, research\
    \ has made\ngreat progress from observational methods to modeling methods\n(Sun\
    \ and Liu, 2003). In particular, with the development of\nground-based and unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle (UAV) based\nmonitoring at the meter level and sub-meter level\
    \ (Gerhards\net al., 2019), it is possible to obtain nondestructive, spatial\n\
    continuous, and automatic infrared thermal (e.g., the Tc) at\nthe plant canopy\
    \ scale (Ray et al., 1988) and thus accurately\nperceive crop water status and\
    \ growth status near real-time. In\nthis context, high-resolution UAV-based thermal\
    \ imaging has\nbeen successfully applied in previous studies of almond trees\n\
    (García-Tejero et al., 2018), corn (Devin et al., 2016), a vineyard\n(Santesteban\
    \ et al., 2017), and citrus (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014)\nthat have proved the\
    \ effectiveness of infrared thermometers\n(TIRs) to monitor crop water status.\n\
    The CWSI can clearly show when and where to irrigate, but it\nis still hard for\
    \ planters to determine how much to irrigate\n(Adnan and Attila, 2019). In arid\
    \ and semiarid inland areas,\nmore than 90% of precipitation returns to the atmosphere\
    \ in the\nform of evapotranspiration (Rosenberg et al., 1983), so accurate\nestimation\
    \ of crop water consumption (i.e., the T) is another key\nconsideration when adjusting\
    \ irrigation scheduling (Zhou et al.,\n2021). Compared with satellite, UAV-based\
    \ remote sensing is\nmore suitable for ﬁeld scale monitoring. Using UAV equipped\n\
    with high-resolution TIR cameras, Ahongshangbam et al. (2020)\ndetected spatial\
    \ variability of tropical rainforest transpiration,\nHou et al. (2021) estimated\
    \ the soybean transpiration under\ndifferent water conditions and veriﬁed with\
    \ hydrogen-oxygen\nstable isotopes measurements, and Ortega-Farias et al. (2021)\n\
    evaluated the water ﬂux of vineyard and veriﬁed with an eddy\ncovariance system.\
    \ These studies have conﬁrmed the accuracy\nand applicability of UAV-based TIRs\
    \ in transpiration estimation.\nCrop transpiration is closely related with its\
    \ water status.\nMany researchers have explored the relationship between the\n\
    CWSI and T. Sepaskhah and Ilampour (1996) detected a linear\nrelation of the CWSI\
    \ and T in cowpea on traditional point-scale\nobservation. Using infrared thermography\
    \ data have also been\ncollected on ﬁeld scale for cotton (Jiang et al., 2019)\
    \ and almond\norchards (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2019). Overall, this linear\nrelationship\
    \ appears to be more discrete in common bean\n(Durigon and van Lier, 2013). Moreover,\
    \ Xu et al. (2016)\nargued that the relationship is a downward curve since the\n\
    water absorbed by plants from the soil cannot meet the needs\nof plant transpiration\
    \ when there is a high CWSI. Furthermore, a\nwater deﬁcit leads to partial closure\
    \ of stomata and inhibits\ntranspiration. Overall, the relationship between the\
    \ CWSI and\nT response to water stress is inconsistent for each crop, and this\n\
    response is expected to vary with the environment. In previous\nstudies, T has\
    \ been measured at ﬁxed points to achieve precise\nirrigation management. However,\
    \ a method of detection to\nidentify the point-by-point relationship in alfalfa\
    \ at the plant\ncanopy scale is urgently needed and remains poorly investigated.\n\
    We pursue the following objectives in this study: 1) quantify\nthe spatiotemporal\
    \ patterns of alfalfa water status under different\nirrigation regimes using high-resolution\
    \ UAV-based thermal\nimages, 2) determine and evaluate the inﬂuences of alternate\n\
    partial root-zone irrigation on the water and growth status of\nalfalfa, and 3)\

    \ of modern agriculture.\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Study Site and Experimental\
    \ Design\nThe study was carried out from July 11 to August 22, 2018, at the\n\
    Wuwei Experimental Station for Efﬁcient Water Use in\nAgriculture (37°52’20″N,\
    \ 102°50’50″E, Elev. 1,581 m) located\nin\nLiangzhou\nDistrict,\nWuwei\nCity,\n\
    Gansu\nProvince,\nNorthwest China (Figure 1A). This region typically has a\ntemperate,\
    \ arid climate and is one of the most prominent arid\nareas with a mismatch between\
    \ water supply and demand (Li\net al., 2015). There is a large temperature difference\
    \ between day\nand night, and the mean annual temperature is around 8°C.\nPerennially\
    \ having rare rainfall but intensive evaporation, the\naverage annual precipitation\
    \ and the annual average surface\nevaporation\nare\napproximately\n164 mm\nand\n\
    2,000 mm,\nrespectively. Sunshine in the area is sufﬁcient, with more than\n3,000\
    \ h of annual sunshine duration, and the annual frost-free\nperiod is more than\
    \ 150 days (Wu and Du, 2020). The soil in the\nexperimental ﬁeld was light gray\
    \ calcareous sand loam with a\nmean dry bulk density of 1.53 g·cm−3, the permanent\
    \ wilting\npoint and ﬁeld capacity (volume) were 9 and 32% for the\n0–160 cm layer,\
    \ respectively; the magnetism of soil organic\nFIGURE 1 | (A) Geographic location\

    \ et al.\nCWSI and Transpiration Evaluation\nmatter, the nitrate nitrogen content,\
    \ the ammonium nitrogen\ncontent, and the available phosphorus content were 4–8\
    \ × 103,\n52.13, 6.70, and 5–8 mg·kg−1, respectively, (Zhang, 2017). The\nnatural\
    \ condition of this station is typical and representative of\nthe Chinese northwest\
    \ inland arid region.\nBefore sowing, drip irrigation pipes (DAYU Water-saving\n\
    Group Corp. LTD., Gansu, China) with a drip head ﬂow rate\nof 3 L h−1 were installed\
    \ at 0.3 m intervals and buried at a depth of\n0.2 m. A ﬂow meter (Green-GutenTop\
    \ water meter, Taizhou\nGreen Valves Corp., Ltd., China) was installed on the\
    \ plots to\nmeasure the ﬂow under different irrigation regimes. Two forms of\n\
    drip irrigation were considered: conventional subsurface drip\nirrigation (R)\
    \ and alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation\n(P). The experimental plot\
    \ was cultivated with Emperor alfalfa\nand each planting plot was 4 × 6 m2, as\
    \ shown by the marked\nblack rectangle in Figure 1C. Based on previous studies\
    \ at this\nstation (Kou, 2014), these methods included four levels of\nirrigation\
    \ quotas: 0 mm, 10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm per time.\nThe irrigation was performed\
    \ every 5–10 days according to the\nenvironmental conditions, speciﬁcally, when\
    \ the soil moisture\ncontent of any subplot falls close to permanent wilting point,\
    \ an\nirrigation will be applied. Three irrigation events were completed\non July\
    \ 16, July 21, and July 29, 2018, during the experiment\nperiod.\nOtherwise,\n\
    fertilization\nmeasures\nand\nother\nenvironmental conditions were the same in\
    \ each plot. Thus,\nseven irrigation strategies were applied to study the effects\
    \ on\nthe growth and water statuses of alfalfa as explicitly abbreviated in\n\
    Table 1. For example, R10 refers to the situation where the alfalfa\nwas irrigated\
    \ 10 mm at a time using conventional drip irrigation\nfor the entire growth stage.\
    \ Meanwhile, CK stands for a situation\nwith no irrigation.\n2.2 Data Acquisition\n\
    2.2.1 Spatiotemporal Data\nThe spatiotemporal data in our experiment were acquired\
    \ from\ntwo perspectives: the proximal and aerial scale.\nWe used a visible-light\
    \ and high-resolution thermal infrared\ncamera (Fluke IR Flex Cam TiX620, Fluke\
    \ Corp., United states) to\ncapture both high-resolution thermal infrared and\
    \ RGB images at\n1.5 m\nabove\nground\nlevel\nfor\nproximal\nremote\nsensing\n\
    observation. It was possible to precisely identify the soil, crops,\nand other\
    \ elements (mainly drip irrigation pipes) in the infrared\nimages, and as demonstrated\
    \ in Figure 1B, only crops were\nanalyzed in this study. The thermal image sensor\
    \ resolution was\n640 × 480 pixels, with an accuracy of ±2°C and a sensitivity\
    \ of\n0.05°C. The instantaneous ﬁeld of view was 0.85 mrad, and the\nmeasuring\
    \ wave-length response was in the range of 7.5–14 µm.\nMeanwhile, the emissivity\
    \ of alfalfa leaves and canopies was set to\n0.95 (Tian et al., 2014); the visible\
    \ light digital camera had a\nresolution of 8 megapixels and up to 32 times digital\
    \ zoom.\nWe used a UAV platform to collect the RGB and thermal\ninfrared images\
    \ of alfalfa (Figure 1C) during the remote sensing\nobservation, the RGB and thermal\
    \ infrared images were used to\nextracted the alfalfa canopy covers and water\
    \ status, respectively.\nThe platform comprised a combination of the DJI UAV (DJI\n\
    M600 Pro), a cloud-borne camera (DJI Zenmuse Z3), and a\nthermal infrared camera\
    \ (FLIR Vue Pro 640). The M600 Pro 6-\naxis aerial vehicle had a hovering vertical\
    \ and horizontal accuracy\nof ±0.5 and ±1.5 m, respectively, a maximum support\
    \ wind speed\nof 8 m·s−1; and a ﬂight time of near 30 min while loading the\n\
    camera. All of these factors indicate that it was well equipped to\nmaintain a\
    \ stable ﬂight attitude over a long period. The DJI\nZenmuse Z3 pan-head camera\
    \ could rotate 360° with a high level\nof accuracy of ±0.03° and effective pixels\
    \ numbering 12 million.\nThe FLIR Vue Pro 640 thermal infrared camera had a wide\
    \ ﬁeld\nangle and a measurement wavelength range of 32°H × 26°V and\n7.5–13.5\
    \ μm, respectively, with a sensitivity of 0.05°C, a camera\nresolution of 640\
    \ × 512 pixels, and a lens focal length of 19 mm. In\norder to obtain thermal\
    \ infrared images with high resolution and\nlarge coverage, the UAV was made to\
    \ hover at a height of 80 m for\noblique photography. Furthermore, the thermal\
    \ infrared images\ncollected by the UAV were input into the FLIR Tools image\n\
    processing software, and the emissivity was set at 0.97 so that\nthese data could\
    \ be calibrated against the proximal data. The\nUAV thermal imageries were processed\
    \ applying geometric and\nradiometric corrections.\nBoth perspectives yielded\
    \ RGB and thermal images of alfalfa,\nas shown in Figures 1B,C, but the two types\
    \ of images had\ndifferent spatial resolutions. The UAV observation was carried\n\
    out every 2 hours when the weather was clear and cloudless from\n9:00 to 19:00\
    \ beginning on July 11 and ending on August 22 (local\ntime). The proximal observation\
    \ schedule was the same as the\nUAV monitoring, but synchronous observations was\
    \ only done\non July 26 and 29. The observations were repeated three times.\n\
    Finally, we selected the highest-quality images for deeper analysis.\n2.2.2 Other\
    \ Field Measurement Data\nMeteorological data, such as air temperature (Ta), relative\n\
    humidity (RH), and precipitation were continuously measured\nfrom a standard automatic\
    \ weather station (HOBO H21001,\nOnset Computer Corp., Cape Cod, MA, United states),\
    \ as\nshown in Figure 2A. In the experimental plot, the data\nTABLE 1 | The irrigation\

    \ Moreover, radiation data was\ncollected using the CNR4 four-component radiometer\
    \ (Kipp &\nZonen CNR4, Delft, the Netherlands) and the Bowen ratio system\nat\
    \ a frequency of 5 min. Longwave and shortwave radiation were\nmeasured to calculate\
    \ the net surface radiation ﬂux (Rn).\nFinally, the soil volumetric water content\
    \ was measured using\na portable soil water proﬁler (Diviner 2000; Australia).\
    \ Every plot\nwas laid out with two measuring tubes, and those were shown as\n\
    red dots in Figure 1C. The proﬁler could obtain the volumetric\nsoil water content\
    \ at 0–100 cm depth, and the average soil\nvolumetric water content at the two\
    \ measuring points was\ncalculated as the value of each plot (Figure 2B).\n2.3\
    \ Methods\n2.3.1 Theory and Equations of the CWSI\nWe used a modiﬁed calculation\
    \ model of the crop water stress\nindex in our study that had simple input parameters\
    \ combined\nwith UAV thermal infrared imaging technology. The equation\nwas as\
    \ follows (Jones, 1999; Jones et al., 2002):\nCWSI \x02 Tc − Tw\nTd − Tw\n(1)\n\
    Where the Tc, Tw, and Td are deﬁned as the temperatures of the\nalfalfa canopy,\
    \ the upper boundary, and the lower boundary (°C),\nrespectively. The Tc was obtained\
    \ from the thermal UAV image.\nAnd for an estimation of the Tw and Td, they were\
    \ extracted as the\nhighest and lowest canopy temperatures of all treatments in\
    \ our\ncase, respectively, (Jones et al., 2002; Meron et al., 2010).\nTherefore,\
    \ the CWSI pixel values were obtained, and the\naverage CWSI of all crop pixels\
    \ in each subplot was calculated\nto discuss the water status under different\
    \ irrigation events.\n2.3.2 Transpiration of Alfalfa\nThe three-temperature model\
    \ is a two-source evapotranspiration\nmodel based on the idea of land-surface\
    \ energy balance, which\nhas been extensively applied in arid areas with an evaluation\
    \ error\nof 0.08 mm/d (Tian et al., 2014). Since the principle of this model\n\
    has been explained in detail by many previous studies (Qiu et al.,\n1998; Xiong\
    \ et al., 2015), we only brieﬂy explain the transpiration\ncalculation model of\
    \ vegetation used here. When vegetation\ncovers the ground, the energy balance\
    \ equation based on\nvegetation canopy can be expressed as seen in Eqn. 2:\nLpT\
    \ \x02 Rn – Hc\n(2)\nFIGURE 2 | The (A) meteorological data in the experiment.\

    \ et al.\nCWSI and Transpiration Evaluation\nWhere the LT is the latent heat ﬂux\
    \ consumed by the alfalfa’s\ntranspiration (W·m−2) and L is the latent heat of\
    \ vaporization\nwith a value of 2.45 × 106 W·m−2·mm−1. Furthermore, Rn is the\n\
    net surface radiation ﬂux (W·m−2), and Hc is the sensible heat ﬂux\nof alfalfa\
    \ and can be calculated as follows (Qiu et al., 1999; Tian\net al., 2014):\nHc\
    \ \x02 ρ × Cp × (Tc − Ta)\nra\n(3)\nra \x02 ρ × Cp × (Ti − Ta)\nRn,i\n(4)\nWhere\
    \ the ρ is the air density (kg m−3) and Cp is the speciﬁc heat\nat constant pressure\
    \ in MJ kg−1°C−1. The ra is the aerodynamic\nresistance (sm−1), namely the diffusion\
    \ resistance of the air layer.\nMoreover, the Ti and Rn,i are the canopy temperature\
    \ and solar\nnet radiation of the imitation canopy without transpiration,\nrespectively,\
    \ which means that Rn,i = Rn. Usually, rectangular\ngreen paper is used as an\
    \ imitation canopy. Here, we considered\nusing the maximum canopy temperature\
    \ to replace the imitation\ncanopy temperature due to difﬁculties with observing\
    \ the\nimitation canopy through an aerial method (Zhao et al., 2010).\nThe subscripts\
    \ a, c, and i represent the air, canopy, and imitation\ncanopy, respectively.\n\
    By combining Eqs. 2, 3, the T was computed using the\nfollowing equation:\nLpT\

    \ Coverage\nCanopy coverage (f) is the ratio of the vertical projection of alfalfa\n\
    canopy onto the land surface to the total area, the higher the\ncanopy coverage,\
    \ the stronger ability of crops to intercept light.\nThe RGB images are combined\
    \ with classiﬁcation software ENVI\nto extract canopy pixels, so as to obtain\

    \ the dynamic CWSI under\ndifferent irrigation treatments. The spatial distribution\
    \ of the Tc,\nTc-Ta, and CWSI for seven sampled alfalfa plots across three\nmeasurement\
    \ dates at 13:00 are shown in Figure 3. It is\nFIGURE 3 | The (1) canopy temperature,\

    \ et al.\nCWSI and Transpiration Evaluation\nremarkable that dramatic spatial\
    \ heterogeneity was very obvious\nin each planting plot for the above three parameters,\
    \ with an\nexample being the plot marked R10 in Figure 3(a-1). This plot\nshows\
    \ a changing color, which suggests that the high-resolution\nUAV-based thermal\
    \ images captured the inﬂuence of the\ncropland microclimate.\nIt should be noted\
    \ that signiﬁcant differences existed between\ndifferent planting plots and that\
    \ the thermal parameters were\nobviously inﬂuenced by the irrigation regimes.\
    \ The same\nirrigation methods had similar patterns for the Tc, Tc-Ta, and\nCWSI,\
    \ while the value decreased with increasing irrigation\nquotas. For example, the\
    \ CWSIs of the planting plots labeled\nR10, R20, and R30 were mainly within the\
    \ ranges of 0.4–0.6,\n0.2–0.4, and 0.0–0.2, respectively, (Figure 3(a-3)). Surveying\n\
    different irrigation methods, especially the differences between\ntraditional\
    \ drip irrigation (R) and alternate partial root-zone drip\nirrigation (P) as\
    \ represented by the canopy temperature\ndistribution of alfalfa during its nutritional\
    \ growth stage in\nFigure 3(a-1), it can be seen that the Tc with R irrigation\
    \ was\nmainly in the range of 28–37°C, while the lower temperature was\nrare on\
    \ the right side with a value concentrated in the range of\n25–32°C. Similar results\
    \ were found for the Tc-Ta as well as the\nCWSI. To be more speciﬁc, compared\
    \ with R irrigation, the\nvalues of the Tc, Tc-Ta, and CWSI were lower with P\
    \ irrigation,\nindicating that traditional drip irrigation may was subjected to\n\
    stronger water stress.\nFinally, difference between the three growth stages was\n\
    apparent. The value of the Tc was lower during the prolonged\ngrowth period, with\
    \ the major ranges of 28–37°C and 23–28°C\nduring nutritional and reproductive\
    \ growth stages (i.e., July 21\nand August 19), respectively, combined with the\
    \ Ta, this\ncondition changed a bit for the canopy-air temperature\ndifference.\
    \ Meanwhile, the CWSI was more complicated than\nthe Tc or Tc-Ta. No generalized\
    \ conclusion could be reached, and\nall three varied from 0 to 0.6. In other words,\
    \ more temporal\nevolutions are needed to interpret the ﬁndings, which suggests\n\
    that it is necessary to establish long-term monitoring of alfalfa\nwater status.\n\
    3.2 The Temporal Assessment of Alfalfa\nWater Status\nThe temporal variability\
    \ of alfalfa measured by the Tc, Tc-Ta, and\nCWSI under different irrigation treatments\
    \ is presented in\nFigure 4. The results demonstrate that the water status of\n\
    alfalfa varied substantially during the observation period and\nFIGURE 4 | The\
    \ (A) daily variations and (B) diurnal variations in (1) the canopy temperature,\
    \ (2) the difference between canopy temperature and air temperature, and\n(3)\
    \ the crop water stress index of alfalfa under different irrigation methods based\
    \ on UAV monitoring. The daily variations reﬂect the mean values of the entire\
    \ plot for each\ntreatment, and the readings taken at 13:00. Precipitation data\
    \ were for the ﬁrst 2 days of the observation period.\nFrontiers in Environmental\

    \ et al.\nCWSI and Transpiration Evaluation\nthat ﬂuctuations could not be ignored\
    \ under different irrigation\nregimes.\nThroughout the irrigation season, the\
    \ Tc values ranged in the\ninterval of 20–55°C, with a mean value of 33.83 ± 5.31°C.\
    \ Analysis\nof the Tc under different water treatments shows a relatively\nconsistent\
    \ trend of ﬂuctuation with different values. In particular,\nthe no-irrigation\
    \ alfalfa had the highest canopy temperature,\nfollowed by the R10, R20, P10,\
    \ R30, P20, and P30, with mean\nvalues of 39.14, 35.23, 31.79, 31.31, 29.74, 29.56,\
    \ and 28.52°C,\nrespectively, (Table 2). It should also be noted that the Tc\n\
    decreased when the irrigation quotas increased, this result is\nconsistent with\
    \ Figure 3(1). In addition, the mean value of R10\nwas higher than that of P10,\
    \ with similar results found in R20 and\nR30 (R20 > P20, R30 > P30), indicating\
    \ that alternate irrigation\nhas a lower Tc under the same irrigation quota. These\
    \ results were\nin accord with the average diurnal trend of the different growth\n\
    stages [Figure 4(b-1)], especially concerning analyses of the peak\nvalues in\
    \ each stage.\nTaking air temperature into consideration, there were some\nchanges\
    \ from the Tc to the Tc-Ta. For example, the lowest Tc\nvalue during the study\
    \ period was on July 29, except for CK\n(August 19). Another big discrepancy was\
    \ the fact that the Tc-Ta\nin the transitory stage was smoother and steadier than\
    \ the Tc,\nwhile its value in the reproductive growth stage ﬂuctuated more\nthan\
    \ that of the Tc. Thus, the diurnal variation curve of the Tc-Ta\nin the transitory\
    \ stage was lower than that of the same curve for\nthe reproductive growth stage,\
    \ except for CK [Figure 4(b-2)].\nThe estimated CWSI during the study period and\
    \ its temporal\npatterns are exhibited in Figure 4(3). Based on analysis of the\n\
    observed dates in July and August, the water status of alfalfa was\nchanging continuously\
    \ with its growth, conﬁrming the necessity\nof real-time water status monitoring.\
    \ Generally, the CWSI\nﬂuctuated widely in the range of 0–0.8 and showed a\ndownward\
    \ trend in July, even approaching zero at the end of\nthis month under some irrigation\
    \ treatments, which indicates a\nrobust water status trend. It jumped in early\
    \ August and then\nslowly declined, except for the CK situation without irrigation\n\
    interference. This variation highlights the role of climate\nconditions\nand\n\
    irrigation.\nAs\ncharted\nin\nFigure\n4(a-3),\nprecipitation\nand\nirrigation\n\
    could\nresult\nin\nthe\nCWSI\ndecreasing, as seen with the irrigation on July\
    \ 16 and heavy\nrainfall on August 4. To clarify our understanding, we presented\n\
    the diurnal pattern of the CWSI at the ﬁrst irrigation [Figure 4(b-\n3)]: R10\
    \ (P10), R20 (P20), and R30 (P30) were irrigated 10 mm,\n20 mm, and 30 mm, respectively,\
    \ at 9:00 on July 16, while CK was\nnot irrigated. Obviously, there was imparity\
    \ for the CWSI\nbetween the CK and irrigated alfalfa after irrigation (e.g., R10).\n\
    The diurnal curve of the CWSI of the irrigated alfalfa was shorter\nand ﬂatter\
    \ than before, while the CK was higher and thinner.\nThese results indicate that\
    \ irrigation signiﬁcantly alleviated alfalfa\nwater stress.\nIn order to identify\
    \ the effect of irrigation on alfalfa water\nstatus under different irrigation\
    \ events, an analysis of the mean of\nthe Tc, Tc-Ta, and the CWSI of alfalfa throughout\
    \ the irrigation\nseason was conducted (Table 2). It can be observed that there\n\
    were signiﬁcant distinctions in the CWSI under different\nirrigation amounts and\
    \ methods. Under the same irrigation\nmethod,\nthe\nCWSI\nfor\ndifferent\nirrigation\n\
    quotas\nwas\nsigniﬁcantly different, that was the increasing irrigation quotas\n\
    resulted in decreasing CWSIs, and it could be ordered as R10 >\nR20 > R30 and\
    \ P10 > P20 > P30, with averages of 0.41, 0.26, and\n0.17 and 0.24, 0.18, and\
    \ 0.13, respectively. All the values were\nsmaller than that of the CK (0.57).\
    \ Under the same irrigation\namount, the CWSI of alfalfa under R was higher than\
    \ that of\nalfalfa under P, and this difference was particularly signiﬁcant in\n\
    scenarios with a low irrigation amount. To be speciﬁc, the CWSI\nunder P was reduced\
    \ by 41.5, 30.9, and 23.5% for 10 mm, 20 mm,\nand 30 mm irrigation treatments,\
    \ respectively, compared with the\nR scenarios. Moreover, every 10 mm increase\
    \ in the alternate\nirrigation quotas resulted in the CWSI decreasing to 0.33,\
    \ 0.06,\nand 0.05. Thus, the alternate irrigation regime was more\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ for a nonnegligible amount of water savings,\nsuggesting that a balance needs\
    \ to be found between the lower\nirrigation quotas and better water status.\n\
    3.3 Estimation of Alfalfa Transpiration\nFigure 5 shows the spatial transpiration\
    \ rates of alfalfa based on\nTIR monitoring at the same time for the same canopy\
    \ areas\nduring three growth stages. When we focus on the heterogeneity\nin each\
    \ stage, it can be seen that the variations were basically\nidentical, with alternate\
    \ irrigation having a higher transpiration\nrate than traditional irrigation and\
    \ the increasing irrigation\nquotas having a positive effect on the transpiration\
    \ rate.\nFurthermore, the concentrated value range for the T changed\nas the observation\
    \ went on, with T values in the early, middle, and\nlate periods concentrated\
    \ in the intervals of 0.8–1.3 mm/h,\n1.3–1.4 mm/h, and 1.3–1.6 mm/h, respectively.\n\
    The alfalfa transpiration rates under different water supplies\nwere estimated\
    \ (Figure 6). According to the results, the\ntranspiration rate increased from\n\
    9:00, reached its peak\nbetween 13:00 and 15:00, and approached zero at 19:00.\
    \ The\npeak type and peak value varied with time, the irrigation amount,\nand\
    \ the irrigation method. Most days, the transpiration rate\ndenoted a single peak\
    \ curve that ﬁrst increased and then\ndecreased. Occasionally, the alfalfa would\
    \ follow the “noon\nbreak”\nphenomenon,\nwith\na\nsmaller\nor\nclosing\nstomata\n\
    opening at midday due to strong light intensity and low air\nhumidity (e.g., July\

    \ too. Hence, the diurnal pattern presented a bimodal\ntype at this time. Analyzing\
    \ the peak T value, it can be seen that\nthe T was closely associated with the\
    \ irrigation regime, ranging\nfrom 0.63 mm/h (CK in July 11) to 1.63 mm/h (P30\
    \ in July 25).\nNo matter the irrigation method, the temporal dynamics suggest\n\
    that improving irrigation quotas will stimulate the transpiration\nrate of alfalfa,\
    \ with relationships being CK < R10 < R20 < R30\nunder R and CK < P10 < P20 <\
    \ P30 under P. This ﬁnding further\nsupports the previous point that increasing\
    \ irrigation amount can\npromote alfalfa transpiration. Moreover, the effect of\
    \ increasing\nirrigation quotas to the peak values becomes less noticeable. For\n\
    instance, under the P irrigation method, the peak value increased\nby 33.2, 16.3,\
    \ and 6.0% with every irrigation increase of 10 mm.\nWhen we compared the two\
    \ irrigation methods, we discovered\nthat the transpiration rates between R and\
    \ P irrigation methods\nwere in disagreement. Computing the averages of all the\n\
    transpiration rates during the observation time, the mean Ts\nof R10, R20, and\
    \ R30 were 0.61 mm/h, 0.71 mm/h, and 0.77 mm/\nh, respectively, while for P10,\
    \ P20, and P30, the mean Ts were\n0.70 mm/h, 0.76 mm/h, and 0.78 mm/h, respectively.\
    \ Alternate\ndrip irrigation saved 67.2, 18.4, and 4.6% of water under the\nirrigation\
    \ quotas of 10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm, respectively.\n3.4 Relationship Between Alfalfa\
    \ Water\nStatus and Transpiration\nPreviously, we concluded that the changing\
    \ of alfalfa water status\nand the responsiveness of transpiration to different\
    \ irrigation\nregimes indicates when and how much to irrigate. Thus, it is\nnecessary\
    \ to discuss how the water level and transpiration of\nalfalfa can be used to\
    \ adjust irrigation scheduling. First of all, in\norder to ﬁnd the most representative\
    \ indexes of alfalfa water status\nand further explore its effect on transpiration,\
    \ the different\nrelationships between the T and the Tc, Tc-Ta, CWSI of CK\nwere\
    \ deﬁned for each monitoring time during the study period\n(Table 3), which eliminates\
    \ any disturbance from irrigation.\nStatistically,\nthe\nresults\nindicate\nthat\n\
    the\nmost\nsigniﬁcant\nconnections were for the readings taken at 11:00 and 17:00\
    \ and\nthat the best relationship was ﬁxed between the CWSI and T at 11:\n00,\
    \ with a negative correlation coefﬁcient of 0.58 (p < 0.01), followed\nby 0.50\
    \ (p < 0.01) occurring at 17:00. Meanwhile, the relationships\nfor the Tc-Ta and\
    \ Tc were weaker. Interestingly, at 13:00 and 15:00,\nthe Tc-Ta and CWSI showed\
    \ weak, negative relationships. This is a\nﬁnding that can be explained by the\
    \ “noon break” phenomenon of\nthe T. As a consequence, the CWSI at 11:00 is used\
    \ for subsequent\nanalysis and discussion.\nFIGURE 5 | The transpiration rates\

    \ the CWSI or the T, the number of spatial\ngrids of corresponding values are\

    \ that the\ntriangular tops between the CWSI and T are in opposite\npositions\n\
    for\neach\ntreatment.\nFor\nexample,\nthe\noverwhelming majority of pixels in\

    \ 7(a-1),\nwhile the corresponding scale grids for the T are concentrated\nin\
    \ the low-value range on the left side of Figure 7(a-2),\nimplying that there\
    \ was an apparent relationship between\nthe CWSI and T.\nTo\nquantify\nthe\ninﬂuence\n\
    of\nalfalfa\nwater\nstatus\non\ntranspiration, we explored the correlation between\
    \ the daily\nCWSI against the T during the nutritional growth stage and\nthe reproductive\
    \ growth stage, respectively (Figure 8). A\nsigniﬁcantly negative slope of the\
    \ CWSI with T was found on\na daily basis (p < 0.001), suggesting that severe\
    \ alfalfa water status\ndecreases transpiration rate. In addition, the slopes\
    \ of the CWSI\nand T in the nutritional growth and reproductive growth stages\n\
    were\n–1.02 mm/h\nand\n–1.43 mm/h,\nrespectively,\nand\ncorresponding intercepts\
    \ were 1.31 mm/h and 1.45 mm/h,\nrespectively, although there was some slight\
    \ scattering (R1\n2 =\n0.83 and R2\n2 = 0.45; RMSE1 = 0.064 and RMSE2 = 0.151).\n\
    Therefore, with steeper slopes and higher intercepts, the alfalfa\nentering the\
    \ reproductive growth stage was less exposed to more\nTABLE 3 | Pearson’s correlation\

    \ Relationship Between Alfalfa Water\nStatus and Growth Status\nWith the prolonged\
    \ growth period, vegetation covers signiﬁcantly\nincreased as shown in Figure\
    \ 9. This result is also reﬂected in the\nspatial distributions (Figures 3, 5).\
    \ Compared with the images in the\nthird period, vegetation cover was signiﬁcantly\
    \ lower in the ﬁrst two\nimages. Meanwhile, it can be concluded that the canopy\
    \ cover of P20\ncompleted ﬁrst on July 22 (99.4%), followed by P30, P10, R30,\
    \ and\nR20, suggesting that increased irrigation quotas or alternate irrigation\n\
    will close the alfalfa canopy sooner. The alfalfa canopies, except for\nthose\
    \ under the CK and R10 conditions, were near closure once they\nentered August,\
    \ and the canopy cover only reached 75% if there was\nno irrigation, implying\
    \ the signiﬁcance of irrigation for alfalfa.\n4 DISCUSSION\n4.1 Veriﬁcation of\
    \ the UAV Observational\nData\nGiven that we performed data processing and numerical\
    \ analysis\non high-resolution UAV-based data covering thermal images, it\nwas\
    \ essential to verify the data itself. As revealed in Figure 10, the\ntime-synchronized\
    \ points were distributed near the 1:1 line and\nﬁt the linear regression. The\
    \ proximal and aerial monitoring data\nwere in good agreement (R2 = 0.81) and\
    \ reached an absolutely\nsigniﬁcant level (p < 0.001), supporting the reliability\
    \ of the UAV\nmonitoring data. It should be noted that most of the Tc proximal\n\
    data yielded slightly lower values than the UAV-based data, with\na slope equal\
    \ to 0.61. This ﬁnding can be summed up in two\npoints. One reason for this difference\
    \ is that the UAV with its\ncoarser resolution likely obtained more mixed pixels\
    \ than in the\nproximal observations, so the soil temperature will improve the\n\
    value in these pixels. Meanwhile, the fact that canopy cover of\nsome subplots\
    \ were not completely probably increased mixed\ngrids, further enlarging this\
    \ gap, indicating that only pure\nvegetation pixel for analysis is necessary.\
    \ The second reason is\nthe scale effect, which must be taken into account (Ricardo\
    \ et al.,\n2019). Nevertheless, the level of agreement was acceptable, with\n\
    an average difference of only 0.28°C, and agreement was best at\n15:00. Consequently,\
    \ the Tc-UAV data was reasonable and robust\nenough.\nFIGURE 8 | Correlation between\

    4.2 Water Status and Vegetation Dynamics\nof Alfalfa\nWater is a strategic resource\
    \ nowadays, and there is urgent demand\nfor theoretical research to overcome water\
    \ scarcity and optimize\nagricultural irrigation water use (Huang and Shan, 1998).\
    \ With the\nsupport of the thermal sensors on board a UAV platform to obtain\n\
    high-resolution images, this study was devoted to demonstrating\nthat the technology\
    \ is valuable in monitoring water status as well as\nthe transpiration rate of\
    \ alfalfa. Similar to previous studies (Susan\net al., 2012; Devin et al., 2016;\
    \ Santesteban et al., 2017; García-Tejero\net al., 2018; Adnan and Attila, 2019),\
    \ we conﬁrmed that the CWSI is\na useful tool to monitor and quantify water stress.\
    \ Previous studies\nhave concluded that thermal readings at midday were more robust\n\
    (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014; García-Tejero et al., 2018) and\nsuggested that assessments\
    \ could be conducted at noon (Xu\net al., 2016). With this information in mind,\
    \ we assessed the\nspatiotemporal variability of alfalfa under different irrigation\n\
    regimes. Spatially, there was obvious heterogeneity in the CWSI,\nwhich ranged\
    \ from 0 to 0.6. This ﬁnding matched the results\nreported by Park et al. (2017),\
    \ suggesting the signiﬁcance of\nmonitoring water status. Temporally, with the\
    \ extension of the\ngrowth period, the canopy cover gradually arrived 100%, and\
    \ the\nalfalfa water condition ﬂuctuated with the water supply and the\nchange\
    \ in meteorological conditions, which has similarly reported\n(Romero et al.,\
    \ 2018). The diurnal variation pattern of the alfalfa’s\nCWSI was described as\
    \ a single-peak curve that reached its peak\naround 13:00, which shows that alfalfa\
    \ is more likely to suffer severe\nwater stress at midday. This ﬁnding has also\
    \ been seen in pepper (Li\net al., 2014) and rice (Xu et al., 2016), indicating\
    \ the commonness of\ncrop water status.\nHowever, too much emphasis was placed\
    \ on the impact of a\nwater deﬁcit on the crop water status. In contrast to existing\n\
    studies (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2016; Park et al.,\n2017; Xie,\
    \ 2017; García-Tejero et al., 2018; Adnan and Attila,\n2019), our study highlights\
    \ how irrigation alleviates water stress,\nﬁnding that water status was markedly\
    \ better after irrigation\n[Figure 4(b-3)], especially at noon. Meanwhile, we\
    \ captured the\nalfalfa response to different irrigation levels, and it appears\
    \ that an\nincreasing irrigation quota resulted in decreasing CWSI. Our\nwork\
    \ also quantiﬁes the CWSI in the order of CK > R10 > R20 >\nR30 and CK > P10 >\
    \ P20 > P30 during the growing season, while\nthe T follow the orders of CK <\
    \ R10 < R20 < R30 and CK < P10 <\nP20 < P30. Hou et al. (2021) also found that\
    \ soybean\ntranspiration rate was higher under high irrigation quota\nbased on\
    \ UAV-based TIR. This can be attributed to the\nincrease of soil moisture content\
    \ (SMC) caused by irrigation\n(García-Tejero et al., 2018), and a signiﬁcantly\
    \ negative\ncorrelation between the CWSI and SMC was reported by Xu\net al. (2016).\
    \ In this study, irrigation was carried out on July 29,\nexcept in the CK scenario.\
    \ The irrigation increased SMC by\n12.5–63.2%\non\nAugust\n3\ncompared\nwith\n\
    the\nsituations\nbeforehand\n(Figure\n1B).\nSubsequently,\nthe\ncapillary\nconduction\
    \ velocity of the soil and the water absorption rate\nof the plant roots gradually\
    \ increased, too (Luo and Cheng, 2011),\nwhich leads to the increase of leaf water\
    \ content and leaf water\npotential, further affecting the water absorption and\
    \ swelling of\nleaf protective cells to alleviate water stress. Moreover, with\
    \ the\nincrease of stomatal conductance (Park et al., 2017) and the\nenhancement\
    \ of transpiration (Zhao et al., 2012), the alfalfa\ncanopy closes in advance\
    \ as a consequence.\nFurthermore, alternate partial root-zone irrigation has been\n\
    proposed as a signiﬁcant water-saving technology (Kang et al.,\n1997). Our study\
    \ veriﬁed this by exploring the spatiotemporal\ncharacteristics of water status\
    \ against the transpiration rate.\nUnder the same levels of irrigation, the Tc,\
    \ Tc-Ta, and CWSI\nof alfalfa under P were all lower than the values under R.\n\
    Compared with R, every increasing 10 mm of irrigation\nresulted in the CWSI under\
    \ P was reduced by 0.17, 0.08, and\n0.04 (Table 2). Existing studies have already\
    \ demonstrated that\nalternate partial root-zone irrigation can reduce deep soil\
    \ water\nleakage signiﬁcantly (Kang et al., 1997; Michael et al., 2018). This\n\
    makes irrigation more uniform in soil and stimulates the growth\nof root hair\
    \ and lateral roots, which enables alfalfa to absorb water\nmore effectively and\
    \ further results in lowering the Tc, lowering\nthe CWSI, and stronger transpiration.\
    \ Our study conﬁrms that\nthe mean transpiration rates of the P irrigation regime\
    \ were\nhigher than those of the R, with values of 0.09 mm/h, 0.05 mm/h,\nand\
    \ 0.01 mm/h for P10, P20, and P30, respectively, compared to\nR10, R20, and R30\
    \ (Figure 6).\nIn addition, many ﬁeld experiments have been carried out to\ndetermine\
    \ the effects of alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation,\nand ﬁndings have\
    \ shown that P can save 30–50% of irrigation\nwater (Cheng et al., 2021), thus\
    \ alleviating water stress and\nreducing the CWSI. Our study backs up this conclusion\
    \ using\nUAV-based\ninfrared\nthermal\nimages.\nBy\nexploring\nthe\nimprovement\
    \ of transpiration rate as the amount of water\nsaving, it was calculated that\
    \ P saved 67.2, 18.4, and 4.6% of\nwater under the irrigation quotas of 10 mm,\
    \ 20 mm, and 30 mm,\nrespectively. Transpiration for crops is regarded as beneﬁcial\n\

    water consumption in terms of irrigation water use (Zhou et al.,\n2021), and a\
    \ higher transpiration rate has been directly connected\nwith higher yield (Lopez-Lopez\
    \ et al., 2018). Since the increment\nof the irrigation quota played a slightly\
    \ positive role on the water-\nsaving effect, we recommend the alternative root-zone\
    \ irrigation\nmethod with a 20 mm irrigation quota for alfalfa.\nMore importantly,\
    \ the signiﬁcantly negative relationships\nbetween water status at 11:00 and the\
    \ transpiration rate of\nalfalfa (p < 0.01) were noticeable, and our study further\n\
    investigated this connection during the growth stages. The\nresults presented\
    \ a strong linear correlation (p < 0.001), and\nthe ﬁtting curve equations were\
    \ expressed as T = –1.02*CWSI +\n1.31 (R2 = 0.83) and T = –1.43*CWSI + 1.45 (R2\
    \ = 0.45) for the\nnutritional growth and reproductive growth stages, respectively.\n\
    Regarding formulas quantiﬁed by other scholars based on ﬁeld\nexperiments, Xu\
    \ et al. (2016) identiﬁed this connection with rice\nas T = –30.42*CWSI2 + 19.41*CWSI\
    \ + 3.16 (R2 = 0.70) and\nGonzalez-Dugo et al. (2019) calculated T = –4.58*CWSI\
    \ + 5.36\n(R2 = 0.97) for almond. These differences may be due to the\nvariety\
    \ of crops and regression methods.\nPhysiological processes such as the transpiration\
    \ of crops are\nmainly carried out in leaf cells, affecting the growth, dry matter\n\
    accumulation, and ﬁnal yield of crops by producing various\norganic nutrients\
    \ needed for plant growth and development,\ncooling crops, and providing transpiration\
    \ pull for the root\nsystem to absorb water and nutrients (Xie, 2017). The\napplications\
    \ of the relationship between the CWSI and T that\nwe\npresented\nmay\nrange\n\
    from\nprecision\ncrop\nirrigation\nmanagement to prediction yield and even more\
    \ ecologically\nbased studies. Lopez-Lopez et al. (2018) presented a water\nproduction\
    \ function for transpiration to estimate the yield of\nhard-shelled almonds, and\
    \ later, Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2019)\ncombined their ﬁndings with this function\
    \ to explore the\npossibility\nof\nestimating\nthe\nyield\nof\nalmond\norchards,\n\
    describing the predicted yield to the whole almond canopy\nscale\nthrough\ninterpolation.\n\
    In\nthe\ncontext\nof\nprecision\nagriculture, our ﬁndings suggest the promising\
    \ ability to\nachieve accurate estimation of alfalfa yield on a large scale.\n\
    5 CONCLUSION\nThis paper demonstrates that the CWSI is a suitable indicator of\n\
    alfalfa water status based on canopy temperature monitoring\nusing UAV-based infrared\
    \ thermal images. Our results can be\nsummarized as follows:\n1) The variability\
    \ of the CWSI and T for alfalfa was different\nunder various irrigation quotas.\
    \ Compared with CK, for each\nincrement of gradient (10 mm), the reduction of\
    \ the CWSI\nwas equivalent to 28.1% (57.9%), 54.4% (68.4%), and 70.2%\n(77.2%)\
    \ under the R (P) irrigation scheduling. Meanwhile, T\nincreased by 27.3% (51.6%),\
    \ 53.6% (60.2%), and 60.9%\n(66.0%) under R (P) irrigation scheduling.\n2) Alternate\
    \ partial root-zone drip irrigation was conﬁrmed as a\nwater-saving method and\
    \ ultimately saved 67.2, 18.4, and\n4.6% of water under the irrigation quotas\
    \ of 10 mm, 20 mm,\nand 30 mm, respectively. Ultimately, the P irrigation method\n\
    was recommended to meet plant water requirements for\nalfalfa in arid and semiarid\
    \ areas.\n3) The CWSI was negatively correlated with the SWC and T. The\nﬁtting\
    \ curve equations of the CWSI and T under the\nnutritional growth and reproductive\
    \ growth stages were\nexpressed as T = –1.02*CWSI + 1.31 (R2 = 0.83) and T =\n\
    –1.43*CWSI + 1.45 (R2 = 0.45), respectively. The applications\nof this relationship\
    \ may range from precision irrigation to\nyield prediction, and future study should\
    \ interpret the\nfeedback on alfalfa yield.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe\

  limitations: 'While the study provides valuable insights into the effects of automated
    irrigation management systems on alfalfa water and growth status, there are a
    few limitations to consider:


    1. **Limited scope of crop species**: The study focuses solely on alfalfa, and
    it is unclear whether the findings can be generalized to other crop species. Different
    crops may exhibit varying responses to irrigation management practices, and further
    research is needed to investigate the applicability of the proposed methods to
    a wider range of crops.


    2. **Data availability and quality**: The effectiveness of automated irrigation
    management systems relies heavily on the availability and quality of data. The
    study does not delve into the challenges of data collection and management, which
    can be significant in real-world scenarios. Future research should explore strategies
    to address data gaps, ensure data accuracy, and handle data variability.


    3. **Economic and environmental considerations**: The implementation of automated
    irrigation management systems involves costs associated with equipment, installation,
    and maintenance. The study does not explicitly discuss the economic viability
    of these systems or their potential environmental impacts. A comprehensive assessment
    of the costs and benefits, including water savings, energy consumption, and environmental
    implications, is necessary to determine the long-term feasibility of these systems.


    4. **Scalability and practical applicability**: The study is conducted on a relatively
    small scale, and it is unclear how the proposed methods can be scaled up to larger
    agricultural operations. Practical considerations, such as system design, infrastructure
    requirements, and farmer adoption, need to be addressed to ensure the widespread
    adoption of automated irrigation management systems.


    5. **Long-term monitoring and adaptation**: The study focuses on a single growing
    season, and it is unclear how the automated irrigation management system will
    perform over multiple seasons or in response to changing climatic conditions.
    Long-term monitoring and evaluation are crucial to assess the system''s resilience
    and ability to adapt to varying environmental factors.'

  analysis: 'This work demonstrates an extensive method for optimizing frequency of
    data collection at HTPP platforms, particularly  operated in non-controlled conditions.
    Dynamic changes in the ambient environment often result in noisy and redundant
    data,  thereby impeding efficiency of information extraction.  Hence,  an intuitive
    set of steps was thoroughly devised for denoising and  converting sensor data
    to ET time series. ARIMA modeling was  performed by changing the daily frequency
    of the entire time series  data set from 15 min to 180 min. It was found that
    there  was no single frequency at which all the forecast measures (AIC,  BIC and
    RMSE) yielded the best value. Rather, it was noticed  (based on only ARIMA modeling)
    that the optimal frequency lied  in the range of 15 min to 105 min. Similar inferences
    were  deduced based on classification performance measures as well.  The metrics
    from both the methods were used for estimating E  and CE at each frequency, and
    optimal sampling frequency was  identified such that redundancy and randomness
    was the  minimum at that frequency. It was finally concluded that a  sampling
    interval of 1 hour or 60 min might be sufficient for  desired information extraction
    from ET time series with reduced  noise in the observed data.  '

    \ \n \nABSTRACT: \n \nThis work is undertaken considering the significance of\
    \ functional phenotyping (primarily measured from continuous profiles of plant-\n\
    water relations) for crop selection purposes. High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping\
    \ (HTPP) platforms which largely employ state-of-\nthe-art sensor technologies\
    \ for acquisition of vast amount of field data, often fail to efficiently translate\
    \ sensor information into \nknowledge due to the major challenges of data handling\
    \ and processing. Hence, it is imperative to concurrently find a way for \ndissociating\
    \ noise from useful data. Additionally, another important aspect is understanding\
    \ how frequent should be the data collection, \nso that information is maximized.\
    \ This paper presents a novel approach for identifying the optimal frequency for\
    \ phenotyping \nevapotranspiration (ET) by assimilating results from both time\
    \ series forecast as well as classification models. Thus, at the optimal \nfrequency,\
    \ plant-water relations can not only be desirably predicted but genotypes can\
    \ also be classified based on the characteristics \nof their ET profiles. Consequently,\
    \ this will aid better crop selection, besides minimizing noise, redundancy, cost\
    \ and effort in HTPP \ndata collection. High frequency (15 min) ET time series\
    \ data of 48 chickpea varieties (with considerable genotypic diversity) collected\
    \ \nat the LeasyScan HTPP platform, ICRISAT is used for this study. Time series\
    \ forecast and classification is performed by varying \nfrequency up to 180 min.\
    \ Multiple performance measures of time series forecast and classification are\
    \ combined, followed by \nimplementation of entropy theory for sampling frequency\
    \ optimization. The results demonstrate that ET time series with a frequency \n\
    of 60 min per day potentially yield the optimum information.   \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION\
    \ \nA run-through of the High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping \n(HTPP) methods implemented\
    \ particularly in the last decade \nreveals the extensive use of Remote Sensing\
    \ (RS) in \ncharacterizing plant processes. Availability of a plethora of \nimaging\
    \ systems has facilitated anatomization of observable \nplant features (largely\
    \ morphological), while weather sensors \nhave effectuated detailed crop mapping\
    \ and modeling under \nvarying environmental conditions. The imaging systems can\
    \ vary \nfrom very close-range fixed digital cameras to space-borne \nsensors,\
    \ thereby covering leaf-level to farm-level details. \nSimilarly, weather data\
    \ can be collected from plant-level (i.e. \nmicroclimatic) to regional scales.\
    \ The opportunity to generate \ninsightful inferences from these data further\
    \ broadens with \nincreased frequency of data collection. However, despite the\
    \ \ntechnological developments thereof, an aspect of HTPP which \nstill remains\
    \ relatively less explored is that of plant physiology \ni.e. functional phenotyping\
    \ (Halperin et al, 2017; Gosa et al, \n2019) which relates to canopy-conductance\
    \ traits. Furbank, \nTester, 2011 have even quoted phenomics as ‘high-throughput\
    \ \nplant physiology’. \n \nThere are essentially two primary limitations which\
    \ impede the \nefficient utilization of HTPP for evaluating the differences in\
    \ \nplant water use capacities: 1. the difficulty to measure plant water \nuse\
    \ frequently, and 2. identifying the optimal frequency for \nsimultaneous measurement\
    \ of canopy-conductance traits. Vadez \net al, 2015 have addressed the first limitation\
    \ by enabling \nsimultaneous measurement of evapotranspiration (ET) under \nnon-controlled\
    \ environmental conditions, while the second is \naddressed in this paper. Time\
    \ series observations of ET are used \nto explore genotypic differences in the\
    \ canopy-conductance \ntraits, among 48 chickpea genotypes. The implications of\
    \ ET in \nunderstanding canopy-conductance is elaborated in Isard, \nBelding,\
    \ 1989 which asserts that “plant-water relations are \nmajorly studied from temporal\
    \ characterization of ET, since ET \nis the only one of the three principal transport\
    \ phenomena \nbetween the earth's surface and lower atmosphere (water vapour,\
    \ \nheat, and momentum flows) that can be measured directly”. \nHalperin et al,\
    \ 2017 have also reinforced the need for \n‘simultaneous and continuous monitoring\
    \ of water relations in \nthe soil–plant–atmosphere continuum’ (i.e. the ET profile\
    \ of each \nplant over time).  \n \nIt has been studied that pot experiments equipped\
    \ with \ngravimetric non-contact sensors (i.e. load cells) can be potentially\
    \ \nused for estimating field ET (Lu et al, 2018). Former functional \nHTPP studies\
    \ have utilized high frequency load cells data for \nranking plants with respect\
    \ to their drought tolerance and other \nphysiological characteristics (Granier\
    \ et al, 2006, Halperin et al, \n2017). Furthermore, although these sensors enable\
    \ evaluation of \nthe impact of soil hydraulic characteristics on irrigation \n\
    management strategies (Tolk et al, 2005) and HTPP of canopy-\nconductance traits\
    \ (Lazarovitch et al, 2006; Denich et al, 2010), \nthere has rarely been any mention\
    \ about optimizing the data \ncollection frequency at such platforms. Identification\
    \ of an \noptimum sampling frequency would not only prevent noise and \nredundancy\
    \ in raw data, but can also promulgate systematic crop-\nspecific irrigation scheduling.\
    \ Hence, this work is focused on \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry,\

    \ \n \n425\n \noptimizing the sampling frequency of load cells observations for\
    \ \nefficient categorization of chickpea genotypes in terms of ET. \n \nHigh frequency\
    \ ET time series exploited for this work was \nobtained from the LeasyScan HTPP\
    \ platform at ICRISAT, \nHyderabad, India which uses load cells to measure pot\
    \ weight at \na frequency of 15 minutes. Due to several extraneous influences,\
    \ \ndata generated in such platforms in non-controlled conditions \ntend to be\
    \ noisy. Hence, these data sets require adequate de-\nnoising (or pre-processing)\
    \ and relevant feature extraction, in \norder to facilitate precise distinction\
    \ in the characteristics of the \ndesired trait.  \n \nIn this work, a thorough\
    \ set of steps was adopted for the \nconversion of raw load cells time series\
    \ into interpretable ET \nprofiles, followed by multi-scale Autoregressive Integrated\
    \ \nMoving Average (ARIMA) modeling. The ARIMA based \nmodels were built for forecasting\
    \ each ET time series at \nfrequencies (interchangeably used with scales), ranging\
    \ from 15 \nmin to 180 min. The genotypes were clustered at the base \nfrequency\
    \ i.e. 15 min and classification accuracy was estimated \nfor each successive\
    \ frequency. Subsequently, a combined set of \nmetrics obtained from forecasting\
    \ as well as classification, was \nused for entropy-based optimization of sampling\
    \ frequency. The \ndetails of each step is presented in Section 2 and the \ncorresponding\
    \ results and description are elaborated in section 3.    \n \n2. MATERIALS AND\
    \ METHODOLOGY \n2.1 Materials \nFor this study, 4 replications of 48 chickpea\
    \ genotypes were \nphenotyped at the LeasyScan HTPP platform, ICRISAT-\nPatancheru\
    \ (17.5111° N, 78.2752° E). The platform is equipped \nwith Phenospex® 3D laser\
    \ scanners which traverse on top of the \nplants, and provide 3-D images (used\
    \ for canopy-growth trait \nanalysis, not covered in this paper) every 2 hours.\
    \ The total \ncapacity of LeasyScan is ~ 5000 plants, grown in sectors (unit of\
    \ \nanalysis) across the trenches of platform. For simultaneous \nphenotyping\
    \ of canopy-conductance traits, each sector is \nassociated with gravimetric sensors\
    \ (load cells) that measure \nweight of respective sectors every 15 minutes. The\
    \ whole system \noperates in non-controlled or open-environment conditions and\
    \ \nprovides HTPP data close to real field conditions (see Vadez et \nal, 2015\
    \ for details). The time series data set examined in this \nwork comprised load-cell\
    \ weights collected at every 15 minutes’ \ninterval, from 20th February to 6th\
    \ March 2017 i.e. 15 days.  The \nfollowing analysis was conducted by considering\
    \ the mean (of 4 \nreplications) time series of each variety. \n  \n2.2 Methodology\
    \ \n2.2.1 \nPre-processing:  \n \nThe complete pre-processing was done in two\
    \ stages. The first \nstage of pre-processing included de-noising load-cell values\
    \ to \nobtain ET time-series. In this step, pot weight values lying \nbeyond the\
    \ range of 60,000-100,000 grams were first discarded, \nas per the limits of the\
    \ experimental set-up (Vadez et al, 2015). It \nwas observed that there were both\
    \ phenomenon-based as well as \nlatent anomalies, which were removed independently.\
    \ The \nphenomenon-based anomalies were primarily caused due to \nintermittent\
    \ irrigation events which resulted in sudden rise and \ndrop in pot weight, after\
    \ the discharge of excess water. This \nresulted in sudden spikes in each of the\
    \ time series. Contrarily, \nabrupt changes in ambient environmental conditions,\
    \ besides \nsystem-generated noise comprised the latent anomalies. While \nthe\
    \ former anomalies needed complete removal from data, the \nlatter required meticulous\
    \ selection of the observations to be \nretained (i.e. due to ambient effects)\
    \ and the ones that should be \nremoved (i.e. system-generated and external noise).\
    \ Discrete \nwavelet transform (DWT) was implemented on each time series \nup\
    \ to the first three levels, and outliers in the coefficients of each \nlevel\
    \ were identified using boxplot procedure. The locations of \nthose outliers in\
    \ the DWT coefficients were retrieved, and the \ncorresponding observations were\
    \ removed from the dataset. \nThus, anomalous peaks from the raw data were eliminated.\
    \ The \nconsequent missing values were linearly interpolated, and their \ndifference\
    \ at lag 1 was calculated to get the ET time series at 15 \nminutes’ frequency,\
    \ for each plant.  \n \nThe next stage in pre-processing included computation\
    \ of \nreference ET i.e. Penman Monteith ET in mm/mm2/15 minutes \n[6] using the\
    \ weather variables, collected from the Campbell \nsensors, installed at the LeasyScan\
    \ platform. Reference ET \nvalues were used as a benchmark to analyse possible\
    \ \nabnormalities in the observed ET values of all the genotypes. The \nratios\
    \ of observed |ET| to reference ET were calculated for day-\ntime (solar radiation\
    \ greater than 0) and night-time (solar \nradiation equal 0). Every observation\
    \ which resulted in a ratio \nbeyond 1.0 and 1.5, for day- and night-time respectively,\
    \ was \nconsidered abnormal and consequently filtered out before \nsmoothing each\
    \ ET time series using the cubic spline method. \n \n2.2.2 \nMulti-scale ARIMA\
    \ Modeling: \n \nAuto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models \nare\
    \ used to explain a given time series in terms of its own past \nvalues, i.e.\
    \ its own lags, and the lagged forecast errors are used \nto forecast future values\
    \ (Ho, Xie, 1998). Here, ARIMA \nmodeling was performed to assess forecast ability\
    \ at different \nscales using different forecast metrics. However, ARIMA models\
    \ \nrequire the series to be stationary. Hence, the Augmented \nDickey-Fuller\
    \ test was executed prior to ARIMA modeling for \ninspecting the stationarity\
    \ of each time series (Cheung, Lai, \n1995). A linear trend in the time series\
    \ was identified due to the \ngrowth of plants during the later days and increased\
    \ water loss \n(through higher transpiration). The presence of trend resulted\
    \ in \na p-value greater than 0.05 for each time series. Hence, the first \ndifferenced\
    \ time series was used for modeling. Through this test, \nit was also identified\
    \ that majority of the time series were auto-\ncorrelated only till lag 12 i.e.\
    \ 180 minutes. Therefore, multi-\nscaling was done by reducing the frequency of\
    \ each time series \nby 15 minutes i.e. the interval of data points was increased\
    \ from \n15 minutes (originally) to 30, 45, 60, …, 180 minutes, through \naggregation\
    \ as suggested in Wu et al, 2013.  \n \nThe entire data set was converted into\
    \ 12 consecutive scales, with \nan interval of 15 min between each.  Subsequently,\
    \ in order to \nassess the forecast ability at each scale the ARIMA model was\
    \ \nused, and a unique model was built for ET time series of each \nplant. The\
    \ auto.arima function in R was implemented for \nselecting the best fit model\
    \ for each time series, and prediction \nwas performed on the last 5 days (the\
    \ initial 10 days were used \nfor training). The corresponding Akaike Information\
    \ Criterion \n(AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Root Mean \nSquare\
    \ Error (RMSE) for each model at each sampling frequency \nwere then retrieved\
    \ (Tsay, 1984). While AIC denotes the out-of-\nsample prediction error, BIC measures\
    \ the trade-off between \nmodel fit and complexity of the model, and RMSE represents\
    \ the \nabsolute fit of the model (i.e. how close is predicted value to the \n\
    observed value). The mean AIC, BIC and RMSE across all the \nmodels (one per plant)\
    \ were retained as the representative \nprediction measures per frequency. \n\

    \ \n \n426\n \nIn this study, there was insufficient prior information about the\
    \ \nclass a particular genotype belongs to, as well as the number of \nclasses\
    \ inherently present in the data. Therefore, an optimal \nnumber of clusters was\
    \ first identified from the 15 min interval \nET time series using Silhouette\
    \ method (Rousseeuw, 1987). It \nwas found that the data set could be optimally\
    \ segregated into \nthree groups. This was followed by feature-based time series\
    \ \nclustering, since time series features are known to be more \ninformative\
    \ and offer better representation of the data than the \nraw time series (Laurinec,\
    \ 2018). Features also help in \nsignificantly reducing the time series dimensionality,\
    \ besides \nemphasising the fundamental characteristics that are most \ninstrumental\
    \ in delineating the differences among samples (here, \nthe genotypes).  \n \n\
    Time series features can be extracted using different methods e.g. \nnondata adaptive,\
    \ data adaptive, model based and data dictated \n(Laurinec, 2018). While the nondata\
    \ adaptive methods transform \nevery time series using the same parameters, irrespective\
    \ of the \ncharacteristic differences between them, the parameters of data \n\
    adaptive transformations vary according to each data series. In \ndata dictated\
    \ methods, a compression ratio (Aghabozorgi et al, \n2015) is defined per time\
    \ series. However, model based methods \nassume that each observed time series\
    \ is based on a basic model, \nand every two time series which could be explained\
    \ by the same \nmodel parameters are similar. For this study, model based feature\
    \ \nextraction was implemented; the parameters obtained from \nARMA models were\
    \ used as features for clustering the time \nseries (Xiong, Yeung, 2002; Otranto,\
    \ 2008). Unsupervised \nRandom Forest (Shi, Horvath, 2005) method was employed\
    \ for \nobtaining the cluster indices, subsequently used as class labels for \n\
    estimating the supervised Random Forest based classification \nperformance measures;\
    \ accuracy (in percentage), F1-score \n(harmonic mean of precision and recall),\
    \ sensitivity (the true-\npositive rate) and normalized ZeroOneLoss (each correct\
    \ \nclassification has loss=0, and incorrect classification has loss=1), \nat\
    \ each scale.   \n \nThus, the cluster-then-label approach to multi-class classification\
    \ \n(de Sa, V.R., 1994; Nguyen, Smeulders, 2004; Nilashi et al, \n2017) was included\
    \ as a part of the procedure for optimizing the \nsampling frequency. The four\
    \ classification metrics, calculated \non test data (30% of the total samples,\
    \ selected randomly) were \ncoalesced with the AIC, BIC and RMSE estimates obtained\
    \ from \nthe previous step. Thus, the data set used for entropy-based \noptimization\
    \ (see next section) was a table with seven attributes \nper scale, representative\
    \ of the respective forecast ability as well \nas classification performance.\
    \ \n \n2.2.4 \nEntropy-based Frequency Optimization: \n \nEntropy (E) per frequency\
    \ (Equation 1) was calculated from the \nvector of performance attributes (as\
    \ detailed in the previous \nsection), followed by computation of conditional\
    \ entropy (CE) \nbetween the base frequency and every other successive frequency\
    \ \n(Equation 2). E and CE were calculated as proposed in Kullback, \n1997 and\
    \ Karamouz et al, 2009. While E enabled estimation of \nthe average amount of\
    \ information (pertaining to forecasting and \nclassification performance) at\
    \ each frequency, CE was \nincorporated as the measure of redundancy in the information\
    \ \n(between each frequency and the base frequency). Thus, each \nfrequency level\
    \ was associated with its respective information \nmeasures, leveraged to define\
    \ the cost (or objective) function for \noptimization. The objective of the study\
    \ was to minimize \nredundancy between two frequency levels, and ensure low \n\
    entropy (i.e. less randomness) at individual scale. Hence, the \nobjective function\
    \ was defined as shown in Equation 3. \n \n\U0001D43B(\U0001D466) = − ∑ \U0001D45D\

    \ \nwas minimum. This procedure was therefore, similar to the \nimplementation\
    \ of internal cluster validation optimization \nmethods (Bezdek, Pal, 1995; Gajawada\
    \ et al, 2012) used in \nmachine \nlearning. \nThe \nreportedly \nrobust \nNelder-Mead\
    \ \noptimization procedure (Singer, Nelder, 2009) was implemented \nusing the\
    \ optim function in R (R, core team, 2013).  \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\
    3.1 Pre-processing \nThe raw time series data from each load cell contained both\
    \ \nmissing as well as erroneous observations (Fig. 1a). The \nextremely anomalous\
    \ values were removed and the remaining \nobservations (Fig. 1b) were used to\
    \ generate the ET time series. \nFig. 1b also shows the efficacy of using DWT\
    \ in identifying the \nspikes in the data set. In this step, the objective was\
    \ to devise a \nbasic set of methods to systematically transform raw data into\
    \ \ntemporal profiles (i.e. pre-processing) of plant responses. Hence, \nafter\
    \ complete pre-processing of the raw data, ET time series of \nfew genotypes were\
    \ compared for visual inspection (Fig. 2).  \n \nThe chickpea genotypes used for\
    \ this analysis either belonged to \nwild, cultivated or check varieties. There\
    \ were also some \ngenotypes which were expected to have high transpiration \n\
    efficiency (TE), while another set of genotypes had low TE. Fig. \n2 compares\
    \ the ET profiles of three different varieties from the \nhigh (G22, blue), low\
    \ TE (G32, red) and the wild types (G1, \npurple), with reference ET (green) as\
    \ a theoretical baseline. \nReference ET represented the maximum possible water\
    \ loss \nunder the given environmental conditions, and the genotypic ET \nprofiles\
    \ were quite lower since the plants were at the very initial \ngrowing stages\
    \ with smaller canopy sizes (hence, lesser stomatal \nwater loss). The overlaid\
    \ plot of reference ET also shows the \nconsistency of pre-processing results,\
    \ under the same ambient \nconditions. The practically more important result was\
    \ however, \nthe visually discernible differences among the ET observations. \n\
    In the following steps, the differences in ET are segregated \nthrough clustering,\
    \ and classification performance is assessed at \ndifferent sampling frequencies.\

    \ last five days of the series at 15 \nmin interval and a confidence interval\
    \ of 95%. The predicted \nvalues were found to lie quite close to the original\
    \ values, thereby \nensuring acceptable performance of the selected models. \n\
    Furthermore, normalized values of the forecast metrics (Table 1), \nAIC, BIC and\
    \ RMSE revealed the best predictability at 15 min \nscale. However, prediction\
    \ RMSE was found to be lowest at 60 \nmin scale. While a remarkable increase in\
    \ RMSE was noticed \nonly after the 105 min scale, AIC and BIC were found to have\
    \ \nconsiderably large estimates only after 60 min scale. Thus, the \nresults\
    \ (as per time series forecast performance) implied that, the \noptimal sampling\
    \ frequency could lie between 15 min to 105 min. \nThe relevance of considering\
    \ these three metrics for time series \nmodel selection have been affirmed in\
    \ several other studies as \nwell (Atkinson et al, 2012; Boroojeni et al, 2017).\
    \ This study \nhowever, includes these performance measures to compare \nmodel\
    \ prediction at different scales.  \nFigure 3. ET time series decomposition plot\

    \ objective of this work was also to enable \ndelineation of differences among\
    \ the varieties with respect to the \ndifferences in their ET profiles. However,\
    \ discrete segregation of \nthe ET time series feature space required prior label\
    \ information. \nHence, cluster indices at 15 min scale were used for \nclassification.\
    \ The separation between clusters is shown on the \nfirst and second dimensions\
    \ of the Multidimensional Scaling \n(MDS) plot (Fig. 6a). Additionally, the differences\
    \ between the \naverage ET profiles of each cluster is plotted in Figure 6b, which\
    \ \nclearly identifies that water loss due to ET is the least in Cluster \n1 and\
    \ highest in Cluster 3.  \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote\

    428\nIn Table 2 the normalized values of classification performance \nmeasures\
    \ are given which indicate that maximum classification \naccuracy was achieved\
    \ at 15, 60 and 105 min scales while the F1-\nscore is highest at 60 and 165 min.\
    \ The true-positive rate was \nfound to be consistently high only until 60 min\
    \ scale beyond \nwhich it started fluctuating. Finally, ZeroOneLoss was also found\
    \ \nto be the least at 60 min and 105 min scales. Thus, the intuitive \ninference\
    \ about the optimal sampling frequency obtained from an \noverall examination\
    \ of the classification measures coincided with \nthat of the time series forecast\
    \ measures. These results also state \nthe need to examine several classification\
    \ performance metrics, \nsince conclusions differ with different metrics i.e.\
    \ performance \ncannot be completely ascertained with a single metric, \nparticularly\
    \ in case of imbalanced datasets (Ferri et al, 2009). The \nclassification measures\
    \ leveraged in this work are local measures \ni.e. these are estimated considering\
    \ the frequency of each class\nknown to have low sensitivity to class noise (Ferri\
    \ et al, 2009).\nFigure 6. MDS plot genotypic clusters (a) and average ET time\
    \ \nseries of each cluster (b) \nFigure 7. Levelplot of the time series classification\
    \ metrics \n(Accuracy, F1_score, Sensitivity, ZeroOneLoss) across the entire \n\
    range of frequencies \n3.4 Entropy-based Frequency Optimization \nThe proposed\
    \ optimization procedure aims to identify a suitable \nfrequency for HTPP data\
    \ collection at which both time series \npredictability as well genotype classification\
    \ performance is \nhigh. Hence, the combined set of metrics from both the methods\
    \ \nwere used to compute Entropy (E) and Conditional Entropy (CE) \nper frequency\
    \ level (or scale). Subsequently, Function Value \n(FV) at each scale was calculated\
    \ as per Equation 3. The variation \nin E, CE and FV is represented in Fig. 8,\
    \ for the entire range of \nfrequency examined in this work. The optimal frequency\
    \ (at \nwhich FV is closest to the optimal value, obtained from the \nNelder-Mead\
    \ algorithm) was found to be 60 min, at which both \nE and CE were quite low.\
    \ Furthermore, an overall inspection of \nE and CE implied that beyond the 150\
    \ min scale, randomness was \nhigher and redundancy was lower. Thus, it was inferred\
    \ that \nobserved data would tend to be more random (insufficient) and \nthe cyclic\
    \ ET patterns will be less predictable if data collection \nfrequency is less\
    \ than 150 min.  \nFigure 8. Levelplot of Entropy (E), Conditional Entropy (CE)\
    \ and \nFunction Value (FV) across the entire range of frequencies \n4.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\
    This study demonstrated an extensive method for optimizing \nfrequency of data\
    \ collection at HTPP platforms, particularly \noperated in non-controlled conditions.\
    \ Dynamic changes in the \nambient environment often result in noisy and redundant\
    \ data, \nthereby impeding efficiency of information extraction.  Hence, \nan\
    \ intuitive set of steps was thoroughly devised for denoising and \nconverting\
    \ sensor data to ET time series. ARIMA modeling was \nperformed by changing the\
    \ daily frequency of the entire time \nseries data set from 15 min to 180 min.\
    \ It was found that there \nwas no single frequency at which all the forecast\
    \ measures (AIC, \nBIC and RMSE) yielded the best value. Rather, it was noticed\
    \ \n(based on only ARIMA modeling) that the optimal frequency lied \nin the range\
    \ of 15 min to 105 min. Similar inferences were \ndeduced based on classification\
    \ performance measures as well. \nThe metrics from both the methods were used\
    \ for estimating E \nand CE at each frequency, and optimal sampling frequency\
    \ was \nidentified such that redundancy and randomness was the \nminimum at that\
    \ frequency. It was finally concluded that a \nsampling interval of 1 hour or\
    \ 60 min might be sufficient for \ndesired information extraction from ET time\
    \ series with reduced \nnoise in the observed data.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe\

- analysis: 'Daily ETo in 1-, 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead scenarios is forecasted at
    30 sites in nine climate regions across the CONUS, using three AI models (WLSTM,
    WGMDH, and WGAANFIS) with three input configurations. In the first configuration,
    only Rs is input to the models given its strongest correlation with ETo. In the
    second configuration, the inputs are Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm. The input variables for
    the third configuration are Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, and RH. The results of the models
    are compared against ETo data from the FPM equation. The training phase is from
    2005 to 2014, and the forecasting phase is from 2015 to 2019.


    The third input configuration generates the most accurate results in more than
    90% of the study sites. The WLSTM in this configuration is the best model for
    forecasting 1-day-ahead ETo, with RMSE = 0.541 mm/d, NS = 0.946, and R = 0.973
    for the forecasting phase. The WGMDH outperforms the WLSTM and WGAANFIS for 3-,
    7-, and 10-day-ahead ETo forecasting with RMSE = 0.636, 0.649, and 0.651 mm/d;
    NS = 0.925, 0.922, and 0.921; and R = 0.962, 0.961 and 0.961, respectively.


    All the three AI models exhibit their best performances in the NW and W climate
    regions, which exhibit the strongest correlation between Rs and ETo. The accuracy
    of the models decreases in the S climate region with the weakest correlation occurs
    between Rs and ETo. Deep learning models are superior to the WGAANFIS model in
    all the seasons. The lowest Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm and highest RH values are observed
    in winter. Accordingly, winter corresponds to the best ETo forecasts with the
    lowest RMSE and highest NS and R compared to the other seasons. The worst performance
    of the models is observed in summer because ETo peaks in this season owing to
    the high Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm values, and the AI models cannot robustly capture
    these peak values.


    We used limited meteorological variables (i.e., Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, and RH) to forecast
    ETo. Therefore, the results are applicable to areas where weather stations can
    not be installed due to topographic restrictions and/or some sensors (e.g., wind
    speed sensors) are not accessible. Future studies can be aimed at applying other
    algorithms such as gradient-based optimizer, whale optimization, billiards-inspired
    optimization, Harris hawks optimization, and darts game optimizer algorithms to
    forecast ETo. Hybridization of these methods with DWT and CWT can also be considered
    to improve their performance. Finally, the outcomes of the new innovative models
    can be compared with those of the proposed models.'

  description: 'The daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) must be accurately forecasted
    to improve real-time irrigation scheduling and decision-making for water resources
    allocation. In this study, multi-step (i.e., 1, 3, 7, and 10)-ahead daily ETo
    at 30 sites is forecasted using three hybrid machine learning approaches: wavelet
    long short-term memory (WLSTM), wavelet group method of data handling (WGMDH),
    and wavelet genetic algorithm-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (WGA-ANFIS).
    The 30 sites are chosen to sample nine climate regions across the contiguous United
    States. Three input scenarios are considered. This study emphasizes on forecasting
    ETo using limited meteorological variables. In the first scenario, we consider
    only solar radiation (Rs) as the input variable owing to the largest correlation
    coefficient (R) between ETo and Rs compared with the other meteorological variables
    in most of the study sites. In the second scenario, in addition to Rs, the daily
    maximum (Tx), minimum (Tn), and mean (Tm) air temperatures are used. The input
    variables for the third scenario are Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, and the relative humidity
    (RH). Data pertaining to 2005–2014 and 2015–2019 are used for the training and
    forecasting phases, respectively. The model forecasts are compared against ETo
    estimates from the Penman–Monteith (PM) equation. The third input scenario yields
    the most accurate results based on the average over all the study sites. In this
    input scenario, the WLSTM outperforms the other models for 1-day-ahead ETo forecasting
    in terms of the 30-site average root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.541 mm/d, Nash–Sutcliffe
    coefficient (NS) = 0.946, and R = 0.973. In contrast, WGMDH outperforms WLSTM
    and WGAANFIS for 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead ETo forecasting with RMSEs of 0.636,
    0.649, and 0.651 mm/d; NS of 0.925,0.922, and 0.921; and R of 0.962, 0.961, and
    0961, respectively. The highest performances of all models are observed in the
    Northwest and West climate regions, which exhibit the strongest correlation between
    Rs and ETo. The accuracy decreases in the South climate region with the weakest
    correlation between Rs and ETo. The lowest values of Rs, Tn, Tx, and Tm and highest
    RH are observed in winter. Consequently, among the seasons, the minimum RMSE (highest
    NS and R) is observed in winter. The worst performance of the models is observed
    in summer, which involves the highest values of Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm. The deteriorated
    performance of the models in warm months is attributable to the high ETo values,
    as the models cannot accurately capture the peaks of ETo. Deep learning models
    (i.e., WLSTM and WGMDH) yield more accurate ETo forecasts and can thus facilitate
    agricultural water management and irrigation scheduling.'

    conjugate 1. Introduction Population growth and climate change have compelled
    scientists to identify efficient methods for producing sufficient amounts of food
    for humans, while consuming less water (Lucas et al., 2020). In this context,
    the daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) must be accurately forecasted to
    facilitate real-time irrigation planning and improved decision-making for water
    resources allocation (Ferreira and da Cunha, 2020). ETo forecasts have a key role
    in real-time decisions on water resources management by quantifying the prospective
    changes in agricultural and hydrological processes (Lucas et al., 2020, Ferreira
    and da Cunha, 2020). In fact, the accurate forecast of ETo has a vital importance
    in optimal irrigation scheduling, irrigation system design and management, crop
    yield simulation, and efficient water resources planning and management (Torres
    et al., 2011, Bachour et al., 2016). Likewise, a more efficient performance of
    irrigation systems depends on reliable forecasts of ETo and such forecasts should
    be far enough in the future to compensate for the travel time of the water supply.
    Real-time decisions on irrigation scheduling are mainly made based on the agricultural
    water demand, which strongly depends on ETo predictions. It is evident that feeding
    online irrigation apps with accurate ETo forecasts significantly improve their
    performance. Reliable ETo forecasts are required as the key inputs in the irrigation
    apps in order to 1) conserve water resources, 2) lower farmers’ cost of water
    and labor through optimizing irrigation events, 3) allow farmers to scheduling
    watering to minimize crop water stress and maximize yields, 4) reduce fertilizer
    costs by minimizing deep percolation (leaching), and finally 5) increase farmers’
    profit by enhancing crop yields and quality (Yin et al., 2020, Karbasi, 2018,
    Roy, 2021; Granata and Di Nunno 2021). Several researchers have used time-series
    and artificial intelligence (AI) models to forecast/estimate daily ETo (Kaya et
    al., 2021, Chia et al., 2021, Yan et al., 2021, Roy, 2021, Yin et al., 2020, Araghi
    et al., 2020, Lucas et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020, Roy et
    al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020, Yu et al., 2020, Ruiming and Shijie, 2020, Seifi
    and Riahi, 2020). However, studies focused on ETo forecasting are not as common
    as those on ETo estimation (Table S1) (Lucas et al., 2020, Ferreira and da Cunha,
    2020, Torres et al., 2011, Bachour et al., 2016, Yin et al., 2020, Karbasi, 2018,
    Roy, 2021). Among the limited studies on ETo forecasting, Lucas et al. (2020)
    forecasted the daily ETo at three study sites in Brazil using convolutional neural
    networks (CNN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The
    authors used the daily maximum (Tx) and minimum air temperatures (Tn), wind speed
    (WS), relative humidity (RH), and solar radiation (Rs) as the input variables
    to estimate ETo and then they used ETo as an input variable for the models. Daily
    data pertaining to 1993–2011 and 2012–2015 were used in the training and forecasting
    phases, respectively. The results showed that ARIMA is more robust for 1-day-ahead
    ETo forecasting, whereas CNN is superior in the 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead scenarios.
    Ferreira and da Cunha (2020) applied long short-term memory (LSTM), an artificial
    neural network (ANN), a CNN, and a hybrid CNN– LSTM model (CNN–LSTM) to forecast
    the daily ETo at several sites in Brazil. The authors showed that the CNN–LSTM
    is superior to the other models for 1- and 2-day-ahead ETo forecasting, whereas
    the ANN is the best model for the lead time of 3–7 days. Yin et al. (2020) used
    Tx, Tn, and RH as the input variables for a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) framework
    and successfully forecasted the daily ETo at three sites in a semi-arid region
    in China. Karbasi (2018) forecasted the daily ETo in Iran by using the hybrid
    wavelet Gaussian process regression (WGPR) model. The WGPR was noted to outperform
    the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. Roy (2021) forecasted the 1-day-ahead
    ETo at a site in Bangladesh with subtropical climate by using LSTM and adaptive
    neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models. LSTM was noted to outperform ANFIS
    in the analyses. Using LSTM, Karbasi et al. (2022) successfully forecasted ETo
    in three meteorological stations in Iran from 2000 to 2019. They showed that LSTM
    has a higher accuracy in arid and semi-arid climates. Roy et al. (2022) forecasted
    5-day ahead ETo in two weather sites in Bangladesh using data from 2004 to 2020.
    They showed that LSTM outperforms ANFIS, support vector regression (SVR), M5 model
    tree (M5Tree), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), probabilistic linear
    regression (PLR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). For sustainable irrigation
    scheduling, Farooque et al. (2022) used LSTM to forecast daily ETo in three weather
    stations in Canada during 2011–2017. They found that LSTM ETo forecasts may help
    farmers, water resource managers, and irrigation planners with improved and sustainable
    water management and irrigation scheduling. Chia et al. (2022) forecasted monthly
    ETo in four weather stations in Malaysia over 2004–2017. They showed that LSTM
    performs better than SVR. Only three reports are available regarding the use of
    AI models for forecasting the daily ETo in the United States (US). Torres et al.
    (2011) applied the multivariate relevance vector machine (MRVM) and multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) models for a site in Utah (US). The authors used ETo data for
    2000–2005 and 2006–2009 in the training and forecasting phases, respectively.
    The results indicated that MLP outperformed MRVM for 1- and 3-day-ahead ETo forecasting,
    but MRVM achieved better results for the lead time of seven days. Bachour et al.
    (2016) successfully forecasted the daily ETo at the same site using the hybrid
    wavelet-MRVM (WMRVM) approach. Granata and Di Nunno (2021) applied a nonlinear
    autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) and LSTM to forecast ETo at
    two weather sites in southern Florida and central Nevada. ETo data for 2007–2010
    and 2011–2012 were used for training and forecasting, respectively. The results
    highlighted that LSTM outperformed NARX for all lead times (1–7 days). Table S1
    highlights that fewer than 10 study sites were selected in more than 80% of the
    studies focused on evaluating the daily ETo. In approximately 40% of the studies,
    only one site was considered as the study area. Although Ferreira and da Cunha
    (2020) tested their models at 53 sites, the sites represented only one climate
    region (i.e., subtropical), and only historical ETo data were used as the input
    variable. Many of the other studies also exhibited similar limitations regarding
    the considered climate regions. Fan et al. (2018) estimated the daily ETo at eight
    sites spanning five climate regions (i.e., subtropical, tropical, continental,
    monsoon, and plateau) of China. The authors demonstrated that the extreme gradient
    boosting (XGBoost) model obtained the most accurate daily ETo estimates (Table
    S1). However, their modeling period did not include the recent decade, especially
    the recent years (i.e., post-2016) in which more extreme hydrologic events have
    occurred owing to climate change (Donat et al., 2016, Almazroui et al., 2020,
    Valipour et al., 2020). Similar limitations regarding the simulation period were
    observed in the other studies. Deep learning models (Lucas et al., 2020, Chen
    et al., 2020, Ferreira and da Cunha, 2020, Yin et al., 2020, Roy, 2021; Granata
    and Di Nunno 2021) and ANFIS (Roy et al., 2020, Dou and Yang, 2018, Araghi et
    al., 2020, Tao et al., 2018, Unes et al., 2020, Zeinolabedini Rezaabad et al.,
    2020) have been frequently reported to be superior to other methods (as highlighted
    in the last column of Table S1, which specifies the best-performing models in
    the existing studies). Additionally, Table S1 shows that the group method of data
    handling (GMDH) has not been applied to forecast/estimate the daily ETo, even
    though Ashrafzadeh et al. (2020) reported that GMDH can forecast monthly ETo more
    precisely than ARIMA and SVM in a humid region in Iran. Raza et al. (2020) also
    highlighted the potential of GMDH is estimating the monthly ETo in Dixon Spring,
    US. The wavelet transform (Chia et al., 2021, Yan et al., 2021, Bachour et al.,
    2016, Araghi et al., 2020, Karbasi, 2018, Partal, 2016, Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh,
    2020) can be applied to effectively denoise time series. Moreover, the genetic
    algorithm (GA) (Wu et al., 2019, Yin et al., 2017) can increase the model accuracy.
    Therefore, in this study, the hybrid wavelet-LSTM (WLSTM), wavelet-GMDH (WGMDH),
    and wavelet-GA-ANFIS (WGAANFIS) models were used to forecast daily ETo. To address
    the abovementioned limitations, this study was aimed at 1) forecasting the daily
    ETo at 30 sites across the contiguous US (CONUS), which cover nine climate regions;
    2) testing the models over a sufficiently long period including recent years (i.e.,
    2005–2019) with more extreme events; and 3) using the daily Tx, Tn, mean air temperature
    (Tm), RH, WS, and Rs as inputs in addition to ETo. This study advances the literature
    in four major directions: 1) it used the WGMDH model to forecast ETo for 1, 3,
    7, and 10 days ahead using limited meteorological variables. To the best of our
    knowledge, no study has ever used WGMDH approach to forecast ETo, 2) it tested
    the models at 30 study sites across CONUS with different climate conditions. The
    existing studies forecasted ETo only at several sites at maximum, 3) three different
    input configurations were used to evaluate performance of models based on their
    inputs, and finally 4) it compared performance of WGMDH method with two commonly
    used approaches, namely WLSTM and WGAANFIS. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data
    We collected daily Tx, Tn, Tm, RH, WS, and Rs data at 30 sites in nine climate
    regions across the CONUS from 2005 to 2019 (15 years). In most of the existing
    studies, 65–70% and 30–35% of the data were used for training and testing the
    models, respectively (Ferreira and da Cunha, 2020, Zeinolabedini Rezaabad et al.,
    2020). Therefore, in this study, daily data pertaining to 2005–2014 (67%) and
    2015–2019 (33%) were used in the training and testing phases, respectively. The
    study sites were selected based on the data availability, while ensuring that
    at least three sites pertained to each climate region to comprehensively represent
    different climate conditions that can influence the ETo (Yang et al., 2021, Valipour
    et al., 2020, Kukal and Irmak, 2016). Fig. 1 shows the locations of the study
    sites in the nine climate regions across the CONUS. Table S2 lists the latitudes,
    longitudes, and altitudes of the study sites. The sites are located in 17 states,
    covering a wide range of altitudes from 3 m in Wilmington (DE) to 1812 m in Cortez
    (CO) (Table S2). Table 1 indicates the mean and standard deviation of the meteorological
    variables and ETo at the study sites. Rs changes from 11.24 MJ/m2/d (Mt. Vernon,
    WA) to 20.54 MJ/m2/d (Yuma Valley, AZ). Tx varies between 9.91 °C (Stephen, MN)
    and 31.21 °C (Yuma Valley, AZ). The lowest and highest Tn are observed in Bottineau,
    ND (−3.34 °C) and Mercedes, TX (17.74 °C), respectively. Bottineau and Mercedes
    exhibit the smallest Tm (3.38 °C) and largest Tm (23.04 °C), respectively. RH
    varies from 40.52% in Yama Valley (AZ) to 81.76% in Mt. Vernon (WA). ETo ranges
    between 1.81 mm/d in Mt. Vernon (WA) and 5.48 mm/d in Yuma Valley (AZ). Download

    1.36 In this study, we used meteorological data from different weather station
    networks (see Table S3). All of the utilized weather stations have been installed,
    operated, maintained and quality controlled by the governmental agencies. Due
    to the reliability and high quality of utilized data, they have been used in many
    studies. The California Department of Water Resources has maintained the quality
    and integrity of the California Irrigation Management Information System, CIMIS
    (Temesgen et al., 2005). Temesgen et al. (2005) used weather data from 37 CIMIS
    stations to compare performance of different reference evapotranspiration equations.
    Senay et al. (2008) evaluated the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)-based
    ETo estimates using data from the CIMIS. Daily CIMIS ETo data from 85 stations
    were compared with GDAS-based ETo at different spatial and temporal scales from
    2002 to 2006. Despite the large difference in spatial scale (CIMIS point vs. ∼
    GDAS 100 km grid cell) between the two datasets, the correlations between station-based
    evapotranspiration and GDAS-evapotranspiration were very high. Gocic and Trajkovic,
    2010, Gocic and Trajkovic, 2011 compared the performance of their ETo retrieval
    equations with that of the FPM equation at the CIMIS stations. Valiantzas (2013)
    tested the performance of his new ETo formula under various climatic conditions
    using daily ETo data from 12 CIMIS stations. Kohli et al. (2020) validated the
    ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS)
    ETo estimates with those obtained at five CIMIS sites in Riverside County, California.
    They found a strong correlation between CIMIS and ECOSTRESS ETo values at all
    five sites. The California Department of Water Resources developed statistical
    quality control criteria for assessing quality of CIMIS data. Finally, they generated
    datasets that pass this quality control (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/Resources.aspx).
    That is why CIMIS data have been widely used in many studies to verify different
    ETo products. Data from other weather station networks have also been widely used
    by different researchers. Using AZMET data, Dhungel et al. (2022) evaluated evapotranspiration
    for lettuce via an energy balance model. Kukal et al. (2020) used HPRCC data for
    the spatio-temporal calibration of the model developed by Hargreaves and Samani
    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to estimate ETo across United States High Plains.
    Pletcher et al. (2022) evaluated evapotranspiration with the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observations and in situ observations (i.e.,
    ICN) to understand water balance in Midwest agriculture. Awal et al. (2020) estimated
    ETo under limited climate data in West Texas using TAMAREC. Gonzalez Tapia et
    al. (2022) utilized AWN data to evaluate potato evapotranspiration and crop coefficients
    on five russet cultivars in the Columbia Basin of Washington State. Scarborough
    (2020) estimated crop evapotranspiration using a satellite remote sensing-based
    energy balance model and DEOS dataset. Grabow et al. (2008) evaluated evapotranspiration-based
    and soil-moisture-based irrigation control in turf using NCSCO data. Valipour
    and Guzmán (2022) identified the meteorological variables influencing ETo variability
    across Florida by using the FAWN database. Yu et al. (2020) indicated that both
    energetic (Tx, Tn, Tm, and Rs) and aerodynamic (RH and WS) variables must be considered
    to accurately estimate the daily ETo. Table S4 shows that ETo is strongly correlated
    with Rs, air temperature variables (i.e., Tx, Tm, and Tn), and RH at a confidence
    level of 95% in most of the study sites. In contrast, the correlation between
    ETo and WS in many sites is insignificant. The goal in this study is to use limited
    meteorological variables to forecast ETo. Thus, Rs, Tx, Tm, Tn, and RH were selected
    as the input variables of the WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGAANFIS models to forecast the
    daily ETo. We considered three input scenarios. Given that Rs had the strongest
    correlation with ETo in almost all the study sites, in the first scenario, only
    Rs was used as the input variable. In the second scenario, Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm
    were used, and in the third scenario, Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, and RH were used as the
    input variables. 2.2. Wavelet transform Wavelets, as a promising tool for signal
    processing, can be used to evaluate stationary and nonstationary data (Altunkaynak
    and Nigussie, 2015). The objective of wavelet transform is to produce time and
    frequency information with a higher resolution than that achievable using traditional
    transforms (Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015, Ni et al., 2020). Wavelet transform
    divides a signal into scaled and shifted versions of the mother wavelet. By effectively
    exploring, denoising, and smoothing time series, wavelet transforms can help improve
    the forecasting accuracy (Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015, He et al., 2015). Notably,
    wavelet transforms can be applied to separately compute different segments of
    the time-domain signal at various frequencies (Cobaner, 2013) and obtain a comprehensive
    time-scale representation of localized and transient phenomena that occur at different
    time scales (Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015). Furthermore, wavelet transforms
    can decompose the original data into sub-series at different resolutions (Altunkaynak
    and Nigussie, 2015, He et al., 2015) and clarify several aspects of data (i.e.,
    trends, breakdown points, and discontinuities) that other signal analysis methods
    cannot capture (Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015). A basic wavelet transform function
    can be expressed as (1) where is the mother wavelet, which is dilated and contracted
    to calculate as follows: (2) where a is a scale or frequency parameter that indicates
    dilation (a > 1) or contraction (a < 1), and b is a translation parameter interpreted
    as the shift of the wavelet transform function. Both a and b are real numbers
    (Cobaner, 2013, Ni et al., 2020). Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and discrete
    wavelet transform (DWT) are two commonly used wavelet transforms. The CWT of a
    signal (i.e., ζ(t)) can be formulated as (Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015) (3)
    where s is the scale parameter, is the translation parameter, and indicates the
    complex conjugate. CWT is designed to be applied to functions defined over the
    complete real axis and typically used to divide a continuous-time function into
    wavelets (Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2015). Consequently, CWT calculations are
    time and resource intensive and incur large computational costs. Unlike CWT, DWT
    deals with functions that are defined over a range of integer transforms. A DWT
    is an implementation of the wavelet transform using a discrete set of wavelet
    scales and translations obeying several defined rules (Altunkaynak and Nigussie,
    2015) and can be described as follows by modifying the wavelet representation:
    (4) where j and k are the control coefficients for wavelet dilation and translation,
    respectively. is a fixed dilation step, and is a translation parameter larger
    than zero. DWT decomposes the signal into mutually orthogonal set of wavelets,
    and thus, it incurs less computation time and is simpler to implement than the
    CWT (Cannas et al., 2006). In this study, DWT was employed to decompose the original
    time-series before they were input to the AI models. 2.3. LSTM model LSTM models,
    which are recurrent neural networks (RNNs), represent robust deep learning models
    (Ni et al., 2020). Unlike traditional ANNs, RNNs have a recurrent hidden unit
    that forms a self-looped cycle to implicitly maintain information regarding the
    history of all past elements in the time series (LeCun et al., 2015). RNNs can
    be interpreted as extremely deep networks with one layer per time step, with the
    same weights shared across time steps (Ni et al., 2020). The LSTM follows an RNN
    architecture with proven capability in analyzing and detecting the long-term dependencies
    of sequential data (Zhang et al., 2021). Generally, the LSTM modules can be classified
    into four fully connected neural network layers including forget, input, update,
    and output. For a given sequential input (x1, x2, …, xt), the forget layer controls
    the current information that will be kept or discarded using a sigmoid activation
    function (σ). The forget layer (ft) can be defined by the following equation (Fang
    et al., 2020): (5) ft = σ(Wf·[ht-1, xt] + bf) where Wf is the weight matrix of
    the forget layer, ht-1 indicates the hidden vector, and bf represents the bias
    of the forget layer. The input layer (it) decides which parameters should be updated.
    The update layer (ut) stores the new (updated) data. The input (it) and update
    (ut) layers are formulated as follows, respectively: (6) it = σ(Wi·[ht-1, xt]
    + bi) (7) ut = tanh(Wu·[ht-1, xt] + bu) where Wi and Wu are the weight matrices
    in the input and update layers, respectively. The bias vectors of input and update
    layers are shown by bi and bu, respectively. The output of input and update layers
    takes a value in the range of 0–1 and − 1–1, respectively (Skydt et al., 2020).
    (8) ht = ot ☉ tanh(ct) (9) ct = ft ☉ ct-1 + it ☉ ut (10) ot = σ(Wo ·[ht-1, xt]
    + bo) where denotes the element-wise product. ct and ct-1 are the new and previous
    cell state, respectively. Wo is the weight matrix and bo stands for the bias parameter.
    Although RNNs are powerful and dynamic systems, their implementation is challenging
    owing to the exploding gradient phenomenon. This issue can be resolved using LSTM.
    An LSTM replaces the ordinary recurrent hidden unit with a memory cell, in which
    the cell acts like a gated leaky neuron. The memory cell is connected to itself
    in the next step with a weight of one, but this self-connection is multiplicatively
    gated by another unit that learns to decide when to clear the content of the memory
    (Ni et al., 2020). In the LSTM model, the input gate decides the information to
    be used to update the cell state (Ct). The tanh layer creates a new candidate
    value that can be added to the state, and then, Ct is updated. The output gate
    controls the information of Ct that is otherwise completely transmitted to the
    new hidden state (Ni et al., 2020). 2.4. GMDH model GMDH was developed by Ivakhnenko
    (1970). It is a multivariable statistical approach for identifying the complex
    input-output relationship in nonlinear systems. GMDH is based on the nested forms
    of polynomials (i.e., quadratic and cubic). Basically, GMDH layers can be written
    as (Zahraie et al., 2017, Ashrafzadeh et al., 2020, Aghelpour and Varshavian,
    2020): (10) where is the output variable, is the ith input variable, is the total
    number of input variables, is the weight associated with , and is the initial
    weight. Each layer is a collection of input processing elements (i.e., nodes),
    and the output of each layer is considered as a new input to the next layer. The
    direction of information flow is only from the first layer to the last layer.
    The weights are optimized by using the least-squares method to obtain the minimum
    residual between the observations and the output values generated by GMDH. GMDH
    optimization process is as follows: The network determines input variables that
    are relevant to the system. Then, the model is built up layer by layer during
    the training phase. The output of each neuron is a quadratic/cubic function of
    both input variables. The parameters of the quadratic/cubic functions are calculated
    by a linear regression method. The former layer is trained before adding a new
    layer. During the training phase, for each unique configuration of two inputs,
    a neuron is trained and based on selection criteria, the best performing neurons
    are chosen. In the next step, a new layer is added, and the training phase is
    performed again on the new layer. The process of adding new layers is terminated
    when a stopping criterion is met (Onwubolu, 2015, Aghelpour and Varshavian, 2020,
    Water et al., 2000). GMDH is a multivariable statistical method that can identify
    the complex input–output relationship in nonlinear systems. GMDH is based on the
    nested forms of quadratic and cubic polynomials. Each layer in the framework is
    composed of input processing elements (nodes). The output of each layer is considered
    a new input for the next layer (Ashrafzadeh et al., 2020). GMDH is an inductive
    self-organizing algebraic model as it does not require the a priori model between
    the inputs and output(s). Instead, GMDH automatically learns the relation between
    the predictors and predictand(s) during the training process. The optimal network
    structure is tuned to minimize the difference between the desired and network
    outputs. Moreover, GMDH eliminates unnecessary nodes from the network. Therefore,
    GMDH has a high generalization ability and can reflect the complexity of nonlinear
    systems within a simple and stable network (Assaleh et al., 2009). 2.5. GAANFIS
    model 2.5.1. Architecture of ANFIS The ANFIS model is a neuro-fuzzy approach that
    was developed by Jang (1993). There are two kinds of learning algorithms to optimize
    the parameters of nodes during the training phase. For simplicity, it is assumed
    that ANFIS has two input variables, x and y, and one output z. The ANFIS structure
    contains two fuzzy if-then rules of Takagi and Sugeno’s type (Li and Su, 2010,
    Takagi and Sugeno, 1984), Rule 1: If (x is A1) and (y is B1) then (f1 = p1x + q1y + r1),
    Rule 2: If (x is A2) and (y is B2) then (f2 = p2x + q2y + r2), where Ai and Bi
    are the fuzzy sets, fi is the output from the fuzzy rule. {pi, qi, ri} are the
    modifiable parameters that are optimized during the training phase. The node functions
    of each layer of ANFIS are briefly described below, Layer 1: Every node i in this
    layer is a adaptive with a node function, (12) where is the input to node i, represents
    the linguistic label associated with this node function, and is the membership
    function of . Generally, is chosen to be bell-shaped (Eq. 13) or gauss-shaped
    (Eq. 14) with maximum equal to 1 and minimum equal to 0, (13) or (14) where {ai,
    bi, ci} are labeled as premise parameters. Layer 2: Every node in this layer is
    a fixed node, and acts as a simple multiplier. The outputs of these nodes are
    given by (15) which are the so-called firing strengths of the rules. Layer 3:
    In this layer, the ith node calculates the ratio of the ith rule’s firing strength
    to the sum of all rules’ firing strengths, (16) ̅ Layer 4: Every node in this
    layer is adaptive with a function, (17) ̅ ̅ where ̅ is the output of layer 3,
    and {pi, qi, ri} are referred to as consequent parameters. Layer 5: In this final
    layer, the single node is a fixed node labeled as ,which computes the overall
    output as the sum of all incoming signals, i.e., (18) ̅ There are two modifiable
    parameter sets, {ai, bi, ci} (labeled as premise parameters) and {pi, qi, ri}
    (labeled as consequent parameters). The aim of the training algorithm is to tune
    the above two parameter sets to make the ANFIS output matches measurements. Each
    epoch of this hybrid learning procedure is composed of two passes: a forward pass
    and a backward pass. In the forward pass, premise parameters are fixed and the
    sequential least squares estimation is applied to identify consequent parameters.
    In the backward pass, the consequent parameters are fixed, the error rate of output
    node back propagates from output end toward the input end, and the premise parameters
    are updated by the gradient method. This hybrid algorithm is proved to be highly
    efficient in training the ANFIS (Jang, 1993). 2.5.2. GA GAs are stochastic optimization
    methods developed based on the idea of “survival of the fittest” and “natural
    selection” (Huang et al., 2019). Compared to other stochastic search methods,
    GAs are well-suited for discontinuous and multi-modal functions even in noisy
    environments, which make them robust and effective (Yin et al., 2017). The GA
    repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the GA
    selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses
    them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations,
    the population “evolves” toward an optimal solution. GA uses three main types
    of operators to find an optimum solution (Li and Su, 2010): Selection: selects
    the individuals (called parents) that contribute in the next generation of populations.
    There are several operators used for selecting the individuals for the next generation.
    Crossover: combines two parents to form new children for the next generation.
    Mutation: applies a sudden change to individual parents to create new children.
    This operator increases prevents the algorithm to trap in local optima. 2.5.3.
    Hybrid GAANFIS In GAANFIS, the inputs of each layer are selected based on their
    importance for simulating the output variable. Instead of a regular linear space
    partitioning, the subtractive clustering method is introduced to optimize the
    rules for each fuzzy sub-model. The parameters of subtractive clustering, which
    control the number of ANFIS fuzzy rules, are often determined by trial and error
    that may result in suboptimal parameters (Unes et al., 2020). In this study, the
    clustering parameters are optimized by the GA. During the global optimization,
    ANFIS is called for evaluating the fitness value of any candidate solution generated
    by GA. The objective function of GA is used to minimize the error of ANFIS results.
    After the subtractive clustering parameters are settled, ANFIS optimizes the parameters
    in the antecedent and consequent parts of each sub-model. Therefore, the parameters
    of the final ANFIS model are optimized, and the so-called GAANFIS method shows
    an enhanced performance (Li and Su, 2010). Karaboga and Kaya (2019) evaluated
    the performance of ten optimization algorithms to improve the ANFIS predictions.
    The GA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were noted to be the most
    efficient in increasing the accuracy of ANFIS. Therefore, in this study, the GA
    was used to tune the hyperparameters of ANFIS to improve its output. In general,
    the GA is inspired by the natural selection mechanism, a biological process in
    which a stronger individual is most likely to be the winner in a competitive environment.
    The GA uses a direct analogy of natural evolution to perform global optimization
    for solving highly complex problems (Ravi et al., 2011). It presumes that the
    potential solution of a problem is unique and represented by a set of different
    parameters that are considered to be the genes of a chromosome and may be structured
    through a string of concatenated values (Ravi et al., 2011). ANFIS involves consequent
    and premise parameter that are adjusted throughout the network learning process.
    Unfortunately, this model may converge to a local minimum when solving complex
    problems. To solve this problem, in this study, the GA was applied to optimize
    the ANFIS hyperparameters. We trained ANFIS using a hybrid learning algorithm
    involving backpropagation gradient descent and the least-squares method. To determine
    the optimal ANFIS membership function, the numbers of input membership functions
    and training epochs were changed (Moayedi and Rezaei, 2020). The genetic learning
    algorithm tuned the membership functions of a Sugeno type fuzzy inference system
    via the training input–output data. In GAANFIS, every epoch was composed of forward
    and backward passes. In the forward pass, a training set of input patterns was
    fed to the GAANFIS controller. The outputs of the neurons were computed on a layer-by-layer
    basis, and the consequent parameters were identified using the least-squares estimator
    (Ravi et al., 2011). The optimal values of the neuro-fuzzy controller were determined
    using the GA. All possible sets of controller parameter values were adjusted to
    minimize the objective function. For the GAANFIS controller design, a stable closed
    loop system was considered (Ravi et al., 2011). Fig. 2 illustrates the method
    used in this study, and Table 2 lists the characteristics of the best models for
    forecasting the daily ETo. For WLSTM, we tested different “Activation functions
    to update the cell and hidden state” and “Activation functions applied to the
    gates” at four sites, namely Safford, Yuma Valley, Ault, and Cortez (see Tables
    S5-S7). As indicated, utilizing Tanh as the “Activation function to update the
    cell and hidden state” and Sigmoid as the “Activation function applied to the
    gates” generated the best results.” Hence, we used them at all the 30 sites. Download

    the number of hidden units, number of epochs, and number of epochs for dropping
    the learning rate were varied over the range of 1–1000, 1–10000, and 1–5000, respectively.
    It was found the number of hidden units, epochs, and epochs for dropping the learning
    rate of respectively 20, 2000, and 125 yielded the best results (Table 2). Also,
    we used three optimizer solvers (i.e., adam, sgdm, and rmsprop) for the training
    network. The Adam solver generated the most accurate ETo forecasts. In addition,
    we tested three functions (namely, Tanh, ReLu, and Sigmoid) for the “Activation
    function to update the cell and hidden state” and “Activation function applied
    to the gates”. Using Tanh as the “Activation function to update the cell and hidden
    state” and Sigmoid as the “Activation function applied to the gates” yielded the
    best results (Table 2). For WGMDH, the number of delays, number of neurons in
    each layer, number of layers, number of epochs, size of mini-batch, and number
    of epochs for dropping the learning rate were changed over the range of 1–100,
    1–1000, 1–200, 1–10000, 1–500, and 1–300, respectively. The best values for the
    abovementioned hyperparameters were listed in Table 2. Finally, for WGAANFIS,
    the number of iterations, population size, number of epochs, number of mutants,
    number of parents, and number of clusters were varied within the range of 1–1000,
    1–400, 1–10000, 1–100, 1–100, 1–100, and 1–100, respectively, and their optimum
    values were reposted in Table 2. The rest of the parameters were chosen based
    on the default values in the MATLAB software (Table 2). In general, irrigation
    scheduling is typically based on 1-day- to 10-day-ahead forecasting. Shorter periods
    (1–7 days) are typically considered for irrigation system planning and power consumption
    optimization. Longer forecast horizons (i.e., up to 10 days) are valuable for
    the management of reservoir and irrigation channel in irrigated farms (Lucas et
    al., 2020). Thus, in this study, we forecasted the daily ETo in 1-, 3-, 7-, and
    10-day-ahead scenarios. 2.6. Estimation of reference evapotranspiration Daily
    meteorological variables from the 30 study sites were incorporated in the Food
    and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)-Penman–Monteith (FPM)
    equation to estimate the daily ETo. The FPM equation can be expressed as follows
    (Allen et al., 1998): (19) where ETo is the daily reference evapotranspiration
    (mm/d), Rn is the net radiation (MJ/m2/d), G is the soil heat flux (MJ/m2/d),
    γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa/℃), es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    ea is the actual vapor pressure (kPa), Δ is the slope of the saturation vapor
    pressure–temperature curve (kPa/℃), T is the daily air temperature (℃), and u
    is the daily WS at 2 m (m/s). 2.7. Statistical metrics The accuracy of WLSTM,
    WGMDH, and WGAANFIS were evaluated using six statistical metrics, i.e., the root
    mean square error (RMSE), Nash-–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), correlation coefficient
    (R) coefficient of determination (R2), Bias, and General Performance Index (GPI)
    defined as follows (Camargo and Sentelhas, 1997, Bachour et al., 2016, Yin et
    al., 2020, Abreu et al., 2021, Roy, 2021, Ojo and Ogunjo, 2022): (20) (21) ̅ (22)
    ̅ ̅ ̅ ̅ (23) ̅ ̅ ̅ ̅ (24) (25) where is the ith estimated reference evapotranspiration
    from the FPM equation (Eq. 19); is the ith forecasted reference evapotranspiration
    from the WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGAANFIS models; ̅ is the mean of the estimated reference
    evapotranspiration from FPM (Eq. 19); ̅ is the mean of the forecasted reference
    evapotranspiration from the WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGAANFIS models; and N is the number
    of data points. The GPI is classified in seven categories: GPI ≥ 0.850, 0.760 ≤ GPI
    < 0.850, 0.660 ≤ GPI < 0.760, 0.610 ≤ GPI < 0.660, 0.510 ≤ GPI < 0.610, 0.410 ≤ GPI
    < 0.510, and GPI < 0.410 as excellent, very good, good, median, bearable, bad,
    and tribble, respectively (Camargo and Sentelhas, 1997, Abreu et al., 2021, Ojo
    and Ogunjo, 2022). 2.8. Taylor diagram The RMSE, R, and standard deviation (SD)
    values can be shown on a two-dimensional diagram, namely, the Taylor diagram (Taylor,
    2001) to more intuitively interpret the results. This diagram was originally designed
    to summarize multiple aspects of indices such as RMSE, R, and SD for evaluating
    the model performances in hydrological analyses. This diagram can clarify the
    accuracy of model forecasts by comparing the observed and forecasted values through
    the visualization of a series of points on a polar plot system. The azimuth angle
    of the diagram indicates the R between the observed and forecasted data, and the
    radial distance from the reference point represents the ratio of the normalized
    SD of the simulation from the observed data (Moazenzadeh et al., 2018). 3. Results
    and discussions 3.1. One-day-ahead reference evapotranspiration forecasting Fig.
    3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show the 1-day-ahead ETo forecasts by the WLSTM, WGMDH, and
    WGAANFIS models at the 30 study sites across the CONUS, respectively. The Northwest
    (NW) and West (W) regions exhibit the highest agreement between the ETo forecasts
    and estimates by FPM compared with those in the other climate regions. In all
    the six sites located in these two climate regions, the RMSE is smaller than 0.50 mm/d.
    Table 1 shows that these six sites have the lowest SD of ETo (lower range of variation).
    In other words, the ETo in these regions is the easiest to forecast, compared
    with those in the other sites. Download : Download high-res image (920KB) Download

    of each graph was (were) used to obtain the best model. Moreover, the WLSTM outperforms
    the WGMDH and WGAANFIS in forecasting 1-day-ahead ETo at all the sites across
    the CONUS. Among the study sites, Garden City, Kansas (in the South (S) climate
    region) has the largest RMSE for the 1-day-ahead ETo forecasts obtained by all
    the models. Table 1 shows that this site has the largest SD of 2.97 mm/d, partly
    attributable to the largest variability in the RH at this site. The lowest NS
    and R pertain to Franklin in the Southeast (SE) climate region. Fig. 6 compares
    the time series of daily ETo estimates by FPM and 1-day-ahead forecasts by the
    WLSTM at Franklin. Notably, Franklin has the highest altitude (after Cortez) and
    SD of the RH, as indicated in Appendix A Supplementary material, Table 1, respectively.
    The best WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGAANFIS models in Franklin site do not use RH as one
    of the input variables to forecast the daily ETo (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5) owing
    to its large variability (Table 1). Therefore, it is likely that the large variabilities
    in the RH influence the model performances. Download : Download high-res image

    ETo estimates by FPM and forecasts by WLSTM at Franklin study site. The variables
    at the top of the graph were used in WLSTM. Fig. 3 shows that only Rs is sufficient
    to accurately forecast the daily ETo in Franklin, which is located in the SE climate
    region. This finding is consistent with the results of Unes et al. (2020): When
    Rs was used as the only input variable for ANFIS, MLR, and SVM, more accurate
    ETo estimates for obtained for a study site in the SE climate region than those
    when two input variables were used. Similar results can be observed for Champaign
    and Harvard in Fig. 3, Fig. 5, respectively. These outcomes are supported by the
    existing reports that highlighted the importance of Rs and other solar parameters
    for daily ETo estimation. Using only Rs as the input variable, Chia et al. (2020)
    estimated the daily ETo by extreme learning machine (ELM) with an acceptable accuracy
    (R = 0.96). Sattari et al. (2021) indicated that when the sunshine duration (n)
    was used as the only input variable, better monthly ETo estimates were achieved
    using the LSTM compared with those when several meteorological variables (Tx,
    Tn, Tm, WS, RH, n) were used. Partal (2016) used the ANN and MLR to estimate the
    daily ETo and noted that the results were only slightly different when only Rs
    was used the input variable and when several variables (Tm, WS, RH, and Rs) were
    used. Zhou et al. (2020) showed the use of radiation-related parameters such as
    the extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra), maximum possible sunshine duration
    (nx), and n in XGBoost and CatBoost yielded the most accurate daily ETo estimates
    in a number of study sites in China. In 43%, 37%, and 47% of the study sites,
    better estimates are obtained when only Rs and temperature variables (i.e., Tx,
    Tn, and Tm) are fed to WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGAANFIS, respectively, compared with
    those when five variables (i.e., Tx, Tn, Tm, RH, and Rs) were input (Fig. 3, Fig.
    4, Fig. 5). These findings are consistent with those reported by Shiri et al.
    (2014): The use of Tx, Tn, Tm, and Rs yielded more accurate daily ETo retrievals
    in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran compared to those obtained using Tx, Tn,
    Tm, RH, and Rs. The 30-site average RMSE, NS, and R of ETo predictions obtained
    using the WLSTM are 0.541 mm/d, 0.946, and 0.973, respectively (Fig. 3). The corresponding
    values for the WGMDH (WGAANFIS) are 0.564 (0.568) mm/d, 0.941 (0.940), and 0.971
    (0.970), respectively. Fig. 7 shows the statistical boxplot of ETo data for the
    training and forecasting stages in the study sites. The box end lines represent
    the 25% and 75% quartiles in the sample distribution. The median position is marked
    within the box. Lines extending from the box end show the 5th and 95th percentiles.
    ETo data in Marianna have the lowest variability particularly for forecasting
    phase, as characterized by the shortest statistical boxplot. Due to the lowest
    variability of ETo in Marianna, the models perform the best and have the lowest
    RMSE values in this site (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In contrast, Garden City has
    the highest ETo variability, particularly for forecasting phase, which makes ETo
    forecasts in that site more difficult. Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show the highest
    RMSE for Garden City. This can be considered as a disadvantage of WLSTM, WGMDH,
    and WGAANFIS in terms of forecasting daily in sites with a high range of variability
    of ETo. Download : Download high-res image (506KB) Download : Download full-size

    evapotranspiration forecasting Fig. 8 shows heat maps of the statistical indices
    for daily ETo forecasts pertaining to the 30 study sites for the three input configurations
    and four lead times. WGMDH (particularly WGMDH-4 and WGMDH-5) obtains more accurate
    3-day, 7-day, and 10-day-ahead ETo forecasts compared with those obtained using
    the WLSTM and WGAANFIS at most sites across the CONUS. Similar to the results
    shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, the best performances of the three AI models
    are observed at the sites in the NW and W climate regions (Fig. 8), which exhibit
    the strongest correlation between Rs and ETo (Table S4). Overall, strong correlations
    between ETo and meteorological Rs lead to more accurate ETo forecasts. Therefore,
    the AI models exhibit their best performances in the NW and W regions for all
    the four lead time horizons (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8).

    3, 7, and 10 in front of the study sites indicate 1-day, 3-day, 7-day, and 10-day-ahead
    ETo forecasting, respectively. The numbers 1, 4, and 5 in front of the models
    indicate the number of input variables (i.e., 1 indicates Rs; 4 indicates Rs,
    Tx, Tn, Tm; and 5 indicates Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, RH). Among the study sites, Mercedes
    located in the S climate region shows the lowest NS and R values for ETo forecasts
    in larger horizons (i.e., 7-day and 10-day-ahead) (Fig. 8). Mercedes has some
    of the highest values for Tx, Tn, Tm, and RH (Table 1). Therefore, this finding
    highlights that the performance of the AI models deteriorates in warm and humid
    environments. This result is consistent with the previous reports in which the
    AI models were noted to be less accurate in estimating the daily ETo in warm and
    humid zones compared to the other climate regions in China (Wu et al., 2019, Fan
    et al., 2018, Wu and Fan, 2019, Zhou et al., 2020). Similar results were reported
    by Araghi et al. (2020): The model performance was lower in a humid region in
    Iran compared with those in arid and semi-arid areas. As shown in Fig. 8, the
    models exhibit a poor performance in the other two study sites (i.e., Garden City
    and Parsons) located in the S region. Notably, among all study sites, the three
    sites located in the S region exhibit the weakest correlation between Rs and ETo
    (Table S4). The heat map of R2 can be seen in Supplementary Material (Fig. S1).
    3.3. Overall evaluation of the models for daily reference evapotranspiration forecasting
    Table 3 lists the thirty-site mean RMSE, NS, R, Bias, and GPI of ETo forecasts
    from the three models with different input configurations. The performance of
    all models in the training phase is better than the forecasting phase. The WLSTM
    forecasts 1-day-ahead ETo more accurately than the other models, with the thirty-site
    average RMSE, NS, R, Bias, and GPI of 0.541 mm/d, 0.946, 0.973, 0.007 mm/d, and
    0.959, respectively. For both training and forecasting phases, all the models
    (except WGAANFIS) show an excellent GPI (i.e., GPI ≥ 0.850). WGAANFIS for 7-day
    and 10-day ahead ETo forecasts show a very good GPI (i.e., 0.760 ≤ GPI < 0.850).

    models in the 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead ETo forecasting. Input configuration 3
    for all models leads to the most accurate ETo forecasts. In terms of the 3-day-
    (7-day)-ahead ETo forecasts, the models with input configuration 3 can be ranked
    in decreasing order of performance as follows: WGMDH, WLSTM, and WGAANFIS with
    RMSE values of 0.636 (0.649), 0.783 (0.865), 0.953 (1.126) mm/d, respectively.
    The same ranking holds for 10-day-ahead ETo forecasting (RMSEs of 0.651, 0.886,
    and 1.182 mm/d). A comparison of the data in Table 3, Table 4 shows that the proposed
    AI models forecast the daily ETo more accurately than the existing models. For
    1-day-ahead ETo forecasts, all the proposed models outperform the models developed
    by Lucas et al. (2020), Torres et al. (2011), and Roy (2021). For 3-, 7-, and
    10-day-ahead forecasts, the deep learning models (i.e., WLSTM and WGMDH) yield
    more accurate results than those obtained using the models developed by Lucas
    et al. (2020) and Torres et al. (2011). Moreover, the proposed models outperform
    those of Bachour et al. (2016) in terms of the NS, and the WGMDH outperforms the
    models proposed by Ferreira and da Cunha (2020). Table 4. Results from the existing

    by the models of Karbasi (2018), Yin et al. (2020), and Granata and Di Nunno (2021)
    are lower than those of the proposed models. However, the existing models were
    verified only at one, three, and two study sites, respectively, and the forecasting
    phase involved only one to three years (Table S1). Finally, the ETo time series
    for Zanjan City in Iran (Karbasi, 2018) was extremely smooth with insignificant
    fluctuations, which is rarely seen in other sites. Fig. 9 shows the thirty-site
    averaged statistical indices of ETo forecasts for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-day lead times.
    Each column shows the model performance for a particular input configuration.
    The statistical metrics of 1-day-ahead ETo forecasts obtained using all the models
    are similar, although the WLSTM slightly outperforms the other models, especially
    for input configuration 1. The WGMDH framework provides the most accurate 3-,
    7-, and 10-day-ahead ETo forecasts, particularly with the second and third input
    configurations. When the lead time is increased from 1 to 10 days, the robustness
    of WGAANFIS decreases, which indicates that deep learning models (i.e., WLSTM
    and WGMDH) are more suitable for forecasting ETo at higher lead times. Download

    for a particular input configuration. Fig. 10 shows the Taylor diagrams to quantify
    the closeness between ETo forecasts from the three AI models and ETo values from
    the FPM equation in terms of the thirty-site mean of three statistical metrics
    (i.e., RMSE, SD, and R). For input configuration 1, the blue star, black plus,
    and pink product signs (corresponding to WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGAANFIS, respectively)
    are close to one another, which indicates that the performance of all the models
    is similar. However, WLSTM has a lower RMSE and higher R, implying that it marginally
    outperforms WGMDH and WGAANFIS for 1-day-ahead ETo forecasting. Moreover, WLSTM
    has a higher SD, which shows that its forecasts can more robustly capture the
    extremum ETo values. In contrast, for 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead ETo forecasting,
    WGMDH shows the highest R and SD and lowest RMSE. Therefore, WLSTM is the best
    model for forecasting the 1-day-ahead daily ETo, whereas WGMDH yields the best
    ETo forecasts in the 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead scenarios. Download : Download high-res

    input configuration. Additionally, we compare the performances of the proposed
    AI models and existing models (Table S1) in forecasting multistep-ahead daily
    ETo. Lucas et al. (2020) showed that ARIMA yields the most accurate 1-day-ahead
    ETo predictions, whereas CNN yields the most accurate 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead
    ETo predictions. Ferreira and da Cunha (2020) indicated that the CNNLSTM and ANN
    are the best models for 1–2-day- and 3–7 day-ahead ETo forecasting, respectively.
    Torres et al. (2011) reported that MLP is the best model for 1- and 3-day-ahead
    ETo forecasting, whereas MVRVM outperforms MLP in the 7-day-ahead forecasting
    scenario. The discrepancy between the ETo forecasts from WLSTM and WGMDH is attributable
    to the inherent nature of these algorithms. WLSTM processes an input sequence
    at a time and generates a sequence output, with the past temporal information
    implicitly maintained by the memory cell (Ni et al., 2020). This sequence-to-sequence
    processing is more concise than the process of inputting and outputting vectors
    and is generally more consistent with the premise of multistep ahead forecasting
    (processing one element of the sequence input at a time than generating the output
    one-by-one) (Ni et al., 2020). In contrast, in WGMDH, the information flow direction
    is only from the first to the last layer. The weights are optimized by the least-squares
    method to achieve the minimum residual between the observed and estimated outputs
    (Ashrafzadeh et al., 2020). 3.4. Seasonal analysis Fig. 11, Fig. 12 show the seasonal

    Winter corresponds to the lowest Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm and highest RH values. Accordingly,
    winter shows the lowest RMSE and highest R and NS values compared to those in
    the other seasons. In terms of the RMSE, R, and NS values, the models exhibit
    their worst performances in summer. Notably, summer has the highest values of
    Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm. Thus, it can be considered that the AI models are sensitive
    to high values of Rs and temperature variables (i.e., Tx, Tn, and Tm), and their
    performance degrades in scenarios involving warm months (i.e., JJA). This finding
    is consistent with the previous reports (Wu et al., 2019, Fan et al., 2018, Wu
    and Fan, 2019, Zhou et al., 2020, Araghi et al., 2020, Shiri et al., 2014, Nourani
    et al., 2020). The lower performance of the AI models in warm months is attributable
    to the peak ETo values observed in this season, which cannot be accurately captured
    by the models (Wu et al., 2019, Fan et al., 2018, Wu and Fan, 2019, Zhou et al.,
    2020, Araghi et al., 2020, Shiri et al., 2014, Nourani et al., 2020). Overall,
    the results highlight that the AI models can accurately forecast multistep-ahead
    daily ETo in all the climate regions across the CONUS. In general, ETo represents
    the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface and is independent of the
    crop type, crop development, soil condition, and management practices (Yu et al.,
    2020). Weather variables are the only factors that control ETo. Air temperature
    and especially Rs provide the required energy to alter the state of water molecules
    from liquid to vapor. A key aerodynamic component is the driving force provided
    by the vapor pressure difference between the overlying atmosphere and evaporating
    surface, which can be explained by RH (Yu et al., 2020, Allen et al., 1998). In
    the three input configurations presented in this study, the temperature variables
    (i.e., Tx, Tn, and Tm) may be treated as the energy part of the ETo equation (Eq.
    19). Moreover, RH (which reflects the degree of saturation of the air) provides
    the driving force to remove water vapor from the evaporating surface (Yu et al.,
    2020, Allen et al., 1998). The findings highlight that AI models are capable of
    physical interpretation and disrupt the common belief that the AI models are purely
    black box systems (Yu et al., 2020). WGAANFIS has the ability to handle a large
    amount of noisy data from complex dynamic systems. WGAANFIS is especially useful
    in modeling systems with unknown underlying physical relationships between inputs
    and outputs. WGAANFIS can merge information from several sources such as expert
    systems, human reasoning (heuristics), empirical models, and measurements for
    effective model development (Banu and Suja, 2019). WGAANFIS is capable of reducing
    the dimensionality of the problem by using a subtractive clustering technique.
    This prevents the combinatorial explosion of fuzzy rules when input data sets
    involve higher dimensions (Adedeji et al., 2022, Al-Mahasneh et al., 2016, Banu
    and Suja, 2019). Subtractive clustering methods are especially useful for building
    the fuzzy model when no prior knowledge of the fuzzy rules exists. WGAANFIS has
    also a number of disadvantages. Since ANFIS is a data-driven modeling technique,
    it is extremely important to select the appropriate input variables, which provide
    the essential information needed for successful modeling. In other words, it is
    important to avoid losing key information by omitting one or more key input variables,
    and to prevent the inclusion of redundant or irrelevant input variables that can
    confuse the training process (Al-Mahasneh et al., 2016). While this applies to
    any modeling technique, it is crucial in WGAANFIS because it depends heavily on
    input-output data compared to deep learning models. The number of fuzzy rules
    grows exponentially with the increase in the number of input variables (Adedeji
    et al., 2022). Hence, a high number of input variables leads to an excessively
    large number of fuzzy rules, which significantly increases the computational time
    of WGAANFIS (Banu and Suja, 2019). Prior experience and knowledge of the user,
    and the use of a clustering tool for input variables may mitigate this problem.
    Also, the successful implementation of WGAANFIS requires the availability of a
    relatively large data set for training. (Adedeji et al., 2022, Al-Mahasneh et
    al., 2016, Banu and Suja, 2019). The primary advantage of WGMDH is its ability
    to select its structure (degree of nonlinearity) without using a priori information
    on the relationship between input and output variables (Tamura and Kondo, 2020,
    Yu et al., 2018). Compared to the conventional neural networks with uniform neurons,
    self-organization of the WGMDH neural networks with active neurons is simplified
    (Liu et al., 2017) Active neurons also significantly improve the efficiency of
    iterative WGMDH algorithms (Stepashko et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2017). Moreover,
    WGMDH neural networks do not suffer from overfitting (Pham and Liu, 1994, Liu
    et al., 2017). Despite the abovementioned disadvantages, input variables of each
    neuron in WGMDH are selected from the adjacent neurons, which can impair the performance
    of WGMDH (Jahed Armaghani et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2017). WLSTM utilizes the
    information learned from previous time steps (Zhang and Song, 2019, Tuli et al.,
    2020). Also, in WLSTM, a memory unit is added to the hidden layer (Ding et al.,
    2022, Tosun et al., 2020). This makes the model deeper and enables it to more
    accurately simulate the relationship between inputs and output as a deep learning
    technique (Brownlee, 2017, Amizhtan et al., 2022, Tuli et al., 2020). The WLSTM
    approach has an advantage of analyzing data in chronological order. In addition,
    WLSTM can recognize global behaviors of temporal data (Liu et al., 2022, Tosun
    et al., 2020). The most important advantage of WLSTM is the simultaneous reduction
    of computational cost and numerical diffusion (Takamizu et al., 2022, Tosun et
    al., 2020). Moreover, WLSTM is able to generate precise information using a small
    amount of data (Bandara et al., 2021; Tuli et al., 2020). Finally, WLSTM can model
    long-term dependence and effectively avoid gradient explosion and disappearance
    (Liu et al., 2022, Tosun et al., 2020). In terms of disadvantage of WLSTM, it
    is computationally expensive because of its high complexity using the three gates
    (Liu et al., 2022, Kim et al., 2023, Tosun et al., 2020). It is difficult for
    WLSTM to process nonlinear and nonstationary data (Shi et al., 2022, Ulina et
    al., 2020, Tuli et al., 2020). LSTM cannot handle parallel problems efficiently
    due to its complex model structure. Moreover, LSTM requires many parameter settings
    for the network topology, initial values of weights, and thresholds. WGAANFIS
    learns uniform weight during training phase (Dikshit and Pradhan, 2021). Unlike
    WGAANFIS, deep learning models (i.e., WLSTM and WGMDH) learnvariable weights across
    time steps. As anomalies exist among the variables, decay of weights over time
    periods is necessary (Dikshit et al., 2021). The forget gate in a deep learning
    architecture captures the decay weighted lag–lead sequence relationship effectively
    without the vanishing gradient issue, thereby has an advantage over WGAANFIS (Dikshit
    and Pradhan, 2021). Due to these advantages, WLSTM and WGMDH perform better than
    WGAANFIS. However, running deep learning models is time consuming, which can be
    considered as their disadvantage. Finally, optimizing hyperparameters of WLSTM,
    WGMDH, and WGAANFIS is time-consuming. The performance of models degrades when
    the range of variability of ETo increases as they cannot forecast peak ETo values
    robustly. We also require sufficiently long time-series of Rs, RH, Tx, Tn, and
    Tm and ETo data to train the models. Having said that, these models do not perform
    well if the weather stations are recently installed at a farmland. Finally, optimizing
    hyperparameters of WLSTM, WGMDH, and WGAANFIS is time-consuming. Although deep
    learning models (i.e., WLSTM and WGMDH) showed a better performance than WGAANFIS,
    application of other optimization algorithms such as PSO (Cui et al., 2021) can
    be considered for future investigations (i.e., WPSOANFIS). Next studies should
    be directed towards the application of machine learning approaches to forecast
    actual evapotranspiration using in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing
    observations. Online irrigation apps provide daily irrigation recommendations
    for the next days by utilizing the long-term ETo average as the ETo forecasts
    during these days. This often can lead to erroneous irrigation scheduling because
    ETo in the next days can be very different from its long-term average. In this
    case, online irrigation tools generate a poor irrigation scheduling, which can
    damage crops and reduces yields. It is evident that feeding the online irrigation
    tools with accurate ETo forecasts from this study is of vital importance and improve
    their performance (Mishra et al., 2013, Lorite et al., 2015, Bachour et al., 2016).
    Since the models used in this study have the ability to forecast ETo from limited
    meteorological variables, the results can be expanded to areas with limited/missing
    data. 4. Conclusions Daily ETo in 1-, 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead scenarios is forecasted
    at 30 sites in nine climate regions across the CONUS, using three AI models (WLSTM,
    WGMDH, and WGAANFIS) with three input configurations. In the first configuration,
    only Rs is input to the models given its strongest correlation with ETo. In the
    second configuration, the inputs are Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm. The input variables for
    the third configuration are Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, and RH. The results of the models
    are compared against ETo data from the FPM equation. The training phase is from
    2005 to 2014, and the forecasting phase is from 2015 to 2019. The third input
    configuration generates the most accurate results in more than 90% of the study
    sites. The WLSTM in this configuration is the best model for forecasting 1-day-ahead
    ETo, with RMSE = 0.541 mm/d, NS = 0.946, and R = 0.973 for the forecasting phase.
    The WGMDH outperforms the WLSTM and WGAANFIS for 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead ETo
    forecasting with RMSE = 0.636, 0.649, and 0.651 mm/d; NS = 0.925, 0.922, and 0.921;
    and R = 0.962, 0.961 and 0.961, respectively. All the three AI models exhibit
    their best performances in the NW and W climate regions, which exhibit the strongest
    correlation between Rs and ETo. The accuracy of the models decreases in the S
    climate region with the weakest correlation occurs between Rs and ETo. Deep learning
    models are superior to the WGAANFIS model in all the seasons. The lowest Rs, Tx,
    Tn, and Tm and highest RH values are observed in winter. Accordingly, winter corresponds
    to the best ETo forecasts with the lowest RMSE and highest NS and R compared to
    the other seasons. The worst performance of the models is observed in summer because
    ETo peaks in this season owing to the high Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm values, and the
    AI models cannot robustly capture these peak values. We used limited meteorological
    variables (i.e., Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, and RH) to forecast ETo. Therefore, the results
    are applicable to areas where weather stations can not be installed due to topographic
    restrictions and/or some sensors (e.g., wind speed sensors) are not accessible.
    Future studies can be aimed at applying other algorithms such as gradient-based
    optimizer, whale optimization, billiards-inspired optimization, Harris hawks optimization,
    and darts game optimizer algorithms to forecast ETo. Hybridization of these methods
    with DWT and CWT can also be considered to improve their performance. Finally,
    the outcomes of the new innovative models can be compared with those of the proposed
    models. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no

    1. Introduction Advances in technology and industry have helped humanity to increase
    life quality and expectancy. This includes delegating laborious processes traditionally
    performed by hand to machines that can perform these tasks more efficiently. However,
    it has brought with it several problems as well [1] relating to the overexploitation
    and nonrational use of Earth’s natural resources, which in turn causes disruption
    of the natural balance expressed by climate change effects, such as global warming
    and severe climate events (droughts, flooding, storms, hurricanes, etc.). In response
    to this alarming situation, humanity is asked more than ever to rethink and reconsider
    its way of dealing with the environment, especially in the context of a world
    population that grows at a higher rate [2]. This puts a lot of pressure on our
    food systems to meet the increasing demand and feed the planet. Agriculture is
    the sector that must be addressed, and agricultural management practices need
    to be optimized and become more efficient and sustainable to address these challenges.
    With water resources as an example, agriculture comes in as the largest consumer
    of this resource, with about an average of 70% in use around the world [3]. In
    this sector, water resources are used mainly in irrigation activities that still
    follow unsustainable methods such as gravity irrigation, the most widely used
    type of irrigation globally [4,5]. Additionally, even when using modern methods
    of irrigation, such as drip irrigation, they can be inefficient in the absence
    of good management [6]. The crucial step to achieving an efficient irrigation
    system, whatever the type of irrigation system used, is to know the proper amount
    of water to supply and the time to apply it (when and how much). To this end,
    we need to monitor either the soil, the crop, or the weather. Monitoring the weather
    enables the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET), which is the sum of transpiration
    from plants and soil surface evaporation. Accurately estimating this parameter
    allows compensation of the lost water quantity to the atmosphere. There are two
    methods of estimating the evapotranspiration of a crop. One uses a single crop
    coefficient (Kc) that incorporates all physiological and physical variations between
    the crops and the second where the Kc is split into two separate coefficients:
    Kcb for crop transpiration and Ke for soil evaporation. The Kc coefficient, then,
    is multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0), which reflects the rate
    of evapotranspiration for a specific crop (grass). It is obtained by monitoring
    various meteorological parameters (air temperature, solar radiation, air relative
    humidity, wind speed, etc.). Therefore, weather monitoring is a key step toward
    implementing efficient irrigation systems and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
    Today, we are able to collect weather data with high spatial and temporal resolution
    thanks to advances in science and technology, including advances in remote sensing
    such as the availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [7] equipped with cutting-edge
    sensors with affordable prices, satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal
    resolutions, open-access reanalysis data such as European ReAnalysis data [8],
    MERRA [9], the JRA-55 [10] or NCEP–DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis data [11]. Additionally,
    advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) field have enabled cost-effective sensor
    data acquisition [12,13,14,15,16]. This huge amount of data raised issues regarding
    the efficiency, complexity, interfaces, dynamics, robustness, and interaction
    between these new types of peer-to-peer connected systems that need to be re-examined
    on a large scale, as discussed in [17]. This unprecedented amount of generated
    data is also contributing to what is known as big data, which needs adequate infrastructure
    to be stored and gain insights for assisting agricultural decision making. This
    work aligns with this objective and is intended to provide intelligent ways to
    deal with these abundant data by applying the concepts of big data analytics and
    leveraging the potential applications of artificial intelligence in agriculture
    to help farmers minimize their risks, or at least make them more manageable, which
    represents a step towards the development of smart and precision agriculture.
    2. State of the Art Several researchers have tried to leverage the challenges
    and opportunities of the big data wave in the agricultural field and how it can
    be the driver of sustainability and precision in this sector by gaining insights
    from massive volumes of data that can be used to assist decision making. As surveyed
    in [18], big data analytics is leading to advances in various industries, but
    it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The work presents a range of
    suggested solutions, tools, algorithms, and data, including how they were used
    and their impact upon the sector as a whole. It also emphasizes the enormous potential
    of big data analytics in agriculture for smarter farming, demonstrating how the
    accessibility of big data analytics tools, methods, and software, as well as the
    growing openness of heterogeneous data sources (the “open data wave”), will encourage
    more academic research, public sector initiatives, and business ventures in the
    agricultural sector. The paper concludes that the adoption of big data practices
    in agriculture is still challenging and faces several obstacles when applied to
    real-world applications. In the paper [19], the authors developed a system composed
    of three components: (i) hardware to capture crop data, (ii) a web application
    for crop data and field information manipulation, and (iii) a mobile application
    to control irrigation via mobiles. The objective of this work is to analyze the
    suitability of crops in terms of air temperature, air relative humidity, and soil
    moisture to optimize future plans and strategies. The authors of the work [20]
    propose a solution to be adopted in India to help farmers face the unpredictable
    nature and variability of climate and weather circumstances. They built a system
    for managing local weather stations in real time that would keep farmers well-informed
    about the current weather conditions in advance, allowing them to make the right
    decisions at the right time and prevent crop loss. High-speed internet infrastructure
    available even in rural areas is the main motivation for conducting this work.
    It facilitates the communication of collected data to remote servers. Once received
    and analyzed, the information derived from these data gives farmers a way to automate
    their agricultural management practices (irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting)
    by triggering the right action at the right time. Article [21] also presented
    a smart weather station management system intended to be used in agriculture and
    to manage meteorological stations. It is based on Internet of Things technology
    (IoT) to minimize costs. The connected sensors measure air temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, air pressure, and wind speed. It then sends the collected data
    to the server part of the system through the Global System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM) module. The application layer is powered by the ThingSpeak platform, which
    offers standard services to the proposed system such as data visualization and
    data analysis. In regards to dealing with the challenges related to handling huge
    amounts of data generated by sensors, the paper [22] proposed a standard architecture
    for a data infrastructure platform called WALLeSMART, which is a cloud-based solution
    that provides a general architecture to handle the difficulties of gathering,
    processing, storing, and visualizing extremely large amounts of data in batch
    and real-time modes. An initial prototype has been developed and tested at various
    farms in the Wallonia region of Belgium, showing prominent results. This proposed
    system can be used as the basis for developing customized smart agricultural services
    to meet our needs. Our contributions not only propose an architecture containing
    some of the standard pipelines used in the literature to build data platforms,
    namely data acquisition, storing, visualizing, and analysis, but a complete system
    with the aim of going from data to decision making. The proposed system provides
    services such as weather time series forecasting, missing values handling using
    a multisource approach (reanalysis and situ data), and estimating important parameters
    needed in the day-to-day life of farmers, such as the evapotranspiration (ET).
    3. Study Area The study area is situated 40 km east of Marrakesh in the semiarid
    Haouz plain in the heart of Morocco (Figure 1). About 2800 ha of this area is
    irrigated, and it is nearly flat. Cereal crops such as wheat and barley are the
    main dominant crops. The region’s climate is typically Mediterranean semiarid,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 250 mm [23,24], temperatures that range
    from hot in the summer (38 °C in July) to cool in the winter (5 °C in February),
    significant daily and monthly variations that are concentrated primarily from
    autumn to spring, and an average annual ET0 of 1600 mm [25]. Figure 1. R3 district
    study area in Morocco and a Photo of the meteorological station installed. 4.
    System Architecture The proposed system is designed to enable the smart management
    of weather data, which represents the key to implementing smart agriculture. By
    monitoring and analyzing the weather effectively, we can optimize various agricultural
    management practices such as irrigation scheduling and choosing the appropriate
    crop to sow [26]. The design of the platform follows a service-oriented architecture
    (Figure 2) to offer services that address each of the four categories of big data
    analytics. As part of a descriptive data analysis that tries to understand what
    happened in the past, a scenario would be: rainfall declined, and the frequency
    changed over the last decade. The answer to why this happened, in turn, is very
    important, and it takes us to the diagnostic data analysis, where the focus is
    to identify anomalies in data to explain the reasons behind events, such as linking
    this event with long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns observed
    in weather evolution charts. The third type covered by the platform is predictive
    data analysis. It looks beyond the present and tries to predict the future using
    statistical methods and machine learning algorithms that learn from historical
    data in an iterative approach, trying to identify the optimal way to predict the
    future. One such service is weather forecasting. The output of the forecasting
    service can be used to support decision making about what actions to take that
    aim to prevent severe events from occurring in the future. This is carried out
    through the last type, which is prescriptive data analysis. Figure 2. General
    architecture of the platform. The platform can be decomposed into four main layers:
    the data acquisition layer, the data storage layer, the processing layer, and
    the application layer. 4.1. Data Acquisition Layer Heterogeneous data from a variety
    of sources, including meteorological station data, IoT weather sensors, reanalysis
    data, third-party meteorological services, and raw files (CSV, Excel, etc.), are
    used as the input for this layer. The concept of big data is introduced to the
    field by the volume, velocity, and variety that characterize these data. Missing
    values are handled in this layer using the method developed in Section 4.4.1 prior
    to being stored in the NoSQL MongoDB database. 4.1.1. Weather Station Data The
    weather dataset used in this study was collected from a meteorological station
    installed in the study area (Figure 1) at the half-hour scale from 2013 to 2020.
    The used tower is equipped with different sensors [27,28] to measure: Incoming
    solar radiation using (Kipp and Zonen CM5 Pyranometer, Delft, The Netherlands).
    Air temperature in Kelvin, relative humidity (R3_Hr, as a fraction between 0 and
    1) and vapor pressure by using (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). Wind speed
    using (A100R Anemometer, R.M. Young Company, Traverse City, MI, USA). Rainfall
    using (FSS500 Tipping Bucket Automatic Rain Gauge, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA). Next, records are stored in data loggers before being collected manually
    by agents or sent to a centralized server via a cellular connection. A full description
    of these data is shown in Table 1, which also includes statistics for missing
    values. Table 1. Meteorological station data description. 4.1.2. ERA5-Land Reanalysis
    Data Advances in measurement technologies have enabled us to use various observation
    methods to monitor the Earth’s weather, including weather stations, weather balloons,
    and satellite imagery, to name a few. However the distribution of these observation
    methods does not cover the entire globe, they may have overlapping footprints
    between covered areas, and fewer of them were available in the past, which makes
    it challenging to conduct studies of past years. To deal with this, climate reanalysis
    emerges as a new way of trying to deliver a complete picture of the past and of
    the entire globe by combining the laws of physics, modern weather models, and
    available weather sources. Such data, if accurate, are crucial and will certainly
    assist decision making in several domains such as smart cities, smart management
    of renewable energy stations, sustainable and climate-smart agriculture [29,30],
    climate change assessments, hydrology [31], and much more. In our study, we used
    the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) [32] available to be downloaded
    for free through the Climate Data Store (CDS) web platform [33]. ERA5-Land is
    the successor to ERA5 [8], which in turn is the successor to ERA-Interim [34].
    This new product covers the period from 1950 to the present. ERA5-Land has the
    benefit over the predecessors of its high horizontal resolution (9 km against
    31 km for ERA5 and 80 km for ERA-Interim). These strengths were achieved thanks
    to the integration of the ECMWF land surface model forced by the ERA5 climate
    reanalysis with corrected elevation for the thermodynamic near-surface state and
    then applied to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. The data used in this
    study concern the two pixels that cover our study area (Figure 3). We downloaded
    ERA5-Land weather data from 2013 to 2020. Since the cloud service Climate Data
    Store API (cdsapi) has a limit of 100,000 records per request, we downloaded each
    year separately and combined them all at the end. The downloaded data were then
    converted to a pandas dataframe data structure using the Python language. We also
    developed a function called “get_era5_land_grib_as_dataframe”, available as a
    part of the GIS class of the public library Data Science Toolkit (DST) [35] that
    accepts an ERA5-Land grip file as a parameter and returns a pandas dataframe,
    which is the most commonly used data structure in the data science field. The
    full description of the downloaded parameters is described in Table 2. Figure
    3. The projection of ERA5-Land pixels over the study area. Table 2. ERA5-Land
    downloaded data description. 4.2. Data Storage Layer In our system, most of the
    collected data are time series (meteorological data, reanalysis data, satellite
    data, etc.). This type is characterized mainly by variety (multisource), volume,
    and velocity (each half-hour). To deal with this, the system uses MongoDB, a big-data-driven
    database for storing and retrieving meteorological data. The choice of using the
    MongoDB database comes after several strengths it presents and its suitability
    for our use case, including that it was designed to replace or enhance the classic
    Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), providing it with a variety of
    additional characteristics such as scalability being schema-less. It is also powerful
    at handling large amounts of real-time data and efficiently handling memory, as
    it is written using the C++ programming language. Not to mention the geospatial
    indexing feature, which makes it perfect for real-time geospatial data collection
    and analysis. Figure 4 shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the weather data
    subcomponent. Figure 4. The Entity Relationship Diagram used in the climate database
    design; ta: air temperature (R3_Tair), rg: global solar radiation (R3_Rg), hr:
    air relative humidity (R3_Hr), p: rainfall (R3_P), ws: wind speed (R3_Vv), wd:
    wind direction (R3_Dv). 4.3. Data Processing Layer The data processing layer takes
    the data from the data storage layer as input and applies the statistical, machine
    learning, and deep learning models to gain insights from the data and turn that
    into services (Figure 2). 4.3.1. Statistical Models Statistical models are used
    in this platform for forecasting purposes. Initially, the model Facebook Prophet
    [36] was used to conduct long-term weather time series forecasting, since it was
    tested on the same data in previous work. 4.3.2. Machine Learning Models The system
    also makes use of machine learning models, given the fact that they can perform
    well on small datasets, for example, the XGBoost [37] model for reference evapotranspiration
    estimation based on stored metrological data [38]. 4.3.3. Deep Learning Models
    Deep learning models or neural networks have gained success in solving complex
    tasks that were previously human-specific and have required some level of human
    intelligence to be solved in different fields. They derive their power by trying
    to mimic the way the human brain works. They are composed of neurons able to process
    huge amounts of data in order to map the output from a set of inputs using internal
    mathematical operations. These neurons are organized into groups called layers
    and, during the propagation of signals between layers in two senses (Forward and
    backpropagation), the deep learning network learns to perform tasks. In our case,
    this is a regression task, where the input is ERA5-Land reanalysis data and the
    output is meteorological station data. 4.4. Application Layer The application
    layer contains multiple services related to weather times series. 4.4.1. Time
    Series Data Imputation Service It is common in real-world meteorological data
    to have missing values for various reasons. Missing values can be due to a network
    error or due to technical issues with certain measurement sensors, etc. These
    missing data can affect the performance of any type of model (machine learning,
    numerical, physical, etc.). As such, they need to be identified and handled efficiently
    during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing stages. There are
    several techniques for dealing with missing data depending on the use case: Deletion:
    Deleting rows or columns with missing values will remove this unwanted type of
    data from our dataset, but it may drastically reduce the size of the dataset,
    especially in the context of data scarcity. Imputation in time series data: In
    the case of a time series with a trend and seasonality, missing data can be replaced
    using seasonal adjustment, such as using the data from the same period of the
    previous year, which is the case for most weather data. However, this method may
    not be as efficient due to changes in weather patterns around the world. In contrast,
    if the time series do not present a trend or a seasonality, it can be treated
    the same way as imputation for a normal dataset. Imputation in normal datasets:
    Replacing it using statistical measures of central tendencies such as the mean,
    median, or mode of a given window of data that require some assumptions about
    the distribution type of the data to be efficient. This service proposes an approach
    based on reanalysis data and artificial intelligence to build models that can
    learn rules to map ERA5-Land reanalysis data to station meteorological data, which
    is also useful for the surrounding regions of our study area (Section 3), since
    we are in relatively homogeneous areas in terms of elevation and climate. We use
    the ERA5-Land data presented in Section 4.1.2 and two different architectures
    of deep learning models. The steps to implement the method workflow are shown
    in Figure 5. Figure 5. The flowchart of the deep learning approach. a. Exploratory
    data analysis Before implementing the proposed machine learning approach, exploratory
    data analysis (EDA) was the first exercise we conducted. It enabled us to understand
    our collected data, as well as to create hypotheses for further analysis and investigation.
    In this step, we made no underlying assumptions about the variables, and we were
    guided only by the observed data. We first calculated the correlation matrix (Figure
    6). This matrix allowed us to choose potential estimators for each target variable.
    Table 3 shows in the second column the potential estimators based on correlation
    coefficients (|r| > 0.5 means high relationships between variables). In the third
    column are the estimators that are used in the literature. Figure 6. The correlation
    heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the station and ERA5-Land parameters. Table
    3. Potential estimators of meteorological parameters. The variable 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 in
    the matrix is calculated using the rule of thumb (Equation (1)), which uses both
    air temperature ( 𝑡2𝑚 ) and dewpoint temperature ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) to estimate air relative
    humidity efficiently for moist air (relative humidity above 50 percent) [39].
    According to the matrix, 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 has a high negative correlation with 𝑡2𝑚 but a
    very weak correlation with 𝑑2𝑚 . Despite this, using the latter ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) combined
    with 𝑡2𝑚 gives a correlation of 0.87 for 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 instead of −0.77, if we take
    only 𝑡2𝑚 into consideration. This motivated us to take both variables as input
    to neural networks for the estimation of 𝑅3 _ 𝐻𝑟 . This is also a confirmation
    for other rule-based (physics-based) approximations that use the same variables
    for air relative humidity estimation derived from the Magnus formula [40] (Equation
    (2)). 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟=100−5(𝑡2𝑚−𝑑2𝑚) (1) 𝑑2𝑚= 𝜆(ln( 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 ))+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 𝛽−(ln(
    𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 )+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 ) (2) Equation (2) is valid for air temperatures ranging
    from −45 to 60 degrees Celsius, the Magnus parameters are, in this case, 𝛽 = 17.62
    and 𝜆 = 243.12 degrees Celsius. For global solar radiation ( 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔 ), the study
    uses the surface solar radiation downwards (ssrd) as estimator. Since the objective
    is to predict meteorological station data based only on ERA5-Land data, we evaluated
    the performance of two deep learning models, namely a Feed Forward Neural Network
    (FFNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict 𝑅3_𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 , 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔
    given the ssrd, and 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 and 𝑑2𝑚 . b. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN):
    In this type of neural network, the input signals (ERA5-Land data) are fed into
    the input layer composed of 100 neurons. In each neuron, the data are processed,
    taking the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias and then applying an activation
    function (Figure 7), before forwarding the output to the next layer. The activation
    function introduces nonlinearity to the output. The choice of this function has
    a real impact on the training process and performance of models and must be chosen
    according to the problem at hand. For example, sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
    activation functions (Equations (3) and (4)) can be used to capture nonlinearity
    that may exist between inputs and outputs. Figure 7. A single neuron model. For
    our case, and given the fact that moving from ERA5-Land reanalysis data to meteorological
    station data is the inverse of inference in statistics, that is, estimating the
    mean of an individual (station data) given the mean of the population (ERA5-Land
    pixels), the error with this assumption is supposed to be linear (polynomial of
    degree one); that said, we used the Rectified Linear Unit function (ReLU) (Equation
    (5)) as the activation function in our neural network layers, which is true for
    both proposed architectures (FFNN and LSTM). 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)= 1 1+ 𝑒 𝑥 (3) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=tanh(𝑥)=
    𝑒 𝑥 − 𝑒 −𝑥 𝑒 𝑥 + 𝑒 −𝑥 (4) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑥)={ 0, x, if𝑥<0 if𝑥≥0 (5) c. Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM): The choice behind using this neural network as a comparison is
    due to its ability to deal with data that have long-term dependency, which is
    the case for climate data. LSTM belongs to the Recurrent Neural Networks family
    (RNN), and therefore also has an internal recurrence, that is, during the learning
    process, a signal is fed back to a neuron or layer that has already received and
    processed it (Figure 8), as well as its ability to remember data through gated
    cells, which are a kind of memory that accept values in the interval [0, 1] and
    are used to decide when the flow of a signal passes through the corresponding
    neuron. LSTM was first developed to resolve the limitations of the vanishing [41]
    and exploding gradient problems that may occur during the training phase. This
    problem stops the learning of the neural network because the updates to the various
    weights become very small. Figure 8. Architectures of FFNN and LSTM used in the
    approach. These two architectures (Figure 8) are trained using the Mean Squared
    Error (MSE) as a loss or cost function that enables calculating the error of a
    network at the end of a forward pass. To optimize the network weights, we used
    the adaptive moment estimation optimization algorithm (Adam), which is characterized
    by fast convergence to the optimal solution and combines the strengths of other
    optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and RMSProp
    during the training phase. Like most other optimization algorithms, Adam uses
    the partial derivative during backward propagation to calculate the error function
    with respect to each weight within the network (Equation (6)). The Adam algorithm
    then updates the network weights for a minimized loss or cost function using rules
    in Equations (7), (8) and (9), respectively. 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑= ∂𝐽 ∂𝜃 (6) 𝑚 𝑡 = 𝛽 1 𝑚 𝑡−1 +(1−

    (9) d. Data normalization Data normalization is performed as part of the data
    preprocessing step and is the process of bringing data to a similar scale. The
    process is also known as feature scaling. In some cases, such as for statistical
    machine learning models, it may not be beneficial, but for deep learning models,
    it is proven to help models to perform better [42,43] in terms of faster convergence,
    reduced training time, and improved stability (preventing models from oscillating
    or divergence). There are multiple methods for data normalization: Min–max standardization:
    Min–max scales the feature values between [0, 1], with 0 being the feature’s minimum
    value and 1 being its maximum value, while maintaining the original distribution
    (Equation (10)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) (10) Decimal scaling: This form
    of scaling is used where values of different decimal ranges are present. For example,
    two features with different bounds can be brought to a similar scale using decimal
    scaling (Equation (11)) 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥 10 𝑛 (11) Such that n is an integer representing
    the order of the scalings. Z-score: This transformation scales the value toward
    a normal distribution with a zero mean and unit variance using the z-score formula
    (Equation (12)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝜇 𝜎 (12) such that 𝜇 is the mean and 𝜎 is the standard
    deviation of the features’ distribution. This method is very efficient for datasets
    with a Gaussian distribution. In our case, we applied the min–max method (Equation
    (10)). Next, we initialize the hyperparameters of the two proposed architectures
    (Table 4). These parameters are not updated during the learning phase. Table 4.
    Hyperparameters used during the training of FFNN and LSTM models. e. Dataset splitting
    Before training begins, we split our dataset into three sets: training, validation,
    and test sets. The validation set is used to assess the performance of the model
    during each epoch of the training phase. Next, the test set is used to evaluate
    the final trained model. We used 80–20% splitting for the training–test sets,
    respectively, and took 20% of the 80% for the validation set. f. Evaluation Metrics
    To evaluate the trained deep learning models’ performance on the test dataset,
    we employed the most commonly used metrics for regression tasks (Equations (13)–(16)):
    Training time: The time it takes for the model to complete 20 epochs. R2 score
    or R2: The coefficient of determination informs about how well the unknown samples
    will be predicted by our model. It ranges between 0 and 1, but it can be negative
    as well (Equation (13)). R 2 =1− ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 )
    2 (13) The Pearson correlation coefficient (R): It measures the linear relationship
    between two normal distributed variables (Equation (14)). R= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥
    ̲ )( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 ̲ ) 2 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − √ (14) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The average of the squares
    of the errors between real and predicted values by the model (Equation (15)).
    RMSE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 1 𝑛 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (15) Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE): This is the average of absolute errors between real and
    predicted values (Equation (16)). MAE= ∑ 𝑛 1 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 | 𝑛 (16) Given the
    fact that we applied the scaling in our data using the formula in Equation (10),
    all metrics (from Equations (13) to (16)) are unitless. 4.4.2. Forecasting Service
    The forecasting service helps make projections of the future state of the atmosphere
    (air temperature, air relative humidity, global solar radiation, etc.) by performing
    a univariate time series forecasting task. The Facebook Prophet model is used
    according on the performance it has provided when trained and evaluated using
    the same meteorological dataset to perform long-term weather forecasting tasks.
    4.4.3. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation Service One of the most
    important agricultural practices in the day-to-day life of a farmer is irrigation.
    To achieve efficiency, we need to accurately estimate crops’ water needs at each
    phase of crop growth throughout the agricultural season. This can be performed
    through several methods, among others is the estimation of the evapotranspiration
    (ET). It indicates the amount of water loss caused by transpiration from the crop
    and soil surface evaporation. We can obtain the ET of a crop (ETc) by multiplying
    the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient Kc, which holds all
    the physical and physiological differences of a given crop. This service proposes
    to estimate the ET0 using machine learning, namely the XGBoost model constrained
    by the physical model FAO Penman–Monteith. The proposed approach follows the steps
    presented in Figure 9. First, we resampled the air temperature, global solar radiation,
    air relative humidity, and wind speed to the daily average, and precipitation
    to the cumulative daily values, and then the missing values were deleted. Figure
    9. The flowchart of the proposed method. To select the most important contributor
    variables to the ET0 estimate, the method uses a random-forest-based technique
    that ranks the importance of features based on their occurrences in nodes across
    all trees: the bar chart (Figure 10) shows sorted meteorological variables’ importance
    scores. Next, the dataset containing meteorological data and the corresponding
    FAO Penman–Monteith ET0 estimated values are split and fed into the XGBoost model,
    and the model is then evaluated. Figure 10. The features’ importance bar chart
    of meteorological parameters. The objective of this service is to provide an alternative
    to the FAO Penman–Monteith calculation procedure by learning the behavior of this
    procedure using a limited number of climatic variables (Figure 11). It is either
    suitable for stations that lack the necessary hardware and sensors to provide
    the entire set of meteorological data required for FAO Penman–Monteith or in the
    case of technical problems with sensors, among other things. Figure 11. The logic
    of the Evapotranspiration estimation component. 4.4.4. Weather Data Analysis and
    Visualization Service It is well-known that data in their raw form are useless,
    but the information, knowledge, and wisdom derived from them are not. Moving from
    one state of data to another is known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD),
    which is a subset of the modern data science field and can be performed using
    various methods, such as CRISP-DM [44], which stands for CRoss-Industry Standard
    Process for Data Mining, or the proposed standard method in [45]. One example
    of insights data visualization and analysis which can be given in our use case
    is shown in Figure 12. This is achieved by following a hybrid methodology that
    includes the following steps: collecting, storing, cleaning, visualizing, analyzing,
    and mining. Figure 12. An example of the data analysis scenario. The first three
    steps are common for all other services available on the platform. The added value
    of this service is providing different types of visualization options, including
    comparison plots (line charts of weather time series), relationship plots (scatter
    plot of weather data), and automatically generating correlation heat maps, which
    are important steps in the data analysis phase to study how one variable affects
    another. 4.4.5. Custom Early Warning Alerts Service This service is classified
    as an outlier or anomaly detection problem. These special types of data can be
    detected in time series by using, among others, rule-based methods, in which case
    the service alerts administrators via SMS and email once the given condition is
    satisfied. An example of such a condition is a threshold of temperature or rainfall.
    The second method of sending warnings is to identify sequences that are notably
    different from the rest of the historical time series data. These sequences can
    be the result of measurement error or noise and can inform administrators about
    the status of the different sensors installed in the meteorological station and
    inform them about events that could require urgent action. To perform this, we
    use unsupervised machine learning methods that do not require an annotated series
    of anomalies to be trained, in contrast to supervised machine learning algorithms.
    The unsupervised method we used is Local Outlier Factor ( 𝐿𝑂𝐹 ) [46]. It uses
    the KNN algorithm principle to calculate the distance of a point with respect
    to its neighbors. This distance is used, in turn, to obtain the Reachability Density
    ( 𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (17)). 𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐾−𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑗 ),𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑖 ,
    𝑥 𝑗 )) (17) Next is measuring the local deviation of the density of a given point
    using Local Reachability Density ( 𝐿𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (18)), which tells us how far
    the point is from the nearest dense cluster of points. 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥)= 1 ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁
    𝑘 (𝑥) 𝑅𝐷(𝑥, 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| (18) where 𝑁𝑘(𝑥) is the number of neighbors of
    x whose distance from x is not greater than the k-distance. As a final step, the
    algorithm calculates the 𝐿𝑂𝐹 (Equation (19)). Conventionally the points that have
    a higher anomaly score than their neighbors 𝐿𝑂𝐹 > 1) will be considered as potential
    outliers, but that is not always true, since in anomaly detection there is no
    clear and standard validation approach, and the final decision must relies on
    domain expertise to consider the detected point as an outlier or not, and the
    role of the service ends by notifying the administrators and letting them decide.
    𝐿𝑂 𝐹 𝑘 (𝑥)= ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 𝑘 𝐿𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| × 1 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥) (19) 5. Results
    and Discussions 5.1. Time Series Data Imputation As a result, for handling missing
    data using deep learning, Figure 13 shows the curves for the loss function (MSE)
    and R2 in both training and validation sets during each epoch. For both architectures
    (FFNN and LSTM), the learning curves indicate a good fit of the model represented
    by an initially high training loss that steadily decreases as more training instances
    are added and flattens over time (0.04 for air temperature, 0.098 for global solar
    radiation, and 0.116 for air relative humidity), and the same way for R2, which
    begins with nonoptimal values in training and validation and converges to stable
    change (0.96 for air temperature, 0.84 for global solar radiation, and 0.77 for
    air relative humidity). Table 5 shows the performance comparisons between the
    two deep learning architectures used in the test set. Figure 13. Monitoring of
    MSE and R2 during training and validation phases: air temperature: (a) FFNN, (b)
    LSTM, global solar radiation: (c) FFNN, (d) LSTM, air relative humidity: (e) FFNN,
    (f) LSTM. Table 5. Performance of deep learning models. Table 5 shows the performance
    comparisons between the two deep learning models used in the test set. Once trained,
    the final deep learning model will be ready for deployment in the production environment
    and used to make inferences about meteorological station data given the ERA5-Land
    data. In contrast to Numerical Methods for Weather Prediction (NWP), which take
    considerable time to run [47], predictions based on our model are made instantly.
    5.2. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation We split our dataset into
    five randomly shuffled parts (five folds). We used one fold for model evaluation
    and the remaining four to train it. Finally, we assess the model’s performance
    by calculating the regression metrics across the five folds of the dataset (Root
    Mean Squared Error RMSE and the coefficient of determination R2). According to
    the results of Table 6, the main point is not the perfect results obtained by
    using all parameters as estimators but using only air temperature and global solar
    radiation (average RMSE = 0.27 and average R2 = 0.93), which gave promising results.
    This represents a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0
    by combining two criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using
    limited and simple-to-obtain meteorological variables (air temperature with global
    solar radiation or only air temperature). Table 6. Cross-validation results for
    the three scenarios. According to the results, the proposed method represents
    a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0 by combining two
    criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using limited and simple-to-obtain
    meteorological variables (air temperature with global solar radiation or only
    air temperature). The results obtained are in agreement with the approach followed
    in [48] for the most contributing variables for ET0 estimation, but it outperforms
    it in terms of RMSE (0.19). In addition, the XGboost model used in this study
    outperforms [49] when using all meteorological variables to train a neural network
    (RMSE = 0.19). 5.3. Prototype of the System The platform is named “FLA7A”, which
    means agriculture in Arabic. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the platform’s dashboard.
    By default, it contains the real-time visualization of the last three days of
    hourly weather data (line charts). However, the user can customize the period
    according to their needs. Figure 14. A screenshot of the platform’s real-time
    weather time series visualization service. The black dots represent the original
    measurements, while the black line represents the linear interpolation of the
    dots. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the dashboard that visualizes the last three
    days of hourly weather data. Figure 15 shows the interface of the forecasting
    service. By default, the forecasting period is set to one year. However, the user
    can change this parameter and also customize the number of years it will take
    into consideration when training the model. As mentioned in Section 4.4.2, the
    service initially uses the statistical model Facebook Prophet, which is powerful
    in long-term forecasting. In future work, the platform will integrate more models,
    especially those known for their performance in the task of short-term and mid-term
    weather forecasting, as surveyed in [50]. Figure 15. A screenshot of the platform’s
    forecast service. The light blue is the uncertainty bounds of the uncertainty
    interval around the final predictions (upper and lower), while the dark blue is
    the predicted values, and the black dots represent our original data. This platform
    is the first incremental step towards our goal of creating a decision support
    system intended to implement smart agriculture in Morocco by using artificial
    intelligence and data science to solve real-life problems facing farmers. More
    studies will be performed to add and optimize different parts of this system.
    For example, for data storage, we used MongoDB as a database to deal with real-time
    big data, however, in terms of system scalability or dealing with batch processing
    or long-running ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) jobs, other technologies should
    be considered. A potential candidate for this could be other NoSQL databases [51]
    or the Hadoop ecosystem (Spark, MapReduce, Hive, etc.) [52,53]. Additionally,
    MongoDB has fault tolerance issues, which is true of practically all distributed
    databases. Moreover, in the proposed deep learning method to deal with missing
    data, we do not cover hyperparameter fine-tuning [54], which is one of the biggest
    drawbacks to using deep neural networks. This task can be performed using GridSearch
    [55] or other optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms or the Monte
    Carlo method, which can lead to better results. Despite this, we found promising
    results, confirming the reliability of the ERA5-Land reanalysis data for our study
    area, which could lead to the application of this method using several stations
    in regions with challenging conditions. Finally, for the anomaly detection part,
    we presented an unsupervised machine learning method that is based on how isolated
    a measure is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood to alert administrators
    via SMS and emails, but other efficient methods can be investigated, such as Conformal
    Anomaly Detection (CAP) [56,57]. 6. Conclusions The work conducted in this paper
    makes use of artificial intelligence and big data analytics to develop a platform
    intended for intelligent weather data management, which is essential to implementing
    smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco. The platform exploits huge amounts
    of generated data to gain insights and help assist decision making. The proposed
    platform offers a number of weather-data-related services such as handling missing
    data, visualization, analysis, estimation, and forecasting. Combining ERA5-Land
    reanalysis data and deep learning algorithms to learn the relationship between
    the two data sources gave promising results (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.04) for the
    air temperature variable. The same is true for the estimation of the reference
    evapotranspiration using XGBoost (R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07). The platform is
    designed to be service-oriented and will incorporate other services and solutions
    to help farmers and policymakers. Author Contributions Platform and machine learning

- analysis: 'In recent years, the use of AI and IoT technologies in smart greenhouses
    has gained traction as a means to address the global food challenge. AI-based
    systems can assist farmers in optimizing crop yields, reducing pesticide usage,
    monitoring environmental conditions, and automating various tasks. This review
    paper examines the current state and future potential of AI-based precision agriculture
    systems in the context of greenhouse cultivation.


    **Contributions to Addressing Point:**


    1. **Cost and time savings:** AI can reduce labor costs and time spent on repetitive
    tasks, allowing farmers to focus on higher-value activities.


    2. **Improved crop quality and yield:** AI can optimize environmental conditions,
    monitor plant health, and make informed decisions on irrigation and fertilization,
    leading to increased crop yields and improved quality.


    3. **Reduced environmental impact:** AI can help farmers monitor and reduce their
    environmental impact by optimizing resource use, such as water and fertilizers.


    **Outstanding Limitations:**


    1. **High capital outlay and maintenance costs:** AI systems can be expensive
    to install and maintain, which may be prohibitive for small-scale farmers.


    2. **Data quality and reliability:** The accuracy and effectiveness of AI systems
    rely on the quality and reliability of the data they are trained on, which can
    be a challenge in real-world farming environments.


    3. **Integration challenges:** Integrating AI systems with existing farm management
    practices and infrastructure can be complex and time-consuming.


    4. **Lack of skilled labor:** The adoption of AI in agriculture requires a workforce
    with the necessary skills and knowledge to operate and maintain these systems.


    **Summary of Relevance:**


    Despite these limitations, AI-based precision agriculture systems hold great promise
    for revolutionizing greenhouse cultivation. As the technology continues to develop
    and costs decrease, AI is expected to play an increasingly significant role in
    enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.'

  description: This article presents the current state-of-the-art research on applying
    artificial intelligence (AI) technology in smart greenhouses to optimize crop
    yields, water, and fertilizer use efficiency, to reduce pest and disease, and
    to enhance agricultural sustainability. The key technologies of interest were
    robotic systems for pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting, bio-inspired
    algorithms for the automation of greenhouse processes, energy management, machine
    path planning and operation of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), resolution of
    scheduling problems, and image signal processing for pest and disease diagnosis.
    Additionally, the review investigated the cost benefits of various energy-management
    and AI-based energy-saving technologies, the integration of photovoltaics and
    dynamic pricing based on real-time and time-of-use metrics, and the cost benefits
    of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and RFID (radiofrequency identification)
    technologies. The review established that commercially viable AI technologies
    for agriculture had increased exponentially. For example, AI-based irrigation
    and soil fertilizer application enabled farmers to realize higher returns on investment
    on fertilizer application and gross returns above the fertilizer cost, higher
    yields, and resource use efficiency. Similarly, AI image detection techniques
    led to the early diagnosis of powdery mildew. The precise operation of agricultural
    robots was supported by the integration of light imaging, detection, and ranging
    (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras in place of the traditional GPS (geographic
    positioning systems) technologies, which are prone to errors. However, critical
    challenges remained unresolved, including cost, disparities between research and
    development (R&D) innovations and technology commercialization, energy use, the
    tradeoff between accuracy and computational speeds, and technology gaps between
    the Global North and South. In general, the value of this review is that it surveys
    the literature on the maturity level of various AI technologies in smart greenhouses
    and offers a state-of-the-art picture of how far the technologies have successfully
    been applied in agriculture and what can be done to optimize their usability.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract This article presents the current state-of-the-art
    research on applying artificial intelligence (AI) technology in smart greenhouses
    to optimize crop yields, water, and fertilizer use efficiency, to reduce pest
    and disease, and to enhance agricultural sustainability. The key technologies
    of interest were robotic systems for pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting,
    bio-inspired algorithms for the automation of greenhouse processes, energy management,
    machine path planning and operation of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), resolution
    of scheduling problems, and image signal processing for pest and disease diagnosis.
    Additionally, the review investigated the cost benefits of various energy-management
    and AI-based energy-saving technologies, the integration of photovoltaics and
    dynamic pricing based on real-time and time-of-use metrics, and the cost benefits
    of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and RFID (radiofrequency identification)
    technologies. The review established that commercially viable AI technologies
    for agriculture had increased exponentially. For example, AI-based irrigation
    and soil fertilizer application enabled farmers to realize higher returns on investment
    on fertilizer application and gross returns above the fertilizer cost, higher
    yields, and resource use efficiency. Similarly, AI image detection techniques
    led to the early diagnosis of powdery mildew. The precise operation of agricultural
    robots was supported by the integration of light imaging, detection, and ranging
    (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras in place of the traditional GPS (geographic
    positioning systems) technologies, which are prone to errors. However, critical
    challenges remained unresolved, including cost, disparities between research and
    development (R&D) innovations and technology commercialization, energy use, the
    tradeoff between accuracy and computational speeds, and technology gaps between
    the Global North and South. In general, the value of this review is that it surveys
    the literature on the maturity level of various AI technologies in smart greenhouses
    and offers a state-of-the-art picture of how far the technologies have successfully
    been applied in agriculture and what can be done to optimize their usability.
    Keywords: greenhouses; agriculture; artificial intelligence; intelligent; algorithms;
    robotics 1. Introduction The AI systems of interest include bio-inspired ecological
    and swarm intelligence algorithms, unmanned UAVs (Unmanned aerial vehicles) for
    pesticide application, and robotic systems for harvesting, irrigation, soil treatment,
    fertilizer application, and seeding [1,2]. In addition, the study critiques the
    role of swarm intelligence (genetic optimization algorithms and related algorithms)
    in agricultural parameter optimization, machinery path planning, robotic flight,
    resolution of scheduling problems, system identification, power systems, and image
    and signal processing [1,2]. The multidimensional view of AI (artificial intelligence)
    technologies in smart greenhouses would provide a nuanced understanding of the
    recent milestones in research and development and their implications for commercial
    and smallholder agriculture in the developed global north (North America, Western
    Europe, Mediterranean region, China, Japan, and South Korea) and underdeveloped
    global south (Africa, Latin America, and South Asia) [3]. Emerging technology
    companies, such as Blue River Technology, Harvest CROO Robotics, Trace Genomics,
    and Autonomous Tractor Corp were leading in the commercial deployment of self-driving
    agricultural tractors, AI-based weed control systems, pest diagnostics, soil analysis,
    and crop health monitoring [4,5]. In line with [4,5], Karnawat et al. [6] acknowledged
    the immense role played by Blue River Technology in the advancement of robotics
    and AI systems in agriculture in California and the US in general. These emerging
    trends of AI and machine learning (ML) in agriculture need to be summarized to
    provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art (i.e., maturity levels
    of various AI applications in agriculture, including barriers and facilitators)
    and insights into future developments [7]. Many factors dictate the need to review
    the maturity levels of various AI applications in agriculture. First, there is
    increasing demand for technological solutions to address global food insecurities,
    especially in the Global South. Currently, at least 810 million people are food
    insecure. The actual ratio would increase over time in line with the global population
    growth. By 2050, the global population will surpass 9 billion [8,9]. The higher
    population growth within a generation would strain the already fragile agricultural
    systems and ecosystems that are being gradually destroyed to create additional
    land for farming. Iddio et al. argued that controlled environment agriculture
    (CEA) using greenhouses might help to offset the pressing concerns about agricultural
    sustainability [10]. The case for greenhouse-based CEA was validated by the fact
    that greenhouse crop cultivation improves yields and reduces the need for excess
    pesticides, water, land, and transportation of crops over extended distances.
    The case for CEA advanced by [10] was in tandem with Afzali et al. [11], who supported
    the intensification of agricultural technologies. The need for a paradigm shift
    in agricultural cultivation was premised on the increasing risk of global starvation
    [12]. The AI-mediated improvements in crop yields may help avert the forecasted
    global food crises. Second, a large body of knowledge, including the evidence
    presented by Senavirathne et al. [13] and Haque et al. [12], suggested that the
    satisfaction of future food needs would be achieved by optimizing the existing
    crop production technologies, given there was limited arable land for agricultural
    expansion [14]. In line with [14], Lakshmi and Corbett [15] estimated that smart
    technology in agriculture may help boost yields by 60% before 2030. Conservative
    estimates indicate the EU market for precision agriculture systems will surpass
    11.8 billion by 2025 [16]. The projected market growth and higher yields catalyzed
    the current greenhouse boom. As of 2020, there were 3.6 million hectares of greenhouse
    crops globally [17,18,19,20,21,22]. Third, current climate projection models forecast
    suppressed rainfall, land degradation, desertification, flooding, and other weather
    phenomena triggered by climate change and increased release of greenhouse gases
    [23,24]. The projections documented by [23,24] reflected the current realities
    in Sub-Saharan Africa [25]. The expansion of open-field agriculture to offset
    climate-related challenges is no longer a viable option. The European Commission
    Joint Research Centre estimated that three-quarters of the useful land on earth
    was already degraded, and the proportion of degraded land would surpass 90% by
    2050 [26]. The challenge is most pronounced in developing countries that experienced
    the highest dryland desertification rate between 1982 and 2015. During this period,
    at least 5.4 million km2 of land was degraded [27]. In theory, losing traditional
    farming dryland was a sufficient motivational factor for transitioning to smart
    greenhouses powered by AI technologies. However, the contrary phenomenon is true
    for climate-smart agriculture worldwide [28]. The current pace of transition does
    not match the challenges. On a positive note, the transition to precision agriculture
    would enable farmers to optimally use water, soil, and energy resources to minimize
    the negative effects of climate change on farming [29]. The rational use of agricultural
    resources would reduce the pressure on the natural environment, resulting in higher
    sustainability. The article critiques recent research on smart greenhouses and
    artificial intelligence technologies, including the favorable factors and the
    challenges that have impeded the growth of AI and smart greenhouse technologies.
    The study emphasized smart farming technologies, mechanization of farms, smart
    micro-irrigation, rapid soil analysis, pest prediction, and autonomous modification
    of the greenhouse microclimate, and LIDAR (light Imaging, detection, and ranging),
    optical and electro-optical cameras for robotic system motion and object identification
    (see Figure 1) [30]. The specific scope was supported by the gaps in research
    and the breadth of information relating to the impact of AI and IoT (Internet
    of Things) and data-driven agriculture, intelligent crop planning, and farm gate-to-fork
    systems [31,32]. More particularly, no review has so far comprehensively mapped
    the state of AI and IoT application in smart greenhouse farming to help researchers
    and farmers of plant factories to solve the imminent problems related to global
    food insecurities and climate change, despite the fact that technological innovations
    have been centrally placed in the development of effective and sustainable solutions
    to these challenges. Thus, this review will enable farmers of factory plants to
    understand the extent to which AI and IoT can be combined to improve farming efficiency
    and productivity and will enable researchers to advance knowledge on this subject
    domain by building on the research achieved so far. Figure 1. Smart farming and
    other emerging innovations in the agricultural sector [30]. Method for Systematic
    Review The review of Incorporating Artificial Intelligence Technology in Smart
    Greenhouses was aligned with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and
    meta-analyses (see Figure 2). PRISMA Flowchart shown in Figure 2 below provides
    detailed information about how the 174 articles cited in this review were identified
    and selected. All data were sourced from published articles. The peer-reviewed
    data were sourced from the following primary databases: MDPI, Elsevier, Springer
    (including Nature Springer) and Taylor and Francis, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
    More databases would have been searched, but a quick literature survey revealed
    that that they mostly publish duplicated content, such as between Frontiers and
    Springer.,Emphasis was given to literature published after 2019, since technological
    advancements, especially AI and IoT, are rapidly evolving. The choice of articles
    published from 2019 onwards was therefore motivated by the need to review only
    recent studies in this field. This motivation was also appraised as valid owing
    to the many research studies on the application of AI in agriculture that have
    been published within the past three years. The primary keywords were AI, greenhouses,
    smart, IoT, and agriculture. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were characterized
    by a title and abstract screening, followed by a full-text and abstract screening
    process, which focused on the subject’s relevance. Articles were excluded if they
    did not discuss the role of various AI technologies in agriculture. Studies were
    also excluded if they did not use any methodological approach to analyze and synthesize
    data before making conclusions. Studies published in non-English languages were
    also excluded to avoid translation errors and associated financial costs and factual
    consequences. The research design of the studies did not matter, but primary studies
    with experimental design were given priority over others during the selection
    process. Figure 2. PRISMA diagram. 2. Artificial Intelligence Technologies for
    Smart Greenhouses 2.1. Historical Background of AI and ICTs in Agriculture Using
    AI and ICT in precision agriculture is not a new phenomenon. Rao et al. [33] traced
    the use of ICTs in precision agriculture back to the 20th century. In 1958, psychologist
    Frank Rosenblatt first formulated and proposed artificial neural networks as mathematical
    models of artificial intelligence whose mathematical structure attempted to mimic
    the functionality of biological neurons [34]. More specifically, in this first
    work, the well-known mathematical simulant of Perceptron, which is the first structure
    of the artificial neural network, was successfully employed to simulate how the
    human brain processes optical data and learns to recognize objects. The first
    structure of Perceptron is the main basis and architecture of the neural networks
    that have been extensively used in precision agriculture and other disciplines.
    Perception marked a historic key point in artificial intelligence research and
    commercial adoption with the coining of a phrase that embodied an entire field
    within AI. AI techniques have developed because of the complexity of the technological
    era, where a plethora of complex problems with a strongly non-linear nature cannot
    be solved using classical deterministic techniques, such as regression analysis
    and least-squared methods. Despite their novelty, it took four decades (until
    the early 1990s) for artificial neural networks to be used widely in medical applications
    [35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42], computational engineering [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53],
    and precision agriculture. The historical analysis of ICTs in agriculture by Rao
    et al. [33,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53] aligns with the broader trends in
    the global demand for AI, ML, and IoT, as noted by Misra et al. [33]. On the downside,
    the true potential of AI and ICTs has not been fully exploited. The observation
    was validated by the fact that the transition of ICT technologies from computing
    to agriculture was delayed, considering the field of artificial intelligence was
    first proposed in 1955 and expanded in subsequent years [8]. During the early
    phases of precision agriculture, the key focus was improving crop yields and productivity
    by monitoring soil nutrients. However, the scope of precision agriculture has
    broadened to encompass artificial pollination using robot bees, autonomous operation
    of farm equipment, and optimization of different agricultural processes using
    bio-inspired algorithms [1,54,55]. The technology patterns demonstrate a peak
    in AL technologies from 2016 onwards. The convergence of new technologies in precision
    agriculture ushered in the Industry 4.0 revolution and the Internet of Plants
    (IoP) [56] (see Figure 3). The figure demonstrates how the availability of digital
    sensors and IoT can be used to collect environmental data, such as light, temperature,
    humidity, nutrition, and water, and then be stored in a cloud-based server, which
    can supply information for various farm work operations. However, there is growing
    criticism of AI technologies in agriculture due to their higher energy demand,
    high initial capital outlay, and variable accuracy [17]. These concerns have been
    discounted in view of the immense benefits of AI systems, including better crop
    yields, lower labor costs, and improved efficiency [57]. Figure 3. Core attributes
    and the link between IoP and IoT [56]. The current scope of AI and IoT in smart
    greenhouses encompasses artificial lighting using LEDs [58], air ventilation,
    water and nutrition pumps, plant nutrition, humidity control, moisture control,
    and temperature control subsystems with a unique combination of sensors and controls
    with distinct attributes [13]. The impact of weeds, pests, diseases, and water
    stress on crop yields validated the broadening scope of AI in precision agriculture.
    Egorov et al. [59] noted that livermore was a pervasive weed across the US, impacting
    the germination and growth of plants. In line with Egorov et al., [8,59] noted
    that improper management of weeds could potentially reduce crop yields by 48–60%.
    However, the projected reduction in crop yields due to pest infestation observed
    by [8] contrasts with Raatz et al., who reported up to 60% losses in harvests
    due to pest infestation [60], but attributed the phenomena to biotic culprits,
    including weed growth. Despite the contrasting observations made by Raatz et al.
    [60] and [8], poor management of crop pests and diseases had a detrimental effect
    on crop yields. The devastating impact of South American tomato pinworm on sweet
    pepper and tomato in Almería, Southeastern Spain, was a case in point [61]. In
    the latter case, the Spanish farmers had to rely on toxic pesticides, such as
    Chlorpyrifos-methyl, to manage the pests [61,62]. Reducing human exposure to toxic
    pesticides through the mechanization of greenhouse spraying activities yielded
    significant benefits in the long term [63]. Additionally, intelligent IPM (Integrated
    pest management) practices may offset the emerging pesticide resistance threats.
    2.2. Current AI Technologies for Agriculture The AI technologies available for
    smart greenhouses and precision agriculture are diverse, ranging from ecological
    bio-inspired algorithms, such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System–Particle
    Swarm Optimization (ANFIS-PSO), ANFIS-GA (ANFIS with Genetic Algorithm) and ANFIS-ACO
    (ANFIS with Ant Colony Optimization), swarm intelligence algorithms (Artificial
    Bee Colony (ABC), Flower Pollination algorithm (FPA), Firefly algorithm, Krill
    Herd algorithm, and genetic optimization algorithms) [64] to UAV (drones) pesticide
    application and robotic systems for harvesting [9], irrigation, soil treatment,
    seeding, fertilizer application, seeding, and other tasks [1,2]. The current body
    of knowledge linked the demand for robotics, UAVs, and bio-inspired algorithms
    in agriculture to distinct factors. On the one hand, scholars argued that the
    growth was catalyzed by the need to enhance yields and operational efficiency
    and reduce costs [8,29,33]. In line with [5,29,33], Cao et al. reported a 10%
    improvement in tomato yields with the iGrow intelligent greenhouse system and
    92% higher profits [18]. On the other hand, AI assimilation in smart agriculture
    was triggered by natural events, including higher levels of pesticide resistance
    and forest fires, which compromised agricultural production [65,66]. The following
    sections critiqued the two worldviews to yield better insights into the favorable
    factors and barriers to AI-system adoption in smart greenhouses and precision
    agriculture at large. 2.2.1. Cost Benefits of AI Technologies for Agriculture
    The focus on the role of AI systems in smart greenhouses and the agricultural
    sector, in general, was validated by the unique challenges and the enormous contribution
    in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA). Agriculture provided direct employment to
    approximately 4.4% of the population in Europe, and its GVA exceeded €181 billion
    [67]. The scenario was not specific to the EU; at least 70% of the Indian population
    depended on agriculture for employment and sustenance [68]. Despite the enormous
    contribution, the future of agriculture in Europe and across the world is threatened
    by population dynamics; most European farmers are older (>80%), while a minority
    are below 40 years [67]. In contrast to the European Economic and Social Committee’s
    report [67] on the impact of demographics on agricultural technology adoption,
    Loudjani et al. [69] argued that the primary barriers were time and costs. The
    average cost of installing AI systems on farms was enormous and beyond the reach
    of smallholder farmers [70]. The contrary was true for large commercial farms
    with a higher capacity to absorb costs and risks and a higher tendency to allocate
    resources for capital-intensive investments [71]. The concerns raised by Kendall
    et al. [70] were supported by the Cisco and the International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU) report [72], which noted that agricultural sensors for AI systems
    with greater functionality are expensive ($150–$1000+ per sensor). The initial
    capital outlay was a key impediment to technology adoption, considering that multiple
    sensors are required for monitoring greenhouse microclimate (humidity, temperature,
    soil nutrient, water levels, and pH). From another dimension, the expenses were
    relative, given that local production of smart greenhouse components may offset
    costs [73]; this view was corroborated by Chung’s study [73] on South Korean companies
    Hyundai Metal Farming Company, Sewoon, DaeSungHione, and Dae Ryun and local production
    of precision farming systems, such as sensors, actuators, fans, heaters, dehumidifiers,
    and window motors. In contrast, there was insufficient production capacity in
    developing countries. The cost-centric worldview advanced by Kendall et al. [70]
    and Loudjani et al. [69] negated the role of externalities. Lakshmi and Corbett
    [18] argued that the effectiveness of AI systems was largely dependent on the
    willingness of the local stakeholders to “modify, generate, and extend their operational
    capabilities to improve efficiency” (p. 5209). Additionally, the processes, AI
    resources, and tools (including drones, sensors, and robots) employed by commercial
    farms profoundly impacted the effectiveness of AI systems. Drawing from Lakshmi
    and Corbett’s study [18], the cost was not a primary barrier to AI technology
    adoption. 2.2.2. Water and Fertilizer Use Efficiency and Crop Yields with AI Systems
    The success of the GOSSYM (a combined simulation model for plant growth and decision)
    aid for cotton crop management mode influenced the iterative development of other
    AI systems, including the HortiMED-AI-powered Decision Support Systems (DSSs)
    [74]. On a positive note, the barriers to the transition from labor- and input-intensive
    agriculture to knowledge-based farming would be eliminated over time; this is
    evident with the recent innovations in AI systems for smart/precision agriculture.
    In 2022, Otazua reported the successful development of the HortiMED-AI-powered
    decision support systems (DSSs) that facilitated autonomous greenhouse control
    using sensors, “multilayer hierarchical control architecture,” smart algorithms,
    “hybrid modeling combining well-known mechanistic models with AI techniques,”
    IoT, and machine learning (p. 1) [74]. The HortiMED-DSS was capable of facilitating
    cost-effective automation of greenhouse heating, ventilation, and fertigation,
    and providing expert services relating to nutrient, crop, and climatic conditions
    (fertilizer and water application rates and timelines). The observations made
    by [74] regarding the benefits of automating greenhouse were in tandem with Cui
    et al. [75]; precision irrigation and fertilizer application led to higher nitrogen
    use and water use efficiency, and in turn, a lower risk of pests and diseases
    in greenhouse cucumbers in China’s Yangling region. The observations made by Cui
    et al. [75] about AI-mediated water-use efficiency corroborated the study by Lin
    et al., which noted that AI technologies provided water to crops within their
    demand ranges [76]. From a theoretical point of view, Cui et al. [75] and Lin
    et al. [76] advanced a simplistic view of sensor operation, which did not align
    with Briciu-Burghina et al. [77]. In the latter case, Briciu-Burghina et al. [77]
    argued that the accuracy of the soil moisture sensors was dependent on hardware
    components and environmental degradation of the sensor components. In line with
    Briciu-Burghina et al. [77], there were cases when the dielectric soil moisture
    sensors failed to accurately measure periodic changes in the soil moisture levels;
    this had a negative domino effect on demand irrigation. The faulty measurements
    were linked to either corrosion or hardware malfunction. The outcome reported
    by Briciu-Burghina et al. [77] negated the impact of soil type on sensor malfunction—an
    issue that was extensively investigated by Shamshiri et al. [78]. The study confirmed
    that the “resistive sensor operates defectively in sandy loam and clay loam soils
    owing to low bulk density and high organic matter” (p. 5) Emerging research recommended
    the adoption of capacitive soil moisture sensors to counteract the limitations
    of the resistive sensors. From the researcher’s perspective, the risk of corrosion
    was disproportionately higher, considering the dielectric sensors were buried
    in situ and the soils were humid [77]. The risk of sensor malfunction highlights
    the potential drawbacks and limits of demand-driven agriculture. Despite the mounting
    evidence on the risk of a sensor malfunction, the technology issues are often
    disregarded due to cost considerations and the anticipated cost savings. Cui et
    al. [75] reported a 17.5% higher cucumber yield following the introduction of
    AI-based irrigation, while the partial factor productivity of applied nitrogen
    increased by 29%. Similarly, with AI-based systems, Sharma et al. [79] reported
    a 17% improvement in wheat grain yields. Considering the outcomes were statistically
    significant (p < 0.005), AI-based irrigation and fertilizer application yielded
    tangible benefits compared to traditional drip irrigation and manual soil fertilization.
    The positive outcomes reported by Cui et al. [75] were consistent with the Sharma
    et al. case study in Saudi Arabia, where superior partial factor productivity
    of applied nitrogen with ANN (Artificial neural network) models was established
    [79]. Since no experimental data contradicted the positive findings made by Cui
    et al. [75] and Sharma et al. [79], it appears that the AI technologies were cost-effective
    and may enable farmers to achieve higher returns on investment on fertilizer application
    and gross returns above the fertilizer cost. The use-efficiency-related benefits
    that emerged from applying fertilizers were comparable to pesticide-use efficiency.
    Facchinetti et al. [80] reported a 50% reduction in the use of pesticides based
    on an initial theoretical mixture of 1000 L/ha. The introduction of computational
    algorithms helped to reduce the demand for pesticides to 470 L/ha. The study confirmed
    that the pesticide application rates could be further reduced to 300 L/ha [80].
    Facchinetti et al. hypothesized a 33% reduction in pesticide use [80], which does
    not match Claver’s research, which noted it was possible to reduce pesticide usage
    by up to 78% using the state-of-the-art algorithm systems developed by Israel-based
    Greeneye Technology [81]. Similarly, Shankar et al. postulated that intelligent
    technologies enabled farmers to practice variable rate application (VAR), which
    provided real-time data on the areas most infested with pests and diseases [82].
    The utility of the VAR was further reinforced by the xarvio Spray Timer and SprayWeather,
    which enabled farmers to establish the most appropriate window for spraying. Drawing
    from the empirical data provided by [82], VAR eliminated the need to apply excessive
    fertilizers in areas least affected by pesticides, and was an ideal alternative
    compared to the system proposed by Facchinetti et al. [80]. The use of fewer pesticides
    in the production of freshly cut salads had a beneficial effect on human health,
    considering pesticide residues in foods were risk factors for myriad non-communicable
    diseases. On the downside, the benefits that accrue from DSS, VAR for pesticides,
    xarvio Spray Timer and SprayWeather, AI-based fertilizer, irrigation, and other
    systems may be less relevant to remote areas with limited IT infrastructure and
    technical expertise [8]. However, these challenges may not persist in the long
    term, considering the high pace of IT infrastructure deployment in rural and urban
    areas, previously classified as unprofitable for such ventures [83]. From another
    perspective, the deployment of IT infrastructure would only provide a partial
    solution, given the aging of the population was also a major issue of concern.
    2.3. AI Systems for Integrated Pest Management Despite the concerns raised about
    the prohibitive costs, the proponents of AI argue that the long-term benefits
    outweigh the short-term costs [84,85]. The reliable use of AI systems to predict
    rice production was a case in point [85]. Beyond the prediction of crop production,
    AI systems facilitated the development of intelligent IPM systems capable of detecting
    early infestation of white flies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum and Bemisia argentifolii)
    and thrips (Thrips tabaci, Frankliniella intonsa, Thrips hawaiiensis, and Thrips
    tabaci) [57]. The observations made by Rustia et al. [57] reinforce earlier observations
    made by Karar et al. [14] on the suitability of deep learning systems in the management
    of pests and diseases. From a commercial perspective, the findings reported by
    Rustia et al. [57] and Karar et al. [14] were compelling, but inadequate for catalyzing
    a paradigm shift in the market; this view was reinforced by the fact that the
    existing stock of Al systems for pest identification and management focused on
    insect pheromone identification [86]. The pheromone-centric ANN and wireless sensor
    network (WSN) technology cannot control all insect types, considering there is
    a limited number of commercially available pheromones for IPM [86]. Despite the
    reservations reported by Singh et al. [86], the ANN–WSN system for pest identification
    accurately categorized harmful and beneficial insects; these data guided the calculation
    of the volume of pesticides for IPM. The limits of WSN technology highlighted
    by [86] were in tandem with [87], who noted that variable monitoring ranges, complex
    typologies, and environmental conditions compromised the operation of WSN systems.
    However, recent R&D evidence suggests otherwise. The shortcomings of WSN identified
    by [86,87] negate recent milestones achieved by Sacaleanu et al. [88] with wireless
    sensors and actuators networks (WSAN). WSAN is an upgrade of WSN developed to
    resolve most of the limitations of WSN using actuators for better monitoring and
    control. The advances made using WSAN have not been accompanied by greater market
    adoption, owing to the newness of the technology; most studies still focus on
    WSN technologies for smart greenhouses [19,89]. Beyond the concerns about the
    pace of market adoption, the body of knowledge, including Rustia et al. [57],
    Singh et al. [86], and Karar et al. [14], was informed by small-scale experiments
    under controlled conditions. Real-life applications of AI systems (IRIS scout
    robots and robot scouts) in identifying pests and diseases in agriculture yielded
    false positive data after analyzing pheromone trap images and powdery mildew [90].
    Since the latter findings were based on market data, the IRIS scout robots and
    robot scouts were not ready for market adoption. Inaccurate assessment of pests
    and disease infestation using AI and ML (machine learning) image analysis techniques
    would result in the excessive application of pesticides. Further research and
    development efforts were necessary to minimize false positive rates. 2.4. Robotics
    and Algorithms for Precision Agriculture and Smart Greenhouses Recently, commercial
    farms have deployed robotic systems to selectively harvest fragile fruits and
    vegetables such as broccoli and tomatoes [91]. The findings by [91] were in agreement
    with Lee et al. [92], who documented the increased use of robotic systems to sort
    tomatoes based on color, size, shape, and mass and to identify all defects during
    the harvesting process. The case for AI robotic systems in smart farming advanced
    by Kootstra et al. [91] was corroborated by Vidwath et al. [93] and Navas et al.
    [94], who highlighted the benefits of soft robotic grippers in fruit and vegetable
    harvesting. In contrast to Vidwath et al. [93] and Navas et al. [94], Tianhua
    et al. [95] argued that AI robotic systems could perform a wide range of unsafe
    greenhouse tasks beyond harvesting. Such applications include pesticide spraying
    and UV-C treatment of crops to mitigate the spread of powdery mildew. From a human
    health perspective, Tianhua et al. [95] perspective on the use of robotic systems
    for pesticide application was validated by pesticide toxicity studies [61,62,96].
    For example, Chlorpyrifos-methyl, a common pesticide employed in integrated pest
    management of the South American tomato pinworm, caused cholinesterase inhibition
    in humans and death in severe cases [62]. In other studies, mechanical AI systems
    enabled farmers to reduce their labor requirements by up to 90% [13]. However,
    the actual reduction rates can be contested, considering robots cannot entirely
    replace human labor. Empirical data supported the arguments concerning costs and
    operational efficiency of AI systems in farms. Hou et al. [97] used Dynamic Artificial
    Bee–Ant Colony algorithm (DABACA) to optimize agricultural machinery plant operational
    cycle and route planning. The study reported better optimization, convergence
    accuracy (>90%), and reduced operational cycles, which translated to significant
    cost savings. The observations made by Hou et al. [97] using DABACA were in line
    with Cao et al. [98], whose bio-inspired algorithm-mediated task assignment of
    agricultural machinery, which employed ant colony algorithm-based B-patterns to
    improve the operational efficiency of agricultural equipment, including the fuel
    used and non-working distance covered during routine farm operations. However,
    critics argue that the positive outcomes drawn from experimental studies, such
    as the observations made by Hou et al. [97] and Cao et al. [98], did not justify
    the widespread adoption of AI systems in greenhouses. The concerns were premised
    on the following factors. First, AI systems in agriculture lacked standardized
    accuracy rates. The system accuracy varied depending on the local environmental
    conditions and operational factors. Second, the risk of error remained regardless
    of the algorithm’s robustness [99,100]. However, the higher risk of errors was
    not ubiquitous. Proietti et al. established that RNN (Recurrent neural network)-based
    decoder–encoder systems exhibited great potential in the early detection of anomalies
    [101]. Similarly, Aytenfsu et al. noted that Elman Recurrent Neural Network (ERNN)
    was 98% accurate in predicting greenhouse temperature and humidity levels. The
    case-specific error theory provided better context concerning the benefits and
    limits of AI systems in smart greenhouses. Even though [99,100] raised valid concerns
    about the constraints, commercial adoption should be encouraged. The positive
    assessment of AI systems in commercial agriculture was validated by successful
    commercial adoption. For example, Gao et al. [102] used an ANN model to quantify
    crop evapotranspiration rates in Saudi Arabia. The ANN model yielded better estimates
    than traditional approaches to estimating evapotranspiration. Accurate determination
    of the plant evapotranspiration rates provided useful data for automated irrigation
    algorithms. Beyond the estimation of the crop evapotranspiration rates, the ANN
    and WDNN algorithms were equally proven useful in predicting the photosynthetic
    rates of plants, among other physiological indices that predict plant growth rates
    and yield [103]. In other cases, hybrid algorithms were proven reliable in weed
    prediction/optimization [104,105], and the determination of the soil cation exchange
    capacity [106]. The positive assessment of ANN technologies reinforces earlier
    observations by Proietti et al. [101] on the fusion of deep learning and artificial
    intelligence (RNN encoders and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)) to facilitate learning
    patterns in time series and modeling data sequences using monitored parameters
    to predict crop growth indicators in greenhouses. The case for RNN advanced by
    Proietti et al. [101] negated critical shortcomings identified by Codeluppi et
    al. [107]; NN systems were inferior to LSTM owing to the long time series and
    vanishing gradient problem, which made it difficult to train the model on long-term
    dependencies. The latter findings validate the emerging transition from LSTM to
    RNN. Gao et al. [102] and Hu et al.’s [103] bias toward new algorithms for greenhouses
    was validated by the following considerations. First, modern greenhouses are complex;
    there are dynamic relationships between different greenhouse parameters, and the
    data mining ability of traditional models is insufficient to facilitate the extraction
    of all useful information. Second, the traditional models’ low precision and convergence
    speeds made them incompatible with modern intelligent greenhouses. On the downside,
    the research of Gao et al. [102] and Hu et al. [103] negated the fact that the
    transition from traditional to modern algorithms does not automatically translate
    to higher prediction accuracy and sensitivity. The hybrid algorithms must be combined
    with the appropriate classifiers to yield better accuracy and specificity [105].
    For example, Tao and Wei achieved a 92% accuracy with the CNN (Convolutional Neural
    Network)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for weed recognition [104]. However,
    SVM coupled with the ANN algorithm proved inferior compared to the emerging class
    of deep learning models. CNN was paired with SVM because the former exhibited
    satisfactory results in computer pattern recognition, but unsatisfactory results
    in artificial differentiation of weeds. The SVM model helped to address this challenge
    [104]. In contrast to Tao and Wei [104], Emamgholizadeh et al. [106] proposed
    a three-model algorithm integrating particle swarm, integrated invasive weed optimization,
    and support vector for accurate weed recognition. Drawing from the latter study,
    the development of algorithms for evaluating greenhouse parameters should be customized
    to match local conditions and requirements. The findings of Emamgholizadeh et
    al. [106] were corroborated by Ibrahim et al., who noted that the integrated particle
    swarm algorithm was ideal for selecting discriminant features [108]. On the downside,
    widespread adoption is constrained by a paucity of temporal data for precise predictions
    and training of AI and ML systems. Karnawat et al. argued that the lack of suitable
    historical data would be a critical impediment to the adoption of AI systems in
    agriculture. The latter findings contradict the positive narratives advanced by
    Emamgholizadeh et al. [106] and Ibrahim et al. [108] concerning the immense potential
    of CNN and ANN algorithms in intelligent farming. The increased reliance on bio-inspired
    algorithms in crop irrigation is justified, given traditional irrigation methods
    resulted in a 60% waste of water resources [38]. The suitability of different
    algorithms in predicting the evapotranspiration rates is depicted in Table 1.
    The data show that ELM-GA, ELM-CSA, ELM-ACO, and ELM PFA were ideal models for
    determining the evapotranspiration rates, since the R2 (coefficient of determination)
    values were close to unity. In addition, the relative mean, standard error, and
    mean of absolute value of errors (MAE) values were within the acceptable range
    [109]. The performance of ELM-GA/CSA/CSO/PFA raises questions on whether bio-inspired
    algorithms are better than traditional ones. Such concerns were informed by the
    study of Chahidi et al., which achieved comparable R2, RSME (Relative Standard
    Mean Error), and MAE values using ANN, SVM, and Gaussian process regression techniques
    [110]. Following the comparison of the validation and test performance, it was
    deduced that the choice of ANN/SVM, GPR vis-à-vis ELM-GA/CSA/CSO/PFA should consider
    other variables beyond R2, RSME, and MAE. The observations were justified by the
    model-specific training time and performance in the validation phase [110]. The
    selection of the appropriate algorithm is key to collecting reliable real-time
    data using sensors to help eliminate excessive waste of water, pesticides, and
    fertilizers. Table 1. Evapotranspiration data collected using ELM statistical
    methods and bio-inspired algorithms [109]. AI-based irrigation techniques offer
    additional benefits, including reduced risk of powdery mildew and Botrytis and
    fungal pathogen spores caused by excess humidity in greenhouses (due to inadequate
    regulation of water molecule condensation during sunrise and sunset and on cold,
    cloudy days) [111]. Proactive prevention of crop pests and disease directly impacts
    crop yields, considering powdery mildew and Botrytis limit chlorophyll formation
    through conidia and conidiophores on the leaf surfaces. Recent advances in AI
    technology for agricultural production facilitated autonomous monitoring of chlorophyll
    formation using the SPAD value, which is a proxy measure for wavelength absorbance
    [112]. However, the reliability of the measurements is contingent on the chloroplast
    movements and light intensity. Liu et al. [111] employed long short-term memory
    neural network systems to effectively manage powdery mildew in greenhouse structures.
    The findings reported by Liu et al. [111] were in line with the research of Abdulridha
    et al. [113] and other experimental studies, which supported using AI technology
    to prevent pests and diseases in greenhouses. In particular, Abdulridha et al.
    relied on UAV-based hyperspectral imaging and artificial intelligence to accurately
    diagnose the presence of powdery mildew [113] (see Figure 4). However, the case
    made by Abdulridha et al. [113] and Liu et al. [111] was not aligned with Pane
    et al. [114], who noted that machine learning techniques were equally effective
    in the management of powdery mildew. Figure 4. Hyperspectral imaging and artificial
    intelligence detection of powdery mildew in squash plant leaves. Images labeled
    (a–c) demonstrate different developmental stages of the powdery mildew disease
    in in-house leaves; (e,f) represent disease severity in outdoor squash plants.
    (a) Powdery mildew was not detected in the regions of interest. (b) Low severity
    of the powdery mildew disease (in-house photos). (c) High severity of the powdery
    mildew disease. (d) Powdery mildew was not detected in the regions of interest
    (outdoor plants). (e) Low severity of the powdery mildew disease (outdoor plants).
    (f) High severity of the powdery mildew disease (outdoor plants) [113]. The concerns
    raised by Abdulridha et al. [113], Liu et al. [111], and Pane et al. [114] about
    the reliability of the algorithms for powdery mildew diagnosis are but a microcosm
    of the limits of image detection techniques. Future R&D is anticipated to resolve
    these challenges. 2.4.1. Role of AI Technologies and Biological Pesticide Compounds
    in IPM The use of AI technologies in place of chemical products (including Prestop®,
    Microflora PROTM, and Active Flower™) and biological powdery mildew management
    techniques was validated by ecological and cost considerations [115] and the mixed
    benefits of bio-pesticide formulations (such as succinic acid and methanolic extract
    of Rosmarinus officinalis) [96]. The case for the biological control interventions
    by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96] was in line with the research of Arnaouty et al.
    [116], which affirmed that biological control agents were effective compared to
    the traditional chemical agents (including Radiant 12% SC, Kanemite 15% SC and
    Actra 25% WG) in the management of pests, including whitefly, Frankliniella occidentalis,
    and flower thrips [116]. In addition to the superior efficacy of the biological
    control agents, the sweet pepper plants exhibited superior yields (35% better)
    following treatment with the biological control agents. Despite the positive observations
    made by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96] and Arnaouty et al. [116], one must acknowledge
    that the effectiveness of the biological control agents is contingent on the seasons
    and the intensity of the pests and disease. The biological control agents might
    be less effective if there is a high intensity of pests and diseases. Other major
    issues of concern with biological control agents include the mixed performance
    of the biological control agents. Despite the reservations, the emphasis on biological
    rather than commercial IPM technicals by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96] and Arnaouty
    et al. [116] represents an emerging pattern in commercial agriculture, guided
    by the need to conserve the environment and reduce pesticide resistance—a phenomenon
    that is most common with commercial pesticides [75]. For example, studies conducted
    in the Russian Federation established that mites gradually became resistant to
    avermectin pesticides in the past 20 years [117]. The observations made by [117]
    in the Russian Federation were comparable to the research of Kirisik and Dagli’s
    [118] and Solmaz et al. [66] in Turkey, where farmers recorded higher Tetranychus
    Urtic resistance to Bifenazate and Abamectin. The observations made by Kirisik
    and Dagli [118] and Solmaz et al. [66] concerning the growing pesticide resistance
    in Turkey were affirmed by Alpkent et al. [119], who attributed the arrhenotokous
    reproduction and high fecundity of Tetranychus urticae populations in greenhouses
    to acaricide resistance. However, in the latter case, the pesticides were resistant
    to a wide range of pesticides, bifenthrin, and hexythiazox. From a globalist perspective,
    Tetranychus urticae resistance to pesticides would create a monumental challenge
    for Turkey and the larger EU. Acaricides purchases represented 14% of the pesticide
    expenditure in the continent [120]. Higher expenditure on acaricides denotes greater
    dependence, which has catastrophic effects on crop yields if widespread pesticide
    resistance is documented. Even though there was compelling evidence to catalyze
    the industry transition to biopesticides and intelligent IPM, the rate of biological
    agent adoption was inadequate [121]; this was despite favorable legislation and
    regulations, including Regulation (EC) No. 1107/2009 and 2016/2903 (RSP) [122].
    Current research does not provide clear-cut reasons why biological agents have
    not outpaced chemical control agents in the market. On the one hand, Liu et al.
    attributed the phenomenon to risk aversion among farmers coupled with an unfavorable
    marketing environment for biological pesticides in China [121]. On the other hand,
    the low adoption was linked to the variable effectiveness of the biological control
    agents relative to chemical pesticides, and the longer duration needed to secure
    financial returns following years of R&D investment [123]. The operational challenges
    highlighted by leading biological pesticide manufacturers supported this narrative.
    From another dimension, the limited uptake of biological pesticides could be linked
    to adopting a wide range of complementary interventions, including crop diversification
    and growing advocacy for pesticide-free agriculture [124,125]. Statistics compiled
    by the EU confirmed that farmers were assimilating pesticide-free agriculture
    policies; this was evident from the consistent reduction in the level of pesticide
    dependence—the most notable improvement was observed in the Czech Republic, where
    pesticide use reduced by 38% between 2011 and 2020. A similar downward trend was
    observed in Denmark, Portugal, and Romania, with each country recording a 20%
    drop in pesticide demand [120]. The pesticide use patterns documented by [120]
    were in agreement with Facchinetti et al. [80], who documented a marginal change
    in pesticide use from the 1990s to the late 2000s as a result of the stringent
    regulatory measures imposed by the EU, including Directive 2009/128/CE. A contrary
    trend was observed in Latvia and Austria, where pesticide demand increased by
    77% and 61%, respectively. In contrast to the statistics provided by Eurostat
    [120], Neumeister noted that EU farmers were locked into pesticide use [126],
    creating an eternal lose–lose situation for all stakeholders. The lose–lose situation
    was evident from the declining genetic diversity, impaired crop yields due to
    lower insect-assisted pollination, and the destruction of local ecosystems. The
    contrasting observations about pesticide use and the rates and barriers to biopesticide
    market entry affirm the complexity of phasing out chemical pesticides from the
    market. On a positive note, the scenario is forecasted to change with the gradual
    introduction of AI technologies in pest management. Karar et al. deployed cloud-based
    solutions and CNN networks to target red spider, flax budworm, cicadellidae, aphids,
    and flea beetles [14]. Early detection of pesticides using AI technologies would
    facilitate timely responses using AI and IoT infrastructure. The observations
    made by Karar et al. [14] were corroborated by Rustia et al., who integrated both
    AI and IoT systems in developing a new and intelligent system of IPM (see Figure
    5). The IPM system shown in Figure 5 shows the use of sensors and image data during
    the data collection phase, which are then stored in a database and processed within
    the same server, using analytics to provide useful outputs, such as hotspot detection
    and other models that can aid decision-making on the farm. The system was > 90%
    effective in managing thrips and whitefly [57]. In both cases, intelligent IPM
    techniques had the potential to reduce pesticide usage, resulting in significant
    cost savings. However, the short-term investment costs are a major impediment
    [121,123]. The observations made by [60,62] reflect the broader concerns about
    the future of Al in agriculture highlighted by Karnawat et al. [6]. However, in
    the latter case, the researchers argued the challenge might be addressed by developing
    affordable interventions in open-source platforms to ensure higher penetration
    among farmers. Figure 5. Key attributes of the intelligent IPM system [14]. The
    proponents of intelligent IPM coupled with biopesticides argue that there were
    immediate short-term benefits. For example, the crop yield was higher with intelligent
    and biological IPM compared to traditional chemical pesticides [116]. Moreover,
    the domino health benefits for humans and cost savings in commercial farming are
    unquantifiable. The latter evidence affirms there were justifiable grounds for
    the transition from traditional to intelligent IPM methods. The paradigm shift
    would benefit global agriculture, considering that pests and diseases accounted
    for up to 40% of global crop losses [14]. In contrast to the cost-related issues
    highlighted by Ni and Punja [115], continuous and excessive pesticide use has
    a detrimental impact on pest management, given the high risk of pesticide resistance.
    Pesticide resistance and incompatibility have partly led to the spread of the
    South American tomato pinworm Tuta absoluta [61] and mites. The current strains
    of the South American tomato pinworm can only be eradicated using strong and toxic
    pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos-methyl and Spinosad [61]. Even though pesticide
    toxicity and resistance risk can be mitigated with biopesticide formulations,
    adoption has remained low owing to their variable effectiveness across different
    classes of pests and diseases. For example, succinic acid and methanolic extract
    of Rosmarinus officinalis were only proven effective against Aphis gossypii in
    cucumber grown in greenhouses [96]. The lack of broad-spectrum biopesticides may
    partly explain why the demand for chemical pesticides remained unchanged; this
    phenomenon introduced new constraints, considering industrial greenhouses cannot
    be used in isolation. Glinushkin et al. proposed an alternative approach, focusing
    on less-potent chemical pesticides, such as Confidor Extra and Nocturne. On the
    downside, these pesticides were only effective against the phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus
    barkeri Hughes, and their efficacy was limited to approximately 25% [117]. According
    to the data in Table 2, the mortality rate for the mites was notably higher for
    avermectin pesticide (>93%) (see Table 2). The application of Confidor, Actellic,
    Scelta, and malathion did not yield mortality rates comparable to avermectin.
    The data suggested that pest mortality rates were proportional to the strength
    of the pesticides [117]. The estimates provided by [117] were comparable to experimental
    data drawn from Turkey [118,119]. Turkish farmers had recorded high levels of
    red spider mite (Tetranychus Urtica) resistance to Bifenazate and Abamectin (acaricides)
    [118,119]. Higher mite mortality rates (>90%) were observed with the adoption
    of aggressive pest management techniques, including mite-dipping and leaf dipping.
    The widespread pesticide resistance further validates the need for intelligent
    IPM systems. Table 2. Potency of different classes of pesticides against mites
    [117]. Drawing from the IPM management practices for Aphis gossypii and phytoseiid
    mite Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes reported by [96,117], farmers with commercial greenhouses
    were faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, law regulations advocated using less
    toxic pesticides [127]. However, ecologically benign biopesticides were not broad-acting.
    On the other hand, chemical pesticides with broad-spectrum activity against pests
    and diseases were toxic to the environment [117,121,122,124]. In light of the
    critical shortcomings of traditional pesticides in greenhouse agriculture, the
    proactive management of powdery mildew and Aphis gossypii, among other pests and
    diseases, using AI and other smart technologies might yield enormous benefits
    to farmers. Complementary techniques for disease detection are needed, considering
    that the research of Abdulridha et al. [113], Liu et al. [111], and Pane et al.
    [114] confirmed that AI-based disease detection systems had critical shortcomings.
    For example, the detection of powdery mildew was impacted by the UV wavelength,
    the camera properties, and the location of the infected leaves in relation to
    the non-infected leaves. The shortcomings of AI-based disease detection systems
    in greenhouse and open-field agriculture raise pertinent questions about sustainable
    IPM practices. Two theories were advanced in the literature. On the one hand,
    proponents of the current status quo supported the continued use of pesticides
    to manage aggressive pests and diseases, including Orius laevigatus, Nesidiocoris
    tenuis, Tuta absoluta, and Amblyseius swirskii [61]. However, persistent pesticide
    use increased the risk of crop pesticide resistance [61,113]. Moreover, the concentration
    of pesticides diminished over time, contributing to the resurgence in the population
    of Nesidiocoris tenuis (see Figure 6); this phenomenon informed the need for frequent
    pesticide applications. Figure 6. (A,C) show the average population of Nesidiocoris
    tenuis and Tuta absoluta per leaf inside a commercial greenhouse in 2016, and
    (B,D) show the average population of the same pests in 2017 after the pesticide
    was applied twice in 2016 [61]. On the other hand, the proponents of smart farming
    advocated using Al and IoT-based solutions in pest management. The high detection
    accuracy validated the case for AI in pest management. The UAV-based hyperspectral
    imaging and artificial intelligence system had 82% and 99% classification accuracy
    for the asymptomatic and late development of powdery mildew [113,127]. Asymptomatic
    detection was critical to the early management of crop diseases and the improvement
    of crop yields. In line with Abdulridha et al. [113], Pane et al. [114] demonstrated
    the utility of intelligent solutions in managing pests and diseases. Following
    delineating the cost-benefits of traditional pesticides versus smart farming solutions,
    the latter was encouraged despite the significant capital requirements in the
    short term. In light of the unique benefits and constraints of AI-based IPM techniques,
    complementary solutions were needed moving forward; this view was corroborated
    by Agarwal and Verma’s [128] assessment of pest behavior-modifying chemicals;
    genetic engineering and plant immunization; CRISPR-based genetic manipulation
    of pest populations; controlled introduction of predators, parasites, and diseases
    to reduce the population of plant pests and diseases; and microbial pesticides.
    Even though RNA interference and genome editing were supported by Agarwal and
    Verma [128], the gene editing of crops has not gained traction, and there is strong
    opposition from bioethicists [129]. The ethical concerns are valid, since CRISPR-based
    gene manipulation may trigger undesirable changes in the crop genome; these shortcomings
    validate the emphasis on AI in IPM. 2.4.2. Commercial Development of Robotic Systems
    for Smart Agriculture (Inhouse and Outdoors) In 2022, John Deere Company (one
    of the world’s leading farm machinery manufacturers) released fully autonomous
    tractors for precision agriculture featuring the next generation optical and electro-optical
    cameras. The cameras helped to detect obstacles and calculate distances in real
    time [130]. The utility of advanced computer vision systems in robotics was affirmed
    by Beloev et al. [131]. However, in the latter case, performance was augmented
    by the integration of image processing algorithms. The robotic system accurately
    distinguished tomatoes, leaves, and wood support structures (see Figure 7). Figure
    7. Object classification, localization, detection, and instance segmentation using
    image processing algorithms in agricultural robots [131]. Despite the milestones
    recorded in recent years, a major concern was the lack of consensus on the most
    effective method for robotic automation and mobility. Drawing from Beloev et al.
    [131] and John Deere [130], LIDAR and optical cameras yielded superior outcomes.
    However, not all scholars support the case for LIDAR and optical cameras. For
    example, Rahmadian and Widyartono [132] argued that satellite-differential GPS
    (geographic positioning systems) (S-DGPS) connected to a John Deere tractor (ground
    station) proved to be reliable and accurate in facilitating autonomous mobility.
    The John Deere-S-DGPS system had an accuracy of up to 2 cm from the target. In
    other cases, the robotic systems achieved an accuracy of less than a centimeter
    [132]. In contrast to other AI and ML systems, which recorded variable results
    under different environments and operating conditions, the G-DGPS had consistent
    accuracy in Israel, Georgia, and the US (California) [132]. The mixed observations
    of Rahmadian and Widyartono [132] and Beloev et al. [131] about the utility of
    GPS systems in agricultural robots show that contextual factors and technological
    improvements were important moderating factors. Additionally, one cannot disregard
    the legitimate concerns raised about robotic system accuracy. The issues raised
    by Zha [8] concerning the inconsistent accuracy of AI systems in smart greenhouses
    were in agreement with Aghelpour, Bahrami-Pichaghchi, and Kisi’s [133] research,
    which reported a low prediction accuracy for the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
    System (ANFIS) coupled with bio-inspired optimization algorithms. However, Aghelpour,
    Bahrami-Pichaghchi, and Kisi [133] and Zha [8] contradict Soheli et al. [134],
    who reported a >93.6% prediction accuracy using ANFIS and IoT. The higher accuracy
    reported by Soheli et al. [134] reinforces the perspectives of Howard et al. on
    achieving an optimal balance between scalability, computational speed, and accuracy
    of the AI systems. The inconsistencies in the accuracy of ANFIS-AI systems with
    bio-inspired algorithms can be partly linked to the distinct operational parameters
    and optimum operational conditions. The later claims aligned with the research
    of Salam et al. [135] on optimal target identification using multiple unmanned
    UAVs guided by bio-inspired algorithms to identify crop diseases. On a positive
    note, the lower prediction accuracy reported by Aghelpour et al. [133] and Zha
    [8] could be resolved using digital models based on model predictive control.
    Howard et al. confirmed that the MPC (model predictive control) digital models
    improved accuracy without compromising the computational speed [136]. On the downside,
    the positive assessment of MPCs by Howard et al. [136] negated the fact that the
    classical controller systems had critical shortcomings and accurate operations
    depended on the mathematical models’ accuracy [10]. In most cases, closed-loop
    control algorithms, such as MPC, may impose new constraints on manipulating variables
    and often on computational resources [10]. Despite the strain on computational
    resources, the continued use of MPC was validated by unique benefits and capabilities,
    including rolling optimization, which provided the operators with sufficient time
    to initiate inverse responses, address sensor failure, change the computing objectives,
    and address time delays between sensors. The MPC system could help streamline
    the performance and accuracy of the UAV systems, which are affected by light intensity,
    soil moisture, relative humidity, pH, and the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorous,
    and potassium [103,113,135]. The observations made by [103,113,135] concerning
    the regulation of the greenhouse microclimate were in agreement with the research
    of Jiang et al. [137] on the factors predicting the economic return and fruit
    quality of greenhouse-grown-table grapes in Northern China. Proper regulation
    of greenhouse parameters was a key prerequisite for higher table grape yields
    and profit margins. The observations reinforce current research on the benefits
    of greenhouse microclimate control. For example, the DynaLight system and dynamic
    climate control in InfoGrow improved the quality of greenhouse crops [136]. Similarly
    to [136], Afzali et al. [11] confirmed that predictive modeling for greenhouse
    light management could yield significant cost savings. In contrast to [136] and
    Afzali et al. [11], Bersani et al. noted that cost savings in predictive modeling
    were largely dependent on the choice of the algorithm and MPC [138]. The latter
    study preferred particle swarm algorithms. On the downside, the selection of bio-inspired
    algorithms may not suffice to offset the existing challenges. Even in cases where
    the dynamic climate control in InfoGrow was present, and it was challenging to
    mitigate the impact of local environmental conditions, the benefits associated
    with timely detection of powdery mildew and management of pests outweighed the
    drawbacks [13,103,111,113,135]. The variable test set accuracy (85–90%) of the
    Adam, RMSprop, Adamax, and Nadam optimizers depicted in Table 3 should not be
    perceived as a major impediment to the adoption of algorithms for smart farms
    [69]. The test accuracy can be improved in subsequent training of the algorithms.
    Moreover, new computational approaches have been employed to enhance the training
    and test set accuracy. Table 3. Relationship between optimizers, learning rates,
    the training set accuracy, and test set accuracy [111]. 3. Digital AI Models for
    Energy Management in Greenhouses 3.1. Energy Demand in Smart Greenhouses and Energy
    Optimization Algorithms The adoption of digital models (such as MATLAB/Simulink)
    to regulate the insulated and transparent greenhouse microclimate is an emerging
    area of research [139]. The materials for greenhouse structures, such as fiberglass,
    PVC, polycarbonate, and reinforced plastics, had a domino effect on energy use
    [140]. Intelligent greenhouse structures are energy-intensive—a factor that may
    impede commercial adoption of AI technologies [141,142]. The claims made by [77,78]
    concerning the energy-intensive nature of greenhouse cultivation were in tandem
    with Iddio et al., who noted that energy costs accounted for 25% of the greenhouse
    overhead costs [10]. Energy is needed to heat and cool greenhouse structures and
    regulate light, humidity, and soil moisture. The disproportionate use of energy
    in greenhouses relative to other sectors in the agricultural industry may explain
    why there was renewed interest in developing the next generation of AI-based energy-saving
    technologies to reduce energy expenditure and improve yields. Nguyen et al. documented
    various bio-inspired interventions for energy optimization in smart grids, smart
    homes, and the internet of energy [55]. The study suggested that swarm and evolutionary-based
    optimization algorithms were ideal for optimizing the use of traditional and renewable
    energy sources to achieve higher user comfort and energy demand aligned with the
    production capacity and grid demand. In contrast to Nguyen et al. [55], Zhang
    et al. [142] proposed an AI-based mode based on a particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) scheme. The latter reduced the cost of greenhouse energy through integrating
    photovoltaics and dynamic pricing (real-time and time-of-use). The algorithm enabled
    seamless communication between the external power grid (EPG) and the PV system.
    For example, the supply of power from the external power grid was only required
    when sunlight was low. If there was sufficient light and load, the EPG supply
    was disconnected. In real-life greenhouse operations, the proposals made by Nguyen
    et al. [55] and Zhang et al. [142] may be relevant or less relevant depending
    on the local operating conditions, energy sources, the scale of greenhouse agriculture,
    and specific circumstances; this is in line with Iddio et al. who recommended
    the use of evolutionary algorithms to address the shortcomings associated with
    proportional–Integral–derivative (PID) control of greenhouse structures. Traditionally,
    PID was preferred owing to its great performance, simplicity, and flexibility
    [10]. However, there were certain tradeoffs, including time-consuming computing
    and the inability to handle abrupt and external disturbances [10]. The case for
    the PID greenhouse control strategy advanced by [10] corroborates [20], who noted
    it was a low-cost alternative. However, there were alternative systems with comparable
    performance, including GA-based model predictive control systems. The PID-related
    shortcomings partly explain why AI bio-inspired algorithms, such as EA (Evolutionary
    Algorithm), were used to modify PID controllers in greenhouses. Similarly to Iddio
    et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [142], Jia et al. [143] confirmed that bio-inspired
    algorithms, particularly adaptive chaotic ACO algorithms, could achieve significant
    energy savings. However, the use of bio-inspired algorithms to reduce energy demand
    in isolation would not suffice, considering energy expenditure in greenhouses
    was a complex non-linear, multi-input and output process; this may explain why
    CFD (computational fluid dynamics) modeling coupled with mathematical transformations
    and systematization of greenhouse design parameters were appealing alternatives
    [144,145,146]. Rasakhodzhaev et al. employed mathematical models in the design
    of adjustable solar greenhouse structures with optimal height for better regulation
    of heating and cooling. In contrast to Zhang et al. [142] and Jia et al. [143],
    Chen et al. [144] employed computational fluid dynamics to regulate surplus air
    thermal energy in greenhouses. The data were employed in the operation of the
    fan-pad evaporative cooling system. Even though the latter system did not rely
    on bio-inspired algorithms, it demonstrated the effectiveness of modeling and
    simulations in regulating greenhouse cooling. In line with Chen et al. [144],
    Mirzamohammadi et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of mathematical simulations
    using the Monte Carlo model. However, the effectiveness of the modeling system
    was largely dependent on the level of uncertainty. The ACOA proposed by Jia et
    al. [143] regulated energy demand in smart sensor networks. However, it remained
    unclear whether the optimal performance of the bio-inspired algorithms in controlled
    environments would yield satisfactory performance in real-world scenarios. Such
    concerns were premised on the fact that the performance of the bio-inspired algorithm
    was influenced by the dynamic relationship between biological interactions and
    physical conditions (atmospheric, weather, soil, and humidity). The concerns raised
    by Jia et al. [143] were partly in agreement with the assessment by An et al.
    [147] of system optimization under non-deterministic weather conditions. The unpredictable
    weather patterns impaired the performance of sensors and actuators for heating,
    lighting, and CO2 dosing and the development of a climate and irrigation strategy.
    3.2. Alternative Energy Saving Measures—LoRa Transmission, PCOA-Lighting Management,
    PCMs, and LEDs Drawing from earlier case study data, the pilot experiments may
    not be practical for regions with diverse climatic conditions and unique energy
    requirements. The above concerns partly contributed to the diversification of
    AI approaches for energy management. In the meantime, the researcher posits that
    it would be prudent for smallholder farmers to make incremental changes for better
    energy management; these may include selecting connectivity technologies with
    lower energy requirements. For example, a comparison of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    ZigBee, mobile, and RFID technologies established the following. Leading connectivity
    technologies for AI systems with higher transmission ranges (20–100 m) had higher
    energy input requirements; Wi-Fi is a case in point. In contrast, LoRa had very
    low energy requirements and high transmission ranges (<30 km) [148]. The claims
    made by Bersani et al. [148] on the low energy requirements were in tandem with
    Placidi et al. [84], who noted that the system’s typology reduced the energy demand
    while enhancing data transmission over long distances. Beyond the selection of
    communication channels, Bersani et al. [138] reported 54% to 83% energy savings
    in incandescent and fluorescent lamps after incorporating a parallel particle
    swarm algorithm for optimal location of lighting. The case for LoRa networks in
    agriculture made by Bersani et al. [148] and Placidi et al. [84] aligned with
    the research of Chen et al. [149] on the market integration of LoRa technology
    in greenhouses. In one case, the LoRa transmission module was used to transfer
    data collected from sensors to the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer). In contrast
    to Chen et al. [149], Henningson [150] observed that the accuracy of the Raspberry
    Pi system was higher when paired with Canon camera systems to improve the resolution
    of the images detected. After integrating the two systems, each plant had a resolution
    of 0.006 pixels. On the downside, farm-based data show that high transmission
    ranges and low energy requirements of LoRa did not automatically translate to
    greater commercial adoption in relation to -Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and
    RFID. For example, Siskandar et al. [151] preferred fuzzy-guided RFID-based communication
    channels for smart greenhouses featuring DHT22/ DS18B20 sensors for temperature
    and humidity regulation. In contrast to Chen et al. [149], Bersani et al. [148],
    and Placidi et al. [84], Mu et al. [152] and Elsayed et al. [153] recommended
    alternative methods for managing energy resources, including the use of phase
    change materials for energy conservation and agricultural residue to generate
    biofuels and energy. However, the application of PCMs recommended by Mu et al.
    [152] represents but a tiny fraction of the potential applications in smart farming.
    For example, Kong et al. [154] noted that PCMs were appropriate materials for
    cold chain logistics [154]. However, not all scholars support the use of PCMs
    in greenhouses and related applications due to the high risk of leakage during
    the phase change process [155]. The researcher supports the use of PCMs, considering
    they can be coupled with solar systems for maximum energy saving. On the downside,
    incremental changes, such as selecting less energy-intensive communication systems,
    cannot suffice; they must be paired with other interventions, including the adoption
    of renewable energy systems in greenhouses [156,157]. Solar and geothermal energy
    are the most viable renewable energy systems [158]. Even though the transition
    to renewable energy was widely encouraged, the reliability of the energy source
    was not guaranteed, especially in regions with intermittent solar radiation [159].
    Even in regions where the supply of solar energy was guaranteed, mass utilization
    of renewable energy resources was a challenge, owing to the significant disconnect
    between the use of AI in the greenhouse and the deployment of AI in energy saving;
    this was a paradoxical phenomenon, considering smart greenhouses (featuring predictive
    light control systems) could reduce energy expenditure by 14–33.85% [11]. The
    improvements in lighting achieved by [11] were in tandem with [58], who documented
    a 19.4% cost saving following the introduction of a predictive control strategy
    and innovative greenhouse lighting system. The light prediction model is illustrated
    in Figure 8. Figure 8. Sunlight prediction models and lighting strategies for
    the predictive light control systems [11]. PPFD was measured with units of µmoL
    m−2 s−1. Following the comparison of the heuristic versus application-specific
    models, the former yielded accurate predictions with minimal variations from the
    baseline. Beyond the lower prediction accuracy, the case against the heuristic
    systems was further corroborated by the high cost of heuristic-based predictions
    compared to the prediction-based method (PBM). On average, the heuristic-based
    predictions cost $5.96/m2, while the PBM cost $0.73/m2 per day [11]. The notable
    disparities in the cost validate the PBM approaches. Proper energy management
    in greenhouse structures remained a priority, considering that the current rates
    of energy expenditure were unsustainable in the long term. For example, US-based
    greenhouse operators utilize $600 million worth of electricity per year [160].
    Regulating energy use using AI was a practical option, since small-scale and large
    commercial farms had to spend additional resources on IPM. On average, US farmers
    spend $1 billion on pesticides per year. Similarly, commercial farming in Europe
    was pesticide intensive—farmers utilized an estimated 346,000 tons of pesticides
    in 2020 alone [120]; nearly half of the expenses were on fungicides and bactericides.
    4. Barriers to Incorporating Artificial Intelligence Technology in Smart Greenhouses
    Current research on AI and IoT in agriculture advances distinct claims on the
    potential barriers to incorporating AI technology in smart greenhouses. One school
    of thought claimed that the inconsistent adoption of AI could be linked to the
    slow commercialization of R&D innovations, barriers to technology acceptance,
    and information asymmetry. This school of thought was corroborated by Zha [8]
    and Senavirathne et al. [13]. The second school of thought suggested that demographics
    were a major determinant. Research from Europe suggested that demographics directly
    affect progressiveness and technology adoption in agriculture [67,161]. Younger
    generations are more highly motivated to adopt new farming technologies than older
    generations. In contrast to the scenario observed by [67,161] in Europe, Asian
    studies highlighted the aging of the population as a barrier [162]. Drawing from
    the latter studies, each continent had unique barriers and drivers for precision
    technology adoption in greenhouses. The issues raised by Zha [8] and Senavirathne
    et al. [13] concerning the pace of technology adoption were discounted by emerging
    research on the immense benefits of augmented reality, such as the GRETA application
    in promoting technology adoption among hobby farmers, and those with limited knowledge
    about farming technologies, and even professional farmers using unique human-computer
    interactions [24]. The case for AR advanced by [24] corroborates Yaqot and Meneses’s
    study [163], which noted AR would help transform rural and novice farmers into
    experts while providing agronomists with a real-time and holistic view of farm
    and crop health. The benefits afforded by AR-based systems such as GRETA suggest
    that poor understanding of technology should not be an impediment to the automation
    of greenhouse operations. The low pace of AI technology adoption in the global
    agricultural sector has remained unresolved. For example, the first AI-powered
    system for agriculture was the GOSSYM cotton crop simulation model developed in
    1985 to regulate water and fertilizer application, weed control, and local climate
    for better cotton yields [8]. The GOSSYM model was key to developing the Artificial
    Intelligence Automated Greenhouse System (AIAGS), processing systems, and web
    applications [13]. On the downside, there was limited R&D in the subsequent years
    to build on the GOSSYM model. In 1996, researchers developed an autonomous AURORA
    greenhouse robot to replace manual labor. The historical slow adoption of precision
    farming technologies documented by [8,13] was in line with Maloku’s appraisal
    of precision farming technology integration in the US and EU [71]. Until the late
    2000s, only 22% of the farmers had integrated precision farming technologies in
    the West [71]. On a positive note, there was a notable improvement in the pace
    of technology adoption post-2013. In the past two years, researchers have developed
    multi-application AI systems for intelligent IPM [15,86,128], seeding and harvesting,
    and weed recognition [104,105], and digital twins for autonomous greenhouse operation
    using traditional sensor data, IoT, big data analytics, and AI [136]. However,
    the pace of R&D innovations does not match commercial adoption—the digital twin-based
    GHI4.0 project in the Danish horticultural industry was in the pilot phase. On
    a positive note, 80% of Danish farmers attempted to integrate precision farming
    technologies in the production of maize and barley crops [71]. Presently, it is
    challenging to determine the cost-benefits of technological innovation and underlying
    motives for the transition to AI in agriculture [18]. For example, even though
    digital twins offer immense potential to balance accuracy, accuracy, and computational
    speeds in agriculture, there are limited data on their applications. Howard et
    al. noted that “state-of-the-art for DTs is limited to specific sub-processes
    modeled with highly specialized models” [136] (p. 7). Further experimental data
    on the cost-benefits of digital twins was needed before deploying the systems
    in greenhouses to simulate and optimize production. The issues relating to digital
    twins are but a microcosm of the broader gaps in the body of knowledge, which
    does not sufficiently delineate the impacts of AI and IT in agriculture. Drawing
    from experimental data compiled by researchers in Europe, North America, and Asia
    [86,90,104,105,108], there were region-specific barriers and enablers for AI integration
    in agriculture depending on the pace of knowledge and technology transfer. The
    intermittent integration of R&D innovations could be due to the higher costs,
    knowledge and resource gaps between advanced and developing countries, the inability
    to entirely replace human labor on farms with robots, and variations between the
    simulated and actual outcomes in the field/smart greenhouses [8]. The criticism
    of AI systems in smart greenhouses and farms by [8] was corroborated by Beloev
    et al. [131], who claimed that mechanical robots were unreliable because they
    relied on satellite triangulation to guide movement—this technology was less reliable
    compared to LIDAR and camera sensor innovations. On a positive note, the constraints
    associated with satellite triangulation have been addressed using light imaging,
    detection, and ranging (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras [131]. The
    advances highlighted by [131] were consistent with [162], which noted that algorithm
    systems had led to the development of advanced sensor systems, including fusion
    algorithms that facilitated the separation of colors into the hue, saturation,
    and value formats. However, the case for electro-optical cameras made by [131,162]
    was not in line with the research of Saddik et al. on latency issues in an image
    collection using multispectral cameras [164]. The latter concerns reinforced the
    case for LIDAR systems in agricultural robots [162]. The technology milestones
    in robotics shaped industry trends in the adoption of robotics for harvesting
    and greenhouse management. 4.1. Training and Test Accuracy of AI Systems in Smart
    Greenhouses and Precision Agriculture The inclusion of different computational
    methods to attain higher accuracy rates was confirmed by Siskandar et al. in their
    assessment of the fuzzy logic system’s accuracy (~95%) in smart greenhouses (see
    Table 3) [151]. Even though the observations of Siskandar et al. were specific
    to the long short-term memory neural network for predicting the occurrence and
    development of powdery mildew in greenhouse cucumber plants, they were relevant
    to other AI systems for greenhouses. On the downside, these claims contrast with
    Lakshmi and Corbett [15], who argued the current barriers to technology adoption
    must be resolved. Traditionally, it was challenging for Al systems to reconcile
    the images and measurements taken under controlled conditions with those in the
    field due to variations in the background complexity, imaging angle, and interferences
    in the natural environment. The constraints have been partly resolved with bio-inspired
    algorithms customized for fault prediction, image recognition, and pest identification
    [165,166]. The use of AI to prevent root rot diseases and fusarium wilt among
    cucumber plants in greenhouses was a case in point [167]. The broad application
    of IoT, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture
    can be partly linked to technological advances in computing. 4.2. Impact of Demographics
    and Socioeconomic Factors on AI Technology Adoption in Agriculture The shortage
    of young, progressive EU farmers raises legitimate concerns regarding the actualization
    of Eurozone agricultural innovation policies, and by extension, the ability to
    sustain higher food demands [67]. The issues raised in the European Economic and
    Social Committee’s report [67] were partly in line with Mohr and Kühl’s research
    in Germany, where age predicted technology adoption [161]. For example, smartphone
    use and access decreased with age among the German farmers sampled. Similarly
    to Mohr and Kühl [161], Maloku [71] noted that less educated and older farmers
    were less inclined to adopt precision farming technologies. However, the observations
    by Mohr and Kühl [161] concerning the rate of technology acceptance in agriculture
    were not aligned with the European Economic and Social Committee’s report [67].
    Most of the sampled German farmers were young (mean age = 33 years), and there
    was more than an 80% assimilation of smart farming technologies among old and
    young farmers. The contrasting observations from Mohr and Kühl and the European
    Economic and Social Committee’s report raise fundamental questions on whether
    demographics were a barrier to adopting AI on smart farms across Europe and the
    world. In contrast to the European Economic and Social Committee’s report [67]
    and Mohr and Kühl [161], Maloku [71] claimed multiple externalities aided and
    impeded smart farming technology adoption; these variables included farm size,
    financial status, technology factors, information resources, social, economic
    issues (age, experience, and education), and farm size. The latter argument provides
    a more representative picture of the dynamics that led to higher or lower technology
    adoption that is more applicable to developing and developed countries in the
    North and the South [137]. Further research on the role of demographics, farm
    size, financial status, technology factors, and information resources was necessary,
    considering achieving and sustaining exponential growth in AI technology adoption
    in agriculture is a prerequisite for tangible global impact on crop yields, pest
    and disease management, and optimization of agricultural resources [168]. Despite
    the overwhelming evidence in support of AI, particularly robotics in harvesting,
    critics argue that AI cannot entirely “replace/replicate humans. Machines do not
    have the multi-perspective skills of humans, as they are typically programmed
    to perform specific tasks in constrained conditions” [69] (p. 9). The issues raised
    by [69] do not consider recent milestones with bio-inspired algorithms that improved
    the precision and reliability of AI and ML infrastructure in agriculture [169].
    The use of bio-inspired hybrid algorithms for weed optimization was a case in
    point [14,105,135]. The role of AI algorithms highlighted by [14,105,135] was
    corroborated by Beloev et al. [131], who used image processing algorithms to improve
    the ground-based accuracy of a robotic system. The selection of advanced algorithms,
    including Hierarchy/Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer
    (GWO), Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Direct Artificial Bee Colony (DABC), and Hybrid
    Genetic Algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO) among others involves
    a tradeoff between computational speed, path planning, fitness, root means squared,
    and mean absolute errors [85]. For example, the ANN algorithm had lower MAE and
    RSME values compared to the GEP testing and training evolutionary algorithm (see
    Table 4). However, the ANN required higher computational resources [14,170]. On
    a positive note, the technical constraints were short-term and should not be considered
    a critical impediment to the adoption of AI systems. Table 4. Gene expression
    programming (GEP), ANN RSME, and MAE [85]. Beyond the technically related barriers
    to the widespread adoption of AI systems in smart farming, there were emerging
    concerns about the impact of farmer demographics on the adoption of AI systems.
    For example, the aging of the farmers was a major issue in Europe [67,161]. In
    light of the observations made by critics and proponents of AI in smart greenhouses
    and precision agriculture, the following fundamental issues emerge. First, AI
    technology critics negate smart agriculture’s immense contribution to farming.
    Second, the proponents of AI technology disregard the enormous capital requirements
    and the barriers to technology transfer in developing countries. On a positive
    note, there were successful cases in the developing countries in the global south.
    For example, Ethiopian scientists had developed an ERNN system to monitor humidity
    and temperature variations in greenhouse structures; the system had additional
    capabilities for wind velocity and carbon dioxide concentration measurement [170].
    Proper temperature regulation and monitoring were necessary, considering a majority
    of the greenhouse crops; tomatoes were particularly susceptible to temperature
    variations [171]; the effect of chilling stress on greenhouse tomatoes in China
    was a case in point [171]. In practice, incorporating artificial intelligence
    technology in smart greenhouses should be supported by prior data on actual farm
    applications and short and long-term benefits vis-à-vis the costs and potentially
    detrimental environmental impacts. The dynamic natural and physical conditions
    (including atmospheric, weather, soil, and humidity) and biological interactions
    between plants, pests, and diseases in greenhouses and open-field agriculture
    increase the complexity of the decision-making processes [6,15,57]. The sophisticated
    relationship between these variables would predict the utility of AI in agriculture
    and agricultural sustainability. On a positive note, emerging research on bio-inspired
    algorithms and selected applications of AI systems in agriculture confirmed that
    the benefits outweighed the risks [14,108,121]. Moreover, the ongoing R&D projects
    would resolve most of the shortcomings. 4.3. Sensor Signal Failure and Communication
    Barriers The growing advocacy for the integration of AI in precision agriculture
    negates the technology-related challenges to commercial adoption. Singh et al.
    established that interferences often compromised communication between sensor
    nodes. There were multiple sources of interferences for sensor signal transfer
    in greenhouses, including crop canopy, soil, and temperature [87,164]. Similarly
    to Singh et al. [87], Shamshiri et al. [78] observed that the accuracy of the
    soil moisture sensors was notably low in regions with high vegetative diversity.
    Sensor accuracy was impaired by different hydrological properties and geography,
    especially in real-world conditions dissimilar to the training datasets. On a
    positive note, most of the constraints identified by Singh et al. [87] and Shamshiri
    et al. [78] have been addressed using AI technologies. In particular, Vanegas-Ayala
    et al. demonstrated the importance of fuzzy clustering techniques in the humidity
    prediction modules. The fuzzy logic controllers enabled the AI systems to model
    and predict the behavior of key greenhouse parameters. The system was appealing
    to the farmers because it was inexpensive and easy to use. A major concern was
    that these issues were often disregarded in research in favor of the mass transition
    to an intelligent greenhouse system. The risk of impaired transmission identified
    by Singh et al. [87] may be resolved using the hardware configuration proposed
    by Serale et al. [58]. The configuration featured Siap+Micros t055 pyranometers
    and Apogee SQ-515 Quantum sensors with a 1.2 mV sensitivity of 1.2mV. The configuration
    proposed by Serale et al. [58] bears semblance to Afzali et al., who deployed
    Apogee instruments to measure the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) over
    the plant canopy in a greenhouse structure [14]. The observations made by Serale
    et al. [58] and Afzali et al. [11] do not take into account the variable accuracy
    of the Apogee solar radiation sensors. According to Zamora-Izquierdo et al., the
    Apogee sensors had a mean accuracy of ±5% [172]. The accuracy of the sensor systems
    could be enhanced using the Remote Sensing Assisted Control System (RSCS), which
    offered multidimensional benefits, including the measurement of CO2 emissions,
    soil moisture, irrigation control, and agricultural production capacities. New
    experimental data have confirmed that using plastic mulches with sustainable remote
    sensing and AI technology systems is practical. In particular, Jim et al. [173]
    reported the successful use of Landsat-5 thematic mapper and hyperspectral airborne
    sensors to map plastic mulched farmlands and plastic-covered greenhouses. The
    data were, in turn, employed to identify regions where plastic mulches can be
    gradually replaced with biodegradable alternatives. The claims made by Jim et
    al. [173] concerning the role of technology in mapping plastic mulches were in
    tandem with Hasituya et al., who deployed remote-sensing aperture radar systems
    to map plastic mulches [174]. 5. Future Perspectives The critical review of the
    current body of knowledge supporting the integration of AI systems in agriculture
    yielded new insights and perspectives on how best to enhance the efficiency of
    smart greenhouses. However, certain issues should be addressed in upcoming studies.
    For example, the current body of knowledge did not establish a consensus on whether
    automated agricultural machinery manufacturers and commercial farms should transition
    from satellite triangulation to light imaging, detection and ranging (LIDAR),
    optical and electro-optical cameras [131], or Satellite-Differential GPS (S-DGPS).
    The mixed observations by Beloev et al. [131], John Deere [130], and Rahmadian
    and Widyartono [132] warrant further research inquiry considering there were different
    technical requirements for open space and indoor (greenhouse) robotic systems.
    Future research on LIDAR and optical camera systems for open space and greenhouse
    robotic tractors would provide better insights into the cost-benefits of available
    technologies to guide commercial adoption. Empirical and farm-based data are important,
    considering John Deere and other companies were commercializing new autonomous
    tractor models fitted with optical cameras [130,132]. Moreover, there was a growing
    acceptance of soft robotic systems for fruit and vegetable harvesting and pesticide
    application. Beyond systems for robotic structures, current data on the suitability
    of different variants of bio-inspired algorithms (swarm intelligence, genetic
    and evolutionary) for pesticide application, and robotic harvesting, automated
    regulation of irrigation, soil treatment, fertilizer application, and seeding
    are specific to the Global North [105,135]. Future research should explore the
    suitability of bio-inspired algorithms to support the automation of greenhouses
    in developing countries. Isolated case studies of milestones in developing countries
    support the recommendation. For example, ERNN systems augmented temperature and
    humidity measurements in Ethiopia’s greenhouses [170]. However, there were gaps
    in the knowledge, which may impede decision-making among stakeholders in the future.
    Future research should investigate whether the LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    mobile, or RFID communication technologies were best suited for specific bio-inspired
    algorithms and the influence of local conditions and variables on performance
    and accuracy. At present, researchers are focusing on different algorithms to
    refine algorithm performance. For example, most studies focused on solar radiation
    intensity, transpiration, and CO2 concentration to predict crop yields, even though
    the approach yielded inaccurate results [18]. The standardization of input variables
    would improve accuracy and performance. Upcoming studies should help establish
    whether intelligent IPM was a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical
    pesticides and biopesticides, considering pesticide resistance and the need to
    adopt sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, there is a growing demand
    for technological solutions to address climate change and global food insecurity,
    which urges the integration of AI technologies like light imaging, detection and
    ranging 1128 (LIDAR), optical and electro-optical cameras [131] or satellite-differential
    GPS (S-DGPS). Apart from the technological aspect, there is also a need to develop
    agricultural production policies that favor the funding of these technologies
    and their integration to agricultural production. Such policies can include setting
    aside grant funds for institutions and companies involved in their development.
    Such policies should also include solving the cost barriers that have consistently
    been highlighted in previous research. Most studies have also demonstrated the
    potential application of AI in large scale agricultural production. Policy incentives
    to facilitate their integration in small-scale farming may also encourage younger
    populations to participate in agricultural production, because most farmers today
    in Europe and North America are older. If the problem is not addressed in a timely
    manner using potential technological solutions, the issues of food insecurity
    are likely to worsen in the future. 6. Conclusions The findings drawn from this
    research had practical consequences for commercial agriculture, considering a
    large body of knowledge focused on applying AI and IoT in traditional applications,
    and the emphasis on the benefits of the technology negated critical concerns about
    energy demand, sensor failure, accuracy, and long-term use. The findings broadened
    current knowledge on the cost benefits of sensors, robotic systems, algorithms,
    renewable energy systems for greenhouses, and support infrastructure. For example,
    users of soil and humidity sensors paired with fuzzy clustering techniques in
    the humidity prediction modules should be conscious of the fact that the accuracy
    of the measurements may be impaired by corrosion or hardware malfunction. Additionally,
    the new generation of new agricultural robotic systems largely depends on replacing
    GPS systems with LIDAR and optical camera systems, given the former exhibited
    poor object recognition. The performance of LIDAR systems was enhanced with image
    processing algorithms. The commercial readiness of AI technologies was demonstrated
    by John Deere company, Blue River Technology, Autonomous Tractor Corp, and other
    companies that had developed intelligence systems for monitoring crop and soil
    health, weed control, and self-driving agricultural tractors. Despite the commendable
    milestones achieved so far, there were multiple barriers to the use of the technology.
    The barriers included the cost of AI technology, variable performance of the algorithm
    in real-world conditions vis-à-vis training, the financial status of the farmers,
    lack of information resources, aging, and lack of prior experience with technology.
    Despite the shortcomings, adopting AI systems should be encouraged, given they
    improved crop yields, water use, and fertilizer use efficiency, and reduced the
    effects of pesticide resistance through intelligent IPM. Moreover, bio-inspired
    algorithms improved energy management by integrating photovoltaics and dynamic
    pricing and autonomous communication between the greenhouse system and EPG supply.
    The emerging climate change risks further reinforce the case for smart greenhouses
    powered by AI systems. In summary, most AI applications in agricultural production
    are in the development phase because they have not fully matured for commercialization
    purposes. The few AI solutions that have so far reached maturity and have been
    rolled out for commercial use despite challenges (e.g., accuracy) include the
    use of drones, sensors, and robots for harvesting crop yields. Although these
    technologies have been applied commercially, the challenge of accuracy and sustainability
    persists. For example, underground sensor hardware can be damaged by moisture
    and other unpredictable environmental conditions, leading to inaccurate data,
    which can easily mislead decisions in commercial farms, leading to huge losses.
    Therefore, although they have reached the commercial maturity, they still need
    further development to optimize their effectiveness in solving the identified
    problems and challenges. Furthermore, considering that many studies are currently
    being undertaken on this topic, it is also imperative to perform a similar mapping
    of the literature every three years to determine the current state of the art
    from time to time, because technological advancements are fast and imminent. Finally,
    more research is needed on overcoming the challenges of integrating AI applications
    into farm input in the Global South, which must include solving the cost barriers
    and knowledge and skills gaps. Funding This research received no external funding.

    \ perennial crops, such as vineyards and orchards.\n* This is likely because perennial\
    \ crops have less disturbance to Ag-IoT platforms than annual crops, which are\
    \ subject to soil preparation and planting each year.\n* The need to remove sensors\
    \ when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a\
    \ significant logistic issue for using them effectively with annual crops.\n\n\
    **Soil water content**: \n\n* Soil water content is the most common variable measured\
    \ by sensors in Ag-IoT systems.\n* This is because water is the largest input\
    \ by volume applied to farms, and accurate measurement of soil water content is\
    \ essential for efficient irrigation management.\n* The authors note that there\
    \ is a challenge to introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under\
    \ the tall and dense crop canopy.\n\n**Other common variables**: \n\n* Other common\
    \ variables measured by sensors in Ag-IoT systems include:\n    * Humidity\n \

    \ sources of data\n\nThe typical sources of data for irrigation management in\
    \ Ag-IoT systems include:\n\n* **Sensors**: Sensors can be used to measure a wide\
    \ range of variables, including soil water content, humidity, air temperature,\
    \ leaf temperature, soil temperature, canopy temperature, leaf area index (LAI),\
    \ normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), crop water stress index (CWSI),\
    \ sap flow, and stomatal conductance.\n* **Weather stations**: Weather stations\
    \ can be used to measure a variety of weather variables, including air temperature,\

    communication 1. Introduction Crops are essential for human life because they
    provide food, animal feed, fuel, and raw materials for clothing and shelter. Crop
    yield has to be doubled in 2050 compared to 2009 in order to meet the demand of
    a growing population while increasing the food quality and reducing production
    inputs (Fukase and Martin, 2020). Potential solutions to enhance global food security
    include closing crop yield gaps, reducing food waste, changing dietary habits,
    and reducing inefficiencies in resource use (Foley et al., 2011). Reducing inefficiencies
    in input resources (such as water and nitrogen) can be achieved by continuously
    monitoring crops, soil, and microclimate, and then properly controlling inputs
    without sacrificing the yield and quality of the crop. Internet of Things (IoT)
    becomes a key technology that enables continuous monitoring and control in this
    scenario. The ability to generate (near) real-time quantitative data with high
    spatiotemporal resolution is a major advantage of IoT systems (Liao et al., 2017).
    IoTs are considered big data systems due to volumes, velocities, and varieties
    of data they generate. These data are mined and modeled to elucidate the relationships
    between inputs and outputs (Tsai et al., 2014). Correlation, trend analysis, classification,
    and numerical prediction are implemented on the data to reach meaningful control
    decisions. Compared with the conventional wireless sensor networks, the holistic
    approach of IoT technology allows users to incorporate data analytics on the big
    data collected by IoT sensor devices. Generally, connected actuators are enabled
    to control the inputs to achieve desired application rates. For example, an internet-connected
    soil water content (SWC) sensor network measures the plant water deficit and uploads
    data to a cloud-based data analysis platform. The analysis will find the trend
    of soil water deficit to determine the best time and quantity to apply irrigation
    water. There has been a boom in IoT application development in agriculture (Ag-IoT)
    in the last two decades, particularly around crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.
    However, the application of Ag-IoT at the commercial scale is still at its early
    stages. A deeper and more holistic understanding of the existing IoT system development
    is important for various stakeholders to sketch the future landscape of Ag-IoT.
    Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the key components of
    Ag-IoT including sensors, actuators, data processing, and data transmission, summarize
    its usage in crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring, and identify the research
    needs for successful IoT implementation in the future. Though Ag-IoT is proliferating
    in both crop and animal monitoring and management, Ag-IoT for crop production
    is the focus of this paper. IoT platforms for livestock production, as well as
    other sectors of agriculture (such as postharvest) are not included. IoT can be
    found in the manufacturing industry, consumers products, retail, finance and marketing,
    healthcare, transportation and logistics, smart city, military applications and
    supply chains (Islam et al., 2022). Fig. 1 shows the three main layers of a generic
    IoT architecture: the perception layer, network layer, and application layer (Jabraeil
    Jamali et al., 2020). The perception layer consists of gateways, mobile devices,
    sensors, actuators, power, and energy storage components. Activities in the perception
    layer include sensing, controlling, actuation, energy harvesting, energy storage,
    data transmission, and power management. The perception layer of the Ag-IoT faces
    challenges including harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneity of the applications,
    nonavailability of communication infrastructure, and lack of continuous power
    supplies, to just mention a few. This review therefore emphasizes the perception
    layer of Ag-IoT. The network layer consists of network devices and data transmission
    and processing functions. The application layer is responsible for user-specific
    applications such as data visualization, actuator control dashboards, as well
    as data storage, analysis, and decision making. This three-layer architecture
    of IoT can be expanded to five layers by including transport layer after network
    layer and adding business layer after the application layer (Banu, 2018). The
    transport layer is responsible for data transmission while the business layer
    manages the whole IoT system according to the user''s business model. Download

    Three- and five-layer architectures of generic IoT systems. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The method of the literature review is presented in Section
    two. Section three details the major elements of Ag-IoT technology. Section four
    describes the challenges that Ag-IoT systems face with emerging solutions. In
    Section five, supporting technologies for Ag-IoT are discussed. How the information
    from Ag-IoT can benefit farm systems analysis and management is discussed in Section
    six. The final section concludes the review article with future research directions.
    2. Review methodology We have come up with a list of eleven research questions
    to guide the literature review and analysis in Ag-IoT. These questions, along
    with the motivation to ask these questions and our initial hypotheses, are listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Research questions, motivations, and hypotheses to guide

    Ag-IoT systems are more popular with perennial crops To find the answers to questions
    in Table 1, a thorough literature review was conducted. The main approach was
    to find the answers based on the recent research carried out in the field of Ag-IoT.
    We have searched for the recent Ag-IoT research published in scientific journals
    and conference proceedings between 2011 and 2021, using keywords through Google
    Scholar and Scopus web search. Keywords used in the search were Internet of Things,
    IoT, Crop Monitoring, Wireless Sensor Network, Smart Agriculture, and Crop Sensing.
    This search resulted in 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings
    papers. After reading the abstracts, 115 papers were determined to be relevant
    to the topic of Ag-IoT. The selected articles are listed in the Appendix, and
    they were used for in-depth analysis. Research papers selected covered countries
    in all six continents (except for Antarctica, Fig. 2a). Asia presented the largest
    number of papers (Scotford and Miller, 2004), whereas Australia had the smallest
    number of papers. In terms of countries, India (Coleman et al., 2022) and China
    (Chen et al., 2014) had the highest numbers of research outcomes. Fig. 2b presented
    the yearly distribution of the research papers. The number of research papers
    published related to the topic increased over time, with the highest in 2019.
    Demographics of the collected data set provided the answer to question 1 in Table
    1, that Ag-IoT has received global attention. More Ag-IoT research has been completed
    in countries with smallholder farmers such as India and China. The selected papers
    were read carefully and analyzed for the technical specification of the IoT systems,
    including the sensors and actuators in each study, communication technologies
    used, environment the system implemented, and the IoT service provider used. Download

    In Section 3, we have thoroughly reviewed the major components of Ag-IoT. To conduct
    this review systematically, we have divided this section into multiple subsections.
    These subsections are sensors, IoT platforms/main control board, wireless communication
    technology, IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and energy management, and actuators.
    3.1. Sensors Sensors play a major role in Ag-IoT systems because they serve as
    the converter between real-world signals and their digital representations. This
    section begins with an introduction and categorization of sensors used to measure
    crop, soil, and microclimate parameters. General purpose sensors such as temperature
    sensor, light intensity sensor, accelerometers, soil moisture sensor, etc., can
    be integrated into Ag-IoT systems (White, 1987). Table 2 gives sensor categories
    along with sensor measurands and provides some examples found in the literature.

    et al., 2017) Proper selection of sensors to an application is essential for IoT
    systems developers as well as for users to best use the sensors. The advancement
    of sensor technologies has a major impact on the popularity of IoT. Low energy
    consumption, compatibility in data transmission between the microcontroller and
    the sensor, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and robustness are major considerations
    to select a sensor for IoT system development. To address research question 2
    in Table 1, we marked and counted the sensors in the 115 research papers reviewed,
    with the total count of each sensor given in Fig. 3. Soil moisture sensors were
    used for the largest number of applications (Ivanova et al., 2016) followed by
    humidity sensors (Hurst et al., 2021) and then air temperature sensors (Haque
    et al., 2021). The reason these sensors were integrated most in Ag-IoT so far
    is likely because of the need for continuous in-situ soil moisture monitoring
    for decision making in irrigated agricultural production. Water scarcity is a
    global issue, and the amount of arable land can be expanded significantly if growers
    can apply water efficiently (Aroca et al., 2018). On the contrary, soil water
    tension measured via soil water potential sensors only appeared in three papers.
    This lower interest in soil water potential sensors is likely due to (1) less
    understanding of the relationship between soil water tension and crop growth,
    (2) less availability of low-cost soil water potential sensors, and (3) the difficulty
    in interfacing the available soil water potential sensors to the IoT platforms.
    Next, we will discuss the Ag-IoT sensors found in the literature according to
    the measurand category it belongs to. Download : Download high-res image (192KB)

    research papers and their frequency. 3.1.1. Acoustic sensors Ultrasound distance
    measurement sensors and microphones are the most common acoustic property measuring
    sensors. Direct use of acoustic measurements is limited in Ag-IoT. Hardwood borer
    identification IoT sensor network is a direct application of microphone used in
    pest detection in forestry (Potamitis et al., 2019). Ultrasonic wind speed and
    direction sensor is an important meteorological sensor used in agriculture to
    estimate evapotranspiration (Kameoka et al., 2017). Compared with the mechanical
    anemometer, an ultrasonic anemometer requires less maintenance due to fewer mechanical
    parts involved. Furthermore, an ultrasonic anemometer can capture sudden changes
    in wind speed and direction very accurately. Acoustic sensors were used indirectly
    to measure biological measurands. Crop canopy height estimation by ultrasound
    sensor is an indirect approach to measure biological parameters (Yuan et al.,
    2018; Elci et al., 2018). IoT-enabled ultrasound distance sensors are widely used
    in irrigation systems to estimate the water volume in tanks, wells and reservoirs,
    and it is an essential sensor for irrigation scheduling in automated irrigation
    systems. Recently ultrasound flow meters replaced the mechanical flow meters due
    to their high accuracy in flow rate measurement with less maintenance. Underwater
    ultrasound scanning is possible for aquatic plant growth monitoring purposes such
    as lotas and seaweed and has a huge potential to determine the harvest stage and
    growth rate monitoring (Kool and Bernard, 2019). Fruit ripeness estimation is
    an interesting example of the indirect use of acoustics in agriculture. Daosawang
    et al. (2020) demonstrated that watermelon ripeness could be estimated by a sound
    generator and receiver. In summary, acoustic sensors advanced in recent years
    while replacing some traditional mechanical Ag-sensors and introducing new applications
    in agriculture. 3.1.2. Biological sensors Above-ground biomass of plant, plant
    height, plant density, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI), count of plant organs
    (leaf, fruit, flower), chlorophyll concentration, sap flow, and stomata conductance
    are useful biological parameters in crop monitoring. Crop yield and the growth
    stage can be estimated from the plant''s mass (biomass). Loadcells are used in
    indoor farming pots to measure the plant weight directly (Long and McCallum, 2015).
    Almost all the field crop biomass estimations have been measured by indirect sensing
    techniques such as biomass-sensitive vegetation indices (VI) or by image processing-based
    techniques. However, both techniques require time-consuming ground truth data
    collection for model calibration. The accuracy of these techniques is subject
    to lighting conditions, sensor type, crop type, model parameters, and training
    data set. Just like crop biomass, many other biological measurands are also estimated
    indirectly. For example, stomata conductance can be quantified through optical
    measurands, and plant height through acoustic sensors. Therefore, most of the
    biological measurands will be discussed as indirect applications under other measurands.
    3.1.3. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors can be categorized into two main types:
    photochemical and electrochemical. Photochemical sensors measure chemical reactions
    or chemicals by their spectral signature, and electrochemical sensors measure
    the electrical properties due to chemical reactions or the presence of chemicals
    (Angkawinitwong and Williams, 2021). Soil pH, soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen
    (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), pH and conductivity of irrigation water,
    and photosynthesis are the parameters that often measured by chemical sensors.
    Knowing the pH of water and soil is important because pH affects the solubility
    of nutrients and therefore plant nutrient uptake and growth. Soil and irrigation
    water pH measurements with IoT-enabled sensors were demonstrated in the literature
    in nine studies. Spatial variability and the dependency of sensor accuracy on
    soil condition are the issues to address to promote them in agriculture (Chen
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). The soil salinity sensor and custom-made nitrate
    sensor were counted only once, which highlighted the difficulty of measuring soil
    chemical properties continuously and in a non-destructive manner. The measurement
    of the real-time nutrient content in the soil, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K) are essential for fertigation. These sensors are still
    at the rudimentary stage (Burton et al., 2018) of development. Real-time soil
    nutrient sensing has a huge potential in future agriculture as nutrient leaching
    and groundwater pollution are serious issues people are facing now. Nitrate sensors
    can be fixed to groundwater pumps to monitor the nitrate status of groundwater,
    or installed in leaching water collectors in fields to get reasonable estimation
    about nitrate leaching (Hooper et al., 2019). Soil salinity can be derived from
    the soil''s electrical conductivity (EC), and it was demonstrated three times
    in the literature. This is a very important parameter to measure as soil salinity
    is one of the main soil degrading factors in irrigated agriculture. None of the
    research in the literature highlighted the importance of using EC sensors in soil
    or irrigation systems to ameliorate the soil salinity build-up due to irrigation.
    CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases attributed to climate change and agriculture
    is considered a major source of their emission. Accounting for the sourcing and
    sinking of CO2 and CH4 from soil and crops is important to understand the budget
    of greenhouse gases in agriculture. Research suggested that elevation of CO2 can
    increase crop yield as well as improve water use efficiency (Hatfield et al.,
    2011). Therefore, it is essential to measure CO2 and CH4. There are two types
    of gas sensors available. Metal oxide gas sensors increase the electric resistance
    of the sensor when it contacts certain gas. Optical gas sensors measure the absorption
    spectra to detect spectral signatures unique to the gas. O2 sensors can be used
    to monitor the crop respiration rate. Electrochemical sensors can be used to estimate
    dissolved oxygen as the increased dissolved oxygen in water can improve the quality
    and the yield of the aquatic plants (Shi et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). Another
    interesting parameter to measure is stomatal conductance. Plant stomatal openings
    regulate the exchange of water vapor and CO2 between a leaf and the surrounding
    atmosphere. So far, no IoT-enabled sensor has been developed to measure this parameter
    even though handheld sensors are available (Lamour et al., 2022). Chemical sensors
    can be used to monitor the quality of fruits during harvesting. As an example,
    IoT-enabled Ethelene gas sensors have a huge potential to use in fruit production
    to identify the best time to initiate harvesting (Esser et al., 2012). Although
    chemical sensors improved rapidly in the past decade, applications developed based
    on them in agriculture are still at an early stage. More research is needed to
    incorporate these sensors with Ag-IoT. 3.1.4. Electric sensors Electric sensors
    play a key role in Ag-IoT as they have been used in many industries for a long
    period. The main principle is to measure the change of electrical properties due
    to physical or chemical changes in plants, soil, and the environment. Some electrical
    parameters are charge, current, potential difference, electric field, resistance
    (or conductance), capacitance, and inductance. Soil moisture sensors via IoT systems
    were the most tested sensor in the literature. As most of the agricultural lands
    face water shortages and climate change has heavily affected the water availability,
    most of the studies attempted to address this requirement. We found that electrical
    resistance, capacitance, and permittivity of bulk soils were used to estimate
    soil volumetric water content (VWC). Furthermore, soil water tension was measured
    by the electrical resistance of gypsum blocks. For better irrigation scheduling,
    both VWC and soil water tension are important: VWC quantifies the amount of water
    in the soil whereas soil water tension is a better indicator of how difficult
    plant roots can extract water from the soil matrix. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors are the other two dominant sensors researchers have tested. There are
    three types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive, and thermal. Crop ET and
    pest or disease forecasting are the potential applications of the air temperature
    and humidity sensing requirements. But 90% of the research just demonstrated the
    capability of plug play these sensors; only 10% of IoT researchers demonstrate
    the capability of using those sensors for a meaningful task like disease forecasting.
    Humidity is an important environmental parameter directly related to ET calculation,
    crop quality, and pest growth forecasting. Sensors can be deployed to measure
    absolute, relative, and specific humidity. For example, the best time to start
    grain harvesting is highly dependent on grain moisture content and if harvested
    without considering the optimal moisture level it may cause extensive post-harvesting
    damage and economic loss (Zoerb et al., 1993). IoT-based ET modeling and irrigation
    scheduling enable low water usage and low irrigation energy consumption. IoT also
    opened the path for non-conventional VWC measurement. Aroca et al. (2018) presented
    the use of RFID to estimate VWC with a received signal strength of the tag with
    R2 > 0.9. A rain sensor based on the electrical conductivity principle was demonstrated
    as an IoT sensor that could detect the start and end of the rain (Andrey Rivas-Sánchez
    et al., 2019). Based on these literature outcomes it can be concluded that electric
    sensors are mature compared to acoustic and chemical sensors and have been used
    in the industry for a long time and have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT.
    3.1.5. Mechanical sensors Mechanical sensors convert a physical parameter of interest
    through a mechanical system to an electrical signal. Parameters such as flow rate,
    acceleration, velocity, direction, orientation, and pressure can be measured by
    mechanical sensors. Examples of IoT-enabled mechanical sensors found in the literature
    include rain gauges, mechanical flow meters, air and liquid pressure meters, and
    anemometers. Rain gauge is important to capture the precipitation accurately to
    determine the timing and quantity of irrigation when combined with soil water
    content sensors and evapotranspiration modeling (Kameoka et al., 2017). Tipping
    bucket rain sensor converts water volume it captures to an electrical signal through
    a simple mechanism. Measuring pressure is important for air, liquid, and soil
    pressure calculation. Air pressure is relevant to measure crop transpiration as
    the opening and closing of plant stomata are partially regulated by vapor pressure
    deficit. Soil compaction can be measured by the pressure sensors inserted into
    the soil, which are useful for measuring the impact of heavy agricultural machinery.
    Irrigation line pressure sensors are critical to monitor the irrigation process
    as the wetting pattern of irrigation systems highly depends on the irrigation
    line pressure. High pressure causes loss of irrigation energy while low pressure
    does not allow maximum irrigation area through sprinklers. Anemometers can be
    used to measure the wind speed which is required for calculating ET and detecting
    high-speed wind that could be hazardous to plants. Gas and liquid flow rate are
    significant parameters for crop, soil, and environmental monitoring. Conventionally
    crop and soil inputs in the liquid or gaseous form, such as water input (including
    rain), leaching water, liquid fertilizer, liquid or gaseous insecticides, are
    measured using flow sensors. Some cash crops or niche crops such as wasabi (Sultana
    and Savage, 1970) and lettuce (Sultana and Savage, 1970) need highly precise environmental
    conditions and flow monitoring sensors are important for meeting those conditions
    in the future if climate change imposes challenges to grow them. Overall mechanical
    sensors play a key role in Ag-IoT systems, but most of the mechanical sensors
    are replaced by non-mechanical sensors due to the fact mechanical sensors need
    frequent maintenance and have long response time. 3.1.6. Optical sensors Optical
    measurands play a key role in modern agriculture. There should be a light source
    and an optical sensor to take the measurements. Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and
    near infrared (NIR) are the main wavelength regions where optical sensors are
    operated. It is important to note that optical sensors appear to have the least
    applications as IoT sensors according to the literature. Typical RGB images were
    used to derive RGB image-based vegetation indexes while multispectral sensors
    were used to derive vegetation indexes such as NDVI and NDRE (red-edge NDVI).
    Most of the optical sensors that generate spectral signatures or images of the
    target produce larger volumes of data and consume a higher amount of power compared
    to other sensors in Fig. 3. This appears to be a significant discouraging factor
    to incorporate these sensors into IoT. Naturally, signals in the visible region
    were used as indicators for many crops and environmental parameters such as maturation
    time, crop quality (Long and McCallum, 2015), crop nutrient requirement, pest
    pressure, as well as water and nutrient level in the soil. Historically people
    used their eyes (only responsive to the visible lights) to evaluate the color
    intensities somewhat qualitatively (e.g., comparing those to standard color cards).
    The introduction of these sensors has significantly improved optical measurements
    of crop and environmental parameters by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) enabling quantitative
    assessments and (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001) extending the spectral regions from
    visible only to UV and NIR. Fruit spectral signature was used to identify defects
    in the fruit that could not be revealed via visible light. NDVI and NDRE were
    used to quantitatively determine crop density as well as the nitrogen and water
    requirements (Scotford and Miller, 2004). We would like to highlight that more
    research is needed to demonstrate the optical measurand use in Ag-IoT as they
    can be used in a wide range of applications in agriculture. 3.1.7. Thermal sensors
    Thermal measurands have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT, and most of them
    are measured indirectly with optical and electrical means; for instance, measuring
    crop canopy temperature with infrared radiometers. In the literature, the frequent
    use of air and soil temperature sensors highlighted their importance in crop ET
    modeling and disease forecasting (Symeonaki et al., 2020). These sensors are cheap
    and readily available as off-the-shelf items and support a wide variety of IoT
    platforms (Mohanraj et al., 2016). Thermal parameters have the potential to indirectly
    measure biological measurands. One such example is the sap flow sensor, which
    was described in one study as a transpiration measuring sensor compatible with
    the IoT system (Villalba et al., 2017). The sensor consisted of a flexible tree
    stem heater and a temperature sensor while the IoT platform calculated sap flow
    based on the applied heat and temperature. This sap flow measurement is proportional
    to transpiration (sap movement in the xylem) and therefore useful in crop ET modeling
    (Villalba et al., 2017). Sap flow monitoring is essential in some crops to understand
    the physiological behavior of plants. Rubber, maple, coconut, and palmyra palm
    sap are the output of the harvest, and in these cases, sap flow monitoring is
    useful to estimate yield, optimize production, and develop high-yielding crop
    varieties. Indirectly measured canopy temperature through infrared radiometers
    estimates the transpiration rate and crop water stress index, which is important
    for water stress detection and irrigation scheduling (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001).
    Identification of pests such as wild boar through thermal measurement is an interesting
    application in agriculture. Furthermore, the temperature is found to affect the
    quality of grapefruits (sugar content) and flowering time of several crops (Pérez-Expósito
    et al., 2017). Temperature sensors can also record the temperature variation in
    plant leaves and flowering buds and give a warning about frosting time (Barker
    et al., 2017). This listing of thermal measurand applications concluded that thermal
    sensors are very important in Ag-IoT and have been demonstrated in the past literature.
    3.2. Sensing platforms and main control board Section 3.2 summarizes the statistics
    of the Ag-IoT sensing platforms and control boards in the literature. The answer
    for Question 3 in Table 1 was derived from Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (196KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main control boards
    of the Ag-IoT systems present in the reviewed papers. 3.2.1. Sensing platforms
    Sensing platforms consist of sensor node including sensors, power supply, energy
    storage, actuators, main control board or the data processing unit, and structural
    components. Structural components determine the sensor node establishment in the
    field. There are two main types of IoT platforms available for crop monitoring.
    Stationery IoT platforms can collect continuous crop data or telemetry data targeting
    a single plant or a group (plot) of plants. The main advantage of stationery IoT
    is the high temporal resolution of the data. Mobile IoT platforms can collect
    data over some areal coverage and with high spatial resolution, but with limited
    temporal resolution. Kumar et al. (2016) presented the development and testing
    of a crop monitoring mobile robot. It is capable of automatically planning the
    path to find crops, recognizing plants using neural networks, applying fertilizer
    timely, and applying water based on the feedback from soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and humidity sensors. 3.2.2. Main control boards The communication and
    data processing hardware for IoT systems reported in the reviewed papers could
    be broadly categorized into three kinds: commercial platforms, custom build, and
    DIY (do-it-yourself) development boards. The commercial platforms are reliable
    but have limited support for integrating different or additional sensors. IPex12
    (Odin Solutions SL, Peru), Particle Electron (Particle Industries, Inc., USA),
    MICAZ (MICAS AG, Germany), IRIS (IRIS IoT Solutions, UK), and Telosb (Advantic
    Sistemas y Servicios S.L., Spain) are commercial IoT systems. In the last decade,
    commercial IoT platforms were still at their development stage, explaining their
    lower use in the reviewed papers. Custom build hardware is designed by researchers
    based on their own requirements. Researchers have the flexibility to decide on
    the number and types of sensors, interfacing connections, microprocessor clock
    speed, IoT node memory capacity, input voltage, and the communication technology
    used in the node. Furthermore, the technical complexities present in developing
    customized sensor interfacing may also discourage researchers from using commercial
    systems. The custom build hardware platforms have high levels of customization
    but require extensive knowledge of embedded system development to design them.
    DIY platforms are IoT nodes designed based on commercially available development
    platforms, including Arduino, EasyPIC v7, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Wapmote. DIY
    development board based IoT systems are popular among researchers because of their
    low cost, high availability, compatibility, and easy programmability. The percentage
    of different hardware platforms used in the reviewed articles is given in Fig.
    4. There were 52 identifiable hardware designs in the list of 115 research. Out
    of them, 29% of the platforms had Arduino only, 8% had Arduino and Raspberry Pi
    hardware jointly, and 2% used Arduino and Arducam hardware together. Ag-IoT research
    was dominated by Arduino-based development systems. Availability, reliability,
    easy programmability, and the option of supporting multiple communication protocols
    made Arduino-based systems popular among Ag-IoT researchers. Raspberry Pi systems
    were demonstrated in 12% of the IoT systems, likely due to their capability of
    capturing images and high computing power compared to Arduino. Selection of the
    IoT platform and the main control board is an important activity in IoT system
    design. The mainboard must support the communication protocols and the power requirement
    (e.g., voltage) of the sensors and actuators. Often voltage and communications
    protocol converters are needed to interface sensors with the main control board.
    Mainboards support three types of digital memories. Volatile memory holds the
    instructions and data of the currently running program until the power is on.
    Volatile memory influences the system''s performance. A larger volatile memory
    is needed for IoT nodes with a large amount of data generated via sensors like
    RGB cameras or spectral sensors. Nonvolatile memory stores data and the program
    when the IoT node power is turned off. The operating system, device identification
    data, and system settings are common data types stored in the nonvolatile memory.
    External nonvolatile memory (e.g., SD cards) can be used to store data or system
    settings, greatly expanding the data storage capability of the Ag-IoT system.
    3.3. Communication technologies and IoT protocols Section 3.3 produces the answers
    to research questions 4 and 5 in Table 1 while discussing findings on the literature
    related to wireless communication technology and IoT protocols. 3.3.1. Wireless
    communication technology Wireless data transmission is a key function of an IoT
    system. To design a successful Ag-IoT system, it is essential to understand the
    radio frequency (RF) contributing factors that impact signal strength, interference,
    system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Also, understanding of pros and
    cons of wireless communication technologies is essential for a better Ag-IoT device
    selection. Received power (Pr) of wireless data transmission in an unobstructed
    line of sight in a radio signal-free area depends on the transmitter power (Pt),
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains (GTX, GRX), the distance between the transmitter
    and the receiver (R), and the wavelength (λ) of the radio. This relationship is
    expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, long wavelength radio signals such as LoRa in 900
    MHz are suitable for long-distance data transmission compared to short wavelength
    signals such as Wi-Fi operated in 2.4–3.2 GHz without changing other variables.
    For long-distance communication, the plane earth loss formula is used to account
    for the curvature of Earth for signal strength (Nadir et al., 2008). Equation
    1 Friis transmission equation (Shaw, 2013). Furthermore, radio signals are subject
    to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These phenomena are illustrated in
    Fig. 5. In open flat agricultural fields, reflection, scattering, and diffraction
    may not occur unless there are large agricultural structures. In hilly areas and
    forests, the effects of wireless signal propagation properties may need special
    attention when placing IoT devices. The Fresnel Zone is the area around the visual
    line-of-sight that radio waves propagate out once they leave the antenna. Blockage
    of Fresnel Zone >40% causes severe signal losses (Tate et al., 2008). Therefore,
    factors such as the height and density of the crop canopies nearby, the presence
    of agricultural structures (e.g., irrigation pivots and storage silos), the locations
    to place IoT nodes, and the antenna height and position are important to account
    for in ensuring the signal transmission quality. In fact, the research on wireless
    communications in rural and agricultural landscapes has raised a lot of interest
    recently (Vuran et al., 2022). The signal quality is also affected by channel
    noise, interference, multipath fading, and attenuation. The success of data transmission
    is measured by a parameter called bit rate error (BRE). Based on the above discussion
    we would like to suggest that it is important to use wireless signal strength
    mapping tools during IoT system installations. Such tools will help to select
    the optimum IoT communication technology (for example, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Mobile Communication)
    suitable for each case, accounting for data transmission rates and signal losses.
    This practice would help farmers to reduce the capital and operational costs involved
    with IoT systems. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download

    In the literature, we found that a wide variety of wireless communication technologies
    were used by the researchers. Out of the 35 studies where communication technology
    was clearly mentioned, 34% used Wi-Fi, 17% were conducted using LoRa, and 14%
    used Zigbee. Also 11% of the studies used ethernet or the wired internet connection.
    Less attention was received for mobile communication technologies such as 4G (3%),
    NB-IoT (3%), and GSM (3%). In some cases, researchers used two or more technologies
    to connect different areas in the fields such as LoRa / Wi-Fi, LoRa / TV white
    space (TVWS), and GSM / Zigbee. According to the findings, Wi-Fi and ethernet
    were common in greenhouses while others were favored in outdoor farming practices.

    IoT protocols are data transmission standards that allow communication between
    the endpoint and services with the internet being the common network. IoT protocols
    are broadly classified into two major groups: IoT data protocols and IoT network
    protocols. The data protocols correspond to the application layer whereas network
    protocols correspond to the perception and network layer in the standard IoT architecture
    (Fig. 1). IoT network protocols create networks of device connections. Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth are such network protocols, and the same term is
    used to represent wireless communication technology. Some common IoT protocols
    are listed in Table 3 with specifications such as frequency, data rate, and range

    IoT network protocol/wireless communication technology has its advantages (Table
    3). Bluetooth is a popular short-range wireless communication technology standard
    convenient to create personal area networks. It is possible to use Bluetooth in
    indoor applications such as mobile phone-connected soil water sensors and sensor
    networking in small greenhouses. ZigBee is useful in large indoor growing spaces
    and LoRa is suitable for field crop monitoring senor networks. Cellular technology
    is useful for indoor or outdoor spaces where the network coverage is available.
    Wi-Fi is suitable for both small or large indoor spaces as well as outdoor applications
    where there is infrastructure support available to setup Wi-Fi gateways. Cellular
    and Wi-Fi allow transmitting images, videos, and other larger data files such
    as 3D point cloud data. Bluetooth shares the same advantage but is limited to
    a short distance. Compared to LoRa, Zigbee, and cellular technology, Wi-Fi has
    high reliability in data transmission, but power consumption is high too. All
    these protocols were tested in real crop growing environments (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016; Codeluppi et al., 2020). 3.4. Cloud platforms and service models
    3.4.1. Cloud platforms Cloud is an essential part of any IoT system. IoT devices
    are not useful without cloud connectivity. Data gathered via individual IoT sensors
    become useful when connected with other relevant sensors. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling
    ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
    computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
    that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
    service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance, 2011). Essential expected characteristics
    of a cloud system are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,
    rapid elasticity, and measured service. Out of the 115 papers we reviewed, only
    25 papers discussed cloud platforms in detail. Among them, 28% of the researchers
    used the ThingSpeak cloud platform developed by MATLAB as the service provider,
    12% used Microsoft Azure, and 12% used Ubidots platform. Furthermore, 12% of the
    researchers built themselves a local data server with the required functionality.
    Google-based Firebase had 8% usage. Other cloud platform service providers including
    Amazon Web Services, cloud sense, generic cloud, sensorDB, SEnviro, and Huawei
    Cloud had 4% use each. The percentage distribution of these cloud platforms is
    given in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Statistics of cloud service provider selection. 3.4.2.
    Public, private, and hybrid cloud In terms of privacy policies, cloud platforms
    can be divided into three major models: 3.4.2.1. Public cloud Services are offered
    over the public internet and available to anyone who needs to purchase them. Third-party
    cloud service providers own and operate the cloud resources such as servers and
    storage in the public cloud model. Users do not need to spend any capital expenditures
    to scale up; applications can be quickly provisioned and terminated; and users
    pay only for what they use. These are the advantages of the public cloud. Amazon
    Web Services and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud services. 3.4.2.2.
    Private cloud A private cloud comprises computing resources used exclusively by
    users from one business or organization therefore hardware must be purchased for
    start-up and maintenance is required. In the private cloud model, infrastructure
    is not shared with users outside the organization. A private cloud can be physically
    placed at a data center owned by the user organization, or it can be hosted by
    a third-party service provider. But the organization has complete control over
    resources and security. 3.4.2.3. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud is a computing environment
    that combines a public and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to
    be shared between them. The organizations determine where to run their applications
    while they control security, compliance, or legal requirements. Some organizations
    use a hybrid cloud model to keep sensitive data in the private cloud whereas frontal
    services and web portals are serviced in the public cloud for scalability. Furthermore,
    the public cloud can act as a supporting system if the data and usage exceeds
    the capacity of the private cloud. 3.4.3. Cloud service model Cloud-based services
    provided to the users can be categorized into three major classes based on the
    hierarchy of the service offered. Typical cloud architecture has nine layers.
    They are from bottom to top in order: network, storage, server, virtualization,
    operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. The next section
    will explain cloud service models in detail with hardware and software layers
    they belong. 3.4.3.1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IaaS was the original
    cloud services model. For IaaS, the cloud service provider will provide the hardware
    and keep it up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration
    are up to the client. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational
    in Microsoft datacenters. The main advantage of the IaaS model is the rapid deployment
    of new computing devices. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure are some
    examples of IaaS. 3.4.3.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) In this cloud service
    model, the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources,
    and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
    For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers
    can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical
    hardware and software requirements. 3.4.3.3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) In the
    case of SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment,
    such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
    The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by
    the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working
    version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. 3.4.3.4. Network-as-a-Service
    (NaaS) Software-defined networking and software-defined perimeters are services
    that belonged to NaaS. NaaS is a cloud model that enables organizations to easily
    operate the network and achieve the outcomes they expect without owning, building,
    or maintaining their infrastructure through the cloud. NaaS can replace hardware-centric
    VPNs, load balancers, firewall appliances, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    connections. Users can scale up and scale down as demand changes, rapidly deploy
    services, and eliminate hardware costs. 3.4.4. Fog and edge computing Edge computing
    is the moving of data processing close to where the data is generated. Wireless
    communication-enabled sensors with microcontrollers can be considered edge computing
    devices. The introduction of the edge computing paradigm was due to issues related
    to centralized cloud computing architecture. Data and control signal transmission
    latency and delays in centralized system data analytics are some disadvantages
    of cloud computing. Therefore, network designers proposed architectures where
    the computing power is distributed more evenly around the network. Fog and edge
    computing push the processing capability out to the edge of the network, closer
    to the source of the data. Such techniques are called fog computing and edge computing.
    Fog computing is a computing layer between the cloud and the edge where edge devices
    send large amounts of data to the cloud. The fog computing layer can get the data
    from the edge layer before it reaches the cloud and filter what is relevant and
    what is not. The filtered data gets stored in the cloud, while the unrelated data
    can be deleted, or analyzed at the fog layer for remote access or to use in localized
    learning models. Precision herbicide applications become popular with field crops.
    There, a moving platform that has a camera, carries and applies the herbicide
    at the exact location of the emerging weed. The image processing hardware and
    software in the moving platform do the image processing instantaneously to reduce
    the delay of cloud-based image processing in larger fields (Coleman et al., 2022).
    The centralized cloud-only needs the weed density from the moving IoT platform
    to forecast the future herbicide need to maintain the required quantity in the
    stocks. Therefore, edge computing is all about placing computing power on the
    very edge of the network, on the actual sensors of the device. Low power consumption
    and low processing power microchips or micro-controllers embedded in the devices
    provide the power for edge computing. For that reason, their processing capacity
    is much more limited but sometimes can be adequate to process images (Chamara
    et al., 2021). 3.4.5. Data analytics in IoT Data analytics is one of the most
    important activities in any IoT system, as the decision-making of an IoT system
    depends on hundreds of sensors and events, which is difficult to analyze manually.
    Data generated by IoT devices fall under three categories. They are structured
    data (such as SQL storage), unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), and semi-structured
    data (like social media feeds). Ag-IoT systems can generate both structured and
    unstructured data (Lea, 2020). Stream processing and batch processing are the
    two main types of data processing techniques. Stream processing is useful for
    mobile Ag-IoT platforms since it allows real-time data processing. Batch processing
    can be applied in irrigation, chemigation, and fertigation applications as data
    are processed as a batch to make the decision. Common data analytics activities
    for IoT platforms are listed in Table 4. Below are some examples how they are
    used in Ag-IoT for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. Alerting allows growers
    to receive an alert message when soil water use exceeds the maximum allowable
    depletion (Gamon et al., 2015). Sensors in the field environment are susceptible
    to problems like physical damage, pest attack, misalignment, and breakdown, which
    cause errors in data streams. These problems can be effectively alleviated by
    error finding. Using time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    or Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to determine the next irrigation or fertigation
    time belongs to trend analysis. Triggering sprinklers in a field based on SWC
    sensor values is an example of signaling. More complex decisions can be formed
    by combining several analytical activities. For example, in automated crop disease
    detection, an average daily temperature above 20 to 25 °C followed by 1–2 in.
    of rain, together with sugar beet leaf color change indicated a sugar beet pathogen
    outbreak (Wolf and Verreet, 2002). This analysis was enabled by data joining,
    tracking, and trend analysis. Table 4. Data analysis activities commonly found
    in Ag-IoT applications. Data analysis activity Function Preprocessing Filter out
    data with little interest to reduce data complexity and duplication Alerting Raise
    an alert if data exceed certain boundary condition Windowing Apply rules on data
    in a predefined time window Joining Combine multiple data streams into a new single
    data stream Error finding Find missing values and anomalies in data streams Tracking
    Identify when or where an event has occurred Trend analysis Quantify change or
    trend of data as a function of time Signaling Send control signal when a decision
    is made 3.5. Power and energy management Power and energy storage are the two
    major driving forces for IoT systems, especially for Ag-IoT located in remote
    fields. In the literature, we found 3 main categories of power management systems.
    Direct main power connected nodes is the first type and most common with indoor
    applications. A rechargeable battery with a recharging option such as solar, hydro,
    or wind is the second option. The third one has a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable
    battery but is designed to consume very low power by sending a very low amount
    of data intermittently. Among the 115 pieces of research we have reviewed, only
    27 of them discussed the IoT system power and energy storage features. Out of
    these 27, 11 platforms used solar power as the main power supply while Lithium
    Polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries were used as the energy storage solution.
    Out of 11 indoor farming applications which explained the power management options,
    9 used the main grid power supply. Research that focused on IoT system setup under
    high dense canopies used high power density and high-capacity battery-only solutions
    such as 12 V lead-acid batteries. Two studies mentioned they used battery with
    solar but did not disclose details about the specifications. It revealed that
    there are very limited power supplies available for in-field IoT implementation
    and the findings are highlighted in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    selection of the Ag-IoT systems in the reviewed studies. Unlike edge-computing
    devices, typical IoT end nodes are designed to be less power-hungry. This power
    consumption goes high due to certain reasons such as connected high throughput
    sensors, significant data processing, and massive data transmission. However,
    these power consumptions can be minimized by exploiting different techniques such
    as the semi-active phase and sleep phase (Zhang and Li, 2019). The edge computing-enabled
    devices need more power. It is essential to standardize the IoT power management
    based on the crop and geographical location of the devices. For example, solar
    power is not a very promising solution for locations with large trees such as
    rubber, pepper, and spices that have a dense crop canopy 5–10 m above the ground
    (Villalba et al., 2017). 3.6. Actuators Monitoring and controlling are two agricultural
    operations closely related to each other. Monitoring by itself is an open-loop
    operation; whereas monitoring, controlling, and again monitoring the effects of
    controlling make a system closed loop and can improve the efficiency of the system.
    Efficient controlling of the actuators based on the monitoring is a key feature
    in the agricultural domain for optimizing inputs, maximizing crop yield and quality,
    and reducing the negative environmental impacts. Fig. 9 depicts the number of
    actuators controlled via IoT systems that were reported in our reviewed papers.
    Out of the 115 studies, 54 mentioned IoT-enabled actuation. Some studies used
    more than one actuator, whereas most of the in-field IoT sensor monitoring systems
    did not mention the use of actuators. Download : Download high-res image (130KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Count of actuators controlled via
    IoT systems found in the reviewed papers. Since water is the largest input by
    volume applied to farms, actuators related to water have been mostly discussed
    in the research work. Such controllers are pumps and solenoid valves. Controlling
    these two actuators were demonstrated in 22 and 8 instances, respectively. After
    irrigation, controlling lighting was the most occurred application in indoor farming
    followed by ventilation, fertigation, alert, and air conditioning. Ventilation
    allows outdoor air to come inside the greenhouse while air conditioning includes
    heating or cooling of the air. Alert meant the system sent an email or message
    to the farmer or the operator of the farm when a parameter exceeded a threshold
    value. An IoT-controlled insect repellent actuator was demonstrated twice among
    the 115 case studies evaluated. Automation of soil bed preparation was achieved
    by utilizing stepper motors in one instance of IoT-based indoor farming. According
    to Figure 9, water pumps and valves were the most frequently used actuators, and
    all these systems were closed loop control systems with soil moisture sensors
    and ET modeling. From the study of the above actuator-related research, it can
    be said that there is enormous potential to automate the controlling of the indoor
    crop''s required environment and soil preparation. (See Fig. 9.) 3.7. Ag-IoT for
    crop monitoring Out of the 115 publications reviewed, 71 systems were demonstrated
    in a real environment. Among them, 65% were implemented in the fields, 24% were
    demonstrated in indoor environments, and 11% were simulations. This is an interesting
    finding that reveals the huge potential of implementing outdoor or in-field IoT
    applications. Typically, it is easy to set up indoor IoT sensor networks due to
    fewer technological barriers, such as extreme environmental conditions and sensor
    connectivity issues. Since real applications were available only in 65% (71 out
    of 115) instances, further real implementations can be done to demonstrate the
    capability of Ag-IoT applications. Considering the 71 systems that demonstrated
    the real applications, 49 were practically demonstrated with certain types of
    crops and 22 did not mention the specific crop they used. 15% of these systems
    were demonstrated with grapes while cereal crops accounted for 26%. One research
    was based on both grapes and oranges. In total 50% of the IoT studies focused
    on perennial specialty crops of higher value including grape, moringa, orange,
    citrus, sugarcane, silver maple, apricot, cashew, and olive (Fig. 10). This result
    indicates that IoT can be implemented with diverse crop types to achieve various
    purposes. Ag-IoT systems are easy to set up on perennial croplands as there is
    less soil preparation for the IoT system installation. It is important to develop
    techniques that allow easy IoT implementation to the annual crops as they contribute
    more to global food security. It is also worth to note only one research demonstrated
    the economic viability of IoT implementation (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, future
    research to assess and understand the economic viability of IoT applications in
    various situations is needed. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download

    crop types. 4. Challenges of Ag-IoT systems and potential solutions Ag-IoT faces
    challenges that are unique compared with IoT applications in other industries.
    In this section, we briefly discuss those challenges that are of utmost importance
    for Ag-IoT system researchers and developers. Ag-IoT challenges can be mainly
    classified into three sections: technical challenges, sectoral challenges, and
    business challenges (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.1. Technical challenges Limitations
    of the advancement of technology are the reasons for technical challenges. They
    would likely be effectively addressed as tools and technologies advance with time.
    The Ag-IoT technical challenges are discussed under the three layers of the IoT
    architecture (Fig. 1), namely, perception layer issues, network layer issues,
    and application layer issues. 4.1.1. Perception layer issues Ag-IoT systems''
    perception layer faces unique challenges, because of the requirements it needs
    to meet during crop and environmental monitoring in harsh environments (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Agricultural lands have limited electricity and communication infrastructure.
    It is not practical or cost-effective to use wired power and communication media
    to connect IoT nodes in the field. Therefore, power management, device longevity,
    and ergonomic design are major challenges related to the Ag-IoT perception layer.
    Power management includes Ag-IoT node-level power generation, strategies to reduce
    power consumption, and energy storage. Section 3.5 Power and Energy Management
    revealed that most of the researchers were interested in solar with rechargeable
    batteries as the power source in agriculture. However, there is a challenge to
    introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under the tall and dense
    crop canopy. Micro wind turbines have the potential as an Ag-IoT power source
    but receive less attention in the literature (Jawad et al., 2017). Continuous
    improvements have been made to rechargeable batteries due to the demand for high
    energy to weight ratio batteries. There are several approaches available to reduce
    power consumption. One approach is to select sensors, actuators, and wireless
    protocols with low energy consumption. Selection of a node duty cycle that turns
    the sensor or actuator on when it reads, sends, or receives signals is another
    viable approach (Estrada-Lopez et al., 2018). Harsh environmental conditions such
    as wind and rainfall, continuous high solar radiation, sub-zero temperatures in
    winter, chemicals commonly used in agriculture, and animal attacks make it difficult
    to keep Ag-IoT nodes in the field in operable conditions for a long time (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Sensors, cables, and enclosures should be designed to withstand
    such conditions. Standards are available to follow in most cases, but the cost
    becomes high when required standards need to be escalated. Analog signals (Analogue
    voltage or current), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), Serial Data Interface at
    1200 baud rate (SDI-12), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
    are the common sensor to microcontroller data transmission techniques. The microcontroller
    development boards and commercial IoT platforms are designed to work with different
    voltage levels, such as 3.3 V, 5 V, 7 V, and 12 V. These different communication
    protocols and operation voltages have created barriers to the interoperability
    of the devices in Ag-IoT implementation. Research and development to standardize
    data communication and power supply in Ag-IoT systems would substantially increase
    the scalability, upgradability, and interoperability in the perception layer.
    Improving ergonomic design and reducing the labor intensiveness for deploying
    Ag-IoT systems in the field are urgently needed. IoT-based soil water content
    monitoring is a good example to show this issue. Often soil sensors are buried
    underground for continuous measurements during a season. These sensor nodes also
    have an aboveground section to allow wireless communication, which could interfere
    with farm operations such as tillage, fertilizer application, and chemical spraying,
    and should be closely monitored. For annual crops, the need to remove the sensors
    when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a significant
    logistic issue for using them effectively. Research on underground wireless communication
    technology (Akyildiz et al., 2009) and Internet of Underground Things (Vuran et
    al., 2018) is ongoing, bearing the promise to alleviate this challenge associated
    with Ag-IoT node installation and maintenance. No standards are currently available
    on Ag-IoT installation as agricultural fields and practices are highly heterogeneous.
    Novel solutions are necessary to encourage Ag-IoT users. 4.1.2. Network layer
    issues The most common Ag-IoT network layer issues are internet coverage, standard
    interception, interference, propagation losses, communication range, wireless
    link quality, network expansion, network management, communication protocols,
    latency, and throughput. As most farms are in rural areas, remote locations, or
    mountain regions, it is a huge challenge to get internet connectivity to them
    since these underpopulated areas have limited internet infrastructure. One solution
    could be creating a local network, a concept similar to a hybrid cloud. This type
    of system does not connect to the internet but still allows local servers to perform
    the basic IoT functionality (Akyildiz et al., 2009). Due to the recent advancement
    in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it would soon be possible to have internet
    connectivity via satellite as illustrated in Fig. 11 on a commercial scale (Ivanova
    et al., 2016). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the future, many agricultural
    fields will rely on satellite-based connectivity to connect their gateways to
    the internet. This system consists of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) type
    ground antenna which is connected to the nodes through multiple gateways. Gateways
    can follow different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, or Zigbee.
    One disadvantage of satellite-based internet connectivity is that it needs a clear
    sky to make a successful connection. Therefore, it is logical to have a local
    server for data storage and decision-making when the connection is interrupted.

    Fig. 11. Future Ag-IoT system with satellite connected internet. Standard interception
    refers to difficulties in using the full potential of a communication technology
    due to standards imposed by regulatory authorities to limit the use. Recent advancements
    on long-range low throughput communication technologies such as LoRa become widely
    known communication protocols in Ag-IoT. To promote fair use of LoRa bandwidth,
    governments can regulate the use of wireless frequencies. For example, in Europe,
    the duty cycle or the transmitter uptime of the LoRa node is between 0.1% to 10%.
    This is a challenge in most Ag-IoT applications as there are higher volumes of
    data to transmit and many sensors and actuators to connect. When many IoT nodes
    are deployed, the interference may occur because the data transmission could use
    the same frequency, especially in unlicensed spectrums, such as ZigBee, Sigfox,
    LoRa, and Wi-Fi. Signal interference causes data loss and reduces the reliability
    of the systems (Elijah et al., 2018). Wireless signal propagation strength, communication
    range, and wireless link quality depend on the humidity, temperature, crop growth
    status, and crop morphological characteristics in agriculture fields (Tzounis
    et al., 2017; Cama-Pinto et al., 2019; Vuran et al., 2022). Thus, wireless signal
    propagation strength simulation and visualization software are essential in the
    future for the mass installation of Ag-IoT sensor nodes. Such software will reduce
    the complexity of node placement issues. 4.1.3. Application layer issues Data
    security, data privacy, and data analysis are application layer issues. Ag-IoT
    data is important for a country''s food security as well as for the Ag business
    model security. In the modern competitive world, data breaching could lead to
    a competitive disadvantage on Ag-business model over a competitor as well as risk
    the food security of a country. Therefore, more focus should be put into improving
    the security and privacy of data generated via Ag-IoT systems. 4.2. Sectoral challenges
    4.2.1. Regulatory issues Data ownership creates another business challenge. Companies
    that provide Ag-IoT services can use the data for improvements in their systems,
    but farmers do not receive compensation for that. There is a challenge to implement
    such a system to prevent data monopoly (Misra et al., 2020). Therefore, regulation
    and legal frameworks about the control and rights of data between farmers and
    IoT companies need to be established (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.2.2. Interoperability
    issue According to Elijah et al. (2018), interoperability involves the ability
    to have technical, synthetic, semantic, and organization interoperability. Technical
    interoperability involves the effortless communication among IoT devices using
    protocols. Data interchanging between systems is semantic interoperability. Synthetic
    interoperability deals with IoT system-generated digital data exchange with humans,
    while organization interoperability involves information sharing among different
    regions, infrastructures, and cultures (Elijah et al., 2018). Here we would like
    to introduce a challenge associated with Ag-IoT system interoperability. As most
    of the farmers have crop rotations and multi-cropping systems, it is essential
    to have Ag-IoT systems with context awareness that allows them to work with different
    cropping systems. The heterogeneity of agricultural systems imposes the system
    interoperability challenge. 4.2.3. Business issues The cost and non-availability
    of skilled personnel in Ag-IoT is a business issue. Cost is a challenge for Ag-IoT
    implementation. There are three types of costs involved with Ag-IoT systems: the
    setup cost or the capital expenditure, running cost or operational cost, and upgrading
    cost. Due to the nature of IoT business models and being a relatively new technology,
    analysis on return on investment of Ag-IoT systems is not yet discussed considerably
    in the literature. Chen et al. (2019) highlighted that application of IoT systems
    on irrigation controlling in turmeric turned out to be profitable. Several factors
    increase capital expenditure. Remote and harsh environmental conditions that Ag-IoT
    systems must bear increase the production cost of Ag-IoT systems. Ag-IoT end nodes
    require materials that do not wear and tear due to sun, rain, and chemicals applied
    during crop cultivation. Communication cost is usually a standard rate, but the
    initial investment is required to set up the internet connection, and this cost
    depends on the infrastructure availability where the farms are located. Theoretical
    knowledge and practical experience about the sensing/actuating system and parameters
    of interest are essential to set up a successful Ag-IoT system. Sensor data interpreters
    need an overall understanding of the agroecological principles to reach a decision
    (Duff et al., 2022). Reluctance to use new technology and unskilled manpower are
    apparent obstacles to implementing Ag-IoT in commercial production crop monitoring
    systems. More extension programs are needed to solve this issue while standards
    are necessary for Ag-IoT system development to improve the common Ag-IoT platforms
    that have interoperable qualities. 5. Supporting technologies 5.1. Augmented reality
    and IoT applications Data visualization and real-time decision-making are important
    to IoT. Based on past literature this sector is the least explored area. Wearable
    augmentation devices improve crop monitoring and control. Smart glasses have the
    real-time data visualization capability to indicate the status of crops, soil,
    or environment (Hurst et al., 2021). An irrigation activity can be controlled
    manually by a farmer if he can visualize the real-time soil water content change
    in the field. The conditions within a greenhouse can be controlled in real-time
    and actuators can be controlled via voice command through a smart glass. Harvesting
    can be more enjoyable and more efficient (lower loss) based on image processing
    capable smart glasses. Vegetable or fruit pickers can be assisted through a smart
    glass by viewing what it detects in the fruit to decide whether to pick it or
    not. Untrained labor usage-related losses can be reduced by augmented reality
    related training. 5.2. Big data Big data generated by Ag-IoT are mostly of heterogeneous
    types. The most common IoT agricultural big data are machine-generated data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). These data are generated from a massive number of sensors and smart
    machines used to measure and record farming processes; which are in turn boosted
    by the IoT. Machine-generated data range from simple sensor records to complex
    computer logs. Big data in agriculture are generated mostly when we introduce
    smart sensing and monitoring with the help of IoT. The main sources of big data
    in Ag-IoT are: sensors, robotics, open data, data captured by airborne sensors
    (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014; Cole et al., 2012), weather/climate data, yield data,
    soil types, agricultural census data (Chen et al., 2014) and so on. Typically,
    telemetry data is generated by sensors such as temperature, rotary, or linear
    encoder. These data are well-structured in contrast to imagery data which need
    post-processing. Such unstructured data have issues in terms of availability,
    quality, and formats (Liu et al., 2015) and can be a concern. As the number of
    sensors is increasing and data volumes are growing rapidly, it is becoming a matter
    of utmost importance to store and process big data. Some approaches to handle
    big data are data shrinking, scale up, scale out, and high-performance computing.
    Data shrinking is the process of throwing away some less important data and still
    being able to reconstruct the original data. Scale-up (vertical scalability) is
    adding additional storage and RAM to store and process the big data in the processing
    node. But this technique has its capacity limit. Scale out (horizontal scalability)
    is the concept of using parallel computers to store and process that big data.
    High-Performance Computing is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to handle
    big data, where computers with multiple cores are grouped to create an efficient
    network to deal with the big data. These techniques are essential for successful
    data handling in Ag-IoT. 5.3. Artificial intelligence in Ag-IoT Techniques that
    enable machines to mimic human behavior are artificial intelligence (AI), while
    a subset of AI that gives machines the ability of learning without being explicitly
    programmed is machine learning. Deep learning techniques are a subset of machine
    learning techniques with multilayer neural network feasibility. The data generated
    from the Ag-IoTs are often used to train machine learning models for specific
    agricultural use cases such as yield forecast, crop stress detection, and pest
    spreading prediction. To be more specific, for the agricultural IoT applications,
    raw sensing information such as field and weather conditions and crop status can
    be collected and used for model training locally or in the remote end that has
    more computational resources. These trained models can later be used to control
    actuators for variable rate irrigation and site-specific pesticide/ herbicide
    applications. Deep learning techniques are heavily used with image processing
    applications in agriculture. Trained deep learning models are available for crop
    type detection (de Filho et al., 2020), plant phenotyping (Pound et al., 2017),
    fruit (Patel et al., 2011), flower (Dias et al., 2018), and leaf detection (Chamara
    et al., 2021), and weed detection for herbicide applications (Coleman et al.,
    2022). AI becomes an integral part of IoT due to its capability of using it as
    a data analytics tool. 6. Ag-IoT for farming systems analyses and management In
    this section, we briefly discuss and envision how Ag-IoT would benefit and potentially
    transform farming systems analyses and management, enabled by its unprecedented
    data, analytics, and connected sensors and actuators. Perhaps the most obvious
    advantages of Ag-IoT come from the high spatiotemporal resolution of farm-level
    data it generates concerning crops, soil, and microclimate (Kagan et al., 2022).
    The high spatial resolution data would quantify the the spatial variability of
    crop parameters (such as yield and leaf area index) and soil parameters (such
    as pH, organic matter, and water holding capacility), and elucidate the relationships
    between them to identify yield-limiting factors at different parts of the field
    (Alfred et al., 2021). This is the underlying principle of site-specific crop
    management, which will be greatly enhanced through Ag-IoT. Modern Ag-IoTs take
    measurements at hourly and sub-hourly intervals. This high temporal resolution
    data allow us to observe the crop responses to environmental cues at finer time
    steps, and enhance our understanding on how basic plant physiological processes
    such as transpiration and photosynthesis vary due to short-term environmental
    fluctuations. Process-based crop and soil models, which are widely used to evaluate
    the economic and environmental consequences of farming practices, usually suffer
    from the lack of site-specific data to parameterize and calibrate them, especially
    the in-season crop data and soil data. These data are exactly what Ag-IoT sensors
    are good at generating, and therefore would improve the accuracy of these models
    for farm-level management assessment. Networked sensors and actuators of Ag-IoT,
    along with the real-time data processing, transmission, and modeling, would greatly
    improve the decision-making cycle of farm-level management practices (Chaterji
    et al., 2021). The traditional crop management decision-making has several limitations.
    First, the decision is usually based on a single set of data, because other datasets
    are unavailable or expensive to obtain. Second, there is usually long latency
    between data generation and decision-making (e.g., several days or weeks). This
    long latency is in contrast to the fact that many stresses in the field (such
    as pest outbreak) occur and develop quickly and need real-time intervention to
    prevent substantial loss. Thirdly, the present management practice only addresses
    one factor at a time whereas in reality crops can undergo multiple stresses simultaneously.
    Altogether, these limitations reflect our inability to capture the complexity
    of the farming system. Ag-IoT has the potential to transform farm-level decision-making
    by enabling multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategies, powered by real-time
    data processing and relevant models run in the cloud to shorten the latency. For
    example, crop, soil, and microclimate sensors can simultaneously measure the crop
    water and nitrogen status, soil moisture content and nitrate content, and weather
    variables. These multi-source inputs can be fed into the models to output two
    variables: a nitrogen sufficiency index and a water sufficiency index. These two
    variables can further be converted to a nitrogen and water application rate for
    site-specific fertigation. This paradigm has several advantages. First, it is
    a multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategy that accounts for the interaction
    between the water and nitrogen stresses. Second, it reduces the cost of implementation
    and shortens the management cycle because two actions are combined into one (one
    pass of field equipment instead of two). In a similar fashion, decisions such
    as pesticide applications and other chemicals (fungicides, growth regulators)
    could potentially be further stacked to make crop production more efficient. Traditionally,
    farm system analyses and management happen at the individual farm level (Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2019). In other words, data are usually not shared or co-analyzed
    across the farm boundary. In the era of Ag-IoT where farm data are shared and
    stored in the cloud, there represents an opportunity where the analysis and modeling
    of Ag-IoT data can cover a group of farms or at a regional scale. These regional
    analyses would answer other important questions such as regional yield forecasting,
    pest tracking, or agricultural resource prioritization. These questions are not
    necessarily important for individual growers, but are at the heart of other stakeholders
    such as policy makers and input suppliers. Data ownership and privacy, covered
    in Section 4, are two big issues that should be resolved before this type of analysis
    may occur. 7. Conclusions and future directions 7.1. Conclusions Ag-IoT is a promising
    technology that would increase resource use efficiency in agricultural systems,
    and is an essential tool for digital agriculture transformation. In this paper,
    we have overviewed impactful research related to Ag-IoT in the past decade. The
    data collected from these papers were categorized and analyzed under six main
    Ag-IoT system design parameters namely sensors, sensing platforms and main control
    board, communication technology and IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and
    energy management, and actuators. According to the analyzed data, it is revealed
    that there is an increased global attention towards the Ag-IoT system-related
    research in the recent years. However, there are certain research gaps found in
    the literature. One of them is that the implementations of the sensors and the
    actuators seem to be limited to soil and environmental parameter monitoring and
    irrigation controlling. Furthermore, crop macro and micronutrient demand analyses
    are still at the infant stage due to the non-availability of sensors that can
    measure nutrients in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to improve the sensor
    and actuator applications in crop monitoring and controlling. In addition, heterogeneity
    of the system parameters (such as data, platforms, required power) is a major
    challenge to the Ag-IoT systems implementation, to which the improvement of the
    context-awareness could be a solution. Power harness options for Ag-IoT nodes
    need more exploration as there are limited options available and it would be a
    big advantage for the perennial crop monitoring. The perception and the network
    layers of Ag-IoT systems require more improvements to meet the sensor implementation
    ergonomics and long-range high-throughput data transmission, respectively. Edge
    computing can be a replacement of the high throughput long-range communication,
    but to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of practical applications
    have been developed based on edge computing to date. Mobile Ag-IoT platforms such
    as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have a huge potential to increase the spatiotemporal
    resolution in Ag-IoT-based monitoring and controlling. 7.2. Future directions
    From the finding of this review, authors would like to highlight some important
    future requirements for Ag-IoT. The entire Ag-IoT research community needs to
    propose a complete system design for Ag-IoT that will be viable, open, and interpretable.
    The objective is to enable the interconnectivity of heterogeneous systems and
    sharing resources to obtain more detailed and specific agricultural data. Furthermore,
    in the future research work, there is a need to develop complete information perception
    standards and design multi-protocol compatible gateways. With some significant
    efforts in the above-mentioned future research directions, the entire research
    community will be able to solve the problems of inconsistent device interfaces
    and protocols, making the system faster, robust, and more convenient. Making full
    use of long-range low throughput communication technology, virtual reality/augmented
    reality, and big data/AI for Ag-IoT is yet to be thoroughly explored. Declaration

  title: 'Ag-IoT for crop and environment monitoring: Past, present, and future'
  verbatim_quote1: Soil water content is the most common variable measured by sensors
    in Ag-IoT systems. This is because water is the largest input by volume applied
    to farms, and accurate measurement of soil water content is essential for efficient
    irrigation management.
  verbatim_quote2: The authors found that 33 variables were measured by various sensors.

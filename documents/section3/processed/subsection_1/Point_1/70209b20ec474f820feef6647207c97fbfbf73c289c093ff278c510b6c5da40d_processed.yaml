  analysis: '**Type of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical
    sources**


    The following types of data are most applicable to irrigation management:


    - **Soil moisture data**, which can be used to determine when to irrigate and
    how much water to apply.

    - **Weather data**, such as rainfall, temperature, and wind speed, which can help
    farmers predict when and how much to irrigate.

    - **Crop data**, such as plant height, leaf size, and yield, which can help farmers
    determine the water needs of their crops.


    These data are typically collected from a variety of sources, including:


    - **Soil moisture sensors**, which can be inserted into the ground to measure
    the amount of moisture in the soil.

    - **Weather stations**, which collect data on rainfall, temperature, and wind
    speed.

    - **Satellite imagery**, which can be used to track crop growth and development.

    - **Farm records**, which can provide information on crop yields and water use.


    **Relevance to the analysis topic**


    The data described above are all essential for effective irrigation management.
    By collecting and analyzing these data, farmers can make informed decisions about
    when and how to irrigate their crops. This can lead to increased crop yields,
    reduced water use, and improved profitability.


    **Insight**


    The use of data in irrigation management is becoming increasingly common, as farmers
    recognize the value of using data to make informed decisions. There are a number
    of tools and resources available to help farmers collect and analyze data, making
    it easier than ever to implement data-driven irrigation management practices.


    **Limitations of the analysis**


    The analysis presented here is based on a review of the literature on irrigation
    management. The specific data requirements and data sources will vary depending
    on the specific crop, climate, and soil conditions. Farmers should consult with
    local experts to determine the best data sources and data analysis methods for
    their specific needs.'

    \ waters is compul-\nsory under current environmental policies, in particular\
    \ in\nEurope, under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD;\nEuropean Commission,\
    \ 2000). The WFD requires the\nclassification of the ecological status of surface\
    \ waters\nwith an integrated approach based on several biological\nindicators\
    \ and physico-chemical and hydro-morphologi-\ncal variables. The principal aim\
    \ of the WFD is to protect\nand enhance the status of aquatic ecosystems in the\
    \ Eu-\nropean Union. Monitoring is a basic effort to assess the\npresent-day quality\
    \ of European waters, describe their\nevolution through time, and, ultimately,\
    \ assess the effects\nof the WFD and design mitigation options (Skeffington\n\
    et al., 2015). \nTraditionally, monitoring freshwaters involves field\nsampling\
    \ and subsequent laboratory work. Samples are\ncollected manually from selected\
    \ areas of the waterbody\nand times of the year. This conventional approach pro-\n\
    vides essential information on the water quality and the\nmain ecological processes.\
    \ However, this approach often\nfails to capture the fast-paced dynamics of many\
    \ biotic\nand abiotic processes because of low sampling frequency\n(Marcé et al.,\
    \ 2016). As an example, the conventional\nmonitoring of the trophic state of lakes\
    \ based on micro-\nscopic characterization of phytoplankton communities\nand chlorophyll-a\
    \ (Chl-a) extractions (Lorenzen, 1967;\nISO, 1992), due to its demanding field\
    \ work and labora-\ntory effort, is necessarily conducted at a low frequency\n\
    resolution. This kind of monitoring may be insufficient to\ndetect the short-lived,\
    \ but significant changes in the phy-\ntoplankton communities, e.g., rapid turnover\
    \ of phyto-\nplankton species, cyanobacterial increases, and bloom\nAutomated\

    \ (HFM) system for the deep subalpine lakes Maggiore, Lugano and Como is under\
    \ development within\nthe EU INTERREG project SIMILE. The HFM system is designed\
    \ to i) describe often neglected but potentially relevant processes oc-\ncurring\
    \ on short time scale; ii) become a cost-effective source of environmental data;\
    \ and iii) strengthen the coordinated management\nof water resources in the subalpine\
    \ lake district. In this project framework, a first HFM station (LM1) consisting\
    \ of a monitoring buoy\nwas placed in Lake Maggiore. LM1 represents a pilot experience\
    \ within the project, aimed at providing the practical know-how needed\nfor the\
    \ development of the whole HFM system. To increase replicability and transferability,\
    \ LM1 was developed in-house, and conceived\nas a low-cost modular system. LM1\
    \ is presently equipped with solar panels, a weather station, and sensors for\
    \ water temperature, pH,\ndissolved oxygen, conductivity, and chlorophyll-a. In\
    \ this study, we describe the main features of LM1 (hardware and software) and\n\
    the adopted Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures. To this end,\
    \ we provide examples from a test period, i.e., the first\n9-months of functioning\
    \ of LM1. A description of the software selected as data management software for\
    \ the HFM system (IstSOS) is\nalso provided. Data gathered during the study period\
    \ provided clear evidence that coupling HFM and discrete sampling for QA/QC\n\
    controls is necessary to produce accurate data and to detect and correct errors,\
    \ mainly because of sensor fouling and calibration drift.\nThese results also\
    \ provide essential information to develop further the HFM system and shared protocols\
    \ adapted to the local environ-\nmental (i.e., large subalpine lakes) and technical\
    \ (expertise availability) context. The next challenge would be making HFM not\
    \ only a\nsource of previously unaffordable information, but also a cost-effective\
    \ tool for environmental monitoring.\nCorresponding author: michela.rogora@cnr.it\n\

    et al., 2012; Tran Khac et al., 2018). \nIn general, all the processes occurring\
    \ over a temporal\nscale shorter than the sampling frequency may go unno-\nticed\
    \ in traditional monitoring programs (e.g., short-lived,\nextreme episodic, or\
    \ unpredictable events; Dubelaar et al.,\n2004; Banas et al., 2005; Itvánovics\
    \ et al., 2005; Stock-\nwell et al., 2020). Both trophic state indicators, and\
    \ single\nlimnological variables (e.g., temperature, pH, dissolved\noxygen) are\
    \ indicative of lake water quality and may con-\ntribute to identify conditions\
    \ favourable to -or indicative\nof- algal blooms development. For instance, summer\
    \ heat\nwaves may promote blooms of harmful cyanobacteria and\nother worrisome\
    \ taxonomic shifts (Wagner and Adrian,\n2009). Sudden changes in water temperature,\
    \ conductivity\nand dissolved oxygen can support the identification of up-\nwelling\
    \ events due to internal sexes, mixing episodes, in-\ntrusion of river waters\
    \ and the calculation of lake mixing\nand stratification indices (Read et al.,\
    \ 2011). Short term\nchanges in pH and dissolved oxygen may also help inves-\n\
    tigating inorganic carbon dynamics in lakes (Khan et al.,\n2020). Further, high\
    \ frequency limnological data, possibly\ngathered at different locations within\
    \ a lake, represent a\nvaluable resource for lake modelling (Laborde et al.,\n\
    2010; Pilotti et al., 2013).\nRecent advances in sensor technology can overcome\n\
    the drawbacks of conventional monitoring, giving the op-\nportunity to measure\
    \ an increasing number of limnologi-\ncal and ecological parameters at unprecedented\
    \ short\ntemporal intervals and also during adverse meteorological\nevents (Banas\
    \ et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2007; Le Vu et\nal., 2011; Jennings et al., 2012;\
    \ Klug et al., 2012; Hamil-\nton et al., 2014; Meinson et al., 2016). Over the\
    \ past\ndecade, there has been a drastic increase in the use of au-\ntomated collection\
    \ of high-frequency data in scientific re-\nsearch and environmental monitoring\
    \ (Horsburgh et al.,\n2015). In addition, the installation of automated high fre-\n\
    quency monitoring (HFM) systems is often expected to\nbecome a cost-effective\
    \ monitoring tool, to cope with the\nscarcity of specialized personnel for field\
    \ and laboratory\nwork and to reduce the analytical costs (Le Vu et al.,\n2011).\
    \ A great impulse to the development of HFM sys-\ntems for European lakes came\
    \ from the COST Action\nNETLAKE (ES1201 - Networking Lake Observatories in\nEurope)\
    \ which prompted the establishment of a network\nof scientists, technologists,\
    \ managers, and stakeholders\nfocused on the application of sensor technology\
    \ for lake\nmonitoring (Marcé et al., 2016). The cooperative network\nGLEON (Global\
    \ Lake Ecological Observatory Network)\nalso supports sharing and interpreting\
    \ high resolution sen-\nsor data from lakes worldwide (Weathers et al., 2013).\
    \ An\nincreasing number of environmental authorities from all\naround the world\
    \ are integrating some HFM systems in\ntheir monitoring programmes (Le Vu et al.,\
    \ 2011; Bertone\net al., 2018), also to improve provision of high-quality\nfreshwater,\
    \ provision of food (aquaculture) and recreation\n(Marcé et al., 2016). A few\
    \ examples from Italy include\nthe HFM network deployed in 18 Sardinian reservoirs\n\
    used to identify the optimal depth for water withdrawal\nand to early detect the\
    \ development of algal blooms\n(Marcé et al., 2016); a monitoring system which\
    \ has been\ndeveloped in Lake Iseo, measuring the main thermal, ra-\ndiative,\
    \ and mechanical ﬂuxes on the lake surface (Pilotti\net al., 2013); and a high-frequency\
    \ monitoring of meteor-\nological parameters and water temperature at different\
    \ lo-\ncations in Lake Como as input to a three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic model\
    \ (Laborde et al., 2010).\nThe implementation of a HFM system is also pro-\njected\
    \ for the lakes of the so-called Insubric region (lakes\nMaggiore, Como, and Lugano)\
    \ and will be developed\nwithin the cross-border cooperation project SIMILE (Ital-\n\
    ian acronym for “Integrated monitoring system for knowl-\nedge, protection and\
    \ valorisation of the subalpine lakes\nand their ecosystems”). While the general\
    \ aim of SIMILE\nis to improve and optimize lake monitoring integrating\nconventional\
    \ monitoring, satellite data, in situ HFM data,\nand user-contributed georeferenced\
    \ data (Brovelli et al.,\n2020), specific aim of the HFM system is to make avail-\n\
    able high frequency data of basic limnological and mete-\norological parameters\
    \ in order to provide information on\nlake processes occurring over a short time\
    \ scale, such as\nalgal blooms, or weather-related episodic events. \nThe HFM\
    \ station LM1 was the first station developed\nwithin SIMILE (Fig. 1). In this\
    \ project framework, LM1\nrepresents a pilot experience, aimed at providing the\
    \ prac-\ntical know-how needed for the creation of the larger HFM\nsystem projected\
    \ in SIMILE. To enable the replicability\nand transferability of this first experience,\
    \ LM1 was con-\nceived as a low-cost modular system. Indeed, although\nfull-equipped\
    \ systems for HFM of water bodies are com-\nmercially available, their long-term\
    \ maintenance may be\ndifficult because the understanding of the hardware and\n\
    software components is often not an easy process. There-\nfore, an increasing\
    \ number of research groups are devel-\noping their own modular system independently\n\
    (Albaladejo et al., 2012; Tran Khac et al., 2018; Vitale et\nal., 2018): in-house\
    \ development provides the flexibility\nneeded to recover the system when malfunctioning\
    \ or\ndamages occur (Vitale et al., 2018) and to tweak its con-\nfiguration to\
    \ monitoring needs.\nIn this paper, we describe LM1 (software and hard-\nware\
    \ components, i.e., sensors, electronic devices, power\nsupply and transmission\
    \ systems), providing an example\nof a cost-effective and modular limnological\
    \ buoy for\nHFM. In addition, we used the first nine months of HFM\ndata to provide\

    \ LONG-TERM DYNAMICS\nLake Maggiore is a large (surface area 213 km2; vol-\nume\
    \ 38.1 km3) and deep (370 m) subalpine lake located\nbetween Northern Italy and\
    \ Southern Switzerland (Fig.\n1). Its watershed (6,600 km2) is shared almost equally\
    \ be-\ntween the two countries while most of lake surface\n(~80%) lies in Italy.\
    \ Lake Maggiore has 33 inflows - main\ninflows are the Ticino and Toce Rivers\
    \ - and one outflow\n(Ticino River). Its theoretical water renewal time is 4.20\n\
    years. Lake level is controlled by the Miorina Dam to or-\ndinarily allow for\
    \ a 0.5 m difference between summer and\nwinter periods (Fenocchi et al., 2017).\n\
    Lake Maggiore has been regularly monitored on a\nmonthly base since 1978 with\
    \ the support of the Interna-\ntional Commission for the Protection of Swiss-Italian\
    \ Wa-\nters (CIPAIS; CNR-IRSA, 2019). Samples and measures\nwere taken at the\
    \ deepest point of the lake (Ghiffa station;\n45°58’30” N; 8°39’09” E). Since\
    \ 2019, a second moni-\ntoring site in Pallanza (100 m depth) has been included\
    \ in\nthe monitoring programme (Fig. 1). Monitoring at both\nstations include\
    \ 1) sampling for chemical and biological\nanalyses, and 2) a vertical profile\
    \ of temperature through\na multiparameter probe (Idronaut CTD304). Sampling for\n\
    chemical analyses involves the collection of 12 water\nsamples along the water\
    \ column at the Ghiffa station and\n3 samples at the Pallanza station. Samples\

    Because of its long monitoring history, Lake Maggiore\nwas included in the Long-Term\
    \ Ecological Research Net-\nwork - LTER site “Southern Alpine Lakes” (LTER\n_EU_IT_008),\
    \ also comprising lakes Orta, Como, Iseo,\nand Garda. These lakes are located\
    \ south of the Alps, in\none of the most densely populated and urbanized areas\
    \ of\nEurope. They represent a strategic water supply for agri-\nculture, industry,\
    \ fishing, and civil use and are an impor-\ntant resource for recreation and tourism\
    \ (Salmaso and\nMosello, 2010). Long-term trends in trophic state and\nother chemical\
    \ and biological variables of the deep sub-\nalpine lakes have been assessed in\
    \ a series of synoptic\nstudies (Salmaso and Mosello, 2010; Rogora et al., 2018;\n\
    Salmaso et al., 2020).\nAccording to long-term monitoring data, the most rel-\n\
    evant changes in Lake Maggiore include oligotrophication\nand increased thermal\
    \ stability. Lake Maggiore has un-\ndergone oligotrophication since the 1980s\
    \ due to reduced\nexternal nutrient loads. The lake is presently oligo-\nmesotrophic,\
    \ with annual average total phosphorus con-\ncentration of 12-13 µg P L–1 (Rogora\
    \ et al., 2018). Trends\nof phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll concentrations\n\
    confirmed the oligotrophication of the lake (Morabito et\nal., 2012). After the\
    \ last episode of complete mixing in\n2005-2006 due to exceptionally cold and\
    \ windy winter\nconditions (Ambrosetti and Barbanti, 1999), a tendency\ntowards\
    \ increasing stability of the water column and de-\ncreasing mixing depth has\
    \ been reported as an effect of\nclimate warming (Rogora et al., 2018). The effects\
    \ of cli-\nmate change on Lake Maggiore have been extensively de-\nscribed and\
    \ involve both the hydrodynamic and thermal\nfeatures of the lake (Fenocchi et\
    \ al., 2018) as well as its\ntrophic and oxygen status (Rogora et al., 2018) and\
    \ vari-\nous biological compartments (Morabito et al., 2012, 2018;\nNõges et al.,\
    \ 2017; Tanentzap et al., 2020). As regards\nphytoplankton, while nutrient inputs\
    \ were the main driv-\ners of its dynamics until the early 1990s, climatic factors\n\
    started to play an important role during the oligotrophi-\ncation phase (Morabito\
    \ et al., 2012).\nUntil present, monitoring of Lake Maggiore has been\nbased on\
    \ the conventional sampling methods described\nabove (CNR-IRSA 2019; Rogora et\
    \ al., 2018) and HFM\nhas been limited to meteorological and hydrological vari-\n\
    ables. However, recent evidence of the relevance of rapid\necological changes\
    \ and extreme meteorological events\nprompted the idea that more frequent limnological\
    \ data are\nneeded to describe and timely predict fast-paced processes\n(Morabito\
    \ et al., 2018), such as algal blooms in spring and\nsummer (Callieri et al.,\
    \ 2014; Tapolczai et al., 2015).\nTHE HFM SYSTEM\nHardware: the buoy, power supply,\

    drift and fouling), and how to manage them. Furtherly,\ndata gathered during the\
    \ test period were used to test\nQuality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures\n\
    to be successively adopted in the whole HFM system. In\nparticular, data quality\
    \ issues will be implemented in Ist-\nSOS, the open-source data management software\
    \ selected\nfor the HFM system (Fig. 2). IstSOS was selected due to\nits specific\
    \ features specialized in hydro-climate data\nmanagement (Pozzoni et al., 2020;\
    \ Strigaro et al., 2019).\nIstSOS is a python implementation of the Sensor Obser-\n\
    vation Service standard (SOS) from the Open Geospatial\nConsortium (OGC), which\
    \ defines a web service interface\nto register and retrieve metadata and observations\
    \ of sen-\nsors using a standard protocols and formats, in order to\nincrease\
    \ the data consistency and interoperability. Among\nthe numerous features of IstSOS\
    \ (Cannata et al., 2015),\nnative support of data quality management is one of\
    \ the\nmost important for this application since it allows to de-\nvelop data\

    \ consequentially\nbased on an increasing level of quality evaluation. The\nIstSOS’s\
    \ web interface allows to register new QC tests,\nsuch as those proposed in this\
    \ work. Thanks to the light-\nweight of IstSOS and to the availability of a CPU\
    \ support\nand a Linux system, it will be possible to install IstSOS\ndirectly\
    \ on the monitoring buoys/platforms. It will act as\na local data storage system\
    \ dedicated to collect and serve\nraw data using standards and perform preliminary\
    \ quality\nchecks directly at the node before data are transmitted to\nthe data\
    \ warehouse. To this end, a standard communica-\ntion between two IstSOS instances\
    \ is enabled. The de-\nscribed two tiers’ data storage approach is depicted in\
    \ Fig.\n3. The general data flow is divided into a tier at sensor\nside (buoy)\
    \ and a tier at server side (data centre). At the\nbuoy, data are collected from\
    \ sensors and then checked\nfor range and step tests. After that, raw observations\
    \ and\nrelated QC codes are inserted into the IstSOS instance in-\nstalled at\
    \ the buoy. At a specific configurable time interval\n(suggested between 10 and\
    \ 30 mins), an algorithm re-\ntrieves raw data from IstSOS, performs quality checks,\n\
    aggregates and store resulting values with related quality\ncode back to IstSOS.\
    \ At user-defined interval data are then\ntransmitted from the buoy to the data\
    \ centre using selected\nprotocol (WiFi, LoRa, NBIoT, 4G) and SOS standard re-\n\
    quests to directly ingest them into the second tier IstSOS\ninstance. Instantly,\
    \ ingested observations are accessible\nfor intensive processing such as for example\
    \ the creation\nof reports, additional data validation tests, the calculation\n\
    of indicators, scientific analysis, alert notifications, fore-\ncast analysis\
    \ and client interfaces creation. This approach\npermits to locally store high\
    \ frequency data and commu-\nnicate aggregated data at an adequate frequency for\
    \ the\npurpose of the monitoring. However, high-frequency data\nare also transmitted\
    \ at fixed intervals (daily in the case of\nLM1 buoy) for raw data backup on a\
    \ local server. This so-\nlution reduces battery consumption, bandwidth usage\
    \ and\ntransmission costs.\nQUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY\nCONTROL PROCEDURES\
    \ FOR SENSOR DATA\nBackground and definitions\nAlthough HFM by sensor networks\
    \ can provide many\nbenefits, sensors are susceptible to some inevitable levels\n\
    of failure, which can result in lost or poor-quality data\n(Campbell et al., 2013).\
    \ It may be therefore inappropriate\nto make HFM data available to the public/users\

    \ to minimize errors in data\nstreaming from the HFM system and to document the\n\
    overall quality of the data. QA and QC are closely related,\nbut they have distinct\
    \ meanings: in our specific context:\nwe define 1) QA as the procedures taken\
    \ to ensure that\nthe HFM system and its maintenance protocols are devel-\noped\
    \ in a way to minimize data loss, sensor errors and the\nneed of subsequent corrective\
    \ measures on data, and 2)\nQC as the procedures to test whether streaming data\

    A high frequency monitoring system for Lake Maggiore\nof semi-automated QC tests\
    \ (see paragraph “QC proce-\ndures”) and an expert-based inspection. QC procedures\n\
    are necessary to make sure that field data measurements\nare right on (i.e., accurate),\
    \ reproducible (precise; consis-\ntent), and have a good estimate of their uncertainty.\
    \ As-\nsociate to proper QA protocols, QC is essential to produce\nreliable data.\
    \ \nErrors in high frequency long-term datasets primarily\noccur from sensor biofouling\
    \ and calibration shift; but er-\nrors may also occur for many other reasons (Wagner\
    \ et\nal., 2006). In Fig. 4 we provide some examples from LM1\nof the most common\
    \ types of error in hydrological and\nwater quality sensor data:\n•\nSkipped or\
    \ no-data values when there are gaps in the\ndata (Fig. 4a). \n•\nSensor drift,\
    \ occurring because electronic drift in sen-\nsors reading away from the instrument’s\
    \ calibration dur-\ning the period between calibrations (Fig. 4b). This may\n\
    also occur due to the aging of parts of the sensor, e.g.,\nmembrane aging or dye\
    \ degradation in oxygen sensors.\n•\nOut of range values, when data values are\
    \ beyond the\nrange of plausible values for the specific phenomenon\nbeing measured\
    \ (Fig. 4c). \n•\nSensor fouling due to biological growth (biofouling;\nFig. 4d)\
    \ or other residue build-up on the sensor be-\ntween maintenance visits (i.e.,\
    \ sensor cleaning), which\ncan produce erroneous values and data truncation, i.e.,\n\
    when data values are recorded at the reporting limit\nfor a sensor because its\
    \ maximum or minimum record-\ning level has been exceeded. \n•\nFailed sensor,\
    \ that is an error occurring when sensor\nfails (e.g., Chl-a sensor fails, and\
    \ the system records a\nvalue equal to 0; Fig. 4e). \n•\nIncorrect offset or calibration,\
    \ when data values are in\nerror by a constant value. \n•\nData value persistence,\

    \ ice build-\nup around a sensor).\nSince error accumulation can rapidly disrupt\
    \ data se-\nries, producing reliable HFM data requires that such errors\nare:\
    \ i) avoided, through appropriate QA procedures; ii)\nidentified, by correct QC\
    \ procedures; and iii) eventually\ncorrected through interactive editing to mitigate\
    \ for error\noccurrence (Mourad and Bertrand-Krajewski, 2002). In\nparticular,\
    \ QA and QC procedures are strictly intercon-\nnected, because the identification\
    \ of errors and function-\ning anomalies by QC procedures provide up to date\n\
    information to ensure the proper maintenance and func-\ntioning of the system.\
    \ Our QA/QC procedures include all\nthe calibration, performance verification,\
    \ and mainte-\nnance of LM1.\nQA procedures\nSensor calibration in laboratory\
    \ \nBefore installation, all the sensors underwent a labo-\nratory calibration.\
    \ Calibration of pH, conductivity and\noxygen sensors were done according to the\
    \ provision of\nthe manufacturers, using pH buffers and standard solu-\ntions.\
    \ The calibration of the chlorophyll sensors was per-\nformed using dilution series\
    \ of single-species cultures of\nChlorella sp. (Chlorophyta). We utilized two\
    \ different\nchlorophyll sensors, by the same manufacturer (Turner\nDesign), to\
    \ assess whether their performance was similar\nand hold common calibration coefficients.\
    \ The phyto-\nplankton culture was added to filtered lake water (What-\nman glass\
    \ fibre filters, GF/C with a nominal porosity of\nca. 1 µm) using 12 litres black\
    \ buckets, with non-reflec-\ntive linear surface. Five algal dilutions were used,\
    \ cover-\ning a Chl-a range of about 0-30 µg L–1. During\nmeasurements, Chl-a\
    \ sensors were held 1 cm beneath the\nsurface of the sample and an automatic mixer\
    \ used. Read-\nings were taken once the instruments had stabilized (after\nca.\
    \ 10 s). The sensors were rinsed and dried thoroughly\nbetween control (MilliQ\
    \ water and filtered lake water) and\ntest samples measurements. Sensor fluorescence\
    \ (F; in\nVolt) were plotted against Chl-a concentrations ([Chl-a];\nin µg L–1)\
    \ obtained by spectrophotometric reading after\nacetone extraction (APAT IRSA-CNR,\
    \ 2003). The sensors\nyielded a linear response up to the highest chlorophyll\n\
    concentration tested. However, performance of the two\nchlorophyll sensors differed\
    \ slightly, resulting in different\nregression equations: [Chl-a 1] = 7.01 F -\
    \ 0.3053, R2 =\n0.998; [Chl-a 2] = 11.421 F - 0.2078, R2 = 0.999. It is thus\n\
    evident that, when dealing with field fluorescent sensors,\neach chlorophyll sensor\
    \ needs to be calibrated individu-\nally. These regression equations were provisionally\
    \ set to\nconvert sensor readings into Chl-a concentrations, subject\nto confirmation\
    \ by field validation. \nIs LM1 working? Remote control\nAn operator oversees\
    \ controlling that LM1 is working\nand sending data properly on a daily basis.\
    \ This procedure\ngreatly limits the possibility of losing data but does not\n\
    allow it to detect malfunctioning in real time. To over-\ncome this problem, we\
    \ created an automated procedure\nto query LM1 every 10 minutes and to send an\
    \ email\nalarm message in case HFM data is not received by the\nserver associated\
    \ with LM1. Such alarm indicates that\nwireless transmission failed and does not\
    \ necessarily\nimply the loss of sensor data. If the problem is limited to\nthe\
    \ transmission system, data can be recovered from a\nlocal memory placed on LM1\
    \ exactly to fix this eventual\nproblem. However, if transmission fails because\
    \ power\nsupply problems or local memory saturation, data cannot\nbe recorded,\
    \ and a timely intervention may save a lot of\ndata. This system allows us to\
    \ intervene promptly, mini-\nmize the loss of data, and detect functioning problems.\n\
    Is LM1 working well? Field controls\nand periodic reporting\nThe correct functioning\
    \ of LM1 was assessed by pe-\nriodic field validations, to test the consistency\
    \ between\nsensor data and data from standard monitoring methods.\nTab. 2 provides\
    \ the activity-log of the field surveys to the\nLM1 buoy. Data from field and\
    \ laboratory measurements\nwere compared with sensor data in order to i) check\
    \ their\naccuracy; ii) recalibrate sensors, when necessary; iii) cor-\nrect sensor\
    \ data when possible.\nField surveys were planned approximately on a bi-\nmonthly\
    \ basis, unless urgent maintenance was required\n(e.g., based on remote controls).\
    \ However, to preserve one\nof the main advantages of HFM (i.e., keeping monitoring\n\
    costs low), we tried to reduce the number of field surveys\nwhen possible, e.g.,\
    \ in periods of low lake productivity\n(winter), when biofouling was likely to\
    \ be less severe and\nfrequent sensor cleaning unnecessary. \nTo check sensor\
    \ data accuracy and get information for\nsubsequent field surveys planning, HFM\
    \ data underwent\nperiodic reporting. A mechanism for periodic reporting is\n\
    an essential part of QA procedures (von Lehmde and Nel-\nson, 1977). A weekly\
    \ report was produced to provide an\neasy visualization of the comparison between\
    \ sensor data\nand conventional monitoring data. Each weekly report is\na description\
    \ of the dynamics of the HFM sensor data col-\nlected over the previous two weeks\
    \ (reporting period).\nThe core part of the reports is a comparison between sen-\n\
    sor data and QA data collected by conventional monitor-\ning methods (infrequent\

    ing to Wagner et al. (2006), field calibration is done by\nusing calibration standards\
    \ (i.e., solutions of known qual-\nity) during field visits. This procedure ensures\
    \ that sensor\nreadings are correct and provides necessary data for re-\ncalibration.\
    \ We periodically performed such calibration\nchecks to recalibrate the pH and\
    \ conductivity sensors\n(Tab. 1). For all the sensors, instead -or in addition\
    \ to- cal-\nibration standards, we used field data obtained from in\nsitu and\

    R. Tiberti et al.\nField measurements and laboratory analyses from\nstandard methods\
    \ were used to check sensor accuracy\nand, if needed, for sensor recalibration\
    \ in the field. Water\ntemperature was measured in situ by taking a vertical tem-\n\
    perature profile with a multiparameter probe (In-Situ\nSmarTroll MP). A 0.5 L\
    \ water sample was taken with a\nRuttner bottle at the sensor depth (2.5 m) for\
    \ laboratory\ndetermination of pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen\n(Winkler’s\
    \ method). Additional 2.0 L water samples were\ntaken at the sensor depths (2.5\
    \ or 8 m; Fig. 1) for chloro-\nphyll-a determination using two methods:\n•\nfluorometric\
    \ determination by FluoroProbe (BBE\nMoldaenke, GmbH, Germany). Measures were\
    \ done\nwith a Workstation benchtop unit, using a 25 ml cu-\nvette of lake water\
    \ samples;\n•\nacetone extraction followed by spectrophotometric\nreading (method\
    \ APAT IRSA 9020; APAT IRSA-CNR\n2003). \nThe accuracy of the temperature, pH,\
    \ conductivity,\nand dissolved oxygen sensors was assessed comparing re-\nsults\
    \ from in situ and laboratory QA measures with sensor\ndata, i.e., average of\
    \ the last 30 measures after QA meas-\nure/sampling. For these sensors, we followed\
    \ the calibra-\ntion criteria of Wagner et al. (2006) to decide when sensor\n\
    recalibration was necessary. In such cases, calibration QA\nmeasures were used\
    \ as a reference to recalibrate the sen-\nsors. However, we usually observed a\
    \ good fit between\nsensor and QA measures and limited calibration problems\n\
    and periodic recalibrations using calibration standards\nwere sufficient to maintain\
    \ sensor data within the accept-\nable accuracy limits (e.g., ±0.3 mg L–1 for\
    \ oxygen con-\ncentration); a clear sensor drift was however observed for\nthe\
    \ pH sensor (Fig. 4b), needing sensor recalibration and\ndrift correction after\
    \ about six months of sensor operation.\nA possible problem related to the optical\
    \ oxygen sensor\nis dye degradation; however, during the nine -months op-\neration\
    \ period, we did not observe any deviation in the\noxygen sensor readings. \n\
    Because Chl-a sensors were calibrated and tested in\nlaboratory conditions, their\
    \ performance may differ in the\nfield with lake phytoplankton communities. In\
    \ addition,\nthere are two very common factors which may affect the\nlinear relationship\
    \ between fluorescence and Chl-a con-\ncentrations, producing significant deviations\
    \ between\nfield and laboratory measures: \n•\nthe so-called fluorescence quenching\
    \ (i.e., the depres-\nsion of the fluorescence signal in surface waters dur-\n\
    ing daylight and especially at noon), which is a\nubiquitous phenomenon in lakes\
    \ and oceans (Marra,\n1997); \n•\nphytoplankton community composition (Richardson\n\
    et al., 2010).\nBoth factors should be taken into account to recali-\nbrate the\
    \ sensor for field measurements, i.e., find an ac-\ncurate conversion factor for\
    \ raw sensor data (from Volts\nto Chl-a concentrations).\nConcerning quenching,\
    \ this mechanism produces a\ndaily cycle in fluorescence data which is regarded\
    \ as a\nconsequence of solar light photoinhibition on algal pho-\ntosynthetic\
    \ activity (McBride and Rose, 2018). As com-\nmonly reported in other HFM studies,\
    \ we have observed\nin our data the depressing effects of quenching on the flu-\n\
    orescence of Chl-a during midday hours. This pattern was\nmuch attenuated at a\
    \ greater depth (8 m; Fig. 5). In Fig.\n5, it can be observed that around the\
    \ time of sunrise (at\nhour 6:00) chlorophyll-a values from night values of\n\
    about 1.0-1.5 Volt sharply declined to daylight values of\n0.3-0.4 Volt, remaining\
    \ at low levels until crepuscular\ntime (sunset at hour 20:15), when values gradually\
    \ in-\ncreased again. \nNeglecting quenching may have disruptive conse-\nquences\
    \ on the interpretation of chlorophyll-a data series;\nwe therefore considered\
    \ the night surface measurements\nas the most indicative of chlorophyll-a concentration,\
    \ as\nsuggested in McBride and Rose (2018). To illustrate this\nissue, we used\
    \ the Chl-a data (in Volt) from the surface\nsensor (2.5 m) and we calculated\
    \ the average Chl-a con-\ncentrations in the 24 hours, or in the night immediately\n\
    following water sampling (using data from one hour\naround midnight); we used\
    \ only values recorded after\nsampling because of possible biofouling events (Fig.\
    \ 4d).\nWhether the field calibration was performed using the\ndaily or night\
    \ averages, this significantly changed the cal-\nibration parameters of the relationship\
    \ between fluores-\ncence (F; in Volt) and laboratory concentration ([Chl-a];\n\
    in µg L–1), i.e., [Chl-a] = 11.52 F + 0.42, R2 = 0.79 for the\ndaily averages;\
    \ [Chl-a] = 9.02 F + 0.22, R2 = 0.83 for the\nnight-time averages. The former\
    \ equation does not ac-\ncount for quenching, having a higher slope and worse\
    \ fit\nof the latter. Interestingly, accounting for quenching also\nprovided a\
    \ better concordance between the parameters of\nthe field calibration and the\
    \ laboratory calibration, run\nunder controlled experimental conditions i.e.,\
    \ [Chl-a] =\n7.01 F - 0.31, R2 = 0.998 (see paragraph “Sensor calibra-\ntion in\
    \ laboratory”). \nConcerning phytoplankton community composition,\nsensor measures\
    \ of chlorophyll-a by fluorometric determi-\nnation may produce an underestimation\
    \ of chlorophyll-a\nconcentrations when cyanobacteria are abundant (Bowling\n\
    et al., 2016), because chlorophyll-a fluorescence induction\nworks differently\
    \ for cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae\n(Stirbet et al., 2019). We found a good\
    \ agreement between\nsensor data and chlorophyll-a concentrations measured by\n\
    laboratory extractions, likely because cyanobacteria have\nusually a low biomass\
    \ in Lake Maggiore (Fastner et al.,\n2016), as confirmed by Fluoroprobe data (Fig.\
    \ 6). Patterns\nobserved in the phytoplankton community over the study\nperiod\
    \ (December 2019 and September 2020; Fig. 6) have\nNon-commercial use only\ntime\

    \ a dynamic typically observed in Lake Maggiore,\nwith a dominance of Bacillariophyta\
    \ during spring and\nearly summer, and a more diverse community during sum-\n\
    mer including Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria (Morabito\net al., 2012). In August\
    \ 2020 a deviation between sensor\nand laboratory chlorophyll data was observed\
    \ and associ-\nated to an increase of phycoerythrin containing Cyanobac-\nteria,\
    \ detected and measured by the Fluoroprobe. The\nincrease of phycoerythrin might\
    \ be due to picocyanobac-\nteria (i.e., Synechococcus), since they usually became\n\
    abundant in late summer in Lake Maggiore (Callieri and\nPiscia, 2002). This condition\
    \ may suggest that sensor field\ncalibration and chlorophyll data interpretation\
    \ in Lake\nMaggiore require careful consideration because of its phy-\ntoplankton\
    \ community composition during summer peri-\nods. Performing frequent field sampling\
    \ and analysis of\nthe phytoplankton community composition could improve\nthe\
    \ comparison with sensor chlorophyll data, at least dur-\ning the first phase\
    \ of the HFM system running. Further,\nthe adoption of field sensors for the detection\
    \ of phyco-\ncyanin and phycoerythrin, as foreseen for the LM1 buoy,\nmay be crucial\
    \ to disentangle the contribute of different\nalgal groups on the overall signal\
    \ of the chlorophyll regis-\ntered by the field sensor. \nSensor cleaning\nSensor\
    \ fouling, in particular biofouling, is a major\nsource of errors in limnological\
    \ HFM systems. Fouling\noccurs because particulate matter, sediments, bacteria,\
    \ mi-\ncroalgae or larger organisms adhere to the surface of the\nsensors, of\
    \ their supports and cables, with possible inter-\nferences with data quality.\
    \ At some places and occasions,\nsensors may face actual short-term biofouling\
    \ effects, dis-\nrupting the quality of the measurements, sometimes in\nless than\
    \ a week. Unless autonomous and effective anti-\nfouling techniques are adopted,\
    \ a regular manual cleaning\nof the sensors is needed to assure the quality of\
    \ the data.\nHowever, this is likely to become the most laborious task\nrelated\
    \ to system maintenance (Laas et al., 2016). \nFor LM1, biofouling was a major\
    \ issue for the sensor\nfor chlorophyll-a, requiring frequent field visits to\
    \ the buoy\nfor sensor cleaning (Tab. 2). Even if fouling was observed\nonly for\
    \ the chlorophyll sensor, all sensors were cleaned\nwith the same frequency required\
    \ by the chlorophyll-a sen-\nsor, which was probably sufficient to avoid any fouling\n\
    problems for the other sensors. The minimum time elapsed\nbetween the last chlorophyll-a\
    \ sensor cleaning and the re-\ncurrence of the problem was less than two weeks,\
    \ but\nlonger recurrence times were usually observed. Evidence\nof fouling arises\
    \ from the observation of the data series,\nwhich show an abrupt decrease, just\
    \ after sensor cleaning\n(Fig. 4d). Until now, biofouling was addressed through\n\
    regular manual cleaning of the sensor surface and support\nand by data correction.\
    \ However, finding autonomous and\neffective anti-fouling systems is probably\
    \ a priority to re-\nduce the maintenance efforts and preserve one of the most\n\
    attractive advantages of automated monitoring systems,\ni.e., saving time and\
    \ personnel costs. \nSome techniques and technologies are available to re-\nduce\
    \ sensor fouling (Pires, 2010); they include using au-\ntomated mechanical cleaning\
    \ systems, antifouling paints\n(with active biocides such as copper), and active\
    \ systems\nbased on electro-mechanical vibration removing fouling\nmaterial from\
    \ the surface. However, antifouling paints are\nnot adapted to protect sensors’\
    \ sensitive parts (the inter-\nface between the measurement medium and the sensor\n\
    sensitive area), which should remain as much as possible\nunmodified, and the\
    \ power requirement of electro-me-\nchanical methods may be too high for HFM systems.\
    \ Up\nto now, standard methods to avoid and manage sensor\nfouling are not available.\
    \ It is likely that biofouling may\nbecome an even more pressing problem for meso-eu-\n\
    trophic lakes, such as lakes Como, Varese and Lugano.\nAn important step for the\
    \ creation of an efficient HFM\nsystem for the subalpine lakes is the creation\
    \ of standard\nantifouling protocols, which should be considered a pri-\nority\
    \ for our project. \nQC procedures\nSemi-automated QC controls\nAutomated QC controls\
    \ do not replace manual data\ninspection by experts which is ultimately needed\
    \ to take\nthe final decision on deletion or correction of erroneous\nor low-quality\
    \ data. However, automated QC represents\na necessary improvement. It ensures\
    \ consistency, re-\nduces human bias, and enables to cope with the huge\nflow\
    \ of data from HFM systems, which is incompatible\nwith manual QC methods historically\
    \ used by ecologists\n(Campbell et al., 2013). Automated QC control classifies\n\
    data according to mathematical or logical criteria. When\nthey do not meet such\
    \ criteria, data are not removed, but\nlabelled (or flagged) as suspicious, preserving\
    \ raw data\nunmanipulated (i.e., pre-processed data). The final deci-\nsion on\
    \ retaining, correcting, or deleting flagged data is\ntaken at the final data\
    \ editing. For example, extreme\nevents may produce extreme but accurate values\
    \ which\nmay be flagged for falling outside a certain range crite-\nrion (Fig.\
    \ 4c). \nMost automated quality control procedures are fo-\ncused on flagging\
    \ raw data values that do not meet one of\nseveral plausibility tests (Sheldon,\
    \ 2008; Lerner et al.,\n2011; Taylor and Loescher, 2013). Flagging erroneous or\n\
    suspicious values can require simple algorithms (e.g., sim-\nple range checks)\
    \ or more complicated techniques\n(Moatar et al., 2001; Hill et al., 2009; Fiebrich\

    \ (R\nDevelopment Core Team, 2019). This package was devel-\noped by the United\
    \ States Geological Survey and specif-\nically designed for automated QC controls\
    \ for sensor data\n(Gries et al., 2014). Our semi-automated QC procedures\nprovide\
    \ for four plausibility tests. A flag is generated and\nassociated to the data\
    \ which do not meet the criteria (Tab.\n3) of the following tests:\n•\nglobal\
    \ range test: data are flagged unless they fall\nwithin valid regional lake ranges\
    \ or instrumental limits\n(whichever is more restrictive) (i.e., >MAXglobal and\n\
    <MINglobal, respectively representing the maximum\nand minimum plausible values\
    \ at a global level); we\nset MAXglobal and MINglobal based on instrumental\n\
    limits and literature data;\n•\nlocal range test: data are flagged unless they\
    \ fall within\nlocally valid site-specific ranges (i.e., >MAXlocal and\n<MINlocal,\
    \ respectively representing the maximum\nand minimum plausible values at a site-specific\
    \ level);\nwe set MAXlocal and MINlocal respectively equal to\nthe upper and lower\
    \ 95% Confidence Intervals of the\nsurface values recorded during the long-term\
    \ monitor-\ning campaign of Lake Maggiore at the Ghiffa sam-\npling station; \n\
    •\nstuck value test (or value persistence test): data are\nflagged if neighbouring\
    \ values differ by less than the\nresolution of the sensor for more than Nrep\
    \ repetitions,\nwhere Nrep is an arbitrary number of repeated data\nthat is considered\
    \ indicative of sensor stuck;\n•\nspike test or absolute deviation around median\
    \ test:\ndata are flagged when their absolute deviation around\nthe median value\
    \ calculated over the last w previous\nvalues is larger than 3 times their median\
    \ (i.e., median\nabsolute deviation - MAD> 3). \nVisual inspection of data and\
    \ manual QC editing\nMany sensor errors, such as sensor drift and fouling\nmay\
    \ swell the automated procedures but become evident\nwhen sensors undergo periodic\
    \ maintenance operations\n(i.e., cleaning) or sensor accuracy is tested, i.e.,\
    \ using cal-\nibration standards or field measures (see paragraph “Qual-\nity\
    \ assurance”). Automated QC can identify and flag po-\ntentially erroneous values.\
    \ However, there is also a need\nof choose and apply the appropriate data corrections\n\
    (Horsburgh et al., 2015). As stated above, to this aim, the\nattention and expertise\
    \ of field or data technicians are re-\nquired (Fiebrich et al., 2010). At this\
    \ stage, flags can be\nconveniently used to sort the data according to the criteria\n\
    for automated QC, which enables saving considerable\ntime. During the final editing,\
    \ data undergo visual inspec-\ntion. A readable graphic representation of HFM\
    \ data as-\nsociated to QA monitoring data (e.g., sensor cleaning\nevents, laboratory\
    \ measurements, etc.; Fig. 4) is therefore\nnecessary. \nIn Tab. 4 we provide\
    \ the logical scheme (i.e., articu-\nlated in a series of dichotomous questions)\
    \ that we used\nfor the final editing. It should be noted that at first data is\n\
    evaluated based on the results of automated QC controls\n(flagged data), but then\
    \ also non-flagged data are in-\nspected. Final editing provides for one of three\
    \ possible\nactions: retain data (for data that are considered accurate\nenough),\
    \ discard data (when data quality is considered too\nlow and correction methods\
    \ inapplicable), or correct (i.e.,\nsubtract/add a quantity to the raw sensor\
    \ value). The final\ndecision is often based on data accuracy as compared to\n\
    QA measurements, so that QA measurements should be\nfrequent enough to enable\
    \ such comparisons and provide\nguarantees about the quality of HFM data. Sensor\
    \ data are\nretained without any manipulations when they match the\ncalibration\
    \ standards or QA measures used to evaluate the\nsensor accuracy. A certain deviation\
    \ between sensor data\nand QA measures is however expected, but data can be\n\
    retained without corrections if they meet fixed quality\nstandard (Tab.4). \n\
    More sophisticated methods are needed to correct for\ni) calibration offset, ii)\
    \ sensor drift, and iii) sensor fouling\n(Wagner et al., 2006). Hereafter we describe\
    \ some meth-\nods to correct data. Being aware that these methods are\nnot representative\
    \ of the entire range of possible correc-\ntion methods. However, a full description\
    \ of these meth-\nods is out of the scopes of the present study. We just\nprovide\
    \ some examples of data correction from our study\nthat can be applied in similar\

    \ 2d).\nThe removal of fouling by sensor cleaning (fouling end\npoint) results\
    \ in a shift of chlorophyll-a values, which pro-\nvides a measure of maximum fouling,\
    \ i.e., estimated as\nthe difference between the chlorophyll-a average values\n\
    12 hours before (ca. 720 points) and 12 hours (ca. 720\npoints) after cleaning.\
    \ The onset of fouling was estimated\nvisually (i.e., the time Chl-a data appeared\
    \ to begin drift-\ning upward). We assumed fouling to be linear, so the cor-\n\
    rection for fouling (the quantity to be subtracted from the\nraw Chl-a data) is\
    \ the linear interpolation between 0 at the\nestimated onset of fouling and the\
    \ maximum fouling at\nthe point of sensor cleaning (Fig. 7b).\nReleasing raw or\

    \ source of errors and\ntheir effects on the flow of data should be clearly de-\n\
    scribed. \nTOWARDS A HFM NETWORK FOR LAKES\nIN THE INSUBRIC REGION \nNewly available\
    \ sensor technologies give the oppor-\ntunity of monitoring lakes at unprecedented\
    \ frequencies.\nHowever, HFM systems entails some difficulties related\nto the\
    \ complex technology of sensors and to the manage-\nment of a huge amount of data.\
    \ Depending on the local\ncontext (i.e., expertise availability), creating a functional\n\
    HFM network may present several difficulties, essentially\nrelated to the gap\
    \ in the technical know-how. LM1 should\nbe considered as a pilot experience to\
    \ start filling this\nknowledge gap. The first nine months of LM1 functioning\n\
    enabled us to test the advantages and shortcomings of\nHFM and will provide the\
    \ needed background to imple-\nment the rest of the HFM network in the Insubric\
    \ lakes\nMaggiore, Como and Lugano, none of which was previ-\nously subject to\
    \ in situ real-time monitoring. \nBased on this pilot experience, we highlight\
    \ four\nmajor issues for the development of an efficient HFM sys-\ntem at a regional\
    \ level:\nSensor data accuracy: positioning sensors and data ac-\nquisition must\
    \ be accompanied by shared QA/QC proce-\ndures, to produce accurate data and provide\
    \ reliable and\nconsistent information on lake water quality. \nValue for money:\
    \ frequent field surveys required for\nsensor maintenance (e.g., cleaning) may\
    \ undermine the\ncost-effectiveness of HFM (Garel et al., 2009; Le Vu et\nal.,\
    \ 2011). Reducing survey frequency is a major issue for\nthe implementation of\
    \ a long-term HFM of Insubric lakes,\nfor example, developing shared methods to\
    \ reduce foul-\ning.\nLong-term sustainability: LM1 hardware and software\nunderwent\
    \ several changes (e.g., changing/adding elec-\ntronic components, sensors, and\
    \ data transmission proto-\ncols) which have been possible because LM1 was\ndeveloped\
    \ in-house, having full access to all the hardware\nand software components. This\
    \ also increased replicabil-\nity and transferability of our experience within\
    \ and out-\nside the SIMILE project. \nData access: making raw, real time HFM\
    \ data avail-\nable to the public/users before validation may be inappro-\npriate,\
    \ even when users are provided with an alerting\nabout possible error sources.\
    \ Sound quality check and val-\nidation protocols are essential to provide useful\
    \ data to\nthe users. Within SIMILE the following strategy will be\nadopted, in\
    \ order to manage that data flow: data are auto-\nmatically checked in real-time\
    \ for soundness and gross-\nerror detection and are stored in the local istSOS\
    \ (on-\nbuoy) with an associated quality index. At specific time\nintervals, data\
    \ are aggregated and associated with a new\nquality index resulting from a number\
    \ of data checks, in-\ncluding those tested in the present study (e.g., step test,\n\
    local and global range tests). Successively, aggregated and\nquality checked data\
    \ are transmitted using the selected\ntransmission protocol to the data-centre\
    \ tier consisting of\nseveral Web services dedicated to data collection, protec-\n\
    tion and serving.\nThe present study provides essential indication for the\ninstallation\
    \ of a HFM system and for a shared QA/QC\nprocedures to guarantee the good functioning\
    \ of the sys-\ntem itself and a wise management of HFM data. A shared\ndata validation\
    \ protocol is still under development, based\non the results we gathered during\
    \ this study. The final pro-\ntocol should aim at reducing the validation time\
    \ to facili-\ntate public access to the data with controlled quality.\nCurrently,\
    \ taking advantage of the experience gained with\nLM1, a mooring platform equipped\
    \ with limnological\nsensors has been installed in Lake Lugano, and three\nbuoys\
    \ will be placed in different areas of Lake Como. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work\

  title: 'Automated high frequency monitoring of Lake Maggiore through &lt;em&gt;in
    situ&lt;/em&gt; sensors: system design, field test and data quality control'
  verbatim_quote1: '**Types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their
    typical sources**


    The following types of data are most applicable to irrigation management:


    - **Soil moisture data**, which can be used to determine when to irrigate and
    how much water to apply.

    - **Weather data**, such as rainfall, temperature, and wind speed, which can help
    farmers predict when and how much to irrigate.

    - **Crop data**, such as plant height, leaf size, and yield, which can help farmers
    determine the water needs of their crops.


    These data are typically collected from a variety of sources, including:


    - **Soil moisture sensors**, which can be inserted into the ground to measure
    the amount of moisture in the soil.

    - **Weather stations**, which collect data on rainfall, temperature, and wind
    speed.

    - **Satellite imagery**, which can be used to track crop growth and development.

    - **Farm records**, which can provide information on crop yields and water use.'
  verbatim_quote2: '**Relevance to the analysis topic**


    The data described above are all essential for effective irrigation management.
    By collecting and analyzing these data, farmers can make informed decisions about
    when and how to irrigate their crops. This can lead to increased crop yields,
    reduced water use, and improved profitability.'

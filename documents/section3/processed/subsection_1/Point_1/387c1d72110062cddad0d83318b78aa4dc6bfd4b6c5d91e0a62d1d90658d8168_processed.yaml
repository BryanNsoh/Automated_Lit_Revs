    of Things (IoT) provides connectivity to the objects that monitor and sense the
    environment to integrate physical world with digital world. If IoT is enabled
    in the Smart Grid (SG), it can benefit from advantages of the IoT such as interoperability,
    connectivity, etc. By combining the IoT with energy harvesting (EH) and cognitive
    radio (CR) techniques, the problems of SG, such as harsh channel conditions and
    limited battery power, may be resolved. Hence, incorporation of EH and CR reveals
    a new networking paradigm for IoT-enabled SG. To this end, we first introduce
    CR usage in the IoT-enabled SG, and explain the advantages and challenges of CRs.
    Furthermore, we propose EH approaches for the resource constraint of wireless
    devices in the IoT-enabled SG. Operation and node architecture of energy harvesting
    cognitive radios (EH-CR), and network architecture of the IoT-enabled SG are described
    to explain details of our networking paradigm. Open issues and future research
    directions are discussed to enable this new paradigm. Similar content being viewed

    at different IoT layers Article 10 May 2021 Internet of Things: Challenges and
    Opportunities Chapter © 2014 1 Introduction The IoT paradigm provides connectivity
    to objects for information exchange from one remote place to another via the Internet
    [1, 2]. These objects sense the physical world and harvest information about it,
    and send the harvested data to remote users via the Internet. It provides the
    accessibility of information from anywhere in anytime. These objects form interconnected
    networks that are self-configurable and intelligent. Hence, the IoT is utilized
    in a number of applications such as e-health monitoring, transportation, environment
    monitoring, and logistic management [3]. As the IoT extends the wireless communication
    by providing connectivity among the objects, SG supports evolution of electrical
    power system by the utilization of next generation communication techniques [4,
    5]. It paves the road for more agile grid with increased efficiency, reliability
    and security. The energy demand, aging infrastructure of the electric grid and
    varying energy production due to renewable energy resources are some challenges
    of the SG. Furthermore, it provides real-time remote monitoring of the SG equipments
    for power provisioning, estimating failures, capacity limitations and blackouts
    [4, 6]. This provides an effective monitoring of the electric grid and control
    for safe, reliable and efficient power delivery in the SG [7]. Wireless sensor
    networks are main components of the IoT, and they form a digital skin of the observed
    system. From this point of view, enabling the IoT in the SG is a fundamental step
    toward the realization of it. The SG can benefit from the application of the IoT
    technology since the IoT enables smart monitoring of the environment, which is
    the main goal of the SG. Utilization of the IoT provides efficient management
    of resources by smart meters, home gateways, smart plugs and connected appliances
    via the Internet since it ensures efficient communication between consumers and
    utility providers, which provides efficiency in energy production and consumption
    [8]. Satisfaction of consumers’ requirements and energy production from alternative
    resources cause a very dynamic environment and require efficient management of
    the electric grid. Autonomous monitoring, diagnosis and control, and efficient
    operation of the power equipments for the power generation, and distribution require
    monitoring and actuating devices [9]. Hence, the inclusion of the IoT in the SG
    is important. This will increase the utilization of information and communication
    technologies in the SG and provide effective management of power grid system [10].
    Empowering the SG with the IoT technology will lead a new paradigm, i.e., IoT-enabled
    SG. An IoT-enabled SG architecture can be seen in Fig. 1, which shows that the
    elements of the SG communicate over the Internet. The nodes, which are named as
    energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CR) in sequel, are our IoT wireless devices,
    and they access the Internet via access point. The condition of power grid elements,
    their energy production, the consumption of the energy are observed and measured
    via the IoT devices. The observations and measurements are sent over multiple
    hops to reach the Internet gateway, i.e., access point, to send them to remote
    areas for necessary actions to be taken in the IoT-enabled SG. Power consumption
    in industrial, commercial and residential sites can be monitored, and the power
    generated by renewable energy resources can be observed in real time via the Internet.
    For this architecture, SG benefits from the advantages of IoT, which are support
    for the communication of heterogeneous wireless devices, flexibility and context-awareness.
    This provides also better management of the grid with the Internet connection
    between SG components, which increases accessibility. Fig. 1 IoT-enabled SG Architecture
    Full size image Enabling wireless technologies for the communication across the
    Internet are Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, and satellite [11]. On the other hand, the standards
    used in the IoT environments are IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 for local areas.
    Hence, IoT devices to realize the SG operate mostly on ISM bands. However, these
    bands are heavily utilized. The over-utilization decreases the communication quality
    and increases the energy consumption of the resource-constrained wireless devices
    in the SG due to collisions. Furthermore, communication links have high packet
    error rates and variable link capacity due to the SG specific challenges such
    as electromagnetic interferences and equipment noise [9, 12, 13]. Hence, the channel
    conditions are generally harsh in the SG environment [14], which results in a
    dynamic delay and capacity variations in the SG networks. To overcome these challenges,
    CR technology can be utilized in the SG applications [15] so that the IoT nodes
    in the SG can access spectrum bands, which have better channel characteristics,
    in a dynamic manner. CR has special functionalities, which enables it to utilize
    licensed bands opportunistically, are spectrum sensing, spectrum decision and
    spectrum hand-off [16]. With the spectrum sensing, idle licensed channels are
    determined. Afterwards, CR can resolve the problems of spatio-temporal variation
    on the channel characteristics, reliability, latency, harsh propagation conditions
    and collisions due to excessive use of certain channels by utilizing idle licensed
    channels [9]. Wireless nodes in the IoT-enabled SG are resource constrained. In
    spite of the recent advancements in ultra-low power (ULP) transceiver and processor
    technologies, a conventional battery tends to deplete less than a year. This issue
    necessitates periodic replenishment and maintenance, however, the excessive numbers
    of the deployed elements, the tasks that are being fulfilled and the randomness
    of depletion times make this option impractical. Therefore, the need for a self-sustaining
    mechanism becomes more apparent to overcome limited power supply difficulty of
    IoT nodes. Although an auxiliary and/or a totally distinct source can contribute
    this aim sufficiently, EH methods come to the forefront as the energy that can
    be provided by these techniques is theoretically unlimited. As there are numerous
    potential alternatives, i.e, environmental and non-environmental, to gather energy,
    temperature and motion variations; electromagnetic fields, radio frequency signals;
    and light propagations can be regarded as the well-studied ones of these techniques.
    EH eases the problem of limited supply for IoT-enabled SG. There are two fundamental
    problems in the domain of IoT, which are spectrum scarcity and resource constraint.
    They are intensified if the IoT is utilized in the SG since wireless channel conditions
    and environment in the SG are harsher than those of any other IoT domain. In this
    paper, we propose a new networking paradigm, energy harvesting cognitive radio
    networking (EH-CRN) for IoT-enabled SG, which utilizes two important techniques,
    namely energy harvesting and cognitive radio. The contributions of this paper
    are to provide a framework to merge these techniques to eliminate the problems
    of IoT-enabled SG and to introduce challenges, the potential advantages of this
    new paradigm, and to present network and node architectures. To this end, we first
    explain the usage of CR in the IoT-enabled SG. Afterwards, we outline the existing
    EH techniques and how they can contribute to the realization of IoT-enabled SG.
    We overview the operation of the energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CRs),
    and explain their node and network architectures. We also state open issues and
    future research directions to realize EH-CRN for IoT-enabled SG. The paper is
    organized as follows. CR usage in IoT-enabled SG is explained in Section 2. EH
    techniques for IoT-enabled SG are outlined in Section 3. The node and network
    architectures, their operation, and open research issues are discussed in Section
    4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Cognitive radios in IoT-enabled smart
    grid The centralized management of the electric grid has experienced a paradigm
    shift toward the SG. It enables the two way communication, which connects the
    consumer side and the utility companies [5]. This paradigm provides an efficient
    management and control of the grid in a better way. SG brings the capability of
    monitoring of demand and supply in real time. Hence, SG adds new services to the
    customers, in which they can adjust their energy consumption according to the
    demand and supply balance. To enable the concept of the SG, it should be integrated
    with the next-generation information and communication technologies having the
    ability of sensing and broadband wireless communication, supporting ubiquitous
    computing and adaptive control [17]. This will increase the stability of the electric
    grid, decrease unnecessary power consumption, predict communication blackouts,
    and provide security of the grid and power provisioning. According to [17], sensing,
    transmission and control are the basic functionalities that are being offered
    by the SG infrastructure. Smart meters and sensors are the key components for
    sensing operations. Depending on the transmission scheme, sensed data reach to
    the controller or centralized coordinator/gateway via multiple hops. The SG covers
    a large geographical area, which makes the communication infeasible due to the
    harsh environmental conditions and the increased distance between communicating
    parties. Hence, the communication architecture of the SG is divided into three
    main groups, which are home/building area networks (HANs/BANs), neighborhood area
    networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs) [15, 17,18,19]. The sensors in
    homes are essential parts of HAN. They send their readings to the local access
    points. HANs in a neighborhood constitutes a NAN, and a NAN connects the grid
    to the core utility systems [15]. SG’s WAN is the network that covers the core
    network and the backhaul network [15]. For the connection of these networks wireless
    communication is utilized. When we look at the overall SG network, there is a
    hierarchical communication infrastructure [19]. Sensor nodes may be deployed in
    different parts of the electrical power system, which make them vital components
    of the SG. The deployment of the sensor nodes on the grid realizes the efficient
    and reliable power flow from the generation units to the end users [14]. These
    sensors provide monitoring of the power systems and diagnosing failures, which
    prevent the outages, and increase the reliability and efficiency of the electric
    grid [14, 21]. The SG benefits from the advantages of wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs), which are easy deployment, collaborative effort for sensing, support for
    increased coverage, flexible operation and low cost. This provides inexpensive
    monitoring and diagnostic system for the SG [22]. The use of wireless sensor nodes
    poses some challenges in the SG. These challenges can be summarized as harsh channel
    conditions, reliability and latency requirements, bit error rate and channel capacity
    variation, and the limited power capability of the sensor nodes [14]. Conditions
    in SG may deteriorate the wireless channel by high humidity, dirt, dust and vibrations
    [23]. These environment-related parameters are also harmful for the sensor nodes.
    Furthermore, different SG applications would have various quality of service (QoS)
    requirements. For instance, monitoring a transformer vault demands a strict delay
    requirement to decrease the repair time by reporting the failure within a restricted
    time. Hence, the deployed sensor nodes should satisfy different levels of QoS.
    Also, the electrical systems in the SG cause variation in the noise level and
    interference in these environments may be high. These situations result in variation
    of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which causes deviations
    in the channel capacity. Furthermore, limited battery power and processing capability
    require highly energy-efficient protocols. The most important challenge is the
    collisions and resulting redundant energy consumption due to over-utilization
    of the unlicensed bands. Although there are some studies to increase the context
    awareness of the SG, few of them consider the spectrum-awareness of the devices
    deployed in the SG [24]. These studies provide recognition in the spectrum usage.
    CR technology is proposed to support spectrum-awareness in wireless communications.
    The motivations behind this technology are to overcome the spectrum scarcity challenge
    and to dynamically use the underutilized licensed spectrum bands [25]. CR technology
    provides sharing licensed spectrum bands with primary users (PUs), which are the
    owners of these bands. In order to utilize these bands while the PUs are not active,
    CRs can change their transmitting parameters to operate on the vacant channel
    [26]. There are two main characteristics of CRs, which are cognitive capability
    and reconfigurability [25, 26]. With the cognitive capability, the idle spectrum
    bands are detected, and the best channel among these idle channels is selected
    for the communication without any interference to the PUs. With reconfigurability,
    CR can operate in different frequencies and reconfigure its parameters for the
    best performance. The use of the idle licensed spectrum bands increases spectrum
    utilization and decreases the traffic in ISM bands. Hence, collisions due to the
    excessive utilization of the unlicensed spectrum bands are decreased, which provides
    efficient spectrum usage and energy-efficiency. The cognitive capability of the
    nodes is possible with cognitive functionalities. They are spectrum sensing, spectrum
    decision and spectrum hand-off. Spectrum sensing gives the ability of revealing
    the radio spectrum band usage in the licensed bands. Spectrum decision is the
    process that the band for the transmission is decided. Furthermore, a radio with
    CR capability must vacate the licensed channel if this channel become occupied.
    This process is performed by the spectrum hand-off functionality. Using these
    features, nodes with CR capability can coexist with the licensed users, which
    are the license holders of that spectrum band. Although CR provides advantages
    for the wireless communication, it poses challenges such as dynamic radio environment.
    If CR technology is utilized in the SG, it also intensifies the challenges posed
    by the SG itself. The IoT paradigm has a goal to connect every electronic device
    to the Internet [1, 2]. It leads to the integration of different technologies
    and communication techniques. Hence, the devices within the IoT should communicate
    with different types of communication devices. The IoT is regarded as a union
    of wireless devices via the Internet to observe and sense the environment, and
    to monitor the surrounding. This paradigm has been evolving the way we communicate,
    most importantly, the standards of living since it finds many application areas
    such as transportation manufacturing, logistics, management of cities etc. [2].
    With the emergence of the IoT, the Internet has been evolved in such a way that
    Network of Interconnected objects senses the environment and actuates accordingly
    by using Internet services for communication, data transfer and analysis of the
    sensed data [1]. From this point of view, the SG has the same characteristics
    since it covers the electrical grid to sense for providing intelligence on demand
    and supply side. Furthermore, the sensing from houses to the generation side provides
    less energy loss, immediate response to the grid failures and easy adaptation
    to new systems [27]. Hence, integration of the SG with the IoT helps better monitoring
    and management of the electrical grid. This integration will also provide IoT
    services such as broad connectivity, privacy, interoperability between the heterogeneous
    wireless devices and access to the cloud computing systems. Internet connection
    of the SG and addressing the sensing and actuator devices in the Internet domain
    provide flexibility, reliability, efficiency and adaptation. Hence, SG can adopt
    the services provided by the IoT. However, the Internet connection via wireless
    links and the communication between the sensing and actuator devices in the SG
    suffers from the harsh channel conditions such as high path loss exponent and
    shadowing deviation [14] and changing spectrum characteristics over time and space
    [7]. Hence, CR may also be solution to overcome these challenges to provide unique
    reliability and requirements by dynamic spectrum access and decrease the energy
    consumption of the wireless devices by avoiding the collisions with adapting its
    operating frequency according to the spectrum sensing. 2.1 Advantages of CR in
    IoT-enabled SG Cognitive cycle operations provides awareness in frequency usage.
    Dynamic adaption to the frequency bands and opportunistic usage of the licensed
    channels increase the spectrum utilization and communication efficiency. The advantages
    of CR in IoT-enabled SG can be outlined as follows [7]. Adaptation to the environmental
    conditions: The harsh conditions of a band can be eliminated by changing the operating
    frequency to channels with less noise level. Accessing to underutilized licensed
    spectrum: With the spectrum sensing, idle channels are utilized, efficiency of
    these bands is increased. Resistance to the varying link capacity: Due to varying
    channel conditions, CR can dynamically hop to the frequency bands with higher
    link capacity. The ability of existence with different type of networks: Due to
    the CR capability, they can coexist with different type of networks since they
    can opportunistically access to the spectrum. This advantage supports operation
    with different technologies due to IoT feature in SG. 2.2 Challenges of CR capable
    IoT-enabled SG The challenges for the realization of the SG are empowered by inclusion
    in the IoT paradigm and the utilization of CR. The IoT requires scalable, energy
    efficient and flexible solutions. Furthermore, the solutions must support spectrum-awareness
    if CR is utilized. Hence, the challenges of CR capable IoT-enabled SG can be outlined
    as follows [14]. Excessive overall data transfer: Since there is a large number
    of wireless devices in the IoT-enabled SG, the overall sensing data conveyed to
    the control center may result in huge amount. Opportunistic wireless transfer
    of this data will pose a great challenge without any excessive interference to
    PUs. Balancing the energy resources: Due to the variations between the demand
    and supply, balancing the energy resources and the determination of their share
    is a difficult task. Spectrum-aware communication between the demand and supply
    side with the harsh environmental condition of the IoT-enabled SG poses a challenge.
    Dynamic licensed user activity: Interference to the licensed users should be less
    than a certain threshold. Variation in the traffic: Due to the activities on the
    user side, the traffic flowing from the user side to the supply side varies. Satisfying
    different levels of QoS: SG can have a wide variety of QoS level due to diverse
    SG applications. Satisfaction of all the users in SG is a challenging task. 3
    Existing methods of energy harvesting Existing techniques of energy scavenging
    is broadly categorized into two groups as Harvest-Use and Harvest-Store- Use,
    where these can be further sub-categorized as controllable and uncontrollable
    [28]. By regarding this separation and the frequency of preference some leading
    EH methods are discussed below, and a detailed comparison is presented in Table
    1. Table 1 Comparison of the existing EH techniques [31] Full size table 3.1 Energy
    harvesting from light sources Power extraction from light sources is a well-known
    technique of EH in which the energy carried by photons is converted into utilizable
    electrical power with respect to a chemical phenomenon, namely photo-voltaic (PV)
    effect [28, 29]. In outdoor, solar energy is efficiently exploited to power various
    systems and applications, thanks to its sufficient power rating, and implementation
    flexibility. One of the most well-established applications of sunlight EH, in
    terms of wireless networking, can be regarded as intelligent surveillance and
    advanced control of grid assets over the Internet since the electrical power grid
    related elements are in widespread. This aspect also contributes to the realization
    of SG and Smart City visions. However, as a corollary of being environmental,
    the energy that can be gathered by sunlight illumination is highly affected by
    ambient factors. For indoor applications, more specialized PV materials, which
    are better suited for diffused lights, are being developed for profiting from
    any kind of light propagation to build HANs/BANs [28]. Although the period of
    harvesting is much longer on the contrary of sunlight’s daytime constraint, the
    energy that can be gathered by artificial lights is roughly one third of sunlight
    energy. 3.2 Thermal energy harvesting Thermal EH is based on a physical phenomenon,
    i.e., Seeback Effect, which occurs between conductor pairs. In brief, due to a
    thermal difference the junction expands in a certain direction that results in
    utilizable electrical power. The attainable energy can be easily adjusted by changing
    connection of the pairs as series and/or parallel [28]. Thermo-electric generation
    (TEG) can be regarded as an innate method for SG communications, where the temperature
    gradients between the grid assets and the environment are being utilized for providing
    energy to the wireless devices attached [30]. In small scale, mostly peltiers
    and/or thermocouples are preferred for low-power requiring time-uncritical consumer
    electronics solutions. It is also possible to energize the circuitries that are
    obliged to monitor the human bodies or any body-attached control systems by using
    the very same approach. As the devices are more likely to operate self-sustainably,
    they may suffer from the quite low power extraction efficiency of the TEG process
    [28, 31]. 3.3 Kinetic energy harvesting As the name suggest, kinetic energy conversion
    (KEC) means profiting from any mechanical stress and/or vibration resultant motion
    variation to gather power for wireless devices. KEC includes electrostatic, piezoelectric
    and electromagnetic methods to extract energy from mostly uncon- trollable but
    somehow predictable environmental sources, as well as partly-controllable and
    mostly unpredictable man-made actions [29]. Airflow EH, in particular, can be
    considered as one of the well-established power provision methods for SG applications,
    in which the wireless autonomous devices destined to surveil the grid are powered
    by KEC-capable anemometer like mechanisms. As these systems provide longevity
    and maintenance-free operation for the networks to be built, the available power
    is highly threatened by many factors, such as daytime and weather conditions.
    Although the vibrations alternate the wind power in SG communications, they require
    specialized harvesters as the frequency of each vibrating element differs. For
    indoor applications, piezoelectric materials are mostly preferred to operate HANs
    and BANs intermittently [28, 31]. 3.4 Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting With
    the unprecedented grow in wireless technologies in recent years, electromagnetic
    (EM) waves become more attractive for especially EH applications [28, 29]. Because
    of the nature of wireless communication, EM signals have the characteristics of
    being easily attainable and efficiently utilizable, which open up the potential
    of building battery-less WSNs that profit from ambient and underutilized RF waves.
    For urban areas, RF energy is about to unseat the conventional methods of EH that
    are destined to run remote services of Smart Cities. For indoor, EM waves emitted
    from modems, routers, smart phones, and laptops are first collected, then converted
    into AC and DC by using power receiving antennae, transducers, and rectifiers,
    respectively. Although the RF EH provides quite satisfying solutions regardless
    of the environmental parameters, being distortive for the communication; having
    strict deployment requirements; depending highly on an unpredictable source compel
    its utilization in mission-critical applications [31]. 3.5 Energy harvesting from
    electromagnetic fields In addition to above-mentioned harvesting techniques, low-power
    operative wireless devices can be also powered by exploiting electromagnetic fields
    around the conductive materials energized at any level. Magnetic field (M-field)
    EH, in particular, is based on coupling the surrounding field flow of AC current
    carrying conductors by clamping them with current transformers [29,30,31]. This
    power transfer-based technique provides acceptable rate of stable power as long
    as there exist sufficient current flow on the conductor that is being utilized.
    Being bulky and requiring additional safety procedures due to the mechanical contact
    are the factors that restrict its employment in certain applications. However,
    for online condition monitoring of overhead power lines and environmental sensing
    around grid assets, it is the most efficient solution in contrast with the ambient
    sources such as sunlight and airflow. Electric field (E-field), in similar, exploits
    the electric charges induced on a conductive material due to a voltage difference.
    The field that is being emitted is obstructed by again a conductive material,
    where a displacement current starts to drain. The charges conveyed are first converted
    into DC and then accumulated in a storage element after regulated. As the source
    of this gathered energy is the ambient field, this method can be termed as E-Field
    EH (EFEH) [30, 31]. EFEH depends only on the existence of voltage potential. Since
    the voltage and the frequency are firmly regulated and exactingly maintained,
    the E-field is stable and also predictable in its behavior. Therefore, it can
    be referred as the most promising way of composing long-term and self-operable
    communication services notwithstanding the environmental parameters. 4 Energy
    harvesting cognitive radios in IoT-enabled smart grid We separately investigate
    the usage of CR and EH in the IoT-enabled SG in prior sections. This section explains
    how the nodes operate by utilizing these technologies in the IoT-enabled SG. Spectrum-aware
    communication and energy harvesting capabilities of these nodes are the key elements
    for successful operation of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, the wireless devices in
    an IoT-enabled SG are named as energy harvesting-cognitive radios (EH-CRs). As
    EH-CRs have additional capabilities, their node architecture would be different
    from conventional wireless nodes in the IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, these capabilities
    require considering the network architectures of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, we
    overview operation of EH-CRs, their node architecture, and the architectures of
    the network consisting of these nodes. 4.1 Operation of EH-CRs Overcoming the
    spectrum scarcity challenges with CR and solving the limited energy supply problem
    with the EH techniques provide significant benefits in the SG domain. Furthermore,
    including the SG in the IoT results in very diverse application areas. This fact
    necessitates a clear understanding of operation of the IoT-enabled EH-CRs. The
    SG is a visionary concept that connects the demand and supply sides by enabling
    two way communication. These connection is provided by the deployment of wireless
    sensing devices and actuators. Hence, the proper operation of these devices is
    quite important. In the IoT-enabled SG, there are different operation schemes
    for the wireless devices. The deployed devices in homes may access directly to
    their gateways or they may reach their Internet gateways through multiple hops.
    During the operation, EH-CRs use spectrum-aware communication techniques for the
    transmission, and EH methods to energize the device. Depending on the sub-network
    architectures, the packet generated by sensing are conveyed in one or multiple
    hops in dynamic radio environment to reach the Internet for realizing IoT-enabled
    SG. They utilize the licensed spectrum bands since they coexist with PUs. Furthermore,
    they scavenge energy by utilizing EH techniques. 4.2 Node architecture of EH-CRs
    We propose a node architecture for IoT-enabled EH-CRs that supports self-sufficient
    and spectrum aware communications. In this architecture, we include three main
    units, which are ultra-low power (ULP) communication, ULP processing, and power
    provision units. A detailed structure is depicted in Fig. 2. The ULP communication
    unit performs channel switching, channel sensing, modulation and power control
    duties at the expense of miliwatts. Furthermore, sensory operations are performed
    in the sensor unit, which is controlled by the ULP processing unit. The sensed
    information is processed in ULP, and it is transferred to the ultra-low power
    communication unit. Fig. 2 Node Architecture of EH-CRs Full size image The power
    provision unit includes energy harvester, rectifier, regulator and energy buffer,
    i.e., super-capacitor, sub-units. As the name suggest, this unit is responsible
    for providing utilizable energy to the each part of the sensor node. In other
    words, profitable sources are captured, converted (if necessary), regulated and
    stored to be distributed to the rest of the system. The processing unit mainly
    decides on operating parameters and manages every process carried out by the sensor
    node. The ULP communication unit has an Internet-capable RF front-end, demodulator
    and decoder to provide the communication with CR functionalities. This node architecture
    is designed to support self-sufficient and spectrum-aware communications in the
    IoT-enabled SG. 4.3 Network architecture of IoT-enabled SG Using the node architecture
    of EH-CRs, we establish a network architecture for the IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore,
    we also utilize the general SG network architecture while establishing it for
    the IoT-enabled SG. The general SG network architecture has a multi-layer architecture
    and spread over a very geographical region, which poses challenges and limitations
    in wireless communications. Furthermore, this network architecture includes a
    number of sub-networks that have different QoS and other communication requirements.
    There are three main components for the SG network architectures, namely, HAN,
    NAN and WAN as seen in Fig. 3 [18, 19]. IAN in Fig. 3 refers to industrial area
    network, which is a sub-network of NAN located at industrial sites. BAN in Fig.
    3 refers to building area network, which is again a sub-network of NAN consisting
    of wireless nodes located in buildings. In our architecture, we split the IoT-enabled
    SG network like in the conventional SG networks. However, we consider the capabilities
    of EH-CRs while proposing our network architecture. We investigate the sub-networks
    of the IoT-enabled SG in the following subsections. Fig. 3 Network Architecture
    of IoT-enabled SG Full size image 4.3.1 Home area networks HANs cover houses and
    buildings. They provide real time monitoring for adjustment of energy consumption.
    Furthermore, they have the capability of control, managing and track of the devices
    at homes and buildings [32]. These networks bring intelligence to the houses,
    i.e., Smart Homes (SHs) [33]. Remote control and tracking, management of heat
    and light, and health-care monitoring are some of the applications of SHs. Home
    is the smallest part of the grid and provides context-aware services to the HAN
    users. The most important elements in HANs are smart meters, which have the capability
    of measuring the energy consumptions of the nodes [34]. WSNs are the key components
    to realize the SG in HANs that can be used home applications related to demand
    and energy management [35]. The collaborative nature of WSNs helps to exchange
    of the sensory information from the home appliances and systems, and makes this
    information accessible via the Internet with the inclusion of IoT. The development
    of the SG have increased the usage of HANs, which utilizes protocols such as ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, and 6LoWPAN. However, they use ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands,
    which are highly utilized and become insufficient for the transmission. This also
    increases the collision and deteriorates the network performance. Hence, CR plays
    a key role to eliminate these problems in HANs. CR is also being utilized in the
    SG domain to manage high volume of data and to satisfy different QoS levels [36].
    In our network architecture, the nodes in home communicates with the access point
    by dynamic spectrum access techniques to overcome the difficulties in the SG.
    This scenario is seen in Fig. 3 with exploitation of different EH methods such
    as harvesting from solar and thermal energy. The EH methods extend the lifetime
    of EH-CRs in HANs. 4.3.2 Neighborhood area networks NANs provide the connection
    between HANs. These networks are also named as field area networks (FANs) due
    to their connection of field devices such as advanced metering infrastructures
    (AMI) and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) [18]. NANs gather the energy consumption
    information from the homes in a neighborhood and sends it to utility companies
    via WANs [36]. NANs also connect SHs and the utility companies. It provides real-time
    communication for pricing and control. Furthermore, main fields of NAN applications
    can be named as distribution automation, load management and so on. Depending
    on the application, the network radius of NANs may be up to 10 km with a rate
    of 0.1 - 10 Mbps [19]. Multi-hop capable wireless nodes may be utilized such as
    ZigBee and Wi-Fi nodes [20]. Wireless sensor nodes may be utilized for this purpose.
    However, they may face the spectrum scarcity challenge in addition to the SG challenges
    such as harsh channel environment. CR again stands as a solution for these problems.
    In our networking paradigm, the nodes in NANs also access the licensed spectrum
    opportunistically. Gateway nodes are with cognitive radio capability. Their energy
    is supplied by the EH methods, which depend on the available energy resources
    in that neighborhood. Figure 3 shows a NAN that gateway node is connected to the
    different sub-networks such as HAN, IAN and BAN. Furthermore, nodes in NANs need
    more energy since they communicate with the nodes in HANs. Hence, efficient EH
    techniques should be employed. 4.3.3 Wide area networks WANs cover large areas
    and connects much smaller networks to form the communication backbone [37]. NANs
    forms WANs, the NANs communicates with the utility center via the Internet through
    WANs [36]. The observations and the real-time measurements of the substations
    and end users are conveyed to the control center traversing WANs, where the data
    from control centers is transmitted in the same manner [37]. IEDs are the sensor
    and actuator nodes, which are deployed in critical parts of the electrical grid
    such as transformers, circuit breakers, etc. [38]. The communication between the
    nodes of WANs requires high bandwidth and low delay due to the accumulated data
    from HANs and NANs. For instance, 5 Mbps data rate and 100 milliseconds delay
    is required for seamless communication [39]. The current WSN solutions may not
    satisfy these requirements due to inherent. CR provides the use of the licensed
    channels with high bandwidth to support the demands. If gateway noes can not access
    base stations in WANs, they reach them in multiple hops by utilizing idle licensed
    bands. 4.4 Open issues and future research directions In this paper, we have proposed
    a new networking paradigm, namely energy harvesting cognitive radio networking
    in IoT-enabled Smart Grid. The nodes have two capabilities, which are energy scavenging
    and spectrum-aware communications. Furthermore, these nodes operate in a very
    harsh domain, which is IoT-enabled Smart Grid. To enable EH-CR networking in IoT-enabled
    SG, we have explained the operation of EH-CRs, the node architecture and their
    network operation in a IoT-enabled SG. This new paradigm yields some open issues
    and future research directions, which are outlined as follows. Spectrum management
    frameworks must be designed according to the networking architecture of the IoT-enabled
    SG and the CR capability of the nodes. Furthermore, EH aspects of these nodes
    should be considered to enable efficient power consumption to support battery
    free operation. Energy harvesting and the energy consumption due to the cognitive
    cycle operations should be considered to balance the energy expenditure for perpetual
    lifetime. Furthermore, the spectrum-aware communication challenges such as arrival
    of PU during opportunistic communication should be considered in IoT-enabled SG
    with the intrinsic harsh channel conditions. Coverage and connectivity of the
    IoT-enabled SG should be studied according to the spectrum-awareness and energy
    harvesting points of view. New power control method can be utilized considering
    the harvested energy in IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, the connectivity of IoT-enabled
    SG should be investigated in such a setup. The heterogeneity of IoT-enabled devices
    should be handled since these devices use different communication technologies.
    The compatibility with EH-CRs and the other IoT devices deployed in SG must be
    investigated in terms of communication. Spectrum-aware routing protocols should
    be designed to enhance the lifetime of the nodes with EH techniques. The routing
    techniques should also consider the different network architectures of SG such
    as HAN, WAN, NAN. Application specific EH methods should be offered to support
    battery free operations of EH-CRs. Furthermore, hybrid energy harvesting approach
    may be proposed to exploit different EH methods in EH-CR nodes. EH methods must
    be utilized in accordance with required operation in different parts of the IoT-enabled
    SG since different nodes in different subnetworks of the IoT-enabled SG uses different
    amount of energy for the communication due to different transmission ranges. 5
    Conclusion In this paper, we propose a totally new networking architecture, namely,
    Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networking for Internet of Things-enabled Smart
    Grid. EH techniques are planned to be utilized for increasing the lifetime of
    wireless devices deployed in IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, as the SG has harsh
    channel conditions and spectrum scarcity problems in its network architecture,
    we propose to use CR to overcome these issues. This new networking paradigm is
    investigated in terms of general operation, node and network architecture aspects.
    Open issues and future research directions are presented to realize EH-CR networking
    in the IoT-enabled SG. References Gubbi J, Buyya R, Marusic S, Palaniswami M (2013)

  limitations: The paper primarily focuses on the convergence of EH, CR, and IoT technologies
    in the context of smart grids, particularly for automated irrigation management.
    It does not extensively discuss the specific data types and sources most applicable
    to irrigation management, which was a key point in the outline of the literature
    review. Additionally, while the paper briefly mentions challenges and limitations
    of its proposed networking paradigm, a more in-depth analysis of potential drawbacks

  title: Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networking for IoT-enabled Smart Grid
  verbatim_quote1: '"Hence, incorporation of EH and CR reveals a new networking paradigm
    for IoT-enabled SG. To this end, we first introduce CR usage in the IoT-enabled
    SG, and explain the advantages and challenges of CRs. Furthermore, we propose
    EH approaches for the resource constraint of wireless devices in the IoT-enabled
    SG."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Fig. 1 IoT-enabled SG Architecture Full size image Enabling wireless
    technologies for the communication across the Internet are Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, and
    satellite [11]. On the other hand, the standards used in the IoT environments
    are IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 for local areas. Hence, IoT devices to realize
    the SG operate mostly on ISM bands. However, these bands are heavily utilized.
    The over-utilization decreases the communication quality and increases the energy
    consumption of the resource-constrained wireless devices in the SG due to collisions."'
  verbatim_quote3: '"We separately investigate the usage of CR and EH in the IoT-enabled
    SG in prior sections. This section explains how the nodes operate by utilizing
    these technologies in the IoT-enabled SG. Spectrum-aware communication and energy
    harvesting capabilities of these nodes are the key elements for successful operation
    of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, the wireless devices in an IoT-enabled SG are named
    as energy harvesting-cognitive radios (EH-CRs). As EH-CRs have additional capabilities,
    their node architecture would be different from conventional wireless nodes in
    the IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, these capabilities require considering the network
    architectures of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, we overview operation of EH-CRs, their
    node architecture, and the architectures of the network consisting of these nodes."'

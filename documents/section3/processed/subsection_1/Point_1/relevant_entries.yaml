- analysis: 'The paper titled "Surface soil moisture estimation in bare agricultural
    soil using modified Dubois model for Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data" focuses on estimating
    soil moisture using remote sensing data, which is relevant to the point of "Types
    of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources".


    The Modified Dubois Model (MDM) is employed to derive surface soil moisture from
    Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The paper utilizes ground-based
    soil moisture measurements to validate the estimated soil moisture. The results
    indicate a strong correlation between model-derived and ground-based soil moisture
    values, suggesting the applicability of the MDM for soil moisture estimation in
    bare agricultural fields.


    The paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the potential of SAR
    data for soil moisture estimation. It provides valuable insights into the use
    of MDM and Sentinel-1 data for irrigation management. However, it is limited to
    bare agricultural fields and does not explore the application of the model to
    different soil types or vegetation conditions.'

  description: Surface soil moisture has vital role in water energy balance, climate
    change and agriculture mainly for crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling.
    Microwave remote sensing with its unique characteristics of high penetration and
    sensitivity towards dielectric constant, has enabled the researchers to explore
    various techniques for soil moisture estimation. With the launch of Sentinel-1
    (A&B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, the hindrance in accessing high
    spatial and temporal resolution data is eliminated. The current study focuses
    on surface soil moisture estimation for bare agricultural fields in the semi-arid
    region. Field soil moisture up to 5 cm depth using HydraGo Probe sensor and surface
    roughness synchronizing with satellite pass dates were collected from total 102
    locations spanning four dates. Volumetric and sensor-based soil moisture are well
    correlated with R2 = 0.85. The Modified Dubois Model (MDM) was applied to obtain
    the relative permittivity of the soil for the backscattering coefficient (σ◦)
    for VV polarization, which is used as one of the inputs in universal Topp’s model
    for soil moisture calculation. Model derived soil moisture is well correlated
    with ground-based soil moisture for the entire range of the soil moisture (0.02-0.18
    m3m-3) with R2 = 0.85 and RMSE=0.005. The entire soil moisture was categorized
    in three soil moisture ranges to evaluate the sensitivity. The highest correlation
    was observed for 0.06-0.1 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.73 and RMSE=0.003 followed by 0.015-0.6
    m3m-3 with R2 = 0.81 and RMSE=0.001 and 0.11-0.18 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.48 and RMSE=0.019
    which is significantly low. Performance accuracy of MDM is encouraging for bare
    soil moisture estimation for even the lower range of surface soil moisture

  description: Diagnosing water conditions timely and accurately is crucial for seasonal
    irrigation scheduling in crop production. The purpose of this study was to establish
    robust water deficit models of winter wheat in different growing seasons by combining
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral and thermal images. In 2021 and 2022,
    a water deficit field experiment on winter wheat was carried out in Hebei Province,
    China. Five-band multispectral and thermal images were obtained with a UAV at
    six key growth stages of winter wheat. Fourteen vegetation indices (VIs) and two
    thermal indices (TIs) were calculated. Simultaneously, wheat stomatal conductance
    and soil water content were measured. On this basis, normalized stomatal conductance
    (NGS) and effective water content (EWC) were calculated. TIs had the highest correlation
    with NGS and EWC at early growth stages, whereas ratio vegetation index (RVI),
    modified simple ratio index (MSR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
    were highly correlated at later stages. Partial least squares (PLS), support vector
    machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) were used to predict
    NGS and EWC for each growth stage, with the data of 2021 as the training set and
    the data of 2022 as independent test set. In general, GBDT outperformed PLS and
    SVM, and NGS was better predicted than EWC. Including VIs and TIs effectively
    improved the estimation accuracy of the predictive models. The test set results
    of the NGS and EWC models built by GBDT achieved the best performance in flowering
    stage (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE)
    = 0.08, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 14.7%) and filling stage (R2
    = 0.90, RMSE = 0.05, NRMSE = 15.9%), respectively. The models of the post-heading
    stage were better than those of the pre-heading stage for both NGS and EWC. This
    study provides a robust method for diagnosing water stress only using UAV remote
    sensing data.

    contentMachine learningRobustness 1. Introduction Wheat is the food crop with
    the largest planting area and the widest distribution in the world (Reynolds and
    Braun, 2022). Irrigation is vital for agricultural production as irrigated wheat
    yield increases by about 34 % compared with rainfed yield on a global scale (Wang
    et al., 2021). However, irrigated agriculture accounts for about 70% of the freshwater
    withdrawals in the world (FAO, 2023), putting pressure on the global water cycle.
    Precision irrigation enables quantitative decision-making and variable inputs
    of irrigation amount by considering spatial and temporal variations in crop water
    demand (Abioye et al., 2020, Daccache et al., 2015). Thus, water use can be managed
    more efficiently through precision irrigation management. This requires accurate
    information on the spatial variation of plant and soil water status and water
    requirement (Maes and Steppe, 2019), which can enable the formulation of plans
    for variable irrigation in large-scale production. Water stress reduces the transpiration
    and stomatal conductance, resulting in an increase in canopy temperature (Jackson
    et al., 1981, Kögler and Söffker, 2019, Buckley, 2019). This change can be observed
    reliably with thermal remote sensing, although corrections for weather conditions
    and vegetation characteristics are needed to interpret the signal (Maes and Steppe,
    2012, Maes et al., 2016). Measurements of canopy reflectance in the visual and
    near infrared are also commonly implemented for diagnosing crop water stress (Das
    et al., 2022, Traore et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2021), but provide information
    only in an advanced stage of water stress, when the canopy structure (e.g., leaf
    angle distribution, reductions in leaf area) or leaf characteristics (e.g., reduction
    in chlorophyll, increase in photoprotective pigments as carotenes or anthocyanins)
    are affected (Han et al., 2020). Yang et al. (2020) pointed out that normalized
    difference red-edge index (NDRE) and red-edge chlorophyll index (RECI) can detect
    the water status of wheat under water stress and can be used to monitor crop efficiency
    under varying water dosages. Bhandari et al. (2021) found that excess green index
    (ExG), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDRE were positively
    correlated with wheat yield at flowering stage and filling stage under water stress
    condition compared to that at early growth stages. Satellite remote sensing can
    be used to monitor crop water conditions on a large scale (Bhattarai et al., 2017,
    Veysi et al., 2017). However, thermal data are not yet available at high spatial
    and spectral resolution, and multispectral reflectance data can be affected by
    clouds and offers limited spatial and temporal resolutions (Ezenne et al., 2019).
    Remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides the advantages of
    wide coverage, short measurement cycles, low cost, and flexible operation (Feng
    et al., 2021, Gago et al., 2015, Maes and Steppe, 2019). Applying UAVs also permits
    simultaneous measurements with multiple sensors (Maes and Steppe, 2019). Combining
    data from different sensors taps into different sources of information (Zhang
    et al., 2015) and can be useful in water stress research, particularly when focusing
    on water stress modelling. Moran et al. (1994) calculated the water deficit index
    (WDI) that combined thermal, multispectral, and meteorological data, which provided
    accurate estimation of alfalfa field evapotranspiration rates and relative field
    water deficit. Abuzar et al. (2009) built a modified trapezoid water stress model
    by combining UAV thermal and multispectral images that can be used both in wheat
    irrigated and rainfed situations. Cheng et al. (2022) showed that a soil water
    content model of corn that combined RGB, multispectral and thermal data resulted
    in higher accuracies than the single variable model. However, analyzing data obtained
    from different sensors is challenging. Few studies have used a combination of
    multispectral and thermal data from UAV platforms to assess stomatal conductance
    and soil water content in winter wheat. Another limitation of most previous studies
    is that the training and test datasets are not independent, resulting in an overly
    optimistic appraisal of the model performance. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate
    whether UAV remote sensing can improve the applicability of water stress models
    for different wheat growing seasons and stages, with separate training and test
    datasets. The goal of this study was to develop an accurate, comprehensive yet
    robust model to estimate water deficit (using normalized stomatal conductance
    and effective water content) at the different growth stages of winter wheat, based
    solely on UAV data. To ensure that the resulting models were more robust, they
    were trained and tested on datasets acquired in different years. We investigated
    whether a combination of multispectral and thermal imagery improves the model
    robustness compared to multispectral data alone. For this purpose, we evaluated
    the performance of different machine learning methods (partial least squares (PLS),
    support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)). 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area and experimental treatments The experiment was conducted
    at the China Agricultural University Experimental Station in Zhuozhou (39.45°N,
    115.85°E), Hebei Province, China. The study area climate is warm summer continental
    (Dwb under the Köppen classification) with a summer precipitation pattern. The
    annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the annual mean temperature is about
    11.6 ℃. The soil is mainly sandy (using the definition of the soil texture triangle
    recommended by the USDA) (Shirazi and Boersma, 1984). The average field capacity
    (FC) and the wilting point (WP) in the 0–40 cm soil layer are 0.24 cm3 cm-3 and
    0.05 cm3 cm-3, respectively. Before sowing, the soil was sampled to test physicochemical
    properties. The content of soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, nitrate
    nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen were 20.2 g kg-1, 32.5 mg kg-1, 14.0 mg kg-1, and
    4.6 mg kg-1, respectively, acquired with ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer.
    The content of exchangeable potassium was 55.0 mg kg-1, obtained by atomic absorption
    spectroscopy. Table 1 shows the sowing parameters of winter wheat. In the second
    year, the wheat grains harvested in the first year were used as seeds. To ensure
    a sufficient number of initial seedlings, the sowing rate in 2022 exceeded that
    of 2021 by an additional 60 kg ha-1. Table 1. Sowing parameters of winter wheat.

    and diagnose the water deficit in winter wheat, an experiment was carried out
    from March to June in 2021 and 2022. The field was divided into 12 experimental
    zones, corresponding to 4 irrigation levels, namely HD (high deficit), MD (moderate
    deficit), SD (slight deficit), and LI (local irrigation). We chose the LI as a
    control irrigation level to find the differences among treatments resulting from
    irrigation levels based on local irrigation management. In the present study,
    the main root depth was within a range of 40 cm. Therefore, when the average soil
    water content (SWC) in 0–40 cm soil layer of LI treatment dropped to around 65%
    FC, all zones were irrigated. The irrigation amount of LI treatment was equivalent
    to the average water depth that could supplement current SWC to 100% FC. In total,
    the irrigation amount of LI treatment in 2021 and 2022 were 270 mm and 235 mm
    respectively, which included 30 mm of overwintering water on November 16, 2020
    and November 27, 2021. The irrigation rates for HD, MD, and SD treatments were
    set at 55%, 70%, and 85% of the irrigation rate applied in the LI treatment, respectively.
    In each experimental zone, 3 sampling plots of 6 m × 6 m were selected, resulting
    in a total of 36 plots. The specific experimental layout is shown in Fig. 1. Fig.
    2 shows the irrigation amount of the 4 treatments as well as the cumulative reference
    crop evapotranspiration (ET0, Penman-Monteith) and rainfall in the experiment.

    crop evapotranspiration. The overwintering water amount of 30 mm was applied on
    November 16, 2020 and November 27, 2021, respectively. To achieve variable rate
    irrigation, the experimental field was irrigated by a three-span center-pivot
    irrigation system with a radius of 140 m, which was equipped with solenoid valves,
    valve controllers, Beidou RTK receivers, and control software. The Beidou RTK
    receiver determined the position of the center pivot in the field for the real
    time identification of control zones. There were a total of 34 low-pressure sprinklers,
    and each sprinkler could be operated separately by turning the solenoid on or
    off. The designed application depths in specific control zones were obtained by
    changing the travel speed of the center pivot and the duty cycle of each solenoid
    valve (Hui et al., 2022) (Fig. 1). 2.2. UAV image acquisition 2.2.1. UAV remote
    sensing platform A DJI M300 Pro UAV (Shenzhen DJI Sciences and Technologies Ltd,
    Shenzhen, China) (maximum take-off weight of 9 kg, maximum payload 2.7 kg, maximum
    flight time of 55 min without payload) was equipped with a 5-band multispectral
    camera (MicaSense Red Edge-MX multispectral camera, AgEagle, Wichita, KS, USA)
    and a thermal infrared camera (DJI Zenmuse H20T). Flights were performed in clear
    sky and low wind speed conditions, between 11:00 and 13:00 local time. The DJI
    Pilot app was used for all flights planning, set at 75% forward and 75% side overlap
    in image acquisition for the thermal imagery. The flight height was 50 m and the
    flight speed was 2.1 m s-1. The flight time and flight conditions (see Section
    2.3.3 for a description of the weather station) are listed in Table 2. Table 2.

    the experimental area, and their exact location was retrieved with an RTK GNSS
    receiver (M600 mini, Compass Navigation, China). The adopted positioning protocol
    was Qianxun Find CM (Qianxun SI, China) with a horizontal accuracy of 2 cm and
    an elevation accuracy of 5 cm. 2.2.2. Multispectral camera The RedEdge-MX multispectral
    camera is a global shutter sensor with 5 spectral bands, namely in the blue (465–485 nm),
    green (550–570 nm), red (663–673 nm), red edge (712–722 nm), and near-infrared
    (820–860 nm) spectrum. The focal length is 5.5 mm, resulting in a field of view
    of 47.2° and ground sampling distance of 3.5 cm at 50 m flight height. During
    the flights, the camera was connected to the DLS-2 sensor, measuring GNSS position
    and downwelling light. The camera was set up to capture an image every 2 s. A
    standard grey panel (Calibrated Reflectance Panel (CRP), MicaSense) was photographed
    for radiometric correction before each flight. 2.2.3. Thermal camera Simultaneously,
    the Zenmuse H20T collected thermal images. It is an integrated camera that contains
    4 sensors for a radiometric thermal camera, a wide angle camera, a zoom camera
    and a laser rangefinder. The thermal imaging camera is a radiometric microbolometer
    camera with a single band sensitivity in the 8–14 µm spectral range, a temperature
    range of −40 to 150 °C, and a resolution of 640 × 512 pixels. Its lens has a focal
    length of 13.5 mm, resulting in a field of view of 40.6° and a ground sampling
    distance of 4.5 cm at 50 m flight height. Images were acquired every 2 s. The
    at-sensor radiance was converted into brightness temperature (Tbr, K) using the
    DJI Thermal SDK 1.2 software to perform the atmospheric correction, with the locally
    measured air temperature (Ta), relative humidity, and flight height. The surface
    temperature (Ts, K) was then calculated as Eq. 1 (Maes et al., 2017, Maes and
    Steppe, 2012): (1) T s = T br 4 − ( 1 − ε ) × T bg 4 ε 4 (2) T bg = 0.7 × T a
    4 4 In which ε is the emissivity, estimated as 0.99. Tbg is the background temperature
    (K), calculated from air temperature (K) as Eq. 2. 2.2.4. Data processing Pix4D
    Mapper (Pix4D 4.4, Pix4D S.A., Switzerland) was used to create orthomosaics with
    the coordinates of five GCPs as input for georeferencing. For the multispectral
    data, the software also converted the data to reflectance using the DLS2 and the
    grey reference panel measurement, which is a relatively reliable way for processing
    these data (Daniels et al., 2023). The multispectral and thermal orthomosaics
    were imported into QGIS 3.22 (QGIS Geographic Information System; Open Source
    Geospatial Foundation Project), which was used for all further GIS processing.
    Fourteen vegetation indices that are commonly used for crop growth monitoring
    were calculated from the multispectral orthomosaic (Table 3). From the thermal
    data, two thermal indices (TIs), including the difference between canopy temperature
    and air temperature (△T, ℃) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were calculated
    as follows ((3), (4)): (3) ∆ T = T s − T a (4) CWSI = T s − T pot T dry − T pot

    camera. With Tpot (℃) and Tdry (℃) corresponding to the surface temperature of
    a winter wheat plant transpiring at a maximal rate (Tpot) and not transpiring
    at all (Tdry). In this case, Tpot and Tdry were calculated directly per measurement
    day using the histogram method, as the 1st and 99th percentile the polygon records
    of that day (De Swaef et al., 2021). The histogram method can be applied in this
    case, since the different irrigation treatments guarantee that at least some completely
    unstressed and some severely stressed plants are present on each measurement day.
    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were converted to binary
    images by the vegetation index threshold (OTSU) (Otsu, 1979) to distinguish vegetation
    from soil background. Then, the average value for each VI and TI of each sample
    plot was extracted using the zonal statistics function. 2.3. Field data acquisition
    2.3.1. Stomatal conductance A leaf porometer (SC-1, METER, USA) was used to measure
    the stomatal conductance (GS) of three wheat flag leaves per plot from 11:00–13:00
    on the same day of the UAV flight. As recommended, the probe was regularly calibrated,
    and the sensor probe was kept horizontally during all measurements. 2.3.2. Soil
    water content A TDR device (Trime-T3, IMKO Ltd., Ettlingen, Germany) was used
    to monitor the soil water content (SWC) at depths of 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm. 36
    Trime tubes were buried at the center of each plot. The soil was extracted with
    a soil drill next to the trime tube to calibrate the TDR measurements. 2.3.3.
    Meteorological parameters During the remote sensing image acquisition, a hand-held
    meteorograph (4500 DT, Kestrel, USA) was used to measure the instantaneous meteorological
    data, including relative humidity, temperature, and wind speeds at 2 m height.
    Additionally, a weather station (HOBO U30, Onset Computer Co., MA, USA) was installed
    in the experimental area and hourly wind speed, precipitation, air temperature,
    relative humidity and solar radiation were collected. As shown in Table 1, air
    temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from a hand-held weather
    meteorograph, and solar radiation was obtained from the weather station. 2.4.
    Model establishment and accuracy evaluation 2.4.1. Calculation of water deficit
    indices To build the water regime training and testing models for wheat from separate
    datasets, the GS at each growth stage in the two-year experiment was normalized
    as NGS (Eq. 5). (5) NGS i = GS i GS max Where GSmax is the maximum value of GS
    measured in each growing season (547.5 mmol m-2 s-1 in 2021 and 575.4 mmol m-2
    s-1 in 2022). The effective soil water content (EWC) in the soil that can be utilized
    by crops was calculated as Eq. 6: (6) EWC i = SWC i − WP FC i − WP Where FCi is
    the field capacity of 0–40 cm soil layer of each plot (ranging from 0.21 to 0.24 cm3
    cm-3) and WP is the wilting point (WP=0.05 cm3 cm-3). 2.4.2. Machine learning
    modelling Due to the high collinearity between the vegetation indices, a Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the dimensions (Abdi and Williams,
    2010). The PCA was performed on the VIs and TIs measured in two years at each
    growth stage to determine important variables and the relationship between VIs
    and TIs. The PCA axes with a cumulative contribution rate of principal component
    variance above 98% were used as inputs of the winter wheat water stress prediction
    models. Three different machine learning algorithms were evaluated. PLS (Partial
    Least Squares) is a multivariate statistical data analysis method that combines
    the advantages of principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis,
    and linear regression analysis (Abdi, 2010). SVM (Support Vector Machines) is
    a supervised machine learning algorithm that implements classification and regression
    by constructing a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional
    space (Cortes et al., 1995). GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) is a commonly
    used ensemble learning algorithm. This algorithm trains multiple individual learners,
    and then combines them through certain strategies to form a strong learner, which
    has the characteristics of high fitting accuracy and strong interpretability (Friedman,
    2002). In this study, the number of iterations of GBDT was chosen as 100, and
    the learning rate was 0.1. The maximum depth of the regression tree was 7, the
    minimum number of leaf nodes samples was 5, and the maximum number of features
    was 3. The Principal Components (PCs) calculated for each growth stage in 2021
    were used as input to build NGS and EWC prediction models. To verify the applicability
    of the model, the PCs in 2022 for each growth stage were used to test the performance
    of the models. In addition, a separate analysis was performed in which the data
    of all different growth stages were pooled. We also constructed a separate model
    for pre-heading (tillering, jointing and booting stage) and post-heading stage
    (heading, flowering and filling stage). Finally, to compare the impact of multispectral
    and thermal images on the prediction accuracy of winter wheat growth parameters,
    models using only multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) were included as input,
    or using both VIs and thermal-based indices (VIs + TIs) were included. 2.4.3.
    Statistical analysis The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error
    (RMSE), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) from (7), (8), (9) were
    used to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the models’ prediction results.
    Statistically, the higher R2 and the smaller RMSE and NRMSE, the higher the accuracy
    of a prediction model. The simulation effect evaluation was divided into four
    levels according to the NRMSE: excellent (NRMSE ≤ 10%), good (10%＜NRMSE ≤ 20%),
    suitable (20%＜NRMSE ≤ 30%), and poor (NRMSE＞30%). A schematic illustrating the
    methodology is presented in Fig. 3. (7) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y i ˆ ) 2

    3.1. Statistics of NGS and EWC of wheat under different irrigation treatments
    Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the variation of NGS and EWC of wheat under the different
    irrigation deficit treatments. In the tillering stage, the difference in NGS and
    EWC between the different treatments was still limited (ranging from 0.28 to 0.37
    in 2021 and from 0.27 to 0.41 in 2022 for NGS, and from 0.36 to 0.42 in 2021 and
    from 0.34 to 0.41 in 2022 for EWC, respectively). With the growth of wheat, these
    differences between irrigation treatments gradually increased, peaking in the
    flowering (NGS) and filling stages (EWC). The two-year experimental results have
    high synergy, which provided a favorable data set for the testing of the model.

    models of each growth stage showed the close correlation between NGS and EWC (Fig.
    5). Under water stress conditions, the transpiration rate of wheat decreased,
    so NGS decreased with the decrease of EWC. However, the regression models of the
    six growth stages were different. In the tillering and jointing stages, R2 varied
    slightly between 0.65 and 0.68. R2 increased significantly in booting and heading
    stages. For both years, the correlations were strongest at the flowering stage.

    3.2. Relationships between VIs, TIs and water stress levels The Pearson correlation
    coefficient matrix of on the one hand NGS and EWC and on the other hand the VIs
    and TIs at different growth stages is given in Fig. 6. All VIs except SIPI (structure
    insensitive pigment index) were positively correlated with NGS and EWC, whereas
    SIPI, △T, and CWSI were negatively correlated with these two variables. To clearly
    distinguish the correlation between the spectral variables and the canopy temperature
    indices with the two variables, the correlation coefficient r was taken as the
    absolute value(︱r︱) for analysis, and the following correlation coefficients were
    referred to︱r︱. Download : Download high-res image (781KB) Download : Download

    growth stages. T1 to T6 represent the growth stage of tillering, jointing, booting,
    heading, flowering and filling, respectively. ''All'' represents all growth stages
    from T1 to T6. RVI, NDVI, NDRE, EVI, OSAVI, DVI, GNDVI,CIRE, EVI2, GOSAVI, MSR,
    SAVI, SIPI and RERVI represent ratio vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation
    index, normalized difference red-edge, enhanced vegetation index, optimized soil
    adjusted vegetation index, difference vegetation index, green normalized difference
    vegetation index, red-edge chlorophyll index, enhanced vegetation index, green
    optimal soil adjusted vegetation index, modified simple ratio index, soil adjusted
    vegetation index, structure insensitive pigment index and red-edge vegetation
    index, respectively. △T and CWSI represent the difference between canopy temperature
    and air temperature, and crop water stress index, respectively. In the tillering
    stage, △T and CWSI had the highest correlation with NGS, while RVI (ratio vegetation
    index), NDVI, and GOSAVI (green optimal soil adjusted vegetation index) also showed
    good correlations with NGS. △T and CWSI also performed best in jointing and booting
    stages, followed closely by MSR (modified simple ratio index), RVI and NDVI. Some
    differences between both years were found in the heading stage, where MSR, RVI
    and NDVI were highly correlated with NGS in 2021, whereas △T and CWSI were most
    highly correlated with NGS in 2022. At flowering and filling stages, RVI, CIRE
    (red-edge chlorophyll index), MSR and RERVI (red-edge vegetation index) correlated
    most closely with NGS. Overall, RVI had the highest correlation throughout the
    entire growing season, for both years, closely followed by CWSI. The correlations
    between EWC, and VIs and TIs were slightly lower than those of NGS. In tillering
    and jointing stages, △T and CWSI were most highly correlated with EWC. However,
    RVI, MSR and GNDVI (green normalized difference vegetation index) showed a higher
    correlation with EWC than TIs in booting, heading and flowering stages. At filling
    stage, RVI and NDVI performed best in 2021and 2022, respectively. In summary,
    the correlation between TIs and NGS and EWC was slightly better than that of the
    VIs in the early growth stages, but this was less obvious in the late growth stages.
    Still, overall, CWSI was the most highly correlating variable throughout the entire
    season, and for both years. During the whole experimental period, VIs of RVI,
    MSR, and NDVI performed well with NGS and EWC. 3.3. Principal Components of PCA
    with VIs and VIs+TIs Fig. 7 shows the cumulative contribution of the PCs in the
    PCA analyses by VIs (a) and VIs+TIs (b). The cumulative contribution of the top
    4 PCA components reached over 98% for all PCA analyses. Therefore, we consider
    it appropriate to use 4 PCA components for VIs and VIs + TIs in this study to
    model NGS and EWC (Section 3.4 & 3.5). Download : Download high-res image (154KB)

    stage and post-heading stage, respectively. For the PCA on the VIs, 93.5% of the
    variation was explained by the first two components, in both pre-heading and post-heading
    stages. In the pre-heading stage, OSAVI (optimized soil adjusted vegetation index),
    GOSAVI, NDVI and NDRE (normalized difference red-edge) were strongly positively
    and SIPI strongly negatively correlated with PC1, with EVI (enhanced vegetation
    index) more correlated with PC2 (Fig. 8a). In the post-heading stage (Fig. 8b),
    the overall correlation pattern between the individual VIs was very similar, although
    they were less strongly correlated to PC1. The two first PC of the PCA on the
    VIs + TIs explained 85.7% and 87.6% of the variation in pre-heading and post-heading
    stages, respectively. In the pre-heading stage (Fig. 8c), nearly all VIs were
    very strongly correlated to PC1, and the two TIs to PC2. In the post-heading stage
    (Fig. 8d), the TIs were strongly correlated with several VIs (e.g., △T with SIPI,
    MSR and RVI; CWSI with GNDVI and NDRE). Consequently, both TIs were negatively
    correlated with PC1 and the PCA of VIs + TIs closely resembled the PCA of the

    3.4. Models simulating NGS The 4 PCA axes from VIs and VIs + TIs were used as
    input variables to construct NGS prediction models with PLS, SVM, and GBDT. This
    section only shows the results of the test set; the results of the training set
    can be found in the Appendix (Table A.1). The accuracy of the NGS prediction models
    varied at different growth stages (Fig. 9). None of the models performed well
    at tillering stage, but the model accuracy gradually increased for the jointing,
    booting, and heading stages. The prediction accuracy peaked at the flowering stage
    (R2＞0.80) and decreased during the filling stage. Combining all data from the
    pre-heading stage into a single model clearly increased the model performance,
    although overall performance was still lower (R2 =0.65–0.75) than that of the
    post-heading stage (R2 =0.84–0.88). Download : Download high-res image (355KB)

    respectively. Pre and Post represent pre-heading stage and post-heading stage,
    respectively. Compared to VIs, the combination of VIs and TIs consistently improved
    the prediction accuracy of NGS at all stages. R2 values improved from 0.74 to
    0.79 at pre-heading stage and from 0.87 to 0.90 at post-heading stage for the
    GBDT method. Among the three methods, PLS usually performed slightly worse, particularly
    in the early and later growth stages. For the individual growth stages, GBDT and
    SVM performed similarly. However, the GBDT model performed consistently best for
    the aggregate pre-heading and post-heading models. 3.5. Models simulating EWC
    With the aim of assessing the spatial variability of soil water availability in
    the large-scale field, this study constructed EWC prediction models by combining
    SWC, FC, and WP for the soil layers from 0 to 40 cm. The results of the training
    set can be found in Appendix (Table A.2), and the results of the independent test
    dataset are shown in Fig. 10. The results show large similarity with those of
    the NGS models: combining VIs and TIs consistently improved model performance,
    and the models of pre-heading and post-heading reached a good level (10%＜NRMSE
    ≤ 20%), with the post-heading model performing slightly better than the pre-heading
    model. The ensemble model in the pre-heading stage performed better than the individual
    stage models. PLS models had the lowest accuracy, and GBDT models overall had
    the highest accuracy. R2 was lower and RMSE and NRMSE were higher at the tillering
    and jointing stages. Different from the NGS models, the models achieved the best
    results in filling stage, with GBDT (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.05, NRMSE = 15.9%) as
    the best model. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download : Download

    indicators for characterizing crop water stress. Large-scale monitoring of crop
    water status based on UAV remote sensing technology is greatly important for wheat
    management. In this study, prediction models of NGS and EWC were constructed using
    VIs and TIs calculated from UAV spectral and thermal remote sensing to evaluate
    water stress of winter wheat. As expected, △T and CWSI were indeed more highly
    correlated with NGS and EWC than the VIs in the early growth stages, when the
    growth of the plants did not yet differ much between the treatments. Still, this
    study revealed that in the later growth stages, several VIs (e.g., RVI, RERVI
    and MSR) were even more closely correlated with NGS and EWC than the TIs. Following
    the lower correlation of VIs with NGS and EWC in the early stages, the performance
    of the models predicting the water stress variables was lower, particularly when
    only VIs were used as input (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). This study confirmed that the prediction
    accuracy of combining VIs and TIs by PCA as input was higher than when relying
    only on multispectral data. This is consistent with findings by Cheng et al. (2022)
    who predicted the soil water content in corn. Our study confirmed that the combination
    of multispectral and canopy temperature image datasets for water stress monitoring
    at key growth stages improved the accuracy of predictive models. Another study
    indicated that WDI derived from multispectral and thermal sensors is a reliable
    factor in assessing the water status of winter wheat (Antoniuk et al., 2023).
    Specifically, the WDI had a consistently high correlation with GS during the whole
    season (R2 ranged from 0.63 to 0.99). But their study lacked a truly independent
    test set, so the applicability of the model in different growth seasons still
    needs to be verified. In our study, the prediction accuracy of the NGS model first
    increased and then decreased with the growth of wheat, with optimal performance
    at flowering stage, in line with models predicting GS by Zhou et al. (2021), using
    solely multispectral remote sensing. However, the prediction accuracy of the EWC
    model showed a gradually increasing trend with the growth of wheat. This is probably
    because in the late stages of the growing season, SWC remained stable, whereas
    GS dropped during the filling stage (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This decrease during filling
    stage can be attributed to the weakening of leaf vitality (Xue et al., 2006).
    Conversely, the accumulated drought stress widened the gap of SWC between different
    irrigation treatments at filling stage. The accuracy of the models predicting
    NGS was overall higher than those targeting EWC. GS is a more direct indicator
    of plant water status and hence more closely related to VIs and TIs than SWC (Jones,
    2004). Similar to the findings of Zia et al. (2012), the models showed better
    performance in the post-heading than in the pre-heading stage. An interesting
    observation was that the ensemble pre-heading model performed better than the
    individual models in the tillering, jointing and booting stages, while the ensemble
    model accuracy of post-heading was not significantly improved. This may be due
    to the gradual growth of wheat before heading, which increases the canopy coverage.
    The results indicate that in the early stages, the relationship between on the
    one hand NGS, EWC and on the other hand VIs and TIs remains relatively stable.
    Technically, a model incorporating more data (from different growth stages) is
    more robust. Overall, the GBDT model outperformed the PLS and SVM models with
    higher R2, lower RMSE and NRMSE in NGS and EWC estimation for most of the wheat
    growth stages. This is in line with recent research that also found high precisions
    for the GBDT algorithm (Du et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2018). GBDT is an ensemble
    algorithm based on decision trees. Its basic learner is serially generated, that
    is, each new learner generated is based on the previous modeling results. Therefore,
    it can be used as a good single regression model, providing very robust prediction,
    excellent and stable model discrimination ability. The generated new learners
    are based on the previous modeling results (Obsie et al., 2020). In addition,
    each decision tree of GBDT only learns the prediction residual part of the observation
    data, which is less prone to over-fitting. The SVM can solve nonlinear problems
    by introducing kernel functions. Although it also shows high test set accuracy
    in some growth stages, the fitting accuracy was not as good as the GBDT method
    from the perspective of the entire growth seasons. PLS performed the worst, probably
    because it cannot handle the non-linear problem in water stress prediction well.
    These data were analyzed based on the four irrigation treatment levels, six growth
    stages, and two growing seasons. A completely independent data set, collected
    in a separate year, was used as test dataset. The results showed that the both
    models reached a good level, indicating the stability of the ensemble approaches
    on new data. Zhou et al. (2021) built a GS prediction model of winter wheat with
    R2 greater than 0.80 by combining the multispectral vegetation indices and texture
    features. However, the study used the dataset of the flowering stage of a single
    growing season for training and testing of the model. Similarly, Qin et al. (2022)
    and Cheng et al. (2022) built predictive models for wheat GS and maize SWC respectively,
    but no truly independent dataset was used in their research. Our model results
    can be used in other growth seasons or independent datasets to diagnose water
    stress in wheat. In addition, compared with the single growth stage, two independent
    models (pre-heading and post-heading stage) achieved acceptable test set results,
    which provided a reference for irrigation plans. These models can reliably estimate
    NGS and EWC without the need to define the growth stage in detail. Therefore,
    modelling NGS and EWC for wheat at these two growth periods is straightforward,
    without requiring models for each growth stage. In addition, this study accurately
    controlled the amount of irrigation in the two growing seasons, thereby expanding
    the range of NGS and EWC, and achieving good test set results. Despite the independent
    dataset gathered in a separate year, the current study was performed within a
    single field and with a single variety of wheat. Different varieties of wheat
    as well as differences in climate and soil characteristics could affect the relationship
    between VIs, TIs and stomatal control. Hence, future studies should focus on implementing
    the models that combine multiple sites and varieties to extend those outcomes.
    Nonetheless, the determination of crop surface canopy temperature for both severely
    stressed and unstressed plants was ascertained by analyzing the 1 % and 99 % quantiles
    of the thermal image''s histogram captured on the respective flying day. However,
    it should be acknowledged that this simplified methodology may not be universally
    applicable, particularly in cases where vegetated areas do not exhibit pronounced
    water deficiency. This limitation arises from the inherent inability to establish
    a baseline for CWSI. The OTSU was employed to segregate the vegetation from the
    soil background. However, a comprehensively comparative analysis of the impact
    of distinct methodologies on model accuracy was not compared in this study. Furthermore,
    sandy soil, such as presentin the experimental site, drains faster than loamy
    or clay soil. Consequently, the canopy temperature of sandy soil tends to exhibit
    higher temperatures under water stress conditions. In prospective investigations,
    the best method for distinguishing between soil and vegetation in sandy soils
    should be studied. This refinement will enable better application of histogram
    analysis to discriminate between non-transpiring and fully transpiring crops.
    Additionally, wheat water deficit diagnostic models were constructed based solely
    on UAV multispectral and thermal remote sensing. For precision irrigation, winter
    wheat water stress map (Fig. 11) still needs to be converted into a task map of
    irrigation requirements, for which it is also necessary to include climatic conditions
    or soil properties in the decision process. Download : Download high-res image

    field experiment was conducted. The stomatal conductance and soil water content
    during the critical growth stages of wheat were monitored, and the water stress
    of wheat was assessed based on UAV multispectral and thermal remote sensing. The
    results showed that temperature indices (TIs, △T and CWSI) had a higher correlation
    with normalized stomal conductance (NGS) and effective water content (EWC) in
    the early growth stage, while RVI, CIRE, MSR, GNDVI, and RERVI from vegetation
    indices (VIs) performed better in the late growth stage. In this study, data from
    different growing seasons were used to construct the training and testing sets
    of the model. The gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) method exhibited higher
    performance compared to partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machine
    (SVM), and the NGS could be better predicted than EWC. Combining VIs and TIs effectively
    improved the prediction accuracy of the NGS and EWC models. R2 increased from
    0.83 to 0.88 (NGS) and 0.77–0.81 (EWC) at the flowering stage by GBDT method.
    Overall, this study provides robust models to diagnose water deficit comprehensively
    and accurately in winter wheat using UAV remote sensing. CRediT authorship contribution

    superior accuracy, particularly in irrigation-intensive regions like the Central

    of radiation-based ETO estimation and outperformed the Hargreaves-Samani and Romanenko
    models across all climatic zones. Notably, SolarET showed its strengths in regions
    where the contribution of aerodynamic terms to ETO is less significant, such as
    desert climates. However, it exhibited lower accuracy in coastal areas, which
    may be attributed to factors not captured by solar radiation alone, like humidity
    fluctuations and intermittent cloud cover.

    Irrigation is the most significant consumer of freshwater worldwide. Deciding

    California is chosen as the case study since it is one of the world''s most hydrologically
    altered and agriculturally productive regions. In total, 19,088,736 hourly data

    surfacePyranometerCatBoostCalifornia 1. Introduction Irrigation is considered
    the most significant anthropogenic alternation to the natural hydrological cycle,
    accounting for about 70% of the global freshwater withdrawal (Siebert et al.,
    2010, Foley et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2022). Population growth and economic
    development require increasing food production in the future, and expanding sustainable
    irrigation is essential to satisfy this burgeoning demand (Schmitt et al., 2022,
    Karimzadeh et al., 2024). Reference evapotranspiration (ETO) is a decisive factor
    for water resources management in weekly and monthly resolutions and for irrigation
    scheduling in daily intervals. A common approach for irrigation management is
    to adjust the daily ETO with crop- and growth stage-specific coefficients to determine
    the potential crop evapotranspiration (ETC) (Ji et al., 2017, Fernández, 2023).
    Under the hypothesis that the crop is fully irrigated and without any growth-limiting
    factors (biotic and abiotic factors), the volume of water lost by the crop should
    be topped up with irrigation water (Haghverdi et al., 2021). Anything more than
    this \"correct amount\" (non-consumptive water use) is considered unproductive
    as it will be lost by evaporation, runoff, or deep percolation, while anything
    less than this amount will develop water stress and potentially yield loss. Therefore,
    a realistic estimate of daily ETO is essential for sustainable water management
    and food production. The FAO 56 Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold standard
    of ETO calculation (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965, Allen et al., 1998). Compared
    to other empirical or semi-empirical equations, P-M is a physical-based equation
    that combines energy balance and mass transfer method and considers aerodynamic
    and surface resistance factors to calculate the evapotranspiration rate over a
    standardized cropped surface (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, P-M requires a complete
    weather station (several sensors for measuring multiple parameters) to be installed
    over an extended reference grass surface to achieve reliable results. This surface
    should be homogeneously extended towards different directions (enough fetch) to
    satisfy the heat and vapor advection assumptions. Moreover, the grass should be
    well-watered to avoid any water stress. Meeting these conditions is troubling,
    especially where labor for maintenance is scarce or expensive, and land and water
    resources are limited, which is very common in agriculturally productive regions.
    Utilizing fertile land and scarce water and labor resources for weather stations
    is not appealing to growers and stakeholders. The other problem is the number
    of stations required for irrigation management. Due to the diversity of micro-climates
    in croplands, only a dense network of stations is practically helpful for irrigation
    management. To address the abovementioned challenges, this research aims to develop
    an ETO estimation approach that relaxes the need for a reference surface. ETO
    has four meteorological driving factors: solar radiation, air temperature, air
    humidity, and wind speed (Ahmadi et al., 2022). From these factors, solar radiation
    (Rs) is the only one that does not rely on surface characteristics, as it is a
    function of incoming solar energy only. Therefore, our approach called \"SolarET\"
    uses RS, which is measured with only one sensor (i.e., pyranometer) placed on
    any arbitrary surface as the sole input parameter. There are numerous input-limited
    alternatives for ETO estimation in the literature, ranging from empirical models
    (e.g., Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to machine learning (ML) applications (e.g.,
    Chen et al., 2020). Almost all well-known empirical models were developed decades
    ago over restricted training data samples, sampling locations, and computational
    resources (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). These methods
    tend to aggregate all un-measured inputs and uncertainties deterministically into
    one empirical coefficient, which might result in inaccurate results. Also, none
    of these methods rely only on solar radiation data. On the contrary, these methods
    need information on air temperature and humidity. Since this information is a
    function of the surface, the empirical equations cannot relax the need for the
    reference grass surface. Similarly, ML alternatives available in the literature
    take air temperature and humidity as their inputs and are not primarily focused
    on bypassing the reference surface (Chen et al., 2020, Dong et al., 2022, Kushwaha
    et al., 2022). Our proposed approach uses decision tree- and neural network-based
    ML regression models to estimate daily ETO with hourly and daily RS data. The
    ML models employed in this study have shown superior performance for similar regression
    problems based on the available literature and ML competitions (Rodriguez-Galiano
    et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2020, Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020, Zhangzhong et
    al., 2023). Contrary to the available ML methods for daily ETO forecasting, which
    use only daily meteorological inputs, this research leverages hourly RS inputs
    to take advantage of the information gained from this finer temporal resolution
    data. Another essential difference between SolarET and available ML-based alternatives
    for ETO estimation lies in its generalizability. Our test set consists of unseen
    weather stations to ensure SolarET''s generalizability and applicability to new
    arbitrary locations in California. In other words, we train our models on data
    collected from some stations/locations and then test them using a previously unseen
    dataset from new stations. We use California as the case study to evaluate the
    applicability of SolarET. California is one of the most hydrologically altered
    regions in the world (Zimmerman et al., 2018). California is also one of the most
    agriculturally productive regions on the planet, with heavy reliance on irrigation
    (Lobell and Bonfils, 2008, Tindula et al., 2013). Another reason California is
    a suitable case study for this research is the reliable, long-term data available
    from several weather stations in California (Ahmadi et al., 2023). To examine
    the performance of SolarET, we test it against Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestley-Taylor
    (PT), and Romanenko empirical models. HS and PT models are developed using California
    data and are widely used and highly trusted for ETO estimation (Tabari et al.,
    2013). Leveraging high temporal resolution data, cutting-edge regression algorithms,
    and big training data availability, we hypothesize that SolarET can outperform
    empirical alternatives without requiring surface-dependent inputs. In other words,
    we hypothesize that SolarET can surpass comparable methods in terms of prediction
    accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability. 2. Study area and dataset
    California was chosen as the case study of this research. It is one of the world''s
    most prominent agriculturally productive regions, heavily dependent on irrigation.
    According to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), in an average
    year, approximately 9.6 million acres are irrigated with roughly 42 billion cubic
    meters of water. To assist irrigators in managing this immense water demand, DWR
    and the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) developed a program called
    the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) in 1982. CIMIS
    consists of over 145 automated weather stations that measure meteorological inputs
    of the Penman-Monteith equation in a standardized condition. Daily and hourly
    reports of ETO and its meteorological driving factors are publicly available on
    the CIMIS website (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). More information about the CIMIS
    program can be found on the CIMIS website. For this study, daily and hourly data
    on required variables from 131 active CIMIS stations are acquired. While some
    of those stations are located in research facilities, most are installed on private
    lands (often growers) where proper maintenance (mainly grass and fetch requirements)
    is a limiting factor. For this work, stations are chosen according to their condition
    and maintenance records, and problematic stations (e.g., stations with poor maintenance,
    inadequate or infrequent irrigation, and non-grass reference surface) are eliminated
    to ensure the quality of the input data. The train set consists of 114 stations.
    The train set data is acquired from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2022 (i.e.,
    28 years of data). Although all the stations in the train set have data until
    the end of 2022 (i.e., they are active stations), their installation date varies,
    and some of them have been installed after 1995 and, therefore, have less than
    28 years of data. CIMIS divides California into 18 homogeneous climatic zones
    with similar meteorological and evapotranspiration characteristics. To test the
    applicability of the proposed methodology in estimating ETO at climatically diverse
    and unseen arbitrary locations, 17 stations, each representing a climatic zone,
    were chosen as the test set. Zone 11 is eliminated, as it does not have any reliable
    station. Names and characteristics of these climatic zones can be found in Table
    A1 in the appendix. Readers are referred to Ahmadi et al. (2022) for more information
    about these zones. To evaluate the generalizability of the proposed ML models,
    they have never been exposed to the test set, even for validation purposes. All
    the results reported in this paper represent the models'' performance on this
    unseen test set. To eliminate biases due to data length and climatic variability
    in longer time spans (e.g., wet or dry periods), the test set consists of data
    from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022 (five years) for all stations. In total,
    19,088,736 hourly data records have been used in this study, with 18,447,984 records
    used as the training set and the remaining 640,752 records employed as the test
    set. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of training and testing stations across California.

    3.1. Reference evapotranspiration The Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold
    standard for calculating ETO (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965). CIMIS calculates
    ETO using the P-M equation version described in the American Society of Civil
    Engineering-Environmental Water Resources Institute paper (Allen et al., 2005).
    CIMIS does not use the daily meteorological variables and daily P-M equation to
    calculate daily ETO. It reports the summation of 24 hourly ETO values from midnight
    to midnight as the daily ETO. Ahmadi et al. (2022) showed that the summation of
    hourly ETO values results in similar outputs as using the daily P-M equation.
    CIMIS uses Eq. 1 to calculate hourly ETO (Allen et al., 1998, Allen et al., 2005,
    Walter et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2015). (1) Where Cd (the ratio of bulk surface
    to aerodynamic resistance) is equal to 0.24 and 0.96 during daytime and nighttime,
    respectively. : standardized reference evapotranspiration (mm h−1), which approximates
    grass ET : the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1) at mean air
    temperature (T) : net radiation (MJ m−2 h−1) estimated from solar radiation and
    other input variables : soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 h−1): G=0.1·Rn daytime
    and G=0.5·Rn nighttime : psychrometric constant (kPa°C−1) : mean hourly air temperature
    (°C) : mean hourly wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1) : saturation vapor pressure
    (kPa) at Ta : mean actual vapor pressure (kPa) from dew point temperature (°C),
    or relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) : latent heat of vaporization (2.45
    MJ kg−1 for water temperature of 20 °C) This equation''s first and second fractions
    are the radiation and aerodynamic terms of the P-M equation. This research uses
    the daily ETO value reported by CIMIS (i.e., the summation of hourly values) as
    the target value or predictand of ML models. 3.2. Data preprocessing and feature
    selection To relax the need of reference surface to estimate ETO, this research
    uses only solar radiation data measured by a pyranometer as the input of ML models.
    This study uses hourly RS as input to leverage more detailed measurements and
    capture the variations in solar radiation during the day. Therefore, each sample
    consists of an input vector of size 24 and a target value, which is the daily
    ETO. To ensure the reliability of input data, all samples with zero RS values
    for daytime (i.e., from 8 AM to 5 PM) have been removed from the dataset. Therefore,
    of the 795,364 daily samples used in this study, 1224 samples were eliminated.
    As only 69 of these eliminated samples are from the test set, we hypothesized
    that this process would not bias the distribution of samples in the test set and
    the study results. To ensure the robustness of ML models and improve their accuracy,
    three data preprocessing steps were taken: 1) eliminating records with null values:
    Null values are removed from the dataset to ensure accuracy, eliminate inconsistencies,
    and transform the data into a suitable format for inputting into the models. This
    filtering removed 6752 records from the training set of ML models and 4830 records
    from the test set. 2) Eliminating records with ETO values higher than 15 mm/day:
    we hypothesize these values are due to sensor errors or poor maintenance conditions.
    This filtering resulted in the elimination of 10 records from the training set.
    3) Using robust scaler: While traditional scaling techniques such as min-max scaling
    or standard scaling rely on the mean and standard deviation of the data, robust
    scaling uses different statistics that are less sensitive to outliers. Specifically,
    it leverages the median and interquartile range (IQR) to scale the input data.
    By reducing the potential impact of extreme values on the performance of ML models,
    robust scaling helps to mitigate the influence of outliers in the input variables.
    Eq. 2 shows how scaled data records are calculated using the robust scaling method:
    (2) Where, as the names suggest, is the value before scaling, and is the median
    of the data distribution; is the value after scaling. and are the 75th quantile
    and 25th quantile of the data distribution, respectively. Two strategies are employed
    for selecting the inputs of ML models. In the first strategy, all zero RS values
    (i.e., nighttime) have been substituted with the daily mean RS value. In this
    strategy, which is called \"mean substitution,\" each input record for the ML
    models has 24 features. To implicitly capture the daylight period, the mean daily
    RS is calculated as the sum of all hourly RS values divided by the number of non-zero
    RS values. This procedure differs from calculating daily RS, where 24 is the denominator.
    As the second strategy, we used feature selection methods to assign quantitative
    feature importance measures to each hour (i.e., each feature). In this strategy,
    only the most essential features are used as the input to train the models. To
    analyze the model performance under different feature selection strategies, we
    used correlation-based (Pearson and Spearman), information-based (Mutual Information),
    and intrinsic (CatBoost) feature selection strategies. To compare the use of hourly
    RS values against coarser temporal resolution inputs, we also tested using daily
    RS as input. In the case of daily Rs, we used a sine function of Julian date as
    the second feature to capture the seasonality. Using a sine function of the Julian
    date has merits over using the raw Julian date, as it can simulate the cyclic
    nature of input records (Eq. 3). (3) Where is the Julian date and is the cyclic
    Julian date value used as the second feature along with daily RS for the daily
    ML models. 3.2.1. Pearson correlation The Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson''s
    \"r\" measures the linear correlation between two data sets or two random variables.
    It is a normalized measure of covariance, and therefore, its value is always between
    −1 and 1, while 1 shows the perfect positive linear correlation and −1 indicates
    the perfect negative linear correlation. When there is no linear correlation between
    the two variables r equals zero. The Pearson correlation of two random variables
    X and Y ( is defined as: (4) Where is the covariance of two variables, and and
    are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively. We used the Pandas library
    in Python to calculate the Pearson correlation. 3.2.2. Spearman correlation Spearman''s
    rank correlation (rs) coefficient is a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank
    statistic that measures the strength of correlation between the ranking of two
    variables (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011). Although the Spearman correlation between
    two variables X and Y is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values
    of those two variables, i.e., R(X) and R(Y), the Spearman correlation is not a
    measure of the linear relationship. Spearman''s coefficient assesses how well
    an arbitrary monotonic function (linear or not) can describe the relationship
    between two variables. Eq. 5 shows how rs is calculated. Like the Pearson correlation,
    rs values are between −1 and 1. We used the Pandas library in Python to calculate
    the Spearman correlation. (5) 3.2.3. Mutual information Mutual information (MI)
    measures how much information about a random variable we can acquire by knowing
    another random variable. MI is a non-negative dimensionless quantity with units
    of information (bits) that quantifies the dependency between two variables. MI
    measures the amount of information gain or uncertainty reduction about one variable
    given knowledge of another. MI is a non-negative measure between 0 and 1. It is
    equal to zero if and only if two random variables are strictly independent, and
    higher values mean higher dependency (Kraskov et al., 2004). In contrast to the
    Pearson correlation coefficient or other linear correlation measures, MI is also
    sensitive to dependencies that do not demonstrate themselves in covariance; therefore,
    it is more generalizable and reliable for feature importance evaluation, especially
    in non-linear contexts like evapotranspiration equations. Detailed information
    about MI can be found in the references (Kozachenko et al., 1987; Kraskov et al.,
    2004; Ross, 2014). We used the Scikit-learn software library in Python to calculate
    MI. 3.2.4. CatBoost feature importance The CatBoost regression model performs
    automatic feature importance analysis on the input data during training. After
    training the model, the relative importance of each input feature can be acquired.
    This measure shows how much, on average, the model prediction changes if the feature
    value changes. Higher feature importance values indicate more significant changes
    to the prediction if the feature value changes. CatBoost feature importance is
    a non-negative value. Feature importance values are normalized so that the sum
    of the importance values of all features is equal to 100. This normalization enables
    a relative assessment of the importance values across various features. For feature
    importance analysis, we chose the hyperparameters of the CatBoost model according
    to outperforming CatBoost models trained on similar datasets on Kaggle, with no
    further hyperparameter tuning. 70% of the data was used to train the model, and
    30% as the test set for model evaluation. More information about the CatBoost
    model is provided in the following sections. We used the catboost library in Python
    to calculate the CatBoost feature importance. 3.3. Machine learning Five ML algorithms
    were chosen to test if only RS data can predict ETO over California. We selected
    highly used and well-known regression algorithms. These algorithms have demonstrated
    superior performance in literature and ML competitions with datasets similar to
    the one used in our study (Zhang et al., 2020). We also used an automatic hyperparameter
    tuning framework to optimize the hyperparameters of the CatBoost algorithm. We
    used this automatic hyperparameter optimization only for CatBoost since CatBoost
    was the best model in our pilot model training, utilizing only a portion of input
    data. Also, according to the literature and ML competition results, CatBoost has
    demonstrated superiority in similar regression problems. Specifically, Zhang et
    al. (2020) showed that the CatBoost model is the most accurate compared to similar
    ML models for daily ETO estimation. 3.3.1. CatBoost CatBoost is an open-source
    gradient-boosted decision tree with widespread applications for classification
    and regression tasks to many data types (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018, Dorogush
    et al., 2018). CatBoost aims to mitigate the challenges of overfitting and target
    leakage through its innovative techniques (Asghari et al., 2023). The algorithm
    introduces two main innovations compared to other gradient-boosted decision trees:
    ordered target statistics and ordered boosting (Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020).
    The term \"ordered target statistics\" refers to the technique CatBoost uses to
    encode categorical variables. \"Ordered boosting\" is a refinement of gradient
    boosting (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). Through this technique, a decision tree
    model is recursively trained on the prediction residuals of data points. This
    approach allows the model to obtain unshifted residuals by applying the current
    model to new training examples at each step, leading to reduced overfitting. The
    main difference between CatBoost and other gradient boosting algorithms like LightGBM
    and XGBoost is that CatBoost uses symmetric or balanced trees. In other words,
    in CatBoost, the splitting condition is consistent across all nodes at the same
    tree depth. Symmetric trees are faster to train and less prone to overfitting.
    Nevertheless, symmetric trees are weaker learners than asymmetric trees, and therefore,
    they generally make worse predictions. However, as the main idea of gradient boosting
    is to combine numerous weak learners to make predictions, the CatBoost algorithm
    tends to make more accurate predictions than LightGBM and XGBoost in several cases.
    Detailed information about the CatBoost algorithm can be found in Prokhorenkova
    et al. (2018). We used the CatBoost package in Python to develop the CatBoost
    model. We employed Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework for automatic
    hyperparameter tuning of the CatBoost model (Akiba et al., 2019). Optuna allows
    users to dynamically construct the hyperparameter search space by offering a define-by-run
    API. Optuna has a user-friendly setup, and it provides efficient sampling and
    pruning algorithms for customization. Detailed information about Optuna and its
    algorithm can be found in Akiba et al. (2019). We did not use the test set in
    automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure our ML models'' generalizability and
    avoid data leakage in our study. Instead, we utilized a cross-validation set consisting
    of 16 stations from the training data, where each represents a distinct climatic
    zone. This cross-validation set mimics the unseen test set. With Optuna, we conducted
    100 trials to optimize the CatBoost model hyperparameters. 3.3.2. Deep neural
    network The feed-forward neural network is the ancestor of all deep learning architectures.
    Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-known and well-studied architectures with
    innumerable applications as predictive regression models and are commonplace in
    ET prediction and forecasting (Kumar et al., 2002, Kim and Kim, 2008). Although
    gradient-boosted algorithms, such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, are generally
    considered more suitable for tabular datasets (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022), such
    as the dataset used in our study, we also included a deep neural network (DNN)
    algorithm in our models to assess its performance relative to other methods. We
    used the TensorFlow library in Python to build our DNN model. Our model has three
    hidden layers with 16, 32, and 16 units, respectively. The activation function
    of input and hidden layers is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Mean Squared Error
    (MSE) is the loss function of the network. Ridge Regression (L2) and Lasso Regression
    (L1) are used as kernel and activity regularizers, respectively, with a regularization
    parameter of 0.01. The model uses Adam optimizer and is trained over 30 epochs
    with a batch size of 64. 3.3.3. LightGBM LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine),
    originally proposed by Ke et al. (2017) and developed by Microsoft as a free and
    open-source framework, efficiently implements the gradient boosting algorithm
    and reduces memory usage. Gradient boosting is an ensemble method where ensembles
    are constructed from decision trees. Models are fit through a gradient descent
    optimization algorithm, where the loss gradient is minimized as the model is tuned
    (Brownlee, 2020). We used the LightGBM package in Python to develop the LightGBM
    model. We used a maximum of 30 tree leaves and a maximum of 7 tree depths for
    base learners. We used 2000 boosted trees to fit. More information about the LightGBM
    method can be found in Ke et al. (2017) and Al Daoud (2019). 3.3.4. Random forest
    Random forest (RF) is a supervised learning algorithm used to solve classification
    and regression problems. RF is a bagging technique that trains many decision trees
    in parallel, and its results are based on an ensemble of the trained trees. When
    used as a regression model, RF returns the mean or average prediction of the individual
    trees as the model''s output. Detailed information about the RF algorithm can
    be found in the references (Ho, 1995, Breiman, 2001). We used the Scikit-learn
    software library in Python to build the RF model. We used 1000 trees in the forest,
    with a maximum depth of 9. 3.3.5. XGBoost XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
    is an open-source gradient-boosting software library. XGBoost provides a parallel
    tree boosting (also known as gradient-boosted decision trees) that efficiently
    solves classification and regression problems. More information about the XGBoost
    model can be found in the references (Chen et al., 2015, Chen and Guestrin, 2016).
    We used the XGBoost library in Python to build the XGBoost model. We used 1000
    trees in the ensemble, with minimum depth and maximum leaves of 7 and 9, respectively.
    The learning rate was set to 0.3. 3.4. Empirical models We evaluated the performance
    of our input-limited data-driven approach against available input-limited alternatives
    for ETO estimation. Three well-known and reliable methods were chosen for this
    aim: a radiation-based method (i.e., Priestley-Taylor), a temperature-based method
    (i.e., Hargreaves-Samani), and a mass transfer-based method (i.e., Romanenko).
    Although none of these methods eliminate the need for a standard reference surface
    and their meteorological inputs rely on the measurement conditions, the comparison
    between SolarET and the methods is beneficial as they are well-established, widely-used
    procedures for ETO estimation. 3.4.1. Priestley-Taylor As shown in Eq. 1, the
    P-M equation consists of a radiation term and an aerodynamic term, where the latter
    groups the elements that represent the surface-atmosphere interactions (Pereira,
    2004). By analyzing data collected over various surfaces, Priestley and Taylor
    (1972) proposed an empirical adjustment to the P-M equation (Mallick et al., 2014).
    The Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation neglects the aerodynamic term and corrects
    the estimated ET by a dimensionless coefficient α (the Priestley-Taylor parameter).
    This coefficient accounts for the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and air and
    surface resistances to estimate the ET from a short, well-watered grass surface.
    Experimental results from several sites worldwide resulted in an average value
    of α=1.26. We use this value in this research. Pereira (2004) states that 1.26
    is a good estimate for α in Davis, California. Eq. 6 depicts how the PT method
    calculates ETO: (6) Where is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve
    ( ℃ ), is the psychrometric constant ( ℃ ), is the latent heat of vaporization
    (2.45 ), is the net radiation ( ), and is the soil heat flux ( ). The Δ over Δ+γ
    represents the fraction of diabatic energy (Rn - G) contributing to ET from the
    grass surface, and the adiabatic contribution to ET is approximately 26% of the
    diabatic contribution. The daily ground heat flux is assumed to be G=0. 3.4.2.
    Hargreaves-Samani Hargreaves-Samani (HS) is an input-limited empirical equation
    to estimate ETO using air temperature and extraterrestrial radiation (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985). This equation is based on the Hargreaves original equation,
    approximating solar radiation with extraterrestrial radiation and maximum minus
    minimum air temperature. Since the HS equation is developed with daily lysimeter
    data from Davis, California, it is well-suited for and highly used in California,
    which makes it a good benchmark for validating our approach. The HS equation is
    as follows: (7) Where is reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), is the extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm/day, for equivalent evaporated water depth), , , and are the mean,
    maximum, and minimum daily air temperature (ºC), respectively. Since data from
    Davis, California, is used to calibrate the constant value of 0.0023, we use the
    same value in this research. 3.4.3. Romanenko Romanenko equation is a mass transfer-based
    empirical equation that uses air temperature and relative humidity to estimate
    ETO. The mass transfer-based methods are essentially based on Dalton''s gas law
    and employ the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface
    to the atmosphere (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017). Romanenko equation estimates daily
    ETO as follows: (8) Where RH is the relative humidity (%). 3.5. Performance measures
    In this study, two deterministic performance measures are employed to investigate
    the accuracy of ETO estimation models: root mean square error (RMSE) and mean
    absolute error (MAE) (Moriasi et al., 2015): (9) (10) Where N is the number of
    samples, and and are observed and predicted ETO values at ith sample, respectively.
    Lower RMSE and MAE values indicate higher accuracies and better performance. Although
    both RMSE and MAE indicate average model prediction error in units of the variable
    of interest, they have fundamental differences. Since RMSE squares the errors
    before averaging them, it gives higher weights to large errors. Consequently,
    RMSE tends to penalize large errors more severely than MAE. According to Chai
    and Draxler (2014), each of these metrics has its own merits in explaining the
    model performance; therefore, in this research, we use them in tandem. 4. Results
    and discussion 4.1. Data investigation Fig. 2 shows the number of data samples
    and the training data distribution for each climatic zone. This figure shows that
    zones 14, 6, and 12 have the highest number of stations and input data samples
    in the training set. On the other hand, there is no data from zone 4 in the training
    set, as all the samples from this zone have been eliminated in the data preprocessing.
    However, zone 4 is present in the test set. This can further evaluate the generalizability
    of the presented methodology for ETO estimation in unseen locations in California.
    Zones 12 and 14 cover a vast area of the Central Valley. The Central Valley is
    one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world, with ideal soil
    and climate for a variety of crops but limited water resources. With limited to
    no rainfall in the summer, the Central Valley''s agriculture relies on irrigation.
    About one-sixth of the US irrigated land lies in the Central Valley (Reilly et
    al., 2008). This heavy irrigation dependence explains this region''s high density
    of CIMIS stations. Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Number of samples, stations, and distribution of the training
    data for each climatic zone. Fig. 2 suggests a relatively uniform distribution
    of solar radiation across California, with lower values in coastal zones (e.g.,
    zones 1 and 2) and higher values in deserts (e.g., zones 17 and 18). The lower
    RS values on the coast can be attributed to dense fog. The ETO distribution in
    California reveals more variability across different zones. The most anomalous
    zones in terms of ETO distribution are coastal zones with very low ETO and desert
    zones with very high ETO. Also, the box plots of Fig. 2 illustrate a broader ETO
    distribution for desert zones. Being abnormal regarding RS and ETO distribution
    and having fewer input data, we hypothesize that our data-driven models struggle
    with accurate ETO prediction in coastal and desert zones. 4.2. Feature selection
    The results of the feature selection methods are presented in Fig. 3, which suggests
    no sharp difference between the features'' importance, especially from Pearson
    and Spearman correlations. As expected, all feature selection methods find the
    hourly RS values from morning and around noon to be the most important features.
    Based on these results, we decided to use the six most essential features/hours
    as the input of the ML models. For example, the six most important hourly Rs values
    selected by the CatBoost feature importance method are 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, and 12,
    respectively (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The most important features (i.e., solar radiation from
    different hours of the day) selected by each feature selection method and their
    corresponding score. It should be noted that both Pearson and MI methods result
    in hours 8–13 of Rs as the six most important features, only with various orders.
    Therefore, the results for Pearson and MI methods are the same and combined hereafter.
    Because different methods suggest a uniform feature importance, we hypothesize
    that the mean substitution procedure (i.e., using all hourly RS values) might
    be superior to using only selected features as input. 4.3. Machine learning models
    The overall performance of the ML models and feature selection methods is depicted
    in Fig. 4 and Figure A1 in the appendix. As these figures show, CatBoost and RF
    have very similar performances in terms of prediction accuracy. It should be noted
    that while Optuna has automatically optimized the CatBoost model''s hyperparameters,
    RF hyperparameters are set manually. This would suggest that automatic hyperparameter
    tuning for this type of regression problem does not guarantee higher accuracy,
    and a manual hyperparameter tuning strategy can result in equally accurate models.
    Also, most of the available automatic hyperparameter tuning frameworks, including
    Optuna, are specifically designed to optimize the hyperparameters of deep learning
    architectures, where the high dimensionality of the hyperparameter space interferes
    with manual hyperparameter tuning strategies like grid or random search and might
    result in sub-efficient models (Akiba et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res

    using all the hourly RS values with the mean substitution method over selecting
    the most important hours. Among feature selection methods, ML models using CatBoost
    intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation perform better than MI and
    Pearson correlation. The quality and relevance of the selected features can influence
    the performance of ML models. In our case, the difference in performance between
    the feature selection methods can be attributed to 1) the ability to handle non-linear
    relationships: ML models can effectively capture non-linear relationships between
    features and the target variable. In this case, CatBoost''s intrinsic feature
    importance considers the inherent non-linear relationship between the input and
    output of the model and selects features that have the highest impact on the model''s
    performance. 2) Robustness to outliers and noise: These observations can also
    be attributed to CatBoost intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation''s
    more effective robustness to outliers than Pearson correlation and Mutual Information
    correlation. Considering the rank-based correlation in Spearman''s correlation
    or the model-specific feature importance in CatBoost, these methods may have selected
    more robust features that lead to better model performance. Using feature selection
    or mean substitution, the CatBoost model with the mean substitution method stands
    out as the most accurate hourly model. Additionally, the RF excels as the preferred
    choice between daily models. We compare these models as the best-performing frameworks
    with empirical ETO estimation models. Fig. 4 and A1 clearly show that the DNN
    model falls behind all ensemble decision tree-based algorithms (i.e., RF and gradient
    boosting-based frameworks). This finding agrees with previous studies where tree-based
    algorithms outperformed vanilla neural networks in predictive regression problems
    (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015, Pham et al., 2020; Jun, 2021). To better understand
    how SolarET performs in different climatic zones of California, we included one
    CIMIS station with around five years of data from each zone. These stations have
    not been used to train the model; therefore, SolarET''s performance in these locations
    can be claimed as its performance in any arbitrary location in those climatic
    zones. Fig. 5 and A2 depict the models'' accuracy for each zone in the test set.
    These results clearly show that the performance of various ML models and feature
    selection methods is similar in each climatic zone. In other words, we cannot
    claim that a specific combination of the ML model and feature selection technique
    is more suitable for a geographical location or particular climatic characteristics.
    All successful prediction frameworks (i.e., ensemble decision tree-based algorithms)
    have lower accuracies in estimating ETO in coastal (zones 1 and 2) and desert
    (zones 17 and 18) areas (Fig. 5 and A2). Download : Download high-res image (444KB)

    (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods over climatic
    zones of California. From an ML perspective, three reasons might contribute to
    the lower accuracy of SolarET in the coastal and desert regions: 1) the low number
    of training data from these zones: Fig. 2 shows limited training data in these
    zones- leading to their insufficient representation of data patterns. Other zones
    also have low numbers of training samples but high predictive accuracy (e.g.,
    zones 16, 13, and 10). Although, these zones are more similar to the majority
    of the training set in terms of ETO distribution (Fig. 2). Therefore, we hypothesize
    that the first reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in the coast and
    desert data is the low number of training samples resembling the statistical characteristics
    of the data from these zones. 2) Higher level of outlier values in both training
    and test sets: As depicted in Fig. 6, there is a higher percentage of outlier
    values in stations 17 and 18 compared to other stations, which could impact the
    performance of the ML models in these specific zones. These outliers introduce
    noise and may not follow the patterns that the ML models have learned from the
    training data, leading to less accurate predictions. 3) Lack of relevant features:
    According to Fig. 7, we hypothesize that one of the other reasons for less accurate
    predictions in zones 17 and 18 is the lower correlation between the daily RS and
    ETO in these regions. Various climatic variables, such as temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation influence ETO. In zones 17 and 18, hourly or daily
    solar radiation may not accurately capture all the required information to estimate
    ETO. All in all, it is worth mentioning that the combination of these reasons,
    rather than a single factor, may have led to inferior performance of the ML models
    in these zones. It is also expected that advection is a more considerable contribution
    to ETO in desert regions than in the Central Valley or along the coast, and the
    lack of information on temperature, humidity, and wind speed in the ML models
    should lead to more considerable errors in regions having large fluctuations in
    aerodynamic contributions to ETO (Berengena and Gavilán, 2005). Download : Download

    evapotranspiration prediction To evaluate our approach of using ML models with
    only pyranometer data for ETO estimation, we compared its performance against
    three empirical limited-input ETO estimation models. It should be noted that both
    approaches, ML and empirical models, were evaluated using the same test set but
    with different features. Fig. 8 and A3 depict the findings of this comparison
    over 17 climatic zones of the test set. In these figures, we displayed the results
    of only the best-performing data-driven models. In the case of hourly inputs,
    the CatBoost ML model with mean substitution is the best, and in the case of daily
    inputs, the random forest model gives the highest accuracy (Fig. 4 and A1). Download

    Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for empirical models and SolarET over climatic
    zones of California. As seen in Fig. 8 and A3, our hourly model generally works
    as well or even better than the most accurate empirical model (i.e., Priestley-Taylor).
    This is especially important as our model takes only solar radiation data as input,
    while PT takes information from minimum and maximum air temperature and elevation
    in addition to net radiation. Also, our hourly and daily models clearly beat Hargreaves-Samani
    and Romanenko in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest that SolarET
    works very well unless there are extremely high or low contributions of aerodynamics
    to the ETO (e.g., desert and coastal climates). This is not surprising, as SolarET
    can only mimic the radiation term of the P-M equation, as it takes no information
    about the aerodynamics term (Eq. 1). Still, Fig. 8 and A3 illustrate that SolarET
    works better than PT as a radiation-based ET estimation model in desert climates.
    The inferior performance of SolarET in comparison to PT in coastal regions might
    be due to the high humidity fluctuation in these regions due to variations in
    wind direction, e.g., from the land or from the ocean, which lead to significant
    variations in temperature and humidity. Moreover, the presence of intermittent
    clouds and fog in these regions might be another reason for the lower accuracy
    of our model as opposed to PT. The low accuracy of empirical models in desert
    climate might be due to two reasons: 1) these models are not calibrated for desert
    climate (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985, Tabari et al.,
    2013); and 2) these models do not adequately account for heat advection in hot
    desert climates (Tolk et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2023). We hypothesize that another
    reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in deserts and coast is not accounting
    for aridity. This pattern is the same for PT and HS in desert regions. This goes
    along with not considering the aerodynamics contribution to the daily ETO. We
    hypothesize that adding information about vapor pressure can solve this problem.
    Fig. 9 analyzes the performance of SolarET against available empirical alternatives
    over the entire test set in terms of prediction accuracy. RMSE and MAE measure
    the dissimilarity between input-limited alternatives and P-M equation prediction.
    We use these performance measures to assess which input-limited ETO estimation
    alternative can simulate the daily P-M equation more realistically. As Fig. 9
    demonstrates, our hourly and daily models beat all empirical alternatives in terms
    of similarity to the P-M daily ETO. Our hourly model is the winner of this comparison.
    Although the overall performance of the hourly model is close to the daily model
    according to Fig. 9, as Fig. 8 depicts, the hourly model results in identical
    or more accurate predictions for all climatic zones. Interestingly, the hourly
    model works much better than the daily model in coastal regions (zones 1, 2, and
    3 in Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the information gained from the higher
    temporal resolution input (i.e., hourly Rs) is beneficial in simulating climatically
    diverse samples and can boost generalizability. Download : Download high-res image

    and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values for empirical models and SolarET over the
    entire test set. Fig. 9 shows that the PT equation, which is a radiation-based
    model, is the most accurate empirical ETO estimation model. The superiority of
    SolarET and the high accuracy of the PT model signifies the suitability of radiation
    data for input-limited ETO estimation in California. This finding agrees with
    Ahmadi et al. (2022) findings on the high correlation between radiation and ETO
    over California. Fig. 9 illustrates that HS and Romanenko models are the least
    realistic representations of P-M ETO over California. However, it should be noted
    that since we aim to compare not only the accuracy but also the generalizability
    of models, the HS model was not calibrated in this study. We hypothesize that
    calibrating HS will improve its accuracy in ETO estimation. Analyzing the errors
    of the ML and empirical models can provide valuable insights into their performance
    and help identify areas for improvement. In this vein, we divided the ETO distribution
    into distinct ranges and compared the best-performing ML model, CatBoost, using
    hourly Rs, with the PT empirical model. Fig. 10 illustrates the percentage of
    values within each specific ETO range where the value of exceeds 0.5. In this
    equation, Refers to P-M value and is what the model predicts. This figure indicates
    the more accurate predictions of CatBoost compared to PT across various ranges
    of ETO values. Overall, CatBoost maintains its superiority not only in the whole
    distribution of ETO over the entire test set but also in cases of low or high
    values of ETO. Moreover, as Figure A4 in the appendix shows, the distribution
    of SolarET error is similar to a Gaussian distribution with a mean value close
    to zero. This distribution suggests the error is random, not a systematic over-
    or under-estimation of ETO. It is also worth mentioning that SolarET accuracy
    is comparable to the best-performing ML-based ETO estimation models available
    in the literature, while it does not use surface-related inputs such as air temperature
    (Chen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download : Download

    5. Summary and conclusion This paper develops a generalizable data-driven approach
    to estimate ETO using only solar radiation data. Since solar radiation is the
    only driving force of ETO, whose measurement does not require a reference crop
    surface, the developed approach (i.e., SolarET) can cut the cost of land, irrigation,
    maintenance, and extra sensors while assisting irrigators and water managers with
    their farm-level and regional decisions. As incoming solar radiation is not a
    function of the surface, a simple pyranometer placed on any location can measure
    the inputs of SolarET. Using a test set from unseen arbitrary locations, we showed
    the generalizability of SolarET over California. Our findings reveal that SolarET
    beats the Hargraves-Samani and Romanenko models in terms of accuracy. SolarET
    works better than Priestley-Taylor, a well-known radiation-based ETO estimation
    method, without using any information about air temperature. Although SolarET
    works accurately in heavily irrigated regions of California and beats all empirical
    models in desert climates, it is less accurate in coastal regions. Future studies
    can include publicly available air temperature data as another input, along with
    measured solar radiation. Adding publicly available air temperature data can result
    in better performance in coastal and desert regions, where the contribution of
    the aerodynamics term of the Penman-Monteith equation is different from other
    inland regions of California. Moreover, developing models tailored to a specific
    region or climate might result in higher accuracies but at the cost of lower generalizability.
    The accuracy-generalizability trade-off of this data-driven approach is another
    area for future research. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mohammad Hossein

    is the most produced and utilized natural fiber worldwide. It is not only an important
    raw material for the development of the textile industry but also an oil crop
    and fine chemical raw material. As the largest producer and consumer of cotton
    in the world, China plays an important role in global cotton production, consumption,
    and trade. Cotton is one of the most important cash crops in China, and it is
    directly related to the national economy and people’s livelihood. Additionally,
    cotton cultivation is closely related to irrigation and also has a serious impact
    on total nitrogen emissions during the growing season. Xinjiang is the largest
    cotton producer in China, but it is located in an arid and semiarid region with
    severe water scarcity. Moreover, global warming intensifies and accelerates potential
    evaporation from crop surfaces, so a decline in the availability of soil moisture
    to plants is obvious, and indirectly, the agricultural water demand has increased
    [1]. With the development of society, the increase in water consumption in industries
    and domestically has led to a decrease in the available water for agriculture,
    exacerbates the supply–demand contradiction of agricultural water use, and seriously
    affects the sustainable development of agriculture [2]. In addition, the flowering
    and boll stage is the most highly sensitive period of cotton to water and fertilizer
    demand, and it is also a period of centralized irrigation for cotton. Optimizing
    the irrigation scheduling strategy, managing water resources intensively and efficiently,
    and improving cotton water productivity are urgent challenges to be solved in
    arid and semiarid agriculture regions [3]. Therefore, accurately measuring and
    analyzing the spatial distribution characteristics of early cotton is a basic
    prerequisite of agricultural water management and optimization in Xinjiang in
    order to provide strong support for the adjustment of regional economic structure,
    industrial structure, and water resource scheduling. Traditional information about
    crop planting area, yield, and other data is mainly obtained by on-the-spot sampling
    survey methods, and then those reports are gathered and submitted step-by-step,
    which is not suitable for large-scale surveillance of agriculture information.
    However, such investigations involve a tremendous amount of work, lack quality
    control, and cannot provide spatial distribution information, making it difficult
    to meet the needs of modern management and decision-making. Satellite remote sensing,
    as an advanced detection technique for the recognition of ground objects, can
    obtain real-time information on a large scale from ground objects and has played
    an important role in cotton recognition [4,5]. With the steady development of
    sensor performance, cotton recognition has evolved from lower spatial resolution
    and multispectral remote sensing image data [6,7,8] to high spatial resolution
    and hyperspectral remote sensing imagery [9,10], and its recognition degree and
    accuracy are constantly improving. Moreover, although the recognition and accuracy
    of images obtained by drones equipped with cameras are very high [11], and the
    sampling time can be flexibly controlled, the observation range is smaller than
    satellite remote sensing, the cost of field operations is high, and large-scale
    surveillance of agriculture information requires a long cycle, making it unsuitable
    for early crop recognition. In recent years, experts and scholars have conducted
    extensive research on the extraction of cotton planting areas based on multitemporal
    or multi-source remote sensing image data [12,13]. Although it can achieve good
    recognition results, the recognition process is complex, and early identification
    of cotton remote sensing cannot be completed in time. Moreover, the interference
    of cloud cover and rather long revisiting cycles of high-resolution satellite
    exists, making it difficult to obtain multitemporal remote-sensing data during
    the cotton growth period, which brings many difficulties to the research of cotton
    recognition [14]. At present, various classification methods based on pixels or
    objects have been used for remote-sensing recognition of crops [15], such as the
    maximum likelihood method [16], nearest neighbor sampling method [17], spectral
    angle mapping method [18], decision tree algorithm [19], ear cap transformation
    method [20], support vector machine [21], random forest [22], neural network [23],
    and biomimetic algorithm [24]. For example, Ji Xusheng et al. [25] compared the
    recognition accuracy of different algorithms based on single high-resolution remote
    sensing images from specific time periods: SPOT-6 (May), Pleiades-1 (September),
    and WorldView-3 (October). With the rapid development of remote-sensing information
    deep excavation and information extraction technology, a series of crop classification
    algorithms and studies that do not rely on field sampling have also been carried
    out [26,27,28]. MARIANA et al. [29] used pixel-based and object-based time-weighted
    dynamic time to identify crop planting areas based on sentinel2 images, and this
    type of algorithm is becoming increasingly mature. Deep learning methods have
    been extensively used to extract valuable information due to their ability to
    extract multiple features of remote sensing images and to discover more subtle
    differences, as well as their high training efficiency and classification accuracy
    and the ability to reduce significant spectral differences within similar ground
    objects (such as “same object but different spectra” and “foreign object with
    the same spectrum” phenomena) [30]. Research has shown that convolutional neural
    networks (CNN) have powerful feature learning and expression capabilities [31].
    Zhang Jing et al. [32] used drones to obtain RGB images of six densities of cotton
    fields and expanded the dataset using data augmentation technology. Different
    neural network models (VGGNet16, GoogleNet, MobileNetV2) were used to identify
    and classify cotton fields with different densities, with recognition accuracy
    rates exceeding 90%. However, under the higher-yield-technique mode of mechanized
    farming in Xinjiang, the plant spacing between plants and rows is unified. The
    classification of density does not have practical significance unless there is
    a lack of seedlings due to disasters. The existing high-resolution temporal and
    spatial research projects of cotton recognition and area extraction mostly focus
    on the comprehensive utilization of medium-resolution multitemporal images [33,34].
    There is little research on remote-sensing image recognition of a single period
    or critical period in cotton growth, especially in early cotton based on high-resolution
    remote-sensing images. Moreover, in large-scale cotton operations, the advantages
    of object-oriented analysis and design methods of early recognition in high-resolution
    images are not clear, and further research and exploration are needed. DeepLabV3+
    network is a CNN that can be used for pixel-level object detection. Due to the
    performance in locating objects in images with complex backgrounds, this type
    of method has been widely applied in the field of agriculture [35,36]. In this
    study, an improved DeepLab V3+ network method for cotton high-resolution remote
    sensing recognition has been proposed, termed DAM (double attention mechanism),
    to recognize cotton. By adding a DAM module, it is possible to highlight the important
    parts of channels and spaces in the recognition results, thereby improving the
    precision of the recognition results. Furthermore, the red edge band can effectively
    monitor the growth status of vegetation. GF-6 satellite is the first multispectral
    remote sensing satellite in China to be equipped with a red edge band alone. The
    monitoring capabilities of satellites for resources such as agriculture, forestry,
    and grasslands can be improved. Improving the classification accuracy of paddy
    crops and enhancing crop recognition capabilities by red edge information, purple
    band, and yellow band showed the GF-6 satellite had broad application prospects
    in the precise identification and area extraction of crops. Given the outstanding
    performance on recognition in the field of agriculture by using the DeepLab V3+
    network and GF-6 images recently, we considered applying this improved DeepLabV3+
    network structure on cotton field identification and compare the results with
    other models to see its performance at identifying the cotton field. The purpose
    of this study is to provide a fast and efficient method for the early large-scale
    identification and distribution of cotton, better serving the critical irrigation
    period of cotton in arid and semiarid regions and providing a good decision-making
    basis for water-saving irrigation policies in arid and semiarid regions. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Study Area Shihezi Reclamation Area in Xinjiang (E84°58′–86°24′,
    N43°26′–45°20′) is located in the middle of the northern foot of the Tianshan
    Mountains, in the south of the Junggar Basin and connected to Gurbantunggut Desert
    in the north, with a total area of 5.851 × 109 m3 (Figure 1). The terrain, from
    south to north, is divided into the Tianshan Mountains, piedmont hilly areas,
    piedmont inclined plains, flood alluvial plains, and aeolian desert areas, with
    an average elevation of 450.8 m. The soil is mostly composed of gray desert soil,
    fluvo-aquic soil, and meadow soil. The soil is mainly composed of gravel soil,
    sandy soil, clay soil, etc. Winter is long and cold, and summer is short and hot,
    with an annual average temperature of 7.5–8.2 °C, 2318–2732 h of sunshine, 147–191
    days of frost-free period, 180–270 mm of annual rainfall, and 1000–1500 mm of
    annual evaporation. Atmospheric water resources (water vapor resources and cloud
    water resources) are relatively less compared to other regions in China, and the
    climate is arid, belonging to a typical temperate continental climate. There are
    rivers and springs on the surface, as well as three rivers, including the Manas
    River, Jingou River, and Bayingou River, within the territory. The water source
    of drip irrigation for cotton fields is “groundwater plus canal water”. Figure
    1. The location of the study area and distribution map of field sampling points.
    2.2. Data Sources GF-6 is a low-orbit optical remote-sensing satellite. As China’s
    first precision agriculture high-resolution observation satellite, the high-resolution
    camera (PMS) uses a TDICCD detector that combines panchromatic and blue (450–520
    nm), green (520–600 nm), red (630–690 nm), and near-infrared (760–900 nm) spectra
    with a panchromatic resolution of 2 m and a multispectral resolution of 8 m. Both
    panchromatic and multispectral systems share the same optical system, and interference
    filters are used for spectral analysis. Both push-sweep widths are 95 km, with
    a spectral range of 450–900 nm. The data is downloaded from the China Resources
    Satellite Application Center Network (https://www.cresda.com/zgzywxyyzx/index.html
    (accessed on 20 June 2022, 28 June 2022)). Collect GF-6 satellite PMS image data
    on 20 June 2022 (Jing No. 549536), 20 June (Jing No. 549537), and 28 June (Jing
    No. 552234), covering the entire study area during the cotton flowering period.
    2.3. Data Processing Image preprocessing includes five parts: radiometric calibration,
    atmospheric correction, orthophoto correction, data fusion, and sample labeling.
    Firstly, radiation calibration, atmospheric correction, and orthophoto correction
    are performed on multispectral data, while atmospheric correction is not performed
    on panchromatic data. Secondly, by fusing the preprocessing panchromatic and multispectral
    images, the image resolution can reach up to 2 m. Next, band synthesis is performed,
    and texture features are extracted using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).
    Then, select representative desert oasis transition zones, urban areas, plantations,
    and various terrain mixed areas within the image for cotton labeling and generate
    a binary vector layer with ID 2 (cotton) and ID 1 (non-cotton). Finally, convert
    the vector layer into a grid layer and crop it (Figure 2). This study utilizes
    image rotation and image flipping to enhance data and increase samples in the
    training set. Figure 2. Distribution map of visual interpretation samples. 2.4.
    Model and Parameter DeepLabV3+ combines the advantages of the EnCoder-Decoder
    (ED) structure and the Atrus Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. To make the
    model more suitable for identification of cotton, this paper has made the following
    improvements on the basis of DeepLabV3+, changing the backbone network (Xception
    network) to a more lightweight MobileNet V2 network. Secondly, in order to increase
    the sensitivity of the model to the cotton planting area, AM (attention mechanism)
    was added to the ASPP module and upsampling layer. The network architecture diagram
    of the DeepLabV3+ semantic segmentation model based on the attention mechanism
    is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Network architecture diagram of DeepLab V3+ semantic
    segmentation model based on attention mechanism. MobileNet V2 can learn more complex
    features with fewer parameters and lower computational costs compared to traditional
    convolutional networks. Simultaneously, having an inverted residual structure
    helps to increase the network’s representation ability while maintaining its efficiency
    [37]. Visual attention is an inherent mechanism that plays an important role in
    human visual perception. As our visual system has limited capacity and cannot
    efficiently process the information from the entire visual field, we focus our
    attention on specific areas of interest in the image and utilize local observation
    to focus on the prominent parts for detailed analysis of these areas. In recent
    years, many experts and scholars have added attention mechanisms to network models
    to improve recognition performance [38,39]. The DAM is a combination of a spatial
    attention module and a channel attention module. By adding a DAM module, it is
    possible to highlight the important parts of channels and spaces in the recognition
    results, thereby improving the precision of the recognition results [35]. The
    DAM structure diagram is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Schematic diagram of DAM
    structure. The spatial attention module can highlight the spatial position distribution
    that is important for recognition in the convolutional layer. By performing channel
    compression on the input feature map F through global average pooling and global
    maximum pooling, 𝐹 𝑠 𝑎𝑣𝑔 and 𝐹 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are obtained respectively. After merging
    two feature maps, the dimensionality is reduced to 1 channel through a 7 × 7 convolution
    operation. Then, the weight map of spatial attention is generated through the
    Sigmoid function, and the generated weight map is multiplied by the original feature
    map (F) to obtain the spatial attention weighted map ( 𝐹 𝑆𝑜𝑢𝑡 ). Its formula is
    as follows: 𝐹 𝑆𝑜𝑢𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑓 7×7 ( 𝐹 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ⊕ 𝐹 𝑠 𝑎𝑣𝑔 ))⊗𝐹 (1) In the equation, σ represents
    the sigmoid function, f7 × 7 represents the convolution of 7 × 7, ⊕ represents
    channel merging, and ⊗ represents element multiplication. The channel attention
    module can highlight channels of significant value for recognition in the convolutional
    layer. By compressing the spatial dimensions of the feature map (F) through global
    average pooling and global maximum pooling, 𝐹 𝑠 𝑎𝑣𝑔 and 𝐹 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are obtained.
    Then, input Fmaxc and Favgc into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), add the obtained
    results, and input the sigmoid function to generate the weight of the channel
    attention. Multiply the generated weight with the original feature map (F) to
    obtain the channel attention-weighted map ( 𝐹 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡 ). Its formula is as follows:
    𝐹 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡 =𝜎((𝑀𝐿𝑃( 𝐹 𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑥 )+𝑀𝐿𝑃( 𝐹 𝑐 𝑎𝑣𝑔 ))⊗𝐹# (2) In the equation, σ represents
    the sigmoid function, MLP represents the multi-layer perceptron, ⊕ represents
    channel merging, and ⊗ represents element multiplication. 2.5. Feature Set Construction
    2.5.1. Vegetation Index Features The vegetation index has regional and temporal
    characteristics, which are influenced by various factors such as atmospheric conditions,
    surrounding environment, lighting conditions, and vegetation growth. It also varies
    depending on the season or surrounding environment. Due to the values of the Normalized
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) being between [−1,1], it can avoid inconvenience in subsequent
    data calculations and partially mitigate the effects caused by factors such as
    terrain, cloud shadows, solar altitude angle, and satellite observation angle.
    The ratio vegetation index (RVI) has a high correlation with the leaf area index
    and chlorophyll content and can be used to distinguish different crops. The difference
    vegetation index (DVI), also known as the environmental vegetation index, is extremely
    sensitive to changes in the environment. Therefore, attempts were made to identify
    cotton using NDVI, RVI, and DVI (Table 1). Table 1. Vegetation index based on
    image band operation. 2.5.2. Texture Features Texture feature is an inherent feature
    of an image, which reflects the properties and spatial relationships of the grayscale
    of the image. It accurately reflects the real structure of ground objects through
    the frequency of color tone changes in the image. The presence of differences
    in canopy structure among different crops is an important classification feature
    for crop recognition [40]. Based on the fused 4-band data of GF-6 PMS, the principle
    of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) proposed by Haralick is introduced to
    extract texture features. The eight texture feature parameters include entropy
    (ENT), mean (MEA), variance (VAR), contrast (CON), homogeneity (HOM), second moment
    (ASM), correlation (COR), and dissimilarity (DIS) [41]. In calculation, the parameters
    involved are the window size, direction, step length, etc. 2.5.3. Feature Combination
    In order to compare the recognition accuracy of different models and the recognition
    accuracy using only the 4-band features and full features under the DeepLabV3+
    network attention mechanism model, the following experiments were conducted, and
    their recognition accuracy was compared (Table 2). Table 2. Model and feature
    set combination. 2.6. Model Performance Evaluation Indicators The semantic segmentation
    performance evaluation indicators can be used to compare the recognition results.
    There are many indicators commonly used to evaluate the performance of model training
    processes, such as Pixel Accuracy (PA), Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), Precision,
    Recall, F1_Score, Intersection over Union, IoU, etc. This paper uses MIoU and
    cross-entropy loss function as evaluation indicators. IoU is used to evaluate
    the overlap between each class and the real label in the semantically segmented
    image. The confusion matrix (CM) of identification results is shown in Table 3.
    The calculation formula is 𝐼𝑜𝑈=𝑇𝑃/(𝐹𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑃) (6) Table 3. Identification result
    confusion matrix. TP and TN with predicted values consistent with actual values;
    FP, FN with inconsistent predicted and true values. MIoU calculates the mean of
    all classes of IoU using the following formula: 𝑀𝐼𝑜𝑈= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑖𝐼𝑜𝑈 (7) Binary
    cross entropy is a loss function commonly used in machine learning modules to
    evaluate the quality of a binary classification prediction result. Its formula
    is 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠=− 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑝( 𝑦 𝑖 ))+(1− 𝑦 𝑖 ) 𝑙𝑜𝑔(1−𝑝( 𝑦 𝑖 )) (8) where y
    is the binary label 0 or 1, and 𝑝(𝑦) is the probability that the output belongs
    to the y label. For the case where label y is 1, if the predicted value 𝑝(𝑦) approaches
    1, then the value of the loss function approaches 0. On the contrary, its value
    is very large, which is very consistent with the properties of the log function.
    2.7. Model Parameter Settings The parameters of the DeepLabV3+ network attention
    mechanism model used in this paper are shown in Table 4: Table 4. Model configuration
    parameters. Batch size represents the data volume input into GPU graphics memory
    each time. Epoch represents the number of iterations after a complete traversal
    during deep learning model training. Through continuous attempts, the model achieves
    satisfactory results when Epoch is 100 in this paper. The Adam optimizer function
    is used as the parameter optimizer. Using a dynamically decaying learning rate
    and the StepLR function provided in the PyTorch model, the initial learning rate
    is set to 0.01, step size is set to 10, and gamma is set to 0.1. This indicates
    that the learning rate decreases to 0.1 times the original after every 10 iterations
    (Figure 5). In this paper, horizontal and vertical flipping were used to increase
    the sample size. After the data preprocessing is completed, the vectorized sample
    data is made into label data in the study area, and it is randomly divided into
    training samples and validation samples in a 7:3 ratio. This study used this label
    data to evaluate the performance of deep learning models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, DeepLabV3+
    DAM with 4-band, and DeepLabV3+DAM with full features). Figure 5. Loss changes
    corresponding to Epoch settings in different models. 2.8. Model Accuracy Evaluation
    Indicators This paper verifies the accuracy through on-site observation data and
    selects 98 non-cotton sample points and 185 cotton sample points in the study
    area. Calculate the CM using omission error and commission error, then derive
    the consistency of the kappa coefficient and overall accuracy between the classification
    map and the reference data. Calculate classification accuracy statistical data
    based on the error matrix, including overall accuracy (correct classification
    number/total number of measured samples), producer’s accuracy (correct classification
    number/total number of a certain category), user’s accuracy (correct classification
    number/(correct classification number plus total number of misclassified to a
    certain category)), and kappa coefficient. This study used this on-site observation
    data to evaluate the accuracy of all models. The Kappa coefficient is an indicator
    for comprehensive evaluation of classification accuracy, which can determine the
    consistency of classification [42]. Its formula is 𝐾𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑎= (𝑃 𝑜 − 𝑃 𝑒 )/(1− 𝑃 𝑒
    )  (9) where Po is the sum of the correct pixel count for cotton and non-cotton
    classification divided by the total number of pixels. Assuming that the true pixel
    count for each class is {x1, x2}, the predicted pixel count for each class is
    {y1, y2}, and the total number of pixels in the sample is n, Pe is calculated
    as follows: 𝑃 𝑒 = 𝑥 1 𝑦 1 + 𝑥 2 𝑦 2 𝑛 2   (10) 3. Results and Analysis 3.1. Performance
    Evaluation In view of the excellent performance of the DeepLabV3+ network model
    in image recognition, we consider applying this improved DeepLabV3+ network attention
    mechanism model structure to cotton field recognition and comparing its performance
    with other models to see its performance in early cotton recognition to see its
    performance in the early identification of cotton. Considering the training efficiency
    and cotton recognition accuracy, this paper also compares the attention mechanism
    model of the DeepLabV3+ network using only 4-band. MIoU can be used to judge the
    accuracy of the model’s prediction results and labeled as similar, and the speed
    of the model’s operation can also be determined based on the calculation speed.
    It is a relatively balanced indicator for measuring model performance. By comparing
    the training sets in the dataset (Table 5), it is found that the DeepLabV3+ network
    attention mechanism model with full features has the highest MIoU and the minimum
    binary cross entropy loss function. Through comparing the MIoU and the binary
    cross entropy loss function, we can find that although the DeepLabV3+DAM with
    full features performs the best regarding MIoU and loss, these optimal values
    show a very small absolute difference between these key performance indicators.
    Table 5. The optimal value for each model configuration parameter. 3.2. Accuracy
    Evaluation CM is the most important index in the accuracy evaluation of ground
    object recognition. The omission error and commission error can be expressed by
    producer precision and user precision, respectively. Therefore, overall accuracy,
    producer accuracy, user accuracy, and Kappa coefficient are used to compare the
    accuracy of different model algorithms’ recognition results (Table 5). It was
    found that in the model using full feature information for classification, the
    overall accuracy of the DeepLabV3+ network was 96.11%, while the overall accuracy
    of the model incorporating the attention mechanism was 98.23%, an improvement
    of 2%. The Kappa coefficient also increased from 0.914 to 0.961, an increase of
    0.047. However, the overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficients of
    the 4-band DeepLabV3+ network with attention mechanism are less different from
    those of the DeepLabV3+ network with all feature sets, and the recognition accuracy
    of the five comparisons reaches an excellent level except RF (0.8 ≤ Kappa ≤1)
    [43]. From Table 6, the DeepLabV3+ DAM with all feature sets shows that the producer’s
    accuracy of cotton is 98.38%, while the user’s accuracy of cotton is 98.91%. This
    indicates that 98.38% of the cotton area on the ground is correctly identified
    as cotton, while 98.91% of the estimated cotton area on the classification map
    is actually cotton. In other words, the classification map missed 1.62% of the
    cotton area on the ground (omission error), while approximately 1.09% of the pixels
    classified as cotton on the classification map (commission error) actually belong
    to other categories. Among the 185 measured points that were actually cotton,
    3 points were misclassified as non-cotton. In addition, out of the 184 points
    classified as cotton on the classification map, 2 are actually corn. Indirectly,
    the actual cotton area is underestimated on the classification chart, but not
    much, only 0.53%. Among the evaluation indicators of P_A, U_A, Overall accuracy,
    Kappa, MIoU, and Loss, the performance and accuracy indicators of the DeepLabV3+DAM
    with full features perform best. Therefore, the DeepLabV3+DAM with full features
    can be concluded to have the best performance and accuracy for the cotton early
    identification task in our study when considering the general probability. Table
    6. Accuracy evaluation of five kinds of comparison research. 3.3. Cotton Identification
    Based on GF-6 satellite images, cotton is identified by comprehensive use of spectrum,
    its combination information, and texture information. We compare its performance
    and accuracy for the cotton early identification task with the RF, U-Net, DeepLabV3+
    network, and Deeplabv3+ model based on the attention mechanism with 4-band. According
    to the above description, applying the DeepLabV3+DAM model proposed in this article
    to remote sensing recognition of cotton can achieve higher recognition accuracy
    and extraction effect. Therefore, we visualize the detailed features of five sub-images,
    the corresponding ground truths, and the prediction results of different models
    from the validation dataset. These five areas include representative desert oasis
    transition zones, urban areas, plantation areas, and various terrain mixed areas.
    Considering the training efficiency and cotton identification accuracy, we selected
    a portion of the representative desert oasis transition zones in the GF-6 images
    to exhibit each model’s performance. The recognition results are shown in Figure
    6. We can see that the DeepLabV3+DAM with full features predictions (Figure 6C)
    are the most consistent with the original image (Figure 6A) and visual interpretation
    samples (Figure 6B), while the RF predictions (Figure 6G) are relatively rough.
    From the visual interpretation, the accuracy of DeepLabV3+DAM with full features
    is better than the other models on the discrimination between cotton and non-cotton
    fields, without excessive confusion and misjudgment in desert oasis transition
    zones, and other models have excessive confusion and misjudgment in the red solid
    line depicts area. In addition, except for the RF model, the boundaries of the
    cotton fields in other models are relatively clear in desert oasis transition
    zones, indicating that deep learning is superior to machine learning in this recognition
    experiment. This is because by modifying the input layer and adding an upsampling
    layer, the phenomenon of loss of ground object boundary information is improved,
    and the recognition accuracy of cotton is improved. Figure 6. Comparison of the
    cotton identification effect of different models in some areas. (A) GF-6 remote
    sensing images, (B) visual interpretation samples, (C) the DeepLabV3+DAM with
    full features, (D) the DeepLabV3+ Network, (E) the DeepLabV3+ DAM with 4-band,
    (F) the U-Net model, (G) the RF model. The white color indicates the identified
    non-cotton in the Figures (B) to (G), and the red solid line depicts area with
    differences in the Figure (A). Considering the training efficiency and cotton
    identification accuracy, we selected another portion of the representative urban
    area in the GF-6 images to exhibit each model’s performance. By comparing their
    performance and accuracy for the cotton early identification model of the RF,
    U-Net, DeepLabV3+ network, and Deeplabv3+ DAM with 4-band, the recognition results
    are shown in Figure 7. We can see that the prediction results of all the deep
    learning methods (Figure 7C) are similar to the original image (Figure 7A) and
    visual interpretation samples (Figure 7B), while the RF predictions (Figure 7G)
    are relatively rough. From the visual interpretation, the accuracy of DeepLabV3+DAM
    with full features is better than the other models on the discrimination between
    cotton and non-cotton fields. There are only a few instances of excessive confusion
    and misjudgment in the representative urban area, and other models have more excessive
    confusion and misjudgment than DeepLabV3+DAM with full features model in the red
    solid line depicts area. In addition, except for the RF model, the boundaries
    of the cotton fields in other models are also relatively clear in the representative
    urban area, indicating that deep learning is superior to machine learning in this
    recognition experiment. It has been determined to be the best model for early
    cotton recognition in view of the excellent performance of the DeepLabV3+DAM model
    with full features in previous experiments. In this research, under the premise
    of limited training samples, the DeepLab V3+ ADM model still achieved good results
    for early cotton recognition and can provide a decision-making basis for water-saving
    irrigation in this area. Figure 7. Comparison of the cotton identification effect

    The white color indicates the identified non-cotton in the Figures (B) to (G),
    and the red solid line depicts areas with differences in the Figure (A). 4. Conclusions
    and Discussion 4.1. Conclusions In this paper, the improved DeepLabV3+DAM model
    structure—which was used for the field of agriculture previously [35,36] to identify
    cotton fields using GF-6 satellite image data—is shown. This model can introduce
    the DAM module, which is a combination of the spatial attention module and channel
    attention module. The spatial attention module can highlight the spatial position
    distribution that is important for recognition in the convolutional layer. The
    channel attention module can highlight channels of significant value for recognition
    in the convolutional layer. By modifying the input layer and adding an upsampling
    layer, the phenomenon of loss of ground object boundary information is improved,
    and the recognition accuracy of cotton is improved. Based on this advantage, the
    model can fully use spectral combination information and texture information for
    cotton field identification before and after the flowering period of cotton. These
    experiment results have been validated using ground truths and compared with four
    deep learning models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, DeepLabV3+ DAM with 4-band, DeepLabV3+
    DAM with full features) and a machine learning model (RF). Through experiments,
    it can be found that the recognition results are affected by many factors, such
    as reflection spectrum, ground texture information, and model algorithm. The main
    conclusions are as follows: According to the experimental results, the improved
    DenseNet model is superior to these popular CNNs using the same datasets. (1)
    The recognition accuracy of traditional machine learning algorithms is far inferior
    to that of deep learning algorithms in accuracy evaluation and the phenomenon
    of loss of ground object boundary information. (2) Compared with the DeepLab V3+
    network and U-Net, the DeepLabV3+ DAM model with the full feature showed a good
    effect on early cotton recognition in this study area. (3) Only the spectral information
    provided by the 4-band feature set is relatively limited, and the performance
    and recognition accuracy of the same DeepLabV3+ DAM model is worse than that of
    the full feature set. 4.2. Discussion In this research, from the perspective of
    water conservation and regulation, high-resolution images of the cotton flowering
    period were obtained. The conclusion that previous studies from the perspective
    of yield estimation have found that the highest cotton recognition accuracy in
    this region occurs during the boll opening period (August, September) [8,44] is
    not contradictory. The low coverage rate of cotton in the flowering stage and
    the unified mechanical cultivation mode of cotton in Xinjiang provided the basis
    for the selection of the texture feature sets and laid the foundation for improving
    the accuracy of early cotton remote-sensing recognition and reduce the difficulty
    of recognition. However, it should be noted that if there are other crops using
    wide film drip irrigation in the study area during the same period, it is likely
    to cause confusion in the recognition results, such as the only two misclassifications
    in the DeepLab V3+ DAM model being corn. A future task will be to verify the improved
    DeepLab V3+ DAM model on images with higher temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions
    for cotton field identification. Early recognition based on drone cotton has been
    used by many scholars for pest control due to its high spatial resolution and
    free time control [45,46]. However, it is time-consuming and expensive, and flight
    time and area are strictly controlled. In addition, the later image stitching
    method will also affect recognition accuracy, which is slightly less economical
    and practical compared to high-resolution remote sensing image recognition. The
    second future task is to apply this method in other areas with complex planting
    structures and diversified agricultural management practices. Xun et al. [5] explored
    the feasibility of combining time series enhanced vegetation index (EVI) calculated
    from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data with
    the fused representation-based classification (FRC) algorithm to identify the
    cotton pixels and map cotton cultivated area in the major cotton production regions
    of China. They believe that the accuracy of the model is influenced not only by
    longitude and latitude but also by agricultural management practices (such as
    species and sowing dates) and climate change. Compared with using only 4-band
    satellite images based on remote-sensing image (GF-1, WFV) data to identify cotton
    during the boll opening period [47], it is believed that the optimized model of
    DenseNet can fully utilize spatial and spectral information for cotton field recognition.
    By comparing the training efficiency and performance of four widely used classical
    convolutional neural networks (ResNet, VGG, SegNet, and DeepLab v3+), it was also
    found that the DeepLab V3+ network has the shortest training time, the easiest
    training, and the lowest computational cost. So, the third future task is to reduce
    the labor cost, improve the automation level and working efficiency of the model,
    and improve the stability and generalization of the model. Author Contributions

    of Things (IoT) paradigm expands the current Internet and enables communication
    through machine to machine, while posing new challenges. Cognitive radio (CR)
    Systems have received much attention over the last decade, because of their ability
    to flexibly adapt their transmission parameters to their changing environment.
    Current technology trends are shifting to the adaptability of cognitive radio
    networks into IoT. The determination of the appropriate transmission parameters
    for a given wireless channel environment is the main feature of a cognitive radio
    engine. For wireless multicarrier transceivers, the problem becomes high dimensional
    due to the large number of decision variables required. Evolutionary algorithms
    are suitable techniques to solve the above-mentioned problem. In this paper, we
    design a CR engine for wireless multicarrier transceivers using real-coded biogeography-based
    optimization (RCBBO). The CR engine also uses a fuzzy decision maker for obtaining
    the best compromised solution. RCBBO uses a mutation operator in order to improve
    the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability of the original
    BBO algorithm. The simulation results show that the RCBBO driven CR engine can
    obtain better results than the original BBO and outperform results from the literature.
    Moreover, RCBBO is more efficient when applied to high-dimensional problems in
    cases of multicarrier system. Similar content being viewed by others Cognitive

    Techniques Article 01 March 2019 1 Introduction In recent years, there is a rapid
    development of wireless communications and a widespread adoption of devices (smartphones,
    tablets, laptops) which are running demanding applications. As a result, the need
    for additional wireless spectrum has been dramatically increasing, leading to
    the spectrum scarcity problem. Furthermore, advanced software applications impose
    high data throughput and reliable connections and at the same time there is a
    big necessity to design eco-friendly systems. Additionally, a study of electromagnetic
    spectrum utilization by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [37] has reported
    that on an average, there is a 10% of the allocated spectrum that is used. Most
    of the spectrum bands are only utilized for limited time and in limited places.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm describes communication not only human to
    human (H2H) but also machine to machine (M2M) without the need of human interference.
    Recently Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) supports M2M communications (called
    LTE-M) [28]. Moreover, the IoT nodes are assumed to be interconnected using cellular
    or other wireless communication technologies. However, the need for spectrum resource
    for IoT applications is becoming significant. Such an issue can be addressed using
    smart IoT objects that will have cognitive capabilities [20, 34]. Current technology
    trends are shifting to the adaptability of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) [3,
    11] into IoT. Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technique which has been proposed
    as the technology which can effectively cope with that problem [15]. Mitola suggested
    that CR systems have the ability to monitor and detect the conditions of their
    operating environment, and reconfigure their transmission parameters in order
    to provide the best service which satisfies the users demands [23, 24]. The CR
    system is informed about its operating environment by the environmental parameters
    which also determine the effectiveness and the accuracy of the decisions made
    by the system. Moreover, it is worth noting that in order to determine the possible
    directions of the system, we must define the performance objectives which will
    be satisfied by it. Although the primary objective of dynamic spectrum access
    is to improve spectrum utilization efficiency, there are additional objectives
    that should be satisfied like the bit-error-rate (BER) minimization, the throughput
    maximization, the power consumption minimization, and the interference minimization.
    Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are suitable techniques for solving the problem
    of reconfiguring the transmission parameters according to certain performance
    objectives. The optimization of CR systems has been performed in the literature
    using several evolutionary optimization techniques. Among others these approaches
    include Genetic Algorithms (GA) [14, 25,26,27, 45], Particle Swarm Optimization
    (PSO) [39, 44], or Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [46]. Additionally, multi-objective
    EAs have also been used to the CR problem [7, 29]. A survey of all these techniques
    can be found in [30]. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [38] is an evolutionary
    algorithm based on mathematical models that describe how species migrate from
    one island to another, how new species arise, and how species become extinct.
    The way the problem solution is found is analogous to natures way of distributing
    species. The BBO algorithm has been applied successfully to several real world
    engineering problems [2, 4, 5, 13, 16, 17, 22, 33, 36]. The authors have applied
    the original BBO algorithm to antenna design problems in [13], where antenna arrays
    are optimized. In order to improve the diversity of the population and enhance
    the exploration ability of BBO, a modified BBO approach referred to as real-coded
    BBO (RCBBO) is proposed in [12]. The authors in [18] use the original BBO algorithm
    for CR system optimization. It must be pointed out that EAs like BBO could also
    be hardware implemented like in [19] using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)
    in order to work faster online. In this paper, the CR system will be optimized
    using three different RCBBO algorithms: RCBBO-G (Gauss mutation), RCBBO-C (Cauchy
    mutation) and RCBBO-L (Levy mutation). Additionally, to evaluate the algorithms
    performance we compare the different RCBBO algorithms with the original BBO algorithm
    as well as with results from the literature. The novelty in our work lies in the
    fact that we propose a novel CR engine framework based on RCBBO and fuzzy decision
    making. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the RCBBO algorithm
    is applied to the cognitive radio engine problem. Furthermore, we use five different
    objective functions for multi-carrier systems optimization instead of three commonly
    found in the literature. This paper contributes also to performance comparison
    of different algorithms to the cognitive radio engine design problem for both
    single carrier and multi-carrier systems using non-parametric statistical tests.
    Moreover, to the best of the authors knowledge, it is the first time that simulation
    results are given for a CR engine with more than 64 carriers. The simulation results
    show that RCBBO algorithms achieve better performance than the BBO algorithm.
    The simulation results are finally combined with a fuzzy decision maker in order
    to find the best compromised solution. The rest of this paper is organized as
    follows. The related work is briefly discussed in Sect. 2. We describe the problem
    formulation in Sect. 3. The details of the BBO and the RCBBO algorithms are given
    in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we present the simulation numerical results. Finally, the
    conclusion is given in Sect. 6. 2 Related Work In [40] a cognitive management
    framework for IoT is proposed, in which dynamically changing real-world objects
    are represented in a virtualized environment. A new IoT paradigm is defined in
    [41] named cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT). The definition of CIoT according
    to the authors is that it is an brain-empowered enhancement of IoT by integrating
    the cognition process into the system design. Additionally, the authors provide
    an operational framework of CIoT that characterizes the fundamental cognitive
    tasks and address the key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks.
    In the same context, following the CIoT paradigm the authors in [32] propose a
    new MAC protocol for cognitive IoT devices. Moreover, they address the topic of
    applications of the CR technology for IoT and propose new and effective solutions
    to the real challenges in CR technology. Their conclusion is that applications
    like social media and chess or card playing, which are not delay-sensitive could
    benefit for such an intelligent MAC protocol with CR features. A convergent solution
    of IoT and CR is the topic of another paper [1]. The authors propose a novel low-cost
    cooperative spectrum sensing solution, which they have integrated to an Internet
    architecture called NovaGenesis. Moreover, the authors provide an experimental
    proof-of-concept that demonstrates the convergence of IoT and CR. The connection
    between IoT and CR is the topic of two recent papers [20, 34]. In [34] the authors
    present a review paper that looks for novel approaches and discusses research
    challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for IoT. Moreover,
    the authors focus on cognitive radio in the context of M2M communications and
    IoT. The goal of the authors in [20] is to study how CR can be helpful for IoT.
    They elaborate on spectrum sensing in conjunction with cloud services, which may
    provide a self-reconfigurable IoT paradigm. Several papers can be found in the
    literature that use a single objective weighted sum approach. In this case, the
    multiple objectives are weighted independently to generate a single objective
    fitness function which is simple and easy to implement. In other cases, the multiple
    objectives are optimized using a multi-objective EA. Newman presented the problem
    in his Ph.D. thesis in [25]. He defined a common set of eight transmission parameters
    and six environment parameters used by cognitive radios, and developed a set of
    preliminary fitness functions that encompass the relationships between a small
    set of these input and output parameters. Additionally, he used rule-based optimization
    techniques to make operating parameter decisions. The authors in [26] presented
    a genetic-algorithm driven, cognitive radio decision engine that determines the
    optimal radio transmission parameters for single and multicarrier systems, they
    gave a set of single carrier and multicarrier fitness functions for their GA implementation.
    Another GA approach is given in [27] where the authors present a population adaptation
    technique for genetic algorithms that takes advantage of the information from
    previous cognition cycles in order to reduce the time required to reach an optimal
    decision. In another paper [6] the authors apply several approaches designed to
    enhance the convergence time and/or improve the performance results of genetic
    algorithm based search engine for cognitive radio networks. Their paper includes
    techniques such as population adaptation, variable quantization, variable adaptation,
    and multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA). Another popular algorithm used
    for such problems is PSO. Tan et al. in [39] use the PSO algorithm to provide
    a fast decision for the CR radio when facing unknown wireless situations. Moreover,
    they utilize a case database, which is also integrated into the architecture to
    improve the response speed and knowledge accumulating ability of the CR. In [44]
    a CR engine based on Binary Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (BCPSO) is presented.
    The authors compare results of the BCPSO with a GA and Binary PSO (BPSO). Additionally,
    the authors in [46] apply a mutated ant colony optimization (MACO) for CR engine
    optimization. They use three fitness functions and apply the optimization procedure
    for 10 sub-carriers. BBO is applied to the same problem for a single carrier case
    in [18]. The authors results showed that BBO outperformed results given by an
    GA. A multi-objective EA approach is given in [29] where the authors propose a
    non-dominated front searching algorithm based on user preference (NFSA-UP). They
    optimize a 64-subcarrier system and they compare performance with other multi-objective
    EAs like NSGA-II. A comparative performance of genetic algorithm, particle swarm
    optimization, differential evolution, bacterial foraging optimization, artificial
    bee colony optimization and cat swarm optimization algorithm is given in [30].
    Each algorithm is tested in single and multicarrier communication systems (64
    subcarriers). 3 Problem Formulation The basic concept of a cognitive engine is
    real-time tuning of transmission parameters according to the environment information.
    Therefore, first the environmental and the transmission parameters should be defined.
    The environmental parameters are the inputs for the cognitive engine in order
    to make a decision about the transmission parameters. The optimization problem
    may therefore defined by searching for the best possible transmission parameters
    subject to the known environmental parameters. The environmental parameters used
    in this paper are the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bit error rate (\({\textit{BER}}\)),
    and background noise power (N) [25]. The transmission parameters are the unknowns
    or the decision variables (\({\textit{SIVs}}\) in case of BBO) of the cognitive
    radio engine. The list of the transmission parameters is shown in Table 1 [18].
    From Table 1 it is worth noting that the modulation type used in our system is
    Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), for \({\textit{modulation index}}=2\), Quadrature
    Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), for \({\textit{modulation index}}=4\), and Quadrature
    Amplitude Modulation (QAM), for \({\textit{modulation index}}>4\). Table 1 Transmission
    parameters Full size table 3.1 Cognitive Radio Engine Objectives The five objective
    functions used in this section are formulated in [18] and kept the same for comparison
    reasons. The total fitness is obtained by summing the objective functions using
    suitable weight values. The single objective fitness functions for a CR system
    with L independent subcarriers are described below: The objective function of
    power consumption minimization is expressed as [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\min
    {\textit{power}}}}(\bar{P})=\frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{{{P}_{i}}}}{L\times
    {{P}_{\max }}} \end{aligned}$$ (1) where \({{P_i}}\) is the transmitted power
    on the i-th subcarrier, and \({{P}_{\max }}\) is the maximum available transmit
    power, and \(\bar{P}=({{P}_{1}},{{P}_{2}}, \ldots , {{P}_{L}})\) is the vector
    of the transmitted power. The objective function of BER minimization is defined
    as [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\min {\textit{ber}}}}(\bar{P},\bar{M})=\frac{{{\log
    }_{10}}(0.5)}{{{\log }_{10}}\left( \frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{Pb{{e}_{i}}({{M}_{i}},{{P}_{i}})}}{L}
    \right) } \end{aligned}$$ (2) where \({{M}_{i}}\) is the modulation index on the
    i-th subcarrier, \(\bar{M}=({{M}_{1}},{{M}_{2}}, \ldots , {{M}_{L}})\) is the
    vector of the modulation indices and For BPSK modulation the BER is defined as
    [31] $$\begin{aligned} Pb{{e}_{i}}({{P}_{i}})=Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{{{P}_{i}}}{{{N}_{0}}}}
    \right) \end{aligned}$$ (3) Also for M-ary PSK the BER is expressed as [31] $$\begin{aligned}
    Pb{{e}_{i}}({{P}_{i}},{{M}_{i}})=\left( \frac{2}{{{\log }_{2}}{{M}_{i}}} \right)
    Q\left( \sqrt{2{{\log }_{2}}\left( {{M}_{i}} \right) \times \frac{{{P}_{i}}}{{{N}_{0}}}\times
    \sin \frac{\pi }{{{M}_{i}}}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (4) Additionally, for M-ary
    QAM modulation the BER is given by [31] $$\begin{aligned} Pb{{e}_{i}}({{P}_{i}},{{M}_{i}})=\left(
    \frac{4}{{{\log }_{2}}{{M}_{i}}} \right) \left( 1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{{{M}_{i}}}} \right)
    Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{3{{\log }_{2}}\left( {{M}_{i}} \right) {{P}_{i}}}{\left( {{M}_{i}}-1
    \right) {{N}_{0}}}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (5) We assume that \({{N}_{0}}=-104\)
    dBm as set in previous papers in order to compare results. The objective function
    of throughput maximization is defined as [25] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\max {\textit{throughput}}}}\left(
    {\bar{M}} \right) =1-\frac{{{\log }_{2}}\left( \frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{{{M}_{i}}}}{L}
    \right) }{{{\log }_{2}}\left( {{M}_{\max }} \right) } \end{aligned}$$ (6) where
    \({{M}_{\max }}\) is the maximum modulation index. The objective function of interference
    minimization is given by [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\min {\textit{interference}}}}\left(
    \bar{P},\bar{B},\bar{T}\bar{D}\bar{D} \right) =\frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{\left[
    \left( {{P}_{i}}\times {{B}_{i}}\times TD{{D}_{i}} \right) -\left( {{P}_{\min
    }}\times {{B}_{\min }} \right) \right] }}{L\left( {{P}_{\max }}\times {{B}_{\max
    }}\times 100 \right) } \end{aligned}$$ (7) where \({{B}_{i}}\) and are the bandwidth
    and the time division duplexing on the i-th subcarrier respectively, \(\bar{B}=({{B}_{1}},{{B}_{2}},
    \ldots ,{{B}_{L}})\), \(\overline{TDD}=(TD{{D}_{1}},TD{{D}_{2}}, \ldots ,TD{{D}_{L}})\)
    are the corresponding vectors of bandwidth and time division duplexing respectively,
    and \({{B}_{\min }}\), \({{B}_{\max }}\) are the minimum and maximum bandwidths
    available. The objective function of spectral efficiency maximization is expressed
    as [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\max {\textit{specteff}}}}\left( \bar{M},\bar{B},{{{\bar{R}}}_{s}}
    \right) =1-\frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{\frac{{{M}_{i}}{{R}_{s,i}}{{B}_{\min
    }}}{{{M}_{\max }}{{R}_{s,\max }}{{B}_{i}}}}}{L} \end{aligned}$$ (8) where \({{R}_{s,i}}\)
    is the symbol rate on the i-th subcarrier, \({{R}_{s}}=({{R}_{s}}_{,1},{{R}_{s,}}_{2},
    \ldots ,{{R}_{s,}}_{L})\) is the corresponding vector of the symbol rate and \({{R}_{s,\max
    }}\) is the maximum symbol rate. The above described objective functions could
    sum in order to create a total objective function. The requirement to fulfill
    multiple objectives has lead to the use of a weighted sum approach. Therefore,
    a total objective function may be defined according to the following sum [25]
    $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{{\textit{total}}}}(\bar{x})=\sum \limits _{i=1}^{k}{{{w}_{i}}{{F}_{i}}(\bar{x})}
    \end{aligned}$$ (9) where k is the number of objective functions, and \({{w}_{1}},{{w}_{2}},
    \ldots {{w}_{k}}\), \(0\le {{w}_{i}}\le 1\) for \(i=1,2,\ldots k\) are suitable
    weight values subject to \({{w}_{1}}+{{w}_{2}}+\cdots +{{w}_{k}}=1\). As a result,
    we may express the multiple objective fitness function for a CR system with N
    independent subcarriers [25] $$\begin{aligned} \begin{array}{l} {F_{{\textit{multicarrier}}}}\left(
    {\bar{P},\bar{M},\bar{B},\overline{TDD} ,{{\bar{R}}_s}} \right) = {w_1}{F_{\min
    - {\textit{power}}}}(\bar{P}) + {w_2}{F_{\min - ber}}(\bar{P},\bar{M}) \\ \quad
    +\, {w_3}{F_{\max - {\textit{throughput}}}}\left( {\bar{M}} \right) + {w_4}{F_{\min
    - {\textit{interference}}}}\left( {\bar{P},\bar{B},\overline{TDD} } \right) \\
    \quad +\, {w_5}{F_{\max - {\textit{specteff}}}}\left( {\bar{M},\bar{B},{{\bar{R}}_s}}
    \right) \end{array} \end{aligned}$$ (10) The weights \({{w}_{1}},{{w}_{2}},{{w}_{3}},{{w}_{4}},{{w}_{5}}\)
    define the search direction of the evolutionary algorithm and must conform to
    the limitations of (13). Table 2 holds five different weight vectors that represent
    different scenarios of the CR engine configuration. Each weight vector emphasizes
    on different performance objective. This fact leads the evolutionary algorithms
    to a solution set that is related to a specific scenario. We have chosen these
    weight values based on a trial and error procedure. We have found that better
    solutions can be obtained using these weight values. Additionally, in order to
    evaluate the choice of equal weights the balanced mode scenario has been also
    selected for comparison reasons. Please note that the weight values taken are
    different than those in [18, 25]. Table 2 Weighting values Full size table 3.2
    Best Compromised Solution In order to choose the best compromised solution from
    the set of solutions a suitable decision maker has to be used. The fuzzy set theory
    has been used as a decision maker in several applications in the literature like
    transportation planning, vendor selection, etc. [8]. The satisfaction degree of
    each objective function is represented by a linear fuzzy membership function expressed
    as $$\begin{aligned} {\mu _k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \quad if\, \,
    {z_k} \le z_k^{\min }\\ \frac{{z_k^{\max } - {z_k}}}{{z_k^{\max } - z_k^{\min
    }}} &{}\quad if \, \, z_k^{\min }< {z_k} < z_k^{\max } \\ 0 &{}\quad if\, \, {z_k}
    \ge z_k^{\max } \end{array} \right. \end{aligned}$$ (11) where \({{z}_{k}}\) is
    the value of k-th objective function, \(z_{k}^{\min }\), \(z_{k}^{\max }\) are
    the minimum and maximum value of the k-th objective function respectively. The
    best compromised solution is found by using $$\begin{aligned} s=\frac{1}{{{n}_{obj}}}\sum
    \limits _{k=1}^{{{n}_{obj}}}{{{\mu }_{k}}} \end{aligned}$$ (12) where \({{n}_{obj}}\)
    is the number of objectives, and s is the degree of satisfaction. For each solution,
    we calculate the value of s. The point with the maximum s value is the best compromised
    solution. 4 Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) The mathematical models of Biogeography
    are based on the work of Robert MacArthur and Edward Wilson in the early 1960s.
    Using this model, they have been able to predict the number of species in a habitat.
    The habitat is an area that is geographically isolated from other habitats. The
    geographical areas that are well suited as residences for biological species are
    said to have a high habitat suitability index (HSI). Therefore, every habitat
    is characterized by the HSI which depends on factors like rainfall, diversity
    of vegetation, diversity of topographic features, land area, and temperature.
    Each of the features that characterize habitability is known as suitability index
    variables (SIV). In BBO a solution to the D-dimensional problem can be represented
    as a vector of SIV variables \({{\left[ SI{{V}_{1}},SI{{V}_{2}}, \ldots SI{{V}_{D}}
    \right] }^{\mathrm{T}}}\), which is a habitat or island. The SIV variables represent
    the vector of the unknown variables \({\mathbf {x}}={{\left[ {{x}_{1}},{{x}_{2}},
    \ldots ,{{x}_{D}} \right] }^{\mathrm{T}}}\). The value of HSI of a habitat is
    the value of the objective function that corresponds to that solution and it is
    found by: $$\begin{aligned} HSI = F\left( {{\textit{habitat}}} \right) = F(SI{V_1},SI{V_2},
    \ldots \,SI{V_M}) \end{aligned}$$ (13) Habitats with a high HSI are good solutions
    of the objective function, while poor solutions are those habitats with a low
    HSI. The habitats with high HSI are those that have large population and high
    emigration rate \(\xi\). For these habitats, the immigration rate \(\lambda\)
    is low. The poor solutions are those that low HSI, which means they have high
    immigration rate \(\lambda\) and low emigration rate \(\xi\). The immigration
    and emigration rates are functions of the number of species in the habitats. These
    are given by: $$\begin{aligned} {{\xi }_{k}}=\, & {} E\left( \frac{k}{{{S}_{\max
    }}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (14) $$\begin{aligned} {{\lambda }_{k}}=\, & {} I\left(
    1-\frac{k}{{{S}_{\max }}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (15) where I is the maximum
    possible immigration rate, E is the maximum possible emigration rate, k is the
    rank of the given candidate solution, and \({{S}_{\max }}\) is the maximum number
    of species (e.g. population size). That is the best candidate solution has a rank
    of \({{S}_{\max }}\) and the worst candidate solution has a rank of one. BBO uses
    both mutation and migration operators. The application of these operators to each
    SIV in each solution is decided probabilistically. Each generation, there is a
    probability \({{P}_{\bmod }}\) \(\in [0,1]\) that each candidate solution will
    be modified by migration. \({{P}_{\bmod }}\) is a user-defined parameter that
    is typically set to a value close to one, and is analogous to crossover probability
    in GAs. The migration for NP habitats can be described in Algorithm 1. The \({{X}_{i}}\)
    in the above algorithm is habitat i. The information sharing between habitats
    is accomplished using the immigration and emigration rate. The \({{\lambda }_{i}}\)
    is proportional to the probability that SIVs from neighbouring habitats will migrate
    into habitat \({{X}_{i}}\). The \({{\xi }_{i}}\) is proportional to the probability
    that SIVs from habitat \({{X}_{i}}\) will migrate into neighboring habitats. The
    mutation rate m of a solution S is defined to be inversely proportional to the
    solution probability and it is given by: $$\begin{aligned} {{m}_{S}}={{m}_{\max
    }}\left( \frac{1-{{P}_{s}}}{{{P}_{\max }}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (16) where
    \({{P}_{s}}\) is the probability that a habitat contains S species, \({{P}_{\max
    }}\) is the maximum \({{P}_{s}}\) value over all \(s \in [1,{{S}_{\max }}]\),
    and \({{m}_{\max }}\) is a user-defined parameter. Simon in [38] described how
    \({{P}_{s}}\) changes from time t to time \(t+\Delta t\) as: $$\begin{aligned}
    {{P}_{s}}(t+\Delta t)={{P}_{s}}(t)\left( 1-{{\lambda }_{s}}\Delta t-{{\mu }_{s}}\Delta
    t \right) +{{P}_{s-1}}(t){{\lambda }_{s-1}}\Delta t+{{P}_{s+1}}(t){{\mu }_{s+1}}\Delta
    t \end{aligned}$$ (17) The mutation procedure is described in Algorithm 2. The
    \({{m}_{i}}\) in Algorithm 2 is the mutation rate of solution i. As with other
    evolutionary algorithms, BBO also incorporates elitism. This is implemented with
    a user-selected elitism parameter p. This means that the p best phase vectors
    remain from one generation to the other. 4.1 Real-Coded BBO (RCBBO) RCBBO [12]
    uses a mutation operator, which is common in several EAs [21, 35, 42, 43]. For
    example, the Evolutionary Programming (EP) [42] algorithm uses the mutation operator
    as the main operator. Although RCBBO is almost identical to BBO, there is a significant
    difference between them: the mutation operator is integrated into RCBBO in order
    to improve the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability
    of the algorithm. The mutation operator used for the different RCBBO versions
    can be one of the following forms [12]: 1. Gaussian mutation: $$\begin{aligned}
    X_{i}^{''}\left( j \right) ={{X}_{i}}\left( j \right) +{{N}_{j}}\left( 0,1 \right)
    \end{aligned}$$ (18) where \({{X}_{i}}\left( j \right)\)is the j-th SIV of the
    i-th habitat and \({{N}_{j}}\left( 0,1 \right)\) indicates a random number generated
    from a Gaussian distribution. 2. Cauchy mutation: $$\begin{aligned} X_{i}^{''}\left(
    j \right) ={{X}_{i}}\left( j \right) +{{\delta }_{j}}\left( t \right) \end{aligned}$$
    (19) where \({{\delta }_{j}}(t)\) indicates a random number generated from a Cauchy
    distribution with \(t=1\). 3. Levy mutation: $$\begin{aligned} X_{i}^{''}\left(
    j \right) ={{X}_{i}}\left( j \right) +{{L}_{j}}\left( a, c \right) \end{aligned}$$
    (20) where \({{L}_{j}}\left( 0.8 \right)\)indicates a random number generated
    from a Levy distribution [21] with \(c =1,\,\,a=0.8\). RCBBO uses a modified algorithm
    for mutation which is given in Algorithm 3 where in Algorithm 3 the mutated \(X_{i}^{''}(j)\)
    depends on the RCBBO version. The RCBBO algorithm is outlined below: 1. Initialize
    the RCBBO control parameters. Map the problem solutions to phase vectors and habitats.
    Set the habitat modification probability \({{P}_{\bmod }}\), the maximum immigration
    rate I, the maximum emigration rate E, the maximum migration rate \({{m}_{\max
    }}\) and the elitism parameter p (if elitism is desired). Set the jumping rate
    \({{j}_{r}}\) and the opposition probability \({p}_{o}\). 2. Initialize a random
    population of NP habitats from a uniform distribution. Set the number of generations
    G to one. 3. Evaluate objective function value. 4. Map the HSI value to the number
    of species S. That is sort the population from most fit to least fit and then
    assign a rank or number to species from 1 (best) to NP (worst). Calculate the
    immigration rate \({{\lambda }_{k}}\), the emigration rate \({{\xi }_{k}}\) for
    each solution of the population. 5. Generate a new child population of NP habitats,
    which is originally the same as the parent population. 6. Apply the migration
    operator for each non-elite habitat based on immigration and emigration rates
    using (14) and (15). 7. Apply the mutation operator according to Algorithm 3.
    8. Evaluate objective function value. 9. Sort the population according to the
    HSI value from best to worst. 10. Apply elitism by replacing the p worst habitats
    of the previous generation with the p best ones. 11. Repeat step 4 until the maximum
    number of generations \({{G}_{\max }}\) or the maximum number of objective function
    evaluations is reached. Therefore, depending on the operator, three different
    algorithms can be defined RCBBO-G (Gauss mutation), RCBBO-C (Cauchy mutation)
    and RCBBO-L (Levy mutation). 5 Numerical Results In this paper, we compare results
    for a single carrier and multiple subcarriers using all BBO algorithms and results
    from the literature. We compare the three RCBBO versions with the original BBO
    algorithm on the five objective functions presented in the previous section. All
    algorithms ran for 20 independent trials. A population of 200 vectors was selected.
    The total number of iterations was set to 60 and 100 for one and multiple subcarriers
    respectively. The stopping criterion was the iteration number. For all BBO algorithms,
    we set the habitat modification probability, \({{P}_{\bmod }}\), to 1 and the
    maximum mutation rate, \({{m}_{\max }}\), equal to 0.01. The maximum immigration
    rate I, and the maximum emigration rate E are both set to one. The elitism size
    is set to two for all algorithms. 5.1 Single Carrier System In the results that
    follow, the different weight factor scenarios are analyzed and reported. The first
    design example is that of a single subcarrier using the total fitness given in
    (10) with different weight scenarios. The total fitness values for five algorithms
    vs the objective functions are listed in Table 3. It can be noticed that the RCBBO-C,
    RCBBO-G, and RCBBO-L algorithms obtain similar results in all the cases. The minimum
    value per objective function is preserved among the three aforementioned algorithms.
    Table 3 Single carrier system Full size table In Table 4, the minimum power consumed
    obective function value results for different weight factor scenarios are presented
    for all the algorithms. It can be noted that the total score of the GA is better
    compared to the other algorithms. Thus, the GA gives an improved performance for
    the minimum power consumption objective. Furthermore, the three RCBBO algorithms
    have quite similar performance in all cases. The original BBO outperforms the
    RCBBO algorithms in four out the five cases. Table 4 Single carrier system Full
    size table Table 5 reports the minimum BER obective function value for different
    weight scenarios. In this case the three RCBBO algorithms have similar performance
    in three out the five cases, outperforming the GA and the original BBO. Moreover,
    the GA presents the worst results in this case. It is interesting to notice that
    the equal weights case present a low objective function value that again all RCBBO
    algorithms obtain the same. Table 5 Single carrier system Full size table Additionally,
    Table 6 holds the minimum interference objective function value results for different
    weight vectors. In this case RCBBO-C and RCBBO-L obtain the best values among
    the other algorithms. The GA is better only in one case, while the original BBO
    fails to obtain a best result for these cases. Table 6 Single carrier system Full
    size table Finally, the comparative results of the maximum spectral efficiency
    objective function value for the different weight vectors are reported in Table
    7. The three RCBBO algorithms perform in a similar way with RCBBO-C and RCBBO-G
    performing slightly better than RCBBO-L. The original BBO outperforms the GA in
    all cases. Fig. 1 Convergence rate graph for single subcarrier case Full size

    subcarriers case Full size image Fig. 4 Convergence rate graph for 512 subcarriers
    case Full size image Moreover, non-parametric statistical tests were conducted
    in order to further elaborate with the algorithms results. These are the Friedman
    test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which are commonly used for the performance
    evaluation of EAs [9, 10]. Both tests are conducted based on the objective function
    values found that are summarized in the Tables 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The results are
    presented in Tables 8 and 9. RCBBO-G emerged as the best algorithm in the Friedman
    test, and RCBBO-C is second. The significant level set for the Wilcoxon signed-rank
    test was 0.05. From the Wilcoxon signed rank test, we see that most p values are
    below the significance level (0.05), so we can accept that a significant difference
    exists between the other algorithms with RCBBO-G to be significantly better than
    GA, BBO, and RCBBO-L. Convergence speed is another performance metric to be examined.
    Figure 1 shows the convergence rate graph for the single carrier case. It seems
    that the three RCBBO algorithms converge at similar speed slightly faster than
    the original BBO algorithm. Table 8 Average rankings achieved by Friedman test

    Multicarrier System Expanding the previous case study with multiple subcarriers
    like 128, 256 and 512 proportional results can be collected and analyzed. It must
    be pointed out that the authors have not been able to find a paper in the literature
    that uses more than 64 subcarriers for this type of problem. Using more subcarriers
    makes the problem high dimensional. In this case the total number of decision
    variables for L subcarriers is 5L. Therefore for 128, 256, and 512 subcarriers
    the total number of decision variables is 640, 1280 and 2560 respectively. We
    compare again the three RCBBO algorithms with the original BBO on the five objective
    functions values for different weight vector scenarios. Table 10 summarizes the
    comparative results of the three RCBBO algorithms and the original BBO by showing
    the number of times that each algorithm ranked first. The first line of Table
    10 shows the results for 128 subcarriers. The RCBBO-L algorithm performs better
    than the other algorithms in 4 out of the 5 different cases. For \(L=256\), the
    RCBBO-L agian performs better in 4 out of the 5 cases. The results for \(L=512\)
    are balanced between the RCBBO algorithms. No RCBBO algorithm can perform better
    than the others in the most of the cases. Overall, we notice that the RCBBO-L
    outperforms the other algorithms in the majority of the cases. Table 10 Comparative
    results of algorithms ranking first for different weight vectors and different
    subcarrier number Full size table Moreover, Fig. 2 depicts the convergence rate
    graph for the 128 subcarriers case. Figures 3 and 4 present the convergence rate
    graph for the 256 and 512 subcarriers respectively. It obvious again, that the
    three RCBBO algorithms converge faster than the original BBO algorithm. From the
    convergence rate graphs it can be deducted that the use of any of the three RCBBO
    algorithms does not offer an advantage regarding convergence rate speed. 5.3 Best
    Compromised Solutions The best compromised solutions using the fuzzy decision
    making rules described in the previous section across the full range of weighted
    vectors and the applied algorithms are reported in Table 11. One may notice that
    the best compromised solutions found are obtained by RBBO-G and RCBBO-C algorithms.
    The RCBBO-G solutions are selected by fuzzy decision maker in all multiple carrier
    cases, while the RCBBO-C solution is selected in the single carrier case. Additionally,
    it is evident that the cost function values increase as the number of subcarriers
    increases. The multiple subcarriers case shows clearly the improved performance
    of the three RCBBO algorithms over the original BBO. Figures 5, 6, and 7 depict
    in a graphical manner the best compromised solutions found by the fuzzy decision
    maker for 128, 256, and 512 subcarriers respectively. Table 11 Best compromised
    solutions for the cases of 1, 128, 256 and 512 subcarriers Full size table 6 Conclusion
    In this paper, we have proposed a modified BBO approach referred to as real-coded
    BBO (RCBBO) for the optimization of Cognitive Radio systems engine combined with
    a fuzzy decision maker. The main characteristic of this algorithm is that the
    real-coded mutation operator is integrated into RCBBO in order to improve its
    performance. Simulation results show that the RCBBO algorithms outperform the
    original BBO algorithm. From the above figures we can see that RCBBO algorithms
    converge faster and obtain better results than BBO. It is also worth noting that
    the differences between RCBBO and BBO results become more significant when the
    number of subcarriers is increasing. Moreover, using fuzzy set theory we managed
    to find the best compromised solution which is given by RCBBO algorithm. The superiority
    of RCBBO against BBO algorithm lies in the fact that the integrated mutation operator
    into RCBBO enhances its exploration ability and improves the diversity of its
    population. References Alberti, A., Mazzer, D., Bontempo, M., de Oliveira, L.,

- analysis: The paper introduces a new decision support app called idCROP, developed
    to assist cotton producers, particularly those in the Texas Rolling Plains and
    High Plains regions, in making informed irrigation decisions. Unlike other irrigation
    decision support tools, idCROP is designed to be inexpensive, user-friendly, and
    does not necessitate extensive technical knowledge or input data. The app leverages
    the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulation
    model and an economic model to generate real-time irrigation schedules and economic
    forecasts based on user-defined water usage and production goals. idCROP integrates
    real-time management data with historical and forecasted weather data to optimize
    irrigation schedules, enhance water-use efficiency, and maximize crop yield. However,
    the full potential of the app can be further realized by employing remote plant
    water stress sensors. The paper concludes by validating the crop model-based irrigation
    scheduling in idCROP using data from the Texas A&M AgriLife Chillicothe Research
    Station in the Texas Rolling Plains region.

  description: Irrigation decision support tools are a means by which crop producers
    can improve the efficiency of water they apply. However, the available tools generally
    have poor adoption rates due to high costs, requirement for technical background
    and skills, need for extensive input data, lack of economic analysis support,
    and/or low accuracy. Here, we aimed to develop an inexpensive and easy-to-use
    decision support mobile app called Irrigation Decision-support for Conserving
    Resources and Optimizing Production (idCROP), to aide cotton producers in the
    Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions to increase water-use efficiency
    while maintaining higher crop yields. The app was built based on the crop simulation
    model, Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), and a newly
    developed economic model to provide real-time irrigation schedules and projected
    economic outcomes based on water use and production goals. The app integrates
    real-time management information from users with historic, real-time, and forecasted
    short-term and seasonal weather data. This integration enables output of efficient
    and situationally relevant irrigation schedules and forecasts of associated cotton
    yield and economic returns. This enables users to choose an irrigation strategy
    that best suits their irrigation capacities and expected returns. The irrigation
    schedules can be improved by optional remote detection of plant water stress using
    a sensor platform mounted on a pivot irrigation system, but the app can be used
    without the sensors in conjunction with any type of irrigation system. The crop
    model-based irrigation scheduling in idCROP was validated at the Texas A&M AgriLife
    Chillicothe Research Station in the Texas Rolling Plains region and acceptable
    results were obtained. The idCROP app provides producers with a simple but powerful
    tool that takes the guess work out of irrigation management, helping them apply
    limited irrigation water more efficiently.

    schedulingPlant stress sensors 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the largest
    water consumer, accounting for ∼70% of global freshwater withdrawal and ∼90% of
    freshwater consumption [1]. Irrigation allows crop production in water-limited
    environments and therefore plays a vital role in global agricultural production
    [2]. Nevertheless, increasing incidences of weather extremes and uncertainty in
    irrigation water supply are critical challenges faced by many producers worldwide
    [[2], [3],]. For example, the infamous drought of 2011 in Texas, United States,
    resulted in about $7.6 billion in agricultural losses [4]. Some heavily irrigated
    regions like western and south-central United States, northern China, western
    and central Asia, North Africa, and Mexico are projected to have no irrigation
    potential in the future due to insufficient water supply in a warming climate
    [5]. Moreover, warmer and drier summers are expected in many regions in the world,
    which will exacerbate the situation by increasing crop water requirements [6,7].
    Therefore, information technology-based irrigation decision support tools are
    needed in these regions to apply limited irrigation water more efficiently. Currently
    available irrigation decision support tools can be classified into four types:
    evapotranspiration (ET) and soil water balance (WB)-based, soil sensor-based,
    plant sensor-based, and crop model-based. However, most of these irrigation decision
    support tools have generally remained limited to the scientific community, with
    low adoption by producers. Issues that limit their adoption include the high cost
    of hardware and software, need to have technical background to use the tools,
    requirement of extensive input data, low accuracy, as well as lack of efficient
    economic analysis support [8]. The ET-WB-based irrigation scheduling method has
    wide applications in web-based or smartphone apps due to its simplicity and requirement
    for little input data. For example, the WISE (Water Irrigation Scheduler for Efficient
    Application) web-based app developed at Colorado State University  [9,10] can
    schedule irrigation on any individual farm across the state of Colorado with automated
    access to daily weather data from a network of more than 90 weather stations and
    soil profile data from the SSURGO database (http://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/).
    The SmartIrrigation smartphone app developed at the University of Florida provides
    real-time irrigation schedules for different crops using weather data from 42
    sites and forecasted short-term data from the National Weather Service [11]. However,
    the ET-WB-based methods have low accuracy in predicting irrigation timing and
    amount due to the lack of field data, such as information about soil properties
    and on-site weather [12]. Soil sensor-based irrigation scheduling requires the
    installation of sensors and extensive manual data collection and therefore is
    cumbersome and expensive. In addition, soil moisture sensors are static and cannot
    represent the spatial variability in soil moisture across a field. DIEM, Dashboard
    for Irrigation Efficiency and Management [13], is a web-based tool developed in
    Texas for field-specific irrigation scheduling that uses soil moisture data collected
    from static sensors and estimates weather data until the end of the growing season
    based on historical data. DIEM requires the installation and removal of soil moisture
    sensors in the field annually. The use of smart sensors in recent years has facilitated
    the monitoring of spatial variability in soil moisture. Some of the examples of
    these sensors include the automated irrigation system developed by Gutierrez et
    al. [14] and several commercially available irrigation management systems [15,16].
    However, the soil sensor-based irrigation scheduling tools cannot accurately represent
    crop water stress, especially under cloudy and high humidity conditions [12].
    For example, crops may not suffer severe water stress even with a low soil water
    content because of reduced evaporative demand under cloudy and high humidity conditions.
    Alternatively, plant sensor-based methods directly estimate crop water status
    by integrating soil-water environment and, therefore, can effectively determine
    irrigation timing [17]. One popular plant sensor-based method is the Crop Water
    Stress Index (CWSI), which uses the canopy-to-air temperature difference to quantify
    crop water stress. The theoretical CWSI derived following the energy balance equation
    has been successfully used to indicate crop water status and schedule irrigation
    under different climatic conditions [[18], [19], [20]]. However, direct use of
    CWSI before full canopy closure can incur substantial errors due to the influence
    of soil heat flux. To overcome this weakness, Moran et al. [21] developed water
    deficit index (WDI), a modification of CWSI, in which the impact of soil heat
    flux was considered using a linear mixing model of soil and canopy temperatures.
    The WDI method was tested in high-frequency sprinkler irrigation for cotton [22].
    Although plant sensor-based methods can effectively determine when to irrigate,
    the amount of water to be applied cannot be directly obtained. Hence, these are
    usually integrated with other methods for real-time irrigation scheduling. With
    proper parameterization and calibration, crop simulation models can be used for
    irrigation scheduling by integrating soil properties, climate, crop genetics,
    and farming system management practices. Crop models are also helpful in evaluating
    the impacts of deficit irrigation scheduling strategies on crop yield. Several
    crop models have been successfully applied for irrigation scheduling, including
    the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) [23,24], AquaCrop
    [25], CROPWAT [26], and Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) [27,28]. These
    models vary in their complexity and accuracy. For example, AquaCROP uses a simplified
    crop model with few data requirements [[29], [30], [31]], but it underestimates
    soil moisture status, leading to inaccurate irrigation scheduling [32]. Among
    these models, the DSSAT model performs better in deficit irrigation scheduling,
    as demonstrated in a variety of regions [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39],
    [40], [41]]. Considerable progress has been made to improve the irrigation scheduling
    algorithm in DSSAT. For example, DeJonge and Thorp [42] improved crop ET simulation
    in DSSAT by including the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient and ASCE standardized reference
    evapotranspiration methods. Lopez et al. [43] integrated growth stage-based deficit
    irrigation, allowing users to specify different thresholds to trigger irrigation
    during different growth stages in DSSAT. The effectiveness of crop model-based
    irrigation scheduling depends on model accuracy, calibration quality, and weather
    forecast reliability [12]. Crop models have been widely used in the retrospective
    evaluation of irrigation scheduling management using historical weather data,
    but the use of crop model-based real-time irrigation scheduling is still limited
    primarily due to unreliable weather forecasts. Using the RZWQM2 model equipped
    with DSSAT, Gu et al. [44] developed IrrSch to schedule irrigation based on model
    simulated crop water stress. IrrSch is currently being tested for real-time irrigation
    scheduling for cotton in Xinjiang, China [36]. The Food, Agriculture and Resource
    Management System (FARMs) developed by Kim and Kisekka [45] enables web-based
    DSSAT simulation for near-real-time simulation by linking the grid SSURGO soil
    database and weather data from the NASA POWER project (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/).
    Nevertheless, future weather forecasts in these two real-time irrigation tools
    were produced using historical weather statistics (e.g., mean and variance), leading
    to considerable uncertainties in full-season decision support. In addition, very
    few crop model-based irrigation scheduling tools have attempted to incorporate
    economic models to support cost-benefit analysis at the farm level [8]. To address
    these drawbacks, we aimed to develop an easy-to-use mobile app for a crop model-
    and sensor-based irrigation decision support system, called idCROP (irrigation
    decision support system for Conserving Resources and Optimizing Production). Cotton  (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) was selected as the focus crop to verify the reliability of the app.
    The Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions, which collectively produce about
    26% of U.S. cotton [46], were selected as the study regions for app development.
    Cotton production in these regions highly depends on irrigation water from the
    underlying Seymour and Ogallala Aquifers. These aquifers have experienced substantial
    groundwater declines due to intensive irrigation and droughts [47]. On the other
    hand, climate change could lead to warmer and drier summers over these two regions
    in the future [48,49], which will necessitate larger groundwater withdrawals to
    meet the higher ET demands. To reduce groundwater use and prolong the usable economic
    lifetime of the Ogallala Aquifer, Groundwater Conservation Districts in the Texas
    High Plains region have already enacted restrictions on groundwater pumping [50].
    Therefore, adoption of innovative irrigation management tools is essential for
    cotton producers in these regions to efficiently apply limited irrigation water
    to maximize crop water productivity, helping producers comply with groundwater
    pumping restrictions. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop the framework
    and workflow of idCROP; (2) prepare region-specific input files, including soil
    files, cultivar parameters, and automated weather files throughout the growing
    season; (3) update and extend the economic analysis functionality; and (4) validate
    the crop-based irrigation decision support system using the field data obtained
    in the 2020 and 2021 cotton growing season at Texas A&M AgriLife Chillicothe Research
    Station in the Texas Rolling Plains region. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Crop
    model- and sensor-based irrigation decision support system The overall architecture
    of idCROP with major components and data streams is illustrated in Fig. 1. The
    two main components of the idCROP tool are a mobile application, developed for
    iOS and Android, and a server. The main software used on the server is DSSAT,
    which integrates with a newly developed economic model. The app was developed
    using an Agile-based software engineering methodology, which involves rapid, iterative,
    and feedback-focused software generation. Using this method, we obtained a finished
    product that addresses the feedback from end-users and subject-matter experts
    during the app development process. This process enabled iterative refinement
    and app expansion and provided an expanded set of features and capabilities in
    an incremental fashion. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    support system and illustration of workflow. The dashed line indicates that the
    sensor-based system is an optional setting. The mobile app can be used without
    the installation of in-field sensors. There are three major components of idCROP:
    (1) data input from users, (2) scenario creation and execution, and (3) result
    generation and presentation. User inputs include initial conditions, planting
    details, management practices, harvest details, and expenses/income, as detailed
    in Table 1. For scenario creation and execution, a data manager is used to create
    input files required to execute the DSSAT and economic models. It combines three
    data sources, including data from users, data stored in the database (e.g., environmental
    and economic data), and external data from the internet (i.e., real-time weather
    data). As shown in Fig. 1, if sensors are installed, a datalogging controller
    is used to store and upload data from the field to the server. Result generation
    and presentation include irrigation schedules, seasonal irrigation requirement,
    water use efficiency, and expected yield and net return. Table 1. Input types

    For the data input using the imperial system, idCROP will convert to the metric
    system. ⁎ More details about these parameters are provided in Supplementary Table
    S1. Users can create scenarios based on the unique characteristics of their fields
    and growing practices. The app analyzes different scenarios and compares how different
    irrigation schedules affect the simulated yield and net return. There are two
    options for irrigation scheduling. The default option is based on the DSSAT model,
    with irrigation scheduled by model-simulated soil water balance. This crop model-based
    approach can be used with any irrigation system. Users have an option to improve
    irrigation prescriptions with the installation of in-field sensors (Fig. 1). For
    this optional integrated (i.e., crop model- and sensor-based) approach, a sensor
    platform is mounted on the pivot, allowing real-time measurement of canopy temperature
    and ground coverage. These data are transferred to a server using a datalogger
    and a wireless modem (Fig. 1) to calculate the hourly WDI. The field-calibrated
    relationships between the seasonal average WDI and cotton yield under different
    ET replacements are used to determine the WDI threshold to trigger irrigation.
    The use of WDI provides on-site corrections and improves the accuracy of the model-based
    irrigation schedules. It is also recommended to install a mini weather station
    into the sensor system, which was tested to be highly effective. For users who
    do not have a mini weather station, idCROP automatically acquires real-time weather
    data from publicly available data, which is explained in detail in Section 2.5.
    The idCROP tool currently calculates expected yield following DSSAT-simulated
    seasonal irrigation schedules under four default irrigation strategies––0, 30,
    60, and 90% ET-replacement. However, the tool is customizable to other ET-replacement
    values and our future efforts will focus on this. For each strategy, the system
    applies the economic model to estimate farm profits expected from adhering to
    the simulated irrigation schedule. Users can follow any ET replacement strategy
    to apply deficit irrigation depending on irrigation water availability. With this
    information, users can proactively make decisions about in-season irrigation and
    crop management to optimize crop yield and profit. The resulting irrigation prescriptions
    are updated as the growing season progresses based on recorded irrigations, past
    and real-time weather data from the beginning of the growing season, and updated
    short-term weather for the remainder of the growing season. Users can change their
    irrigation strategy during the growing season, if necessary, based on unanticipated
    changes in the availability of irrigation water, the weather, or their yield and
    economic goals. 2.2. Field experiment and treatments The parameters used in the
    DSSAT model and the WDI threshold used to trigger irrigation under different ET
    replacements were calibrated and validated using field experiments. A two-year
    study was conducted at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Station at Chillicothe
    in the Texas Rolling Plains in the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons (Fig. 2a). A
    two-tower center pivot irrigation system was used (Fig. 2b). Half of the field
    was covered by the pivot, which was divided into sections, with each occupying
    1/12th of the total area. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete
    block design, with three replications of four irrigation scheduling treatments
    that differed in ET replacement rate (90%, 60%, 30%, and 0%). Download : Download

    radiometer and spectral sensor; and (d) CR1000X datalogging controller. (c) and
    (d) are the equipment required if the user chooses to adopt the sensor-based approach.
    A sensor platform was mounted on the pivot, about 4 m above the ground (Fig. 2c).
    The sensor platform included an SI-121-SS infrared radiometer [51] to measure
    crop canopy temperature and an S2-112-SS spectral sensor pair [51] to measure
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In 2021, a ClimaVUE50 all-in-one
    weather station [52] was added to the sensor platform, allowing for on-site collection
    of weather parameters. The sensor platform was controlled by a CR1000X datalogging
    controller [53] to store and upload data to the server (Fig. 2d). Data were collected
    within two hours of solar noon every two weeks on dry runs (i.e., irrigation water
    was not being applied) of the pivot across the field experiment area. A similar
    sensor system was placed on the ground in the 90% ET replacement plot, including
    an all-in-one weather station and an infrared temperature (IRT) sensor. The ground-based
    system allowed for continuous hourly measurement, which is used to validate the
    pivot-based system. A mid-maturing cotton cultivar (Phytogen 350 W3FE) was planted
    on 15 June 2020 and 27 May 2021. Irrigation was applied weekly or twice-weekly,
    depending on ET water losses. Monitoring and calculation of reference ET was done
    using data from an on-site weather station. The irrigation amount for each ET
    replacement treatment was calculated based on weekly reference ET using the Penman-Monteith
    method, which was multiplied by the appropriate growth stage-based irrigation
    coefficients for cotton from Ko et al. [54] and ET replacement coefficient (e.g.,
    0.6 for 60% ET replacement). At the end of each growing season, plots were harvested
    to determine cotton lint and seed yields. Seed cotton yield (seed + lint) was
    used for model simulations. 2.3. Scenario and data 2.3.1. Initial conditions After
    specifying the field location (latitude, longitude), users are required to select
    the crop grown in the previous growing season. Based on users’ choice, idCROP
    calculates the root and surface residue weight remaining in the field, which are
    the input data required by DSSAT to initialize the fresh organic matter of the
    experiment file. The idCROP app provides input files for 15 crop types, including
    fallow and ‘other crops’. For crop types that are not listed, users can select
    ‘other crops’, which is calculated based on the mean value of major crops. The
    major crop types in the study region were identified from the Cropland Data Layer
    of the National Agriculture Statistics Service, United States Department of Agriculture
    (https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) (Supplementary Table S2 and Figure S2).
    The surface residue at harvest is calculated as: (1) (2) where Sur_residuei is
    the surface residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of the ith type of crop at the harvest;
    Yieldi and Sur_mi are the yield (kg [dry matter] ha−1) and above-ground biomass
    (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of ith type of crop at maturity, respectively; and HIi
    is the harvest index of ith type of crop, which is explained in detail in Table
    S3. The root residue at harvest is calculated as: (3) where Root_residuei is the
    root residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of the ith type of crop at the harvest, and
    RSratio is the root-to-shoot ratio, for which a constant value of 0.4 is used.
    The decomposition of surface and root residues is analyzed using a first-order
    exponential model [55] as: (4) where Residuet and Residue0 are the surface or
    root residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) at time t and the harvest, respectively; and
    k is the decomposition rate of surface or root residue and are assumed to be the
    same. Fig. 3 shows the percentages of surface/root residue remaining at different
    times. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download full-size

    alfalfa from Schomberg and Steiner [57]; peanut from Mulvaney et al. [58]; millet
    from Soratto et al. [59]; and Barley from Loomis et al. [60]. Triticale uses the
    value of winter wheat, and hay and grass use the value of alfalfa. 2.3.2. Planting
    details Some screenshots of idCROP are provided in Fig. 4 to illustrate its capabilities.
    To ensure robust crop growth and production simulation, the app sets a soft warning
    if the entered planting date is outside the dates specified by the crop insurance
    window (April 15 - June 20) and a hard warning if the entered date is 2-4 weeks
    beyond the dates specified by the crop insurance window (April 1- July 5). The
    emergence date is calculated based on an accumulation of 70 daily heat units after
    planting with a temperature threshold of 60 ℉ (15.6 °C) (i.e., DD60) (Eq. S1 in
    Supplementary Material). Row spacing and seed rate data are required from users
    to calculate plant population at seeding (Eq. S2). The idCROP tool automatically
    calculates the population at emergence based on an 82% emergence rate [61] using
    Eq. S3, but advanced users can set the emergence rate by themselves. A simple
    procedure to estimate this parameter is provided if users click the ‘show advanced’
    button (Fig. 4c-d). Download : Download high-res image (788KB) Download : Download

    For irrigation setup, idCROP provides three options, including low energy precision
    application (LEPA), low elevation spray application (LESA), and mid-elevation
    spray application (MESA). The irrigation efficiency of each system was estimated
    as the mean value of efficiencies reported in published studies (Table S3). 2.3.3.
    Management practices After setting the initial conditions and planting details,
    users can define management practices, including irrigation, tillage, fertilizer,
    and chemicals application dates and amounts. The available options for each management
    practice are detailed in Table S1. The data on tillage depth for each application
    method is taken from Neitsch et al. [62] (Table S5). The details about the method
    and depth of fertilizer and chemical application are included in Table S6. 2.4.
    Environmental data 2.4.1. Soil files To provide field-scale soil input data, the
    Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data and the NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were
    used to identify dominant soil types in cotton acreages in the Texas Rolling Plains
    region. The dominant soil types are detailed in Table S7. Soil properties such
    as soil texture, bulk density, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil pH, and
    cation exchange capacity for the identified soils were obtained from the Official
    Soil Series Descriptions [63]. Other soil information such as the field capacity
    (referred to as drained upper limit in DSSAT), wilting point (lower limit), soil
    water at saturation, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated using
    the Soil-Plant-Air-Water model [64]. Soil root growth factor, an important input
    for each soil layer that reflects physical or chemical constraints on root growth
    in certain soil layers [65], was estimated using a function in the DSSAT soil
    file creation utility program (i.e., SBuild) based on soil texture, bulk density
    and soil organic carbon [66]. The initial soil moisture was assumed to be 65%
    of the available water content. The developed soil files were included in idCROP
    so that user can select a soil type that is similar in soil properties to the
    soil on user''s farm. 2.4.2. Cultivar parameter files The crop modules in the
    DSSAT-CSM require genotype coefficients for different maturity groups to mimic
    their growth and development. Cotton genotype coefficients were developed for
    three maturity groups (i.e., early, early-mid, and mid-full) using variety trial
    data of 45 cultivars from 10 stations collected by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension
    over five growing seasons (2016-2020) [67]. Measured data from irrigated sites
    and dryland sites were used for calibration and validation, respectively, for
    different maturity groups. As shown in Table 2, the calibrated coefficients captured
    the variation in growing season length and differences in growth patterns among
    the maturity groups. The developed cultivar files were included in idCROP so users
    can select the maturity group that best represents the cultivar they plant. Table

    bias error (Eq. S5). 2.5. Real-time weather forecasts To provide real-time weather
    forecasts throughout the growing season, idCROP combines four weather data sources:
    (1) historical weather data, (2) real-time data, (3) forecasted daily short-term
    weather data for 16 days, and (4) forecasted daily seasonal weather data for six
    months. Historical weather data until the day before the date of simulation (or
    app use) was obtained from the nearest West Texas Mesonet weather station [68].
    Missing weather data was filled with two other sources, including the National
    Climatic Data Center data [69] and the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR)
    data [70]. For real-time data, on-site weather station can be set up by the users
    who choose to deploy sensors. For the users without on-site weather station, idCROP
    would automatically obtain real-time data from the nearest West Texas Mesonet
    weather station. Daily short-term forecasted weather data was obtained from the
    Global Forecast System (GFS) for a 16-day period [71]. GFS provides global weather
    forecast every six hours with a 0.5° spatial resolution and 3-hr temporal resolution,
    including daily maximum temperature (Tmax), daily minimum temperature (Tmin),
    precipitation, and solar radiation. The most recent forecast cycle was used for
    the real-time forecast. Daily forecasted seasonal weather data was obtained for
    six months from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) forecasting system.
    NMME is an experimental real-time seasonal forecast system, which provides daily
    global weather forecasts with an 11-month lead time at 1° spatial resolution (approximately
    110 km at the equator) based on ensemble simulations (10 ensembles for each model)
    of several state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models (GCMs). An improved
    statistical downscaling method with corrections for both mean and variability
    [72,73] was used to produce daily data at a 1-km resolution (Eq. S6). The GFS
    hindcast data (2008-2019) and Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries
    (DAYMET, version 4) (2008-2019) at 1 km resolution were used for calibration of
    downscaled data. As shown in Fig. 5, the downscaled GFS data captured the variations
    of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation very well at the farm level. The calibrated parameters
    for the short forecast downscaling method can be found in Fig. S3-S5. Download

    and DAYMET data (1982-2010) were used for validation of the downscaling parameters
    for the seasonal weather forecasts using the same statistical downscaling method
    that is being used for the validation of short-term weather forecasts. In the
    current version of idCROP, we have successfully downscaled data from one NMME
    model (i.e., Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model version 4, CanCM4) [74], to
    1 km spatial resolution over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS). As shown in Fig. 6,
    the original CanCM4 data overestimated Tmax and Tmin in most regions. The downscaled
    CanCM4 data captured the seasonal variation of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation at
    the farm level. The calibrated parameters for the seasonal forecast downscaling
    method can be found in Figs. S6 - S8. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    of each year. Comparisons of (c) monthly maximum temperature, (f) monthly minimum

    the Texas Rolling Plains region. A step-by-step procedure for generating updated
    daily weather forecasts covering the entire growing season is depicted in Fig.
    7. For the short-term (16-day) forecasted data from GFS, daily Tmax, Tmin, precipitation,
    and solar radiation were calculated as the maximum, minimum, sum, and mean of
    the sub-daily forecasts, respectively, from the most recent forecast cycle at
    0.5° × 0.5° spatial resolution. The 0.5° × 0.5° resolution data was then downscaled
    to 1 km using the calibrated downscaling parameters. Download : Download high-res
    image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Flowchart showing weather
    data inputs and processing in idCROP. For the seasonal forecast (up to six months),
    the ensemble means were first calculated to produce the daily weather forecast
    at 1° × 1° spatial resolution. The 1° × 1° data was then downscaled to 1 km using
    the validated downscaling parameters. The forecasted seasonal solar radiation
    data is not available from the data source, and hence it was calculated using
    Tmax, Tmin, and extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra) data as suggested by Allen
    et al. [75]. The historic weather data file starts several months before the planting
    date, ensuring the warm-up of the DSSAT model. The real-time and short-term weather
    files were updated daily, and the seasonal forecast weather file was updated monthly.
    The forecasted data would be replaced by the newly available real-time weather
    data as the growing season progresses to improve the reliability of crop yield
    and irrigation water requirement predictions. 2.6. Economic model The economic
    model in idCROP was developed based on an enterprise budget approach, which provides
    visual analytics for irrigation decision support and tradeoff analysis. It combines
    farm input and output data with corresponding prices from online sources. Users
    can compare the net returns for selected irrigation levels and understand net
    return changes due to price fluctuation. Net returns were defined as the difference
    between total revenues and total variable and fixed costs. The total revenues
    for selected irrigation levels are based on the simulated crop yield and the crop
    price at the harvest. The lint and seed yields were estimated as 58.6% and 41.4%
    of the DSSAT-simulated seed cotton yield, respectively [76]. Both seed and lint
    prices were decided based on market prices as mentioned below. Then, the net returns
    for selected irrigation levels (NRj, $ per ha) are calculated as follows: (5)
    where Yij is the lint or seed yield at the selected irrigation level j simulated
    by DSSAT, kg ha−1; Pi is the price for lint or seed at harvest, $ ha−1; Variable_costmj
    is the mth type of variable cost at the selected irrigation level j, $ per ha;
    and Fixed_costnj is the nth type of fixed cost at the selected irrigation level
    j. Variable costs include expenses on seed, fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides,
    labor, fuel, machine repair and maintenance, irrigation application, custom hired
    machinery, and equipment for planting and chemical applications if applicable,
    insurance, interest, and custom harvest. Fixed costs include depreciation and
    opportunity costs of planting, tillage and spraying machinery and equipment, irrigation
    equipment, other assets, and land lease costs if applicable. These data were obtained
    from the enterprise budget for Texas A&M AgriLife Extension District 3 [77], which
    is embedded in idCROP by default. These prices can also be adjusted by users based
    on their own farm-level data or their own regional enterprise budget. Typical
    variable and fixed costs are detailed in Table S8 and Table S9. To provide more
    accurate estimates of total revenues, harvest crop prices were estimated using
    the contract future market price at harvest time plus/minus the average price
    basis for each location during harvest. The default cotton future market prices
    were based on the future market contracts from the New York market [78]. Users
    can also adjust the harvest prices based on their price marketing strategy for
    that season. Additionally, idCROP allows users to evaluate the net return changes
    at alternative price levels by performing sensitivity analysis using the above-mentioned
    harvest price as basis (i.e., harvest price ±20%) for selected irrigation levels.
    The app also provides breakeven prices (i.e., the minimum price required to cover
    variable costs, Eq. 6) and total costs (Eq. 7), for selected irrigation levels.
    (6) (7) 2.7. Crop model-based irrigation scheduling algorithm in idCROP For crop
    model-based irrigation scheduling, future irrigation scheduling throughout the
    growing season is predicted using the ET-based automatic irrigation algorithm
    in DSSAT (i.e., setting IRRIG = E in DSSAT). For the ET-based automatic irrigation,
    the accumulation of ET demand (ACCUM_ET) was updated daily, which was calculated
    as the daily potential plant transpiration plus actual soil evaporation minus
    infiltration from rainfall. The idCROP app sets an ET demand threshold of 25 mm
    (i.e., IMDEP =25) and irrigation is triggered if ACCUM_ET ≥ 25 mm. Then, the irrigation
    amount is the accumulated ET demand multiplied by the deficit percentage (ITHRU)
    (i.e., ACCUM_ET × ITHRU/100). The ITHRU is determined by the user. For example,
    if a user wants to apply 90% ET replacement (i.e., ITHRU=90), then the irrigation
    amount is 0.9 × ACCUM_ET. The lower threshold of available water (ITHRL) is set
    as 20 to ensure a low ET replacement strategy (e.g., 30% ET) can be successfully
    executed by DSSAT. In addition, the minimum number of days between irrigation
    events is kept at three to avoid unreasonable results. The DSSAT parameter setting
    for different irrigation strategies is detailed in Table 3. When actual irrigations
    differ from idCROP scenarios, corrections on appropriate dates can be entered
    and confirmed. Table 3. Crop model-based irrigation scheduling setting in idCROP.

    3. Results 3.1. Major outputs of idCROP Major outputs of idCROP include irrigation
    schedules, seasonal irrigation requirements, estimated water use efficiency, and
    expected yield and net returns. Water use efficiency is defined as the yield produced
    per unit of water applied. Fig. 8 illustrates the major outputs of idCROP under
    different irrigation strategies (i.e., 0%, 30%, 60%, and 90% ET replacements).
    With these outputs, users can compare the simulation output intuitively and choose
    an irrigation strategy that best fits their irrigation capacity, yield, and economic
    goals. Download : Download high-res image (770KB) Download : Download full-size

    First, historical weather data from 1991 to 2020 are used to test the performance
    of crop model-based irrigation scheduling algorithm in idCROP under different
    irrigation strategies. As shown in Fig. 9, seed cotton yield showed an increasing
    trend as the ET-replacement level increased from 0% to 100%, and the corresponding
    seasonal irrigation amount also consistently increased as the irrigation level
    increased. Also, a reasonable number of irrigation events were obtained for all
    irrigation strategies. These results demonstrated that the crop model-based irrigation
    scheduling algorithms could effectively simulate the irrigation amount and timing.

    irrigation depth; and (c) number of irrigation events. Boxplots show the 25th,
    50th, 75th percentiles, and extremes. The prediction reliability of the crop model-based
    irrigation decision support system in idCROP was then tested at the Chillicothe
    Research Station in the 2020 growing season. As shown in Fig. 10a-c, the seasonal
    weather forecast captured the variation of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation during
    the growing season. To investigate the reliability of idCROP at different lead
    times, predictions of seed cotton yield, seasonal irrigation demand, and precipitation
    with 0 to 5-month lead times were further examined (Fig. 10d-f). The cotton growing
    season in the Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions generally starts from
    May and continues to October, suggesting a 5-month lead time. Even at the beginning
    of the season (lead 5-month), idCROP can provide reasonable yield, seasonal irrigation,
    and precipitation forecasts with relative errors ranging from 14% to 18%. For
    seed cotton yield prediction, idCROP showed better performance as time proceeded
    in the growing season. However, seasonal irrigation requirements showed relatively
    large variability due to the combined effect of predicted temperature and precipitation.

    outputs from idCROP for the experiment at the Chillicothe Research Station during
    the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons are illustrated in Fig. 11. Seed cotton yield
    showed an increasing trend as the ET-replacement level increased from 0% to 90%
    ET replacement, and the corresponding total costs consistently increased likewise
    as more irrigation was applied (Fig. 11a). The highest net return was found using
    the 90% ET replacement. A detailed analysis of different fixed (22%) and variable
    costs (78%) for the 90% ET replacement is also provided in Fig. 11b. Custom machine
    hires accounted for the largest proportion (39%) of total costs. Download : Download

    (c) sensitivity analysis of net return; and (d) breakeven prices for different
    lint yields. Sensitivity analysis of the net returns at different harvest prices
    is illustrated in Fig. 11c, which shows changes in net return due to price fluctuation.
    In addition, idCROP provides breakeven prices at different lint yields (Fig. 11d).
    With this information, users can identify the paths to increase their profits
    and secure financial incentives with limited irrigation. 4. Discussion Compared
    to existing irrigation decision support systems, idCROP has several advantages,
    including (1) high-resolution and improved real-time weather forecasts combining
    historic, real-time, and short-term (16-day) and seasonal (6-month) forecasted
    weather; (2) an advanced economic model, enabling the calculation of net returns
    and breakeven prices with consideration of price-cost variability. Users can compare
    the simulation output intuitively and choose an irrigation strategy that best
    fits their irrigation capacity, yield, and economic goals and also switch from
    one strategy to other depending on changes in irrigation water availability at
    any time during the growing season; (3) improved site-specific accuracy by combining
    crop model-based irrigation scheduling with on-farm, non-contact sensor data that
    can be used to improve the irrigation schedules. Currently, the short-term and
    seasonal weather forecasts have already been calibrated over the CONUS at 1-km
    resolution, which has not been incorporated into currently available irrigation
    scheduling systems. This forecasted weather can be corrected with on-site weather
    data as the growing season progresses, enabling a reliable weather forecast covering
    the growing season. idCROP updates and extends the economic analysis by providing
    crop net returns estimates, price sensitivity analysis, and breakeven prices based
    on enterprise budgets by combining farm input and output data with corresponding
    prices from online sources. These economic analyses enable users to choose an
    irrigation strategy that best fits their irrigation capacity and secure financial
    incentives, which is also not available in any existing irrigation scheduling
    decision support systems [8]. Along with the tool, a ticket-based response system
    is implemented and maintained to capture and document the status of all user inquiries,
    suggestions, and trouble reports. This feedback will help prioritize modifications/refinements
    of the system moving forward. The app performance for sensor-based irrigation
    scheduling has not been rigorously tested and verified. In the 2020 and 2021 cotton
    growing seasons, preliminary data were gathered on the WDI water stress index
    using a pivot-mounted sensor at the Chillicothe Research Station. The calculation
    of WDI is detailed in section S4 and Table 10. The data from 2020 indicated a
    strong relationship between WDI and water stress in cotton (Fig. 12a). A relatively
    stable WDI trend in the four ET-based water management regimes was observed when
    the soil between crop rows was not visible to the temperature sensor mounted on
    the phenotyping system (shortly after 60 days of planting). Efforts to address
    the issue before canopy closure are in progress, and the preliminary data in 2021
    (not shown) with nearly bare soil surface showed a relatively stable WDI trend
    under irrigated conditions. The strong relationship between the seasonal average
    WDI and observed cotton seed yield (Fig. 12b) can help us determine WDI thresholds
    for triggering irrigation based on the expected yield/water use. These results
    lead us to conclude that WDI, a modified CWSI method that accounts for canopy
    coverage, can be reliably used as an indicator in precision deficit irrigation
    management. Other preliminary data from the same phenotyping system has shown
    spectral reflectance sensors to be highly accurate in estimating canopy coverage.
    With temperature and spectral reflectance sensors mounted directly to a pivot
    irrigation system, WDI can provide a precise irrigation schedule according to
    the desired level of water deficit, especially when paired with model predictions
    of crop growth and water use. Taghvaeian et al. [8] analyzed irrigation scheduling
    practices in the U.S. in the past ten years and pointed out that water and energy
    could be significantly saved if plant sensor-based methods are part of the irrigation
    scheduling toolsets. Download : Download high-res image (238KB) Download : Download

    management regimes as a function of time (a) and the relationship between seasonal
    average WDI and cotton seed yield (b) during the 2020 growing season at Chillicothe,
    TX. There are several limitations in the current version of idCROP. First, the
    utility of the existing idCROP app prototype is limited to cotton production in
    the Texas Rolling Plains region. However, more crops simulated by DSSAT and any
    field in the CONUS can be added in the future. This can be done by including additional
    information related to soils, cultivars, and crop management, as well as extending
    the geographic extent for the creation of automated weather data files. Second,
    the seasonal weather forecast shows considerable uncertainties, especially for
    precipitation. To reduce the uncertainty in seasonal weather forecasts, we will
    include other NMME models that are being updated every month, including Community
    Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) [79], and Goddard Earth Observing System
    (GEOS-5) [80]. Third, the continued availability of real-time and short-term forecasted
    weather data for the app could sometimes be challenging. This challenge could
    be overcome by setting different priority levels for different weather sources.
    For example, weather data from an on-site weather station, if available, would
    be given the highest priority for historic and current weather data, followed
    by data from the nearest weather station (e.g., West Texas Mesonet), NCDC station,
    and NARR gridded dataset. If these data are not available, the short-term and
    seasonal forecasted data can be used as backup data. Conclusions The idCROP tool
    simplifies the application of DSSAT cropping system model for irrigation scheduling
    with minimal inputs required from the user. Users can provide just basic management
    information such as planting date, row spacing, seed rate, cultivar types, irrigation,
    fertilizer, and chemical applied date and amounts. To provide more realistic soil
    data, idCROP identifies dominant soil types using SSURGO and CDL datasets and
    specifies soil physical properties using the Official Soil Series Descriptions.
    The idCROP app pairs historic and forecasted weather throughout the growing season
    along with recorded irrigations to provide reliable irrigation recommendations
    that are optimized in real-time. The app generates prescriptions for several irrigation
    strategies that users can compare to know how different irrigation schedules affect
    the yield and net returns. We have also tested on-farm sensors mounted on pivot
    irrigation systems to improve the accuracy of irrigation recommendations, although
    the app can be used without the additional sensor data. The prototype idCROP app
    has been deployed to a small group of evaluators on both iOS and Android mobile
    devices. Although the utility of the existing idCROP app prototype is limited
    to cotton production in the Texas Rolling Plains region, more crops and any field
    in the CONUS can be added to idCROP in the future with additional information
    related to soils, cultivars, and crop management, as well as extending the geographic
    extent for the creation of automated weather data files. Supplementary information

    various parameters used in idCROP, downscaling methods, and water deficit index
    calculation in addition to 10 tables and 8 figures. Declaration of Competing Interest

    High-resolution soil moisture (SM) products are crucial for managing water in
    agricultural regions, irrigation scheduling, and land–atmosphere model simulations.
    Most satellite-based SM products have spatial resolutions in the tens of kilometers,
    which cannot satisfy the aforementioned applications, and there is an urgent need
    to disaggregate them to fine spatial resolutions. Currently, disaggregation method
    based on multi-source data fusion tend to be robust, but the following difficulties

    in space and time which hinder the applications; 2) only one model-based product
    is used in the fusion process and different model-based products were not sufficiently
    evaluated. To overcome these problems, this work developed an SM disaggregation
    methodology. The best model-based SM product was first assessed using the triple
    collocation (TC) method, which allows us to obtain the weight of individual product.
    The model-based and microwave SM products were combined based on weight to produce

    1. Introduction The regulation of water-heat exchange at the land–atmosphere interface
    is significantly impacted by soil moisture (SM), thus making it an essential climatic
    and ecological variable (Humphrey et al., 2021). In agriculture, excessive SM
    lead to waterlogging, while insufficient SM result in drought (Liu et al., 2018).
    Both conditions adversely affect crop growth, highlighting the close relationship
    between SM and food security. In terms of land surface/hydrological modeling,
    the assimilation of SM data improves model state estimation (Yin et al., 2023).
    Additionally, SM can be used as a constraint to parameterize the model to prevent
    the phenomenon of “same result with different parameters” (Rajib et al., 2016).
    In climate, existing research indicates that SM significantly improves rainfall
    forecast, especially in extreme events (van den Hurk et al., 2012). Moreover,
    spatiotemporally continuous SM is beneficial to climate change analysis (Seneviratne
    et al., 2010). All these domains necessitate SM data with high spatiotemporal
    resolution, precision, and continuity to serve their application needs. Since
    soil dielectric constant measured by microwave is directly correlated with SM,
    and the microwave band has the characteristics of all-day, all-weather measurement
    and penetration of vegetation (Ulaby et al., 1981), it is widely regarded as the
    primary wavelength for SM monitoring (Ma et al., 2023). Microwave satellites have
    two different types of sensors: active (radar, scatterometer) and passive (radiometer-based).
    Although the active microwave has a high spatial resolution, it is susceptible
    to factors such as surface roughness, vegetation, and speckle noise, and has a
    relatively long satellite revisit period (Ambrosone et al., 2020, Wang et al.,
    2022). In contrast, the passive microwave technique offers a high temporal resolution
    and its retrieval algorithms are more mature, yet its application is restricted
    to the resolution of tens of kilometers. In addition, it is possible to create
    model-based SM products with spatial integrity and temporal continuity by utilizing
    data assimilation techniques and driving land surface models. However, like passive
    microwave data, model-based products also have relatively coarse spatial resolution.
    For example, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) resolution is 0.25°
    (Rodell et al., 2004), the ERA5-Land resolution is 0.1° (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019),
    and China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS)
    has a resolution of 0.0625° (Shi et al., 2011). More importantly, improper parameter
    settings, model structure, and the forcing data uncertainty, affect the accuracy
    of the products and require evaluation of various model-based products in different
    regions (Fan et al., 2022, Zeng et al., 2015). Due to the coupled influence of
    human activity, underlying surface conditions, and climate change, SM exhibits
    significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Coarse spatial resolution microwave
    and model-based products are not entirely capable of describing this heterogeneity,
    and need to be disaggregated to produce SM products with higher spatiotemporal
    resolution. Currently, there are three main disaggregation methods (Peng et al.,
    2017, Qu et al., 2020). The first is based on geospatial information data (Ranney
    et al., 2015), but it requires a large amount of station data to establish the
    relationship. The second is model-based approach, including statistical model
    (Kim and Barros, 2002) and land surface/hydrological model (Vergopolan et al.,
    2020). However, statistical models are not universally applicable, and the process
    of constructing land surface/hydrological models is complex, requiring a substantial
    amount of driving data. The third is a multi-source data fusion approach, which
    has been extensively used in recent disaggregation studies. For example, Song
    et al. disaggregated the AMSR-2 data to 1 km by geographically weighted regression
    (Song et al., 2019). To disaggregate SMAP observations, Wei et al. employed a
    gradient-boosted decision-tree regression model through a high-resolution SM index
    (Wei et al., 2019). Long et al. leveraged microwave and CLDAS SM products as background
    fields, and developed an effective SM disaggregation method by random forest (Long
    et al., 2019). Based on remote sensing, ERA5-Land, and in-situ data, Huang et
    al. generated a spatiotemporally continuous surface SM product (Huang et al.,
    2022). However, there are three main limitations to existing disaggregation studies
    based on multi-source data fusion in obtaining highly accurate, high spatiotemporal
    resolution and spatially complete SM products: 1) some studies disaggregated individual
    passive microwave SM product (e.g., SMAP, AMSR-2). However, such passive products
    suffer from spatial and temporal missing due to their operation orbit and revisit
    intervals, hence the derived disaggregation products also inherit these deficiencies.
    Some studies have addressed this issue by introducing model-based data, but they
    do not evaluate different model-based products to choose the most suitable one
    for the study region; 2) many studies employ machine learning techniques to merge
    various SM products. However, the internal mechanisms of machine learning are
    not as well defined and it is difficult to accurately characterize the error in
    each product; 3) optical/infrared products as auxiliary data are susceptible to
    impacts from cloud masking, atmospheric effects, and vegetation coverage, resulting
    in invalid grids. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, this study contributes
    to the following three components: 1) three mainstream model-based SM products
    (GLDAS, CLDAS, and ERA5-Land) were individually combined with microwave active
    and passive data to form three sets of triplets. Through triple collocation (TC)
    analysis, the model-based products were compared, and the product with the smallest
    error was selected; 2) depending on the error variance derived from triple collocation
    analysis, the selected model-based, microwave active, and microwave passive products
    were optimally fused through least squares merging and Pearson correlation-based
    determination scheme to produce reliable 25 km daily seamless SM products; 3)
    the temporal correlation and spectral similarity among images were explored by
    spatiotemporal interpolation and the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance
    fusion model (ESTARFM) to complement the missing in optical/infrared products
    and generate daily seamless auxiliary data at 1 km. Finally, the geographically
    weighted regression (GWR) model with local regression capability was employed
    to disaggregate the 25 km TC-merged product by the auxiliary data, resulting in
    daily seamless SM product at 1 km. 2. Study area The Shandian River Basin, which
    is in the intersection of Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    in China, was chosen as the study area (Fig. 1). This area boasts a diverse range
    of land cover types that includes farmland, grasslands, forests, and small amounts
    of shrubs and bare land. The climatic type of the study area is temperate continental,
    characterized by cold, dry winters and wet, rainy summers, with an average annual
    precipitation of 300–500 mm. As a result, there are significant seasonal variations
    in SM (Wang et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res image (987KB) Download

    River Basin. A wireless sensor network measuring SM in the Shandian River Basin
    consists of 34 stations that operate at three different scales: 100 km, 50 km,
    and 10 km. As this study involves different scales of SM products (25 km, 6.25
    km, and 1 km), the area can satisfy different scales of product validation. Decagon
    5TM SM sensors are used at each station, and measurements are taken at five depths.
    In this study, the 5 cm depth data is used to match the SM products. In addition,
    the final study range was chosen between 41° − 43°N and 115° − 117.5°E to facilitate
    data fusion. 3. Data and methodology 3.1. Multi-source soil moisture and auxiliary
    data 3.1.1. Microwave soil moisture The ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project
    provided the microwave SM products used in this study, which includes active,
    passive, and combined products at 25 km. Annual updates by the CCI SM team have
    resulted in 13 releases so far, each of which added new sensors and extended the
    time series (Gruber et al., 2019). In this study, both active and passive microwave
    products were selected to participate in the triple collocation calculations,
    they include mainstream active and passive sensors. 3.1.2. Model-based soil moisture
    (i) CLDAS The CLDAS product depends on data fusion and assimilation methods by
    atmospheric products to drive different land surface models, and in turn the values
    simulated by these models are ensemble averaged to obtain the surface state variables.
    The CLDAS near real-time SM product was chosen for this study, with 0.0625° spatial
    resolution at a daily or hourly time scale. To match the microwave data, the daily
    data from 0 to 5 cm depth was selected and resampled to 25 km. Moreover, hourly
    CLDAS land surface temperature (LST) was used in the ESTARFM fusion process. (ii)
    GLDAS The GLDAS product is developed by NASA to provide an optimal field for land
    surface conditions and fluxes, it contains the products of three land surface
    models (Catchment, VIC, and Noah). This study used SM product simulated by Noah
    model, which vertically divided into four layers with 0.25° spatial resolution
    at 3-hour temporal scale. Similarly, to match the satellite products, the top
    layer (0–10 cm) was selected, and the 3-hour data were averaged on a daily scale.
    (iii) ERA5-Land ERA5-Land product has higher spatial and temporal resolutions
    (0.1°, hourly), more output parameters, more advanced forecast models, and data
    assimilation technology than ERA5. This study utilized the top layer (0–7 cm)
    of the ERA5-Land SM product. Same as the aforementioned product, the ERA5-Land
    product was resampled to 25 km and temporally averaged to a daily scale. 3.1.3.
    Auxiliary data (i) MODIS products The nighttime MYD11A1 product offered the LST
    in this study, which has a local overpass time of around 1:30 AM. For the enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI), by combining 16-day EVI data from MYD13A2 and MOD13A2,
    an 8-day EVI product at 1 km can be obtained. Furthermore, the land cover type
    product (MCD12Q1) was used and the IGBP classification layer was chosen to participate
    in the error calculation. (ii) DEM The multi-temporal interpolation and GWR disaggregation
    process used the STRM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as auxiliary data. 3.2.
    Methodology The method of this study comprises three parts (Fig. 2): 1) assessment
    of the optimal model-based product and analysis of each product''s error variance
    using the TC methods. Based on error variance, the model-based, active microwave,
    and passive microwave products are optimally merged to produce a daily seamless
    SM product at 25 km; 2) development of daily seamless EVI product by linear interpolation
    and daily seamless LST product through iterative multi-temporal reconstruction
    and ESTARFM method, forming a 1 km seamless auxiliary dataset; 3) utilization
    of the GWR method to disaggregate the TC-merged product by the auxiliary dataset

    disaggregated methodology to obtain 1 km daily seamless SM by combining triple
    collocation, iterative multi-temporal interpolation, and geographically weighted
    regression. 3.2.1. Developing 25 km daily seamless soil moisture To produce the
    25 km daily seamless SM product, all products were first bias corrected to unify
    the value ranges, and then the optimal model-based product was evaluated by the
    triple collocation algorithm, while the error variance of each product was obtained.
    According to the error variance, the least squares merging technique was used
    to further calculate each product''s weight. Finally, for a more reliable merge,
    data were merged under different scenarios by considering the relevant significance
    levels. (i) Bias correction Differences in sensor frequency, observation principles,
    and inversion algorithms lead to certain systematic biases among different SM
    products. This study applied the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching
    technique to eliminate statistical moment differences between the two datasets
    (Reichle and Koster, 2004). Since model-based data have high spatiotemporal continuity,
    they are widely used as reference data in bias correction. All SM products involved
    in TC calculations were matched with model-based products by the CDF technique,
    so that they had the same value range and distribution. In addition, the reference
    data quality affects the merged product’s accuracy (Afshar et al., 2019), therefore
    it is necessary to evaluate different model-based products. (ii) Evaluation and
    uncertainty estimation of model-based products The TC method has the advantage
    of not relying on “true values” and can estimate the error of each product independently.
    This method has been extensively applied to calculate errors of hydrological variables
    such as precipitation (Lyu et al., 2021), evapotranspiration (Khan et al., 2018),
    and SM (Gruber et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2023, Wu et al., 2021). It is called “triple
    collocation” because the three data need to be paired together to form a triple
    in the calculation. An important principle of triple collocation is that the errors
    between the data must be uncorrelated. In this study, three triplets were constructed,
    namely 1) CLDAS - passive - active, 2) GLDAS - passive- active, and 3) ERA5-Land
    - passive- active. In each triplet, the data are model-based, passive microwave,
    and active microwave, which have different data sources and algorithms, thus fulfilling
    the prerequisite of uncorrelated errors. Moreover, these three triplets make three
    model-based products comparable. By comparing the results of three triplets, it
    is possible to assess the best model-based product and to obtain the relative
    error between each product. The calculation of TC is categorized into difference
    and covariance methods. This study chose the covariance method, which assumes
    the following principles between SM products and “true value”: 1) they are linearly
    correlated; 2) they are independent of each other in terms of error. According
    to the formula of covariance, the final formula of error variance () is: (1) where
    is random error variance, and are the variance of product and covariance between
    products, respectively. represent three SM products after CDF matching. Moreover,
    the following two points should be considered during TC calculation: 1) only grids
    with more than 100 samples in the time series retained for analysis; otherwise
    the results may be unreliable (Scipal et al., 2010); 2) when the error variance
    of one of the products is less than zero, the results of other products are not
    credible. Both cases may result in invalid grids. To ensure full coverage of the
    error variance, this study assigned the average error variance of valid grids
    in a given land cover type to the invalid grids of the same type. (iii) Weight
    estimation This study adopted the least squares merging method to estimate weights,
    which has been effectively used to merge SM (Gruber et al., 2017, Zeng et al.,
    2016), rainfall (Dong et al., 2020), and terrestrial water storage (Yin and Park,
    2021) products. The aim of least squares merging is to obtain the smallest error
    variance () of merged products and thus achieve an optimal merging of the different
    data, which takes the following form based on the TC estimates: (2) where is the
    weight of each product, and is the error variance calculated by the TC method.
    To obtain unbiased combined results, the sum of is 1. Then: (3) Letting and equal
    0, the weights for each product are: (4) When only two products are available,
    the weights for each product change to the following form: (5) (iv) Merging scheme
    considering significance levels The SM product generated in this study needed
    to meet two criteria: seamlessness and reliability. However, apart from the two
    unreliable situations mentioned in section 3.1.2, a weak correlation between one
    product in the triplet and the other two indicates a lower temporal coverage or
    poorer quality for that product, which would result in a low spatial coverage
    of the merged product. Hence, a scheme considering the relevant significance level
    (p-value < 0.05) was adopted to fulfill the seamless requirement of the merged
    product, which has been applied in previous studies (Gruber et al., 2017, Peng
    et al., 2021). The merging scheme is grid-based and consists of four scenarios
    (Table 1): 1) when all products are significantly correlated, a weighted average
    based on TC weights is used; 2) when a product shows strong correlation with two
    others, the value of that product is chosen; 3) when only two products are significantly
    correlated, the average value of these is calculated; and 4) when there is no
    significant correlation between the three products, the grid is generally ignored.
    For full spatial coverage, we filled in the gaps by utilizing model-based products
    that have continuity in both temporal and spatial. Table 1. Pearson correlation-based

    Generating 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data The objective of this section is
    to generate 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data. First, daily seamless EVI data
    were obtained through Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering (Savitzky and Golay, 1964)
    and linear interpolation methods. Second, seamless LST data were acquired by an
    iterative multi-temporal interpolation algorithm, and then the LST data were further
    extended to a daily scale by introducing the ESTARFM method. (i) Daily seamless
    EVI In this study, high-quality 16-day MODIS EVI (MYD13A2 and MOD13A2) products
    were selected. They were quality controlled and SG filtered to remove unreliable
    grids and then combined to generate an 8-day EVI. Moreover, linear interpolation
    was performed on the 8-day EVI in the time series to obtain daily seamless EVI,
    as there is a certain phenological regularity of vegetation growth. (ii) Daily
    seamless LST (a) Iterative multi-temporal interpolation The multi-temporal interpolation
    method supposes that the LST variation is highly consistent across grids with
    similar seasonal, elevation, and vegetation conditions (Song et al., 2019, Yu
    et al., 2015). Assuming a linear relationship between the variables, the following
    relationship exists between the two LST images obtained at close date intervals
    ( and ): (6) where is the EVI image on day, , , , and represent coefficients.
    According to the above principle, the LST images were first quality-controlled
    to remove unreliable grids. The LST images with above 90 % clear-sky grids were
    served as reference images (), and all images were the target images for interpolation
    (). The time interval between and was limited to 30 days to prevent significant
    seasonal changes. If this condition was not met, images from adjacent years were
    substituted. In addition, this study fully utilized all reference images with
    temporal intervals from the target image less than 30 days to perform an iterative
    interpolation operation. According to the principle of proximity of time intervals,
    the ones with shorter intervals were given priority. (b) ESTARFM Although seamless
    LST images can be obtained through iterative multi-temporal interpolation, the
    prerequisite is that the interpolated image must have LST values corresponding
    to the reference image. However, the proportion of clear-sky grids over the entire
    study area is zero on certain dates, these images cannot be processed by multi-temporal
    interpolation. Therefore, ESTARFM was introduced to deal with these dates, which
    takes the time trend of reflectance variations into account and integrates spectral
    and geographic similarities to reconstruct each grid. This method effectively
    fuses high-spatial and low-temporal resolution images with high-temporal and low-spatial
    resolution images to obtain high-spatiotemporal resolution data. It has been widely
    applied in the data fusion field (Abowarda et al., 2021, Long et al., 2020), and
    more descriptions of this model can be found in Zhu et al. (Zhu et al., 2010).
    In this study, the seamless interpolated LST (1 km, some dates missing) data were
    extended to the daily scale using the ESTARFM method by the CLDAS LST (∼6.25 km,
    daily) product. After the above process, all images had 99 % or higher clear-sky
    LST grids. To generate a seamless LST image, the remaining missing grids were
    filled by the inverse distance interpolation (IDW) method. 3.2.3. GWR disaggregation
    The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model utilizes regression coefficients
    to investigate spatially non-stationary relationships between variables (Brunsdon
    et al., 1996). In contrast to simple global regression methods, GWR follows the
    idea of local regression and the first law of geography. It calculates the weight
    relationship between each sample point and the target sample point by introducing
    a distance decay function to obtain the regression coefficient value. In recent
    years, there have been many studies using the GWR method to disaggregate different
    variables such as precipitation (Chen et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015), water storage
    changes (Chen et al., 2023), land surface temperature (Duan and Li, 2016, Wu et
    al., 2019), and soil moisture (Jin et al., 2018, Song et al., 2019). The formula
    for GWR is: (7) where are the locations of the ith grid, and denote the dependent
    and the kth independent variable of grid i, respectively. m is the total number
    of independent variables, denotes the residuals. and are the constant term and
    regression coefficients, respectively, they are calculated from: (8) where is
    the unbiased estimate of , X and Y represent the multi-dimensional and one-dimensional
    matrices of the independent and dependent variables, respectively. is a spatial
    weighting matrix, and T denotes the transpose. In this study, SM was the dependent
    variable, the daily seamless LST and EVI were obtained in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2,
    and DEM data were used as independent variables. The reasons for choosing these
    three factors are: 1) LST is related to water evaporation, the higher the LST,
    the faster the rate of evaporation; 2) EVI indicates the growth law of plants,
    which reduces evaporation and retains water in the soil; and 3) DEM affects water
    significantly, such as there is a significant difference between the water level
    of the shaded and sunny slopes. Many previous studies have selected these three
    factors to disaggregate SM (Hu et al., 2020, Song et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2019).
    This study also attempted to include other variables, such as slope factor, but
    the fitting effect did not significantly improve. Moreover, too many variables
    will lead to overfitting problems. Therefore, LST, EVI, and DEM were ultimately
    selected as independent variables. GWR was implemented by first resampling the
    LST, EVI, and DEM data to 25 km and fitting them to the merged data to produce
    the coefficients and residuals in Eq. (7). Then, the coefficients and residuals
    were interpolated to 1 km by cubic spline interpolation. Finally, the 1 km seamless
    daily SM product was obtained based on 1 km ancillary data. 4. Results and discussions
    4.1. Evaluation of model-based products To eliminate the influence caused by the
    choice of different reference data, this study rotated three products (CLDAS,
    GLDAS, and ERA5-Land) as reference data, yielding three groups of error results
    (Table 2). In general, the errors of passive and active data from different triplets
    should not differ significantly under the same reference data. However, as mentioned
    in section 3.1.2, when a product in a grid had a negative error variance, the
    results for the other products were invalid. This resulted in an inconsistent
    number of valid grids in different triplets, and the study area has a total of
    80 grids at 25 km scale. Therefore, the errors in active and passive data slightly
    differ across different triplets. Table 2. Error statistics of different triplets
    in the triple collocation. Group Reference product Triplet Error Number of valid
    grids Model-based CCI Passive CCI Active (1) CLDAS (C) C-P-A 0.021 0.042 0.033

    Land (E) C-P-A 0.019 0.028 0.022 67 G-P-A 0.027 0.026 0.024 67 E-P-A 0.048 0.025
    0.030 54 Note: P and A denote ESA CCI passive and active soil moisture product,
    respectively. For intra-group comparison, the C - P - A and G - P - A triplets
    have almost the same number of valid grids, so there is little difference between
    the errors in active and passive data in these two triplets. For example, in the
    first group, the error values for the passive products obtained from the C - P
    - A and G - P - A are 0.042 and 0.038, respectively, which only differ by 0.004.
    However, the number of valid grids for the E - P - A triplet is considerably lower,
    indicating that ERA5-Land may be unsuitable for TC analysis in this study. Moreover,
    comparing the three triplets in each group, ERA5-Land has the largest error and
    the CLDAS product has the smallest error, which supports the conclusion that CLDAS
    is more appropriate for China as it uses high-quality meteorological forcing data
    (Qin et al., 2017). Therefore, this study selected CLDAS as reference data and
    performed TC analysis with the CLDAS - passive -active combination. Based on the
    error results, the three products were fused to obtain a seamless daily SM product
    at 25 km. 4.2. Analysis of the merged microwave retrieved and model-based SM product
    To investigate the spatiotemporal variations of four SM products (CLDAS, CCI passive,
    CCI active, and TC-merged data), this study utilized Hovmöller diagram (Hovmöller,
    1949), which averages all values located at the same longitude/latitude, and is
    divided into a longitude/latitude axis showing spatial heterogeneity and a time
    axis indicating temporal variation. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 illustrate the spatiotemporal
    variations and coverage of the four SM products across latitudes and longitudes
    from 2019 to 2020, respectively. Numerically, the four products exhibited consistent
    trends in the time series: the soil began to freeze in November each year, resulting
    in low SM values, and as the temperature increased in March of the following year,
    the soil thawed and SM gradually increased. Overall, the active data had higher
    values, followed by the passive data, while CLDAS and TC-merged data had lower
    values. As latitude or longitude increased, no obvious change occurred in SM values,
    possibly due to the averaging process reducing spatial heterogeneity. In addition,
    the ESA CCI data were relatively scattered, with noticeable “jumps” between adjacent
    grids, whereas model-based and TC-merged data have a more continuous spatial distribution.
    This is because the model-based data were simulated from land surface models,
    which have the advantage of spatiotemporal continuity, the TC-merged data inherited
    this property. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download

    terms of spatiotemporal coverage, although the Hovmöller diagrams average all
    grids along the same longitude and latitude, there are still significant data
    gaps in both active and passive data (gray areas in Fig. 3, Fig. 4), mostly concentrated
    between November and March of the following year. There could be several factors
    for the data gaps in the microwave data, including (1) the validity of backscattering
    coefficients and brightness temperature; (2) the inability of radiative transfer
    models to converge in retrieving SM; (3) radio frequency interference (RFI); and
    (4) the impacts of freezing and thawing on soil. In summary, TC-merged data combines
    the strengths of the high spatiotemporal coverage of CLDAS with the high accuracy
    of microwave data. 4.3. Analysis of interpolated LST 4.3.1. Evolution of the interpolation
    process Fig. 5 illustrates the evolution of clear-sky grid coverage for LST data
    after each step of interpolation. For ease of presentation, only 2019 is depicted.
    Fig. 5 (a) displays the original clear-sky grid coverage of each LST image. The
    distribution of the points in the figure is highly dispersed, revealing varying
    degrees of missing data in the LST data. Among these images, a total of 98 images
    with clear-sky grid coverage over 90 % were selected as reference images for iterative
    multi-temporal interpolation. Fig. 5 (b) indicates that after iterative multi-temporal
    interpolation, the proportion of clear-sky grid in the LST image has been significantly
    improved, with most of them reaching 100 % and the rest around 99 %. Download

    Original (a) and interpolated coverage (b and c) for MODIS LST data in 2019. However,
    for images with zero ratio of the clear-sky grid (points with zero value in Fig.
    5 (b)), there is no LST value as a reference. Therefore, multi-temporal interpolation
    could not be employed. To address this issue, the ESTARFM method was introduced
    in this study, where MODIS LST data with zero proportion (15 days in total) were
    treated as high-resolution images and CLDAS LST data served as low-resolution
    data. MODIS LST values for the same day were predicted from the CLDAS LST images.
    In addition, to be consistent with the acquisition time of MODIS data at 1:30
    a.m., CLDAS LST measurements at 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. were averaged. After the
    above steps, only a few images had a small number of missing grids, which were
    filled in by the IDW algorithm. Eventually, 100 % clear-sky grid coverage was
    achieved for all images (Fig. 5 (c)), producing a 1 km daily seamless LST product.
    4.3.2. Validation of the interpolated LST This study used the CLDAS LST to evaluate
    the interpolated data, the quality of this dataset exceeds that of its international
    counterparts in China, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.8 K and an average
    correlation value of 0.98 when compared to ground-based measurements, thus providing
    a reliable validation data. At 1 km scale, the study area consists of 50,000 grids,
    and the correlation (R) between interpolated LST and CLDAS LST on the time series
    was calculated grid by grid. As shown in Fig. 6, the average correlation is 0.931,
    and most of the correlations reached above 0.9. These results demonstrate the
    validity and applicability of the interpolated LST data, which can serve as auxiliary
    data in the SM disaggregation process. Download : Download high-res image (187KB)

    (Disaggregated, TC-merged, CLDAS, CCI Passive, and CCI Active), interpolated LST
    and EVI data. Regarding the temporal trends, the five SM products exhibited similar
    patterns: in winter, the SM values were lower on January 23 because of frozen
    soil and sparse vegetation. Then, SM increased on April 21 as soil temperatures
    rose and snowmelt occurred. In summer, temperatures and evaporation rates continue
    to increase. However, as shown in the EVI figure, the lush vegetation growth in
    summer helps to reduce evaporation and increase water retention in soil. As a
    result, SM values peaked on July 23. Finally, SM gradually decreased as precipitation
    decreased and vegetation withered in the autumn. Compared to other SM products,
    the disaggregated product has a finer spatial resolution, which characterizes
    the spatial heterogeneity of SM within the grid. Meanwhile, the disaggregated
    product has completed spatial coverage. Therefore, the disaggregated product effectively
    captures the spatiotemporal characteristics of SM with higher spatial resolution,
    which contributes to local SM management. 4.4.2. Product comparison and validation
    with ground measurements (i) Comparison of products involved in this study A single
    validation metric cannot fully characterize the error of the product, therefore,
    four widely used statistical indicators were employed to validate the SM products
    (Entekhabi et al., 2010): (1) Pearson correlation (R), which reflects the degree
    of correspondence between the products and in-situ data; (2) Bias, which denotes
    that the product is drier or wetter compared to station data; (3) RMSE, the Root
    Mean Square Error, which indicates the degree of error dispersion; and (4) unbiased
    RMSE (ubRMSE), which measures the product’s accuracy by removing the bias from
    the RMSE. Fig. 8 portrays the statistical metrics between each SM product and
    the stations, and Table 3 lists the average statistical indicators for each product.

    0.044 0.072 0.751 0.034 Among the five products, the active product performs poorly,
    which may be influenced by factors including vegetation cover and surface roughness.
    For the ubRMSE, the top-ranked product was the TC-merged product, indicating that
    this study achieves optimal merging. The disaggregated product ranks second because
    the disaggregated product is obtained by disaggregating the TC-merged product,
    which is bound to lose a certain amount of accuracy in the process. The average
    ubRMSE of disaggregated products is 0.044 m3/m3, which essentially satisfies the
    0.04 m3/m3 accuracy criteria set by the Global Climate Observing System for SM
    products. For RMSE, the CCI passive product demonstrates best, with TC-merged
    and disaggregated products following closely behind. Regarding R, the CLDAS product
    exhibits the highest average value (0.782), closely followed by the disaggregated
    product (0.751). The difference between them is minimal, and they all correlate
    strongly with the station data, significantly surpassing other products. In terms
    of Bias, the disaggregated product ranks second with a comparatively low average
    bias value of 0.034 m3/m3. Moreover, all products except the CCI passive product
    overestimated SM values in the Shangdian River Basin, which is in accordance with
    the past study (Zheng et al., 2022). Therefore, considering all indicators comprehensively,
    the disaggregated product inherits the advantages of microwave and model-based
    products, exhibiting satisfactory accuracy. More importantly, it offers higher
    spatiotemporal resolution and coverage. For further comparison of the disaggregated,
    TC-merged, CLDAS, CCI passive, and active SM product, Fig. 9 depicts the temporal
    evolution of these products (dot markers) and site data (line markers) for 2019–2020,
    with a total of 34 in-situ sites in the study area. In this study, one site from
    each of the three networks, large, medium, and small, is selected for demonstration,
    and the sites are L1, M1, and S2. For the site data, the soil was frozen around
    November each year and gradually thawed in March of the following year. During
    this period, SM varied very gently. Throughout the time series, SM varies slightly
    between 0 and 0.03 m3/m3. SM values between the active and passive data are significantly
    different, and they hardly capture the dynamic changes in the site data. In contrast,
    CLDAS, TC-merged, and disaggregated data are well-matched to the stations. In
    addition, all but passive data overestimate SM to some extent, which is consistent
    with the above analysis. (ii) Comparison with other 1 km products Download : Download

    products covering the Shandian River Basin were compared. The first is the 1 km
    daily product produced by Fang et al. (2022), which used thermal inertia theory
    and MODIS data to disaggregate 9 km SMAP soil moisture data to 1 km. The second

    by Zheng et al. (2023), which disaggregated the ESA CCI product using the Random
    Forest algorithm with the help of ERA5 data. Table 4 shows that the 1 km product

    good performance in the Shandian River Basin. Table 4. Average values of validation

    a disaggregation methodology to combine the strengths of remote sensing and model-based
    products for SM estimation at fine-spatial resolution. The method consists of
    model-based data evaluation, seamless fusion of microwave and model-based SM data
    at 25 km, and SM disaggregation at 1 km with optical/infrared auxiliary variables.
    Based on the developed disaggregation methodology, this study produced three sets
    of valuable products: First, this study evaluates the potential of the triple
    collocation method to merge SM products at 25 km, by integrating the CCI active,
    CCI passive, and CLDAS products. CLDAS was chosen as it has the smallest error
    compared to other model-based products. The TC-merged product fully combines the
    strengths of the model-based and the microwave data, and it has a higher accuracy
    than the individual products, achieving the goal of optimal merging. Second, the
    1 km daily seamless interpolated LST product was developed by exploring spatial
    and spectral similarities between images using iterative multi-temporal interpolation
    and the ESTARFM method. After validation, the mean value of the correlation between
    the interpolated LST and the CLDAS LST was 0.931, indicating its validity and
    reliability. Finally, the 1 km daily seamless SM product was generated, by disaggregating
    25 km TC-merged SM data with the aid of 1 km ancillary data using the GWR algorithm.
    The disaggregated products captured the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity
    across the study area. Given the high spatiotemporal resolution, satisfactory
    accuracy, and spatial continuity, our developed algorithms and SM products have
    significant potential for applications in precision agriculture and hydrology
    domains. In this study, the coverage of CLDAS data is for the Asian region. When
    beyond this region, it necessitates the evaluation of alternative model-based
    products. Therefore, future research endeavors will concentrate on investigating
    the optimal model-based products in various regions, as well as comparing different
    disaggregation methods. CRediT authorship contribution statement Luyao Zhu: Conceptualization,

    • Many states with large irrigated areas had no published paper on sensor accuracy
    or application. • Sensor errors were sensitive to calibration used, but not the
    technology or installation orientation. • Sensor-based scheduling used less water
    compared to other scheduling practices and resulted in larger or similar yield.
    Abstract Soil water sensors (SWS) have been widely researched and practiced for
    irrigation scheduling. Due to popularity of this approach, there is a need for
    frequent reviews of the SWS literature to keep the researchers, extension professionals,
    and end-users updated and to help with defining and modifying future directions.
    In addition, existing literature reviews do not systematically report and summarize
    the results of previous studies. To address this gap, a systematic review was
    carried out to identify and analyze related literature published in the United
    States in the past two decades. Two focus areas were SWS accuracy assessment and
    SWS application in irrigation scheduling. The results showed that SWS accuracy
    was most susceptible to sensor calibration. The reported root mean square errors
    had similar ranges and means among different technologies, installation orientations,
    and study environments. Compared to other scheduling methods, SWS-based scheduling
    resulted in water saving, with average amounts ranging from 1 % when compared
    to canopy temperature methods to 38 % in case of traditional approaches. In addition,
    SWS-based scheduling led to larger or similar yields compared to other scheduling
    methods. Texas and Nebraska were the top two states in terms of the number of
    studies on SWS accuracy and irrigation scheduling. Previous article in issue Next

    been recognized as one of the most commonly used approaches in implementing scientific
    irrigation scheduling (Taghvaeian et al., 2020). A vast majority of these sensors
    in the last twenty years have been designed based on technologies relying on electrical
    resistivity and electromagnetic principles. Sensors based on electrical resistance
    indirectly measure soil water tension. These sensors measure changes in electrical
    resistance in soil media, which is calibrated against soil water tension from
    pressure plates or some other methods. On the other hand, sensors based on electromagnetic
    principles rely on dielectric properties of soil to estimate soil water content
    and employ a broad spectrum of methods operating at different frequencies such
    as time domain reflectometry, capacitance, and frequency domain reflectometry,
    to name a few (Evett et al., 2012). The effectiveness and applicability of SWS
    largely depend on their accuracies (Aguilar et al., 2015). Many previous studies
    have assessed the performance of a wide variety of SWS under variable agro-climatological
    conditions (Evett and Parkin, 2005, Ochsner et al., 2013). Some of the major factors
    affecting SWS accuracy are sensor technologies, calibrations used to convert raw
    data to soil water content, soil texture, soil salinity, and installation specifications.
    Minimizing the impact of these factors on SWS accuracy requires more studies to
    be conducted under variable soil and weather conditions. Besides the factors affecting
    accuracy, new SWS are continuously introduced and made commercially available
    by private companies and research organizations. These newer SWS replace older
    sensors and models, creating the need to conduct more experiments to assess their
    performance. Similarly, there is a continuous need to review the SWS accuracy
    studies to keep researchers, producers, and other stakeholders updated with the
    developments and assist them with the selection of the new sensors that would
    best suit their needs. Several review papers related to SWS in the context of
    United States (US) have been published in the past two decades. Most of these
    reviews have been focused on one of three areas: 1) soil water measurement technologies
    and underlying principles, 2) the advantages and disadvantages of different SWS
    technologies, and 3) how SWS accuracies change on a paper-to-paper basis. These
    review papers include Noborio (2001) and Robinson et al. (2003), which focused
    on time domain reflectometry, an emerging technology at that time that was receiving
    considerable attention from researchers. Later reviews by Evett and Parkin (2005),
    Robinson et al. (2008), Evett et al. (2012), Ochsner et al. (2013), and Cahn and
    Johnson (2017) provided discussions on more than one technology. Through evaluating
    previous review papers (listed above), three key limitations have been identified.
    Firstly, they did not summarize the findings of research studies in a way that
    could shed light on factors that influence SWS accuracy. Secondly, the majority
    of them did not go beyond the accuracy assessment and did not explore SWS utilization
    in practical irrigation scheduling. Finally, they did not review and compare scheduling
    based on SWS with other approaches. Addressing these three limitations in one
    paper requires an approach beyond traditional literature reviews. This is where
    systematic reviews have been proven successful by providing a more comprehensive
    and structured summary of the previous research studies (Aromataris and Pearson,
    2014). The goal of this systematic review was to identify and analyze related
    literature published in the past two decades on SWS and their applications in
    agricultural irrigation management and to provide future guidelines and directions
    for research and extension professionals, producers, government agencies, and
    other stakeholders. The specific objectives were: 1) to extract and summarize
    information on SWS accuracy and factors that influence accuracy, and 2) to review
    and synthesize information on SWS application in irrigation scheduling and how
    it compares with other approaches. The results of this systematic review highlight
    the aspects of SWS accuracy and utilization in irrigation scheduling that need
    more attention. Furthermore, this review could be useful policymakers to better
    prioritize and direct limited financial resources to promote SWS performance and
    use in irrigation scheduling. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Literature assimilation
    Two databases of Google Scholar and Scopus® were searched to identify previously
    published peer-reviewed journal manuscripts and conference papers related to SWS
    accuracy assessment and application in managing agricultural irrigation following
    the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
    guidelines (Page et al., 2021). The following keywords were used in the search
    process: soil sensor* irrigation, soil sensor* irrigation management, and soil
    sensor* irrigation scheduling. The asterisk truncation enabled the search engines
    to find both single and plural forms of a word in Scopus®. The resulting papers
    were screened based on the following criteria for inclusion: 1) papers published
    between January 2000 and July 2021; 2) studies conducted in the conterminous US;
    and 3) studies that either assessed the accuracy of one or more commercially available
    SWS for applications in agricultural irrigation scheduling or compared SWS-based
    irrigation scheduling with other scheduling methods or both. Exclusion criteria
    were: 1) review studies, theses, and dissertations and 2) SWS studies targeting
    greenhouse or landscape applications. A total of 165 papers were identified from
    the databases. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 80 papers
    were selected for the systematic review. Seventeen additional papers were identified
    from these 80 papers by forward and backward citation chasing (Cooper et al.,
    2018). Finally, 97 papers were identified from the PRISMA-guided literature search
    (Fig. 1): 49 papers on SWS accuracy assessment and 48 papers on SWS-based irrigation
    scheduling. Only one paper had both components. Download : Download high-res image

    flowchart of the systematic review on soil water sensors. 2.2. Information extraction
    The identified SWS papers were reviewed in detail and their findings were synthesized,
    organized, and presented under two focus areas of i) accuracy assessment and ii)
    application in irrigation scheduling. For the first focus area, a dataset was
    created consisting of twelve variables extracted from each of the 49 identified
    papers, if available. These variables were: 1) SWS technologies tested, 2) replications
    per sensor, 3) installation orientation (horizontal or vertical), 4) number of
    soil types considered, 5) study environment (field or laboratory), 6) SWS calibration
    used (factory or site-specific), 7) statistical error indicators reported (root
    mean square error, mean bias error, etc.), 8) number of locations where the statistical
    indicators were obtained, 9) reference method used to obtain the statistical indicators,
    10) study duration, 11) soil salinity, and 12) soil texture (percentages of sand,
    silt, and clay). We conducted a basic analysis on each of these twelve variables
    to obtain the proportions of the papers that reported each of these variables,
    the elements of each variable, and the range and mean of the variables or their
    elements (for example horizontal and vertical elements in case of installation
    orientation variable). In addition to the basic analysis, a detailed analysis
    was carried out on the error indicators evaluating the effects of four variables
    out of twelve that have been shown to have more influence on SWS accuracy: SWS
    technologies (Kukal et al., 2020), installation orientation (Chen et al., 2019),
    study environment (Feng and Sui, 2020), and calibrations (Chen et al., 2019, Singh
    et al., 2019). We extracted all error indicators for each of the four variables.
    Then, the error indicators were visualized through boxplots for each element of
    each variable. Since soil texture (especially clay content) also impacts the performance
    of many SWS (Datta et al., 2018, Singh et al., 2019), the results were presented
    separately for different ranges of clay content to allow for easier evaluation
    of the effects of studied variables under different levels of clay content. This
    way, the effects of differences in the four mentioned variables were compared
    when soil textures were somewhat similar. Based on the reported percentages in
    identified papers, four classes of clay content were considered for the detailed
    analysis: 0–22 %, 23–45 %, 46–69 %, and unreported. The ending number in each
    class included its fractions. Besides clay content, salinity is another variable
    that impacts SWS accuracy. But we did not include this variable in the detailed
    analysis as most of the identified papers did not report soil salinity. When discussing
    the results based on the root mean square error (RMSE), which was the most reported
    error indicator, classifications of two previous studies were used. Hignett and
    Evett (2008) suggested that SWS can be effective in irrigation scheduling if their
    RMSE is less than or equal to 0.02 m3 m−3. Fares et al. (2011) suggested the accuracy
    of SWS can be classified as good, fair, poor, and very poor for RMSE < 0.01, 0.01 ≤ RMSE < 0.05,
    0.05 ≤ RMSE < 0.10, and RMSE ≥ 0.10 m3 m−3, respectively. For the second focus
    area (applications in irrigation scheduling), another dataset was created consisting
    of six variables extracted from the 48 identified papers: 1) SWS technologies
    used, 2) cropping systems, 3) study duration, 4) study location, 5) farm ownership
    (commercial farm or research station), 6) other scheduling methods studied, and
    7) impacts of the studied scheduling methods on water use, yield, energy consumption,
    and net income. Like the accuracy assessment dataset, we presented descriptive
    statistics for each of these seven variables and their elements. Since different
    studies reported changes in water use, yield, energy consumption, and net income
    in different units, combining and comparing them required normalizing their results.
    To do so, the differences were first estimated by subtracting the value of the
    reported parameter based on other scheduling methods from its value for SWS-based
    method and then dividing the difference by the value based on the other scheduling
    method to obtain the percent increase or decrease in the parameter when SWS-based
    scheduling was used. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Accuracy assessment 3.1.1.
    Basic analysis The identified papers varied widely with respect to the twelve
    variables and their elements. The number of tested SWS technologies ranged from
    1 to 10, with a mean of 3 tested technologies in each paper. The number of replications
    had a range of 1–18 with a mean of 3. Installation orientation was reported in
    71 % of the papers. Similar number of papers reported horizontal (26 %) and vertical
    (25 %) installations, with 20 % of the papers using both orientations. The average
    number of soil types in each study was 3 (range of 1–9). Forty-seven percent of
    the papers determined SWS accuracy under field conditions, 43 % in laboratory,
    and the rest (10 %) in both field and laboratory. About half (51 %) of the papers
    used factory calibration in determining SWS accuracy, 14 % used site-specific
    calibration, and 35 % used both. Eighty percent of experiments were completed
    in one year, with maximum duration being 3 years (14 % of papers). A variety of
    error indicators were used to represent SWS accuracy. The two most common indicators
    were RMSE and mean bias error (MBE), reported in 76 % and 35 % of reviewed papers,
    respectively. Twenty-nine percent of papers reported both RMSE and MBE. Except
    for one paper that reported RMSE in units of soil matric potential and was excluded
    from the analyses, the units of RMSE and MBE were volumetric water content. Less
    common error indicators reported were relative RMSE, coefficient of determination,
    and absolute average difference. Based on frequency of use in identified papers,
    RMSE and MBE were selected for detailed analysis. Soil salinity was reported in
    only 18 % of the papers, with a range of 0–8.4 dS m−1 (1:1 soil-water ratio) and
    a mean of 1.8 dS m−1. Clay content was reported in 72 % of the papers (range of
    0–69 %). When considering all types of error indicators in the database, a total
    of 1510 error observations were reported to represent SWS accuracy. The number
    of error observations for each county in the conterminous US is shown in Fig.
    2. At the state level, Texas and Nebraska were the leading states with 32 % and
    26 % of the total observations, respectively. It is worth pointing out that many
    major irrigated areas in the south and west have no reported error indicator,
    so information is not available on how different SWS technologies perform there.
    This may have some negative impact on SWS adoption as an initial step in technology
    transfer is the trust of potential end-users in performance of that technology.
    Among the methods used as reference to estimate the error indicators, gravimetric
    sampling was the most common method, accounting for 51 % of the total observations,
    followed by neutron scattering (47 %). Other methods included tensiometry and
    time domain reflectometry. Download : Download high-res image (658KB) Download

    in the literature for each county in the conterminous US. 3.1.2. Detailed analysis
    3.1.2.1. Technology Eight different SWS technologies were used in accuracy assessment
    studies: amplitude domain reflectometry, time domain reflectometry (TDR), frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR), time domain transmissometry, electrical resistivity
    (ER), suction in soil matrix, heat pulse, and neutron scattering. The terms FDR
    and capacitance have been used interchangeably by many researchers as they are
    based on similar technologies (Hignett and Evett, 2008). Therefore, these two
    technologies are referred to as FDR in this paper. Three of the eight mentioned
    technologies dominated the reported error indicators: TDR (45 % and 41 % of all
    reported RMSE and MBE, respectively), FDR (43 % and 39 %, respectively), and ER
    (8 % and 16 %, respectively). Therefore, the emphasis of this detailed analysis
    is on these three technologies. Moreover, the analysis looked at RMSE and MBE
    resulting from factory calibrated SWS readings to keep the comparison among these
    technologies fair. This would also make the findings more useful to practical
    end-users who may not have resources to conduct site-specific calibration (e.g.,
    producers and farm managers). The mean RMSE among the three technologies were
    similar at 0.07–0.08 m3 m−3. The ranges of RMSE for TDR, FDR, and ER were somewhat
    different at 0–0.40, 0.01–0.52, and 0.02–0.21 m3 m−3, respectively. The maximum
    RMSE of 0.52 m3 m−3 for FDR was due to the combined effects of high clay content
    and salinity. The smaller range of ER compared to the other two technologies may
    be due to the smaller size of RMSE observations and thus less exposure to variable
    environmental conditions. Zero, 6 %, and 16 % of the RMSEs reported for ER, FDR,
    and TDR technologies were smaller than the threshold set by Hignett and Evett
    (2008), respectively. This means that based on their standard, only a small portion
    of cases (none for ER) met the irrigation scheduling requirements. According to
    less-strict thresholds of Fares et al. (2011), the percentages of errors falling
    under good or fair classes were larger at 50 % for TDR, 46 % for FDR, and 44 %
    for ER. The mean MBE for TDR, FDR, and ER were 0.02, 0.03, and − 0.04 m3 m−3,
    respectively. In general, the errors did not seem to increase with clay content
    (Fig. 3). The largest mean and median RMSE and MBE were typically found in the
    medium clay content level (23–45 %). Download : Download high-res image (143KB)

    The numbers within the plot represent the number of observations used to produce
    the corresponding box. The total number of observations for RMSE and MBE was 637
    and 289, respectively. 3.1.2.2. Installation orientation Some previous researchers
    have found different accuracies in response to installation orientation. For instance,
    Zhu et al. (2019) reported smaller errors for horizontally installed SWS in Nebraska
    compared to vertical orientation. Chen et al. (2019) found similar results in
    Texas. Both studies speculated the reason could be due to a vertical soil temperature
    gradient that was not accurately captured in vertical installation since the temperature
    was measured at one point in the head of the sensor. This systematic review, however,
    did not support those findings. The mean RMSE was the same (0.06 m3 m−3) for both
    orientations. The ranges of RMSE were also close at 0–0.40 and 0–0.35 m3 m−3 for
    horizontal and vertical orientations, respectively. Twenty-seven and 21 % of RMSE
    obtained under horizontal and vertical orientations were smaller than the thresholds
    of Hignett and Evett (2008). According to Fares et al. (2011), 56 % of RMSE fell
    under good or fair classes for both orientations. Like RMSE, the mean MBE were
    the same (0.01 m3 m−3). However, the range of MBE for horizontal orientation was
    larger (− 0.54 to 0.56 m3 m−3) than that of vertical orientation (− 0.16 to 0.24 m3
    m−3). This may be because 99 % of the horizontal observations were obtained under
    field conditions, compared to 57 % of the vertical orientation, and thus were
    more exposed to variable conditions of outdoor environment. No obvious relationship
    between error indicators and levels of clay content was observed (Fig. 4). There
    were no MBE reported for clay content level of 46–69 %. Download : Download high-res

    the plot represent the number of observations used to produce the corresponding
    box. The total number of observations for RMSE and MBE was 683 and 367, respectively.
    3.1.2.3. Environment The mean RMSE was the same (0.06 m3 m−3) for both field and
    laboratory environments, but the range was smaller for field (0–0.40 m3 m−3) than
    laboratory (0–0.52 m3 m−3). The maximum RMSE of 0.52 m3 m−3 under laboratory was
    reported by Vaz et al. (2013) and was due to combined effects of high clay content
    and salinity. Ignoring this value, the range was 0–0.35 m3 m−3, closer to (and
    smaller than) that of field RMSE. According to thresholds by Hignett and Evett
    (2008), only 18 % and 28 % of the reported RMSE from field and laboratory were
    considered appropriate for irrigation scheduling. Based on thresholds set by Fares
    et al. (2011), 56 % and 68 % of RMSE obtained from field and laboratory were considered
    as good or fair, respectively. Like RMSE, the mean MBE for field and laboratory
    were similar (0.01 m3 m−3), with a range of − 0.54 to 0.56 m3 m−3 for field and
    a smaller range of − 0.06 to 0.24 m3 m−3 for laboratory. Analyzing the results
    for different levels of clay content showed that the median field RMSE was smaller
    than median laboratory RMSE only for the lowest clay content level (Fig. 5). Download

    The numbers within the plot represent the number of observations used to produce

    and 466, respectively. 3.1.2.4. Calibration Factory calibration was used more
    commonly than site-specific calibration, accounting for 69 % and 64 % of all RMSE
    and MBE estimates, respectively. The mean RMSE of factory calibration was 0.07 m3
    m−3, about three times larger than site-specific calibration (0.02 m3 m−3). The
    range of RMSE for factory calibration was also about four times larger (0–0.52 m3
    m−3) than site-specific calibration (0–0.13 m3 m−3). This was expected as the
    estimates based on site-specific calibration are tuned for unique conditions of
    the installation site, generated with the goal of producing smaller errors. Only
    11 % of the RMSE obtained using factory calibration was suitable for irrigation
    scheduling according to threshold of Hignett and Evett (2008), compared to 48 %
    in case of site-specific calibration. A similar trend was observed based on classification
    of Fares et al. (2011), with 49 % and 91 % of factory and site-specific RMSE falling
    under good or fair classes, respectively. The mean MBE obtained from factory calibration
    was also larger (0.02 m3 m−3) than site-specific (− 0.01 m3 m−3). The range of
    MBE using factory calibration was larger (− 0.54 to 0.56 m3 m−3) than that of
    site-specific calibration (− 0.39 to 0.08 m3 m−3). The superiority of site-specific
    calibration was evident when analyzing error indicators for different levels of
    clay content (Fig. 6). In case of RMSE, the mean, median, and range were notably
    larger for factory calibration at all clay levels. The average improvement in
    RMSE going from factory to site-specific calibration was 216 %. Like RMSE, the
    mean, median, and range of MBE were considerably larger based on factory calibration.
    The accuracy improvement using site-specific calibration has been well-documented
    in previous studies (e.g., Dong et al., 2020; Kukal et al., 2020). They recommended
    using SWS with site-specific calibration to obtain more accurate estimates of
    soil water content. However, end-users seldom have technical and financial resources
    to do site-specific calibration. Download : Download high-res image (126KB) Download

    of observations for RMSE and MBE was 957 and 466, respectively. 3.2. Applications
    in irrigation scheduling Six different SWS technologies were implemented in irrigation
    scheduling studies: ER, FDR, TDR, neutron probe, tensiometer, and time domain
    transmissometry. ER accounted for 33 % of the cases, followed by FDR (21 %), neutron
    probe (16 %), and TDR (13 %). The other two technologies comprised of 17 % of
    the cases combined. The main reasons behind dominant use of ER in irrigation scheduling
    could be its lower cost, ease of use, and ease of data interpretation. In addition,
    many extension factsheets and user manuals have been developed since the earlier
    versions of the ER technology (gypsum blocks) were developed several decades ago.
    Among cropping systems where irrigation scheduling methods were tested, corn and
    cotton were the most dominant. Other notable crops were tomato, soybean, watermelon,
    sugar beet, sorghum, and potato. The length of the study period in identified
    papers ranged from 1 to 6 years, with a mean of 2 years. A total of 64 locations
    where irrigation scheduling by SWS was investigated were identified. Fig. 7 presents
    the county-wise number of locations in the conterminous US. At the state level,
    Nebraska was the lead with 22 % of the locations, followed by Texas (17 %), Mississippi
    (13 %), and Florida (13 %). About 13 % of irrigation scheduling studies were conducted
    at commercial fields of producers and the rest (87 %) at research farms owned
    by universities or research institutions. Like the spatial pattern of SWS accuracy
    assessment studies, many major irrigated areas (especially in western US) had
    no reported study on SWS utilization for irrigation scheduling. Download : Download

    where irrigation scheduling application of SWS has been studied for each county
    in the conterminous US. Among the identified papers, 40 % relied only on the SWS
    method and the rest compared it with other scheduling methods, including traditional,
    computer models, evapotranspiration replacement, and canopy temperature. The traditional
    scheduling included producers’ practices and approaches to deciding when and how
    much to irrigate, as well as rotational delivery by water provider. Computer models
    included simple soil water balance models executed through spreadsheets and checkbooks,
    advanced simulation models (e.g., CERES-Maize), and mobile- and web-based applications
    such as Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler, SmartIrrigation Cotton App, and Irrigator
    Pro. The evapotranspiration replacement approach relied on reports of crop water
    use obtained from local weather stations, with the amount of irrigation water
    being equal to the cumulative evapotranspiration since the last irrigation event.
    The canopy temperature method was based on the thermal remote sensing of crop
    canopy. The SWS-based irrigation scheduling was compared with the traditional
    method more commonly than any other method, followed by computer models and evapotranspiration
    replacement (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (47KB) Download : Download

    97 % and 90 % of the identified papers reported changes in water use and yield,
    respectively, while 2 % documented changes in energy consumption and 6 % reported
    changes in net income. Only one paper (Irmak et al., 2012) reported all four parameters.

    10th and 90th percentiles and dotted lines indicate the mean. The numbers within
    the plot represent the number of observations used to produce the corresponding
    box. The total number of observations was 32. On average, SWS-based scheduling
    used 38 % less water than traditional, 16 % less water than computer models, 20 %
    less water than evapotranspiration replacement, and 1 % less water than canopy
    temperature methods. Several reasons could explain the smaller water use of the
    SWS-based method. Steele et al. (2000) mentioned that SWS-based irrigation scheduling
    used less water because of its real-time monitoring of crop water use compared
    to the methods that lack continuous monitoring. Muñoz-Carpena et al. (2008) attributed
    smaller water use in SWS-based compared to traditional scheduling to smaller irrigation
    amounts early in the growing season. Ganjegunte and Clark (2017) observed both
    smaller amounts and fewer irrigation events in SWS-based scheduling compared to
    traditional scheduling. Overall, SWS-based scheduling resulted in larger yield
    (9 % on average) when considering all of the methods it was compared against.
    The largest increase in yield (24 %) was observed when SWS-based scheduling was
    compared against traditional scheduling. SWS-based scheduling had 7 % larger yield
    on average compared to evapotranspiration replacement. Computer models and canopy
    temperature methods had somewhat similar yield to the SWS-based scheduling method
    (within 2–3 %). In the reviewed papers, the overall goal of using various irrigation
    scheduling methods has been to minimize irrigation amounts and optimize irrigation
    frequency to meet a target crop yield that is generally obtained from traditional
    scheduling method. Thus, increasing yield through other scheduling methods is
    often viewed as a secondary objective in these studies, especially those conducted
    in the drought-stricken or water-limited areas. This may explain the smaller magnitude
    of differences in yield compared to differences in water use when comparing SWS-based
    scheduling with other scheduling methods. 4. Conclusions A systematic review was
    carried out to identify and analyze relevant literature on the use of SWS for
    irrigation scheduling in the US between 2000 and 2021. The analysis was concentrated
    on two focus areas: SWS accuracy assessment and SWS application in irrigation
    scheduling. With respect to accuracy assessment, most of the studies were conducted
    in Texas and Nebraska, while many other states with vast irrigated areas had no
    published study. Gravimetric sampling and neutron scattering were two most common
    methods of reference to estimate SWS errors. The three dominant technologies (TDR,
    FDR, and ER) had similar average RMSE and did not show any trend in errors with
    increasing clay content. Similarly, installing sensors horizontally or vertically
    and under field or laboratory conditions did not impact the average RMSE and no
    trend with increasing clay content was found. Not surprisingly, the average RMSE
    for factory (manufacturer) calibration was three times larger than the average
    RMSE based on site-specific calibration, and this was the case for each class
    of clay content. Like accuracy assessment, TDR, FDR, and ER were the dominant
    technologies used in irrigation scheduling. Texas and Nebraska were the leading
    states in this focus area as well. Many states in western US did not have a single
    paper in the past two decades on practical application of SWS for irrigation scheduling.
    Nearly all papers that compared SWS-based scheduling with other methods reported
    changes in water use and yield, two of the most important metrics in evaluating
    the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling methods. Making irrigation decisions
    based on SWS resulted in average reductions in water use of 38 % compared to traditional
    scheduling methods, 16 % compared to computer models, 20 % compared to evapotranspiration
    replacement, and 1 % compared to canopy temperature methods. The savings in water
    use were achieved while the yields improved (24 % compared to traditional methods)
    or remained about the same. This systematic review presented the state of the
    art of the accuracy and application of SWS in irrigation scheduling in the US
    in the last 20 years. With regular releases of new sensors and modifications of
    older ones, our recommendations for future SWS studies are to: 1) continue testing
    new sensors and models soon after they become available to provide accuracy assessments
    in a timely manner; 2) conduct more accuracy assessment studies under field conditions
    and in major irrigated areas and states that did not have a single experiment
    in the past 20 years; 3) report soil texture, soil salinity, and RMSE whenever
    possible to make the results more comparable and transferrable; 4) develop more
    site-specific calibrations for commercially-available SWS (we also strongly encourage
    SWS manufacturers to provide a library of calibrations or allow users to enter
    their own calibration); and 5) to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of
    utilizing SWS for scientific irrigation scheduling by documenting the improvements
    in water use, yield, energy consumption, and net income, which are necessary for
    decision makers and producers to support and adopt SWS technologies. The results
    of such studies may be more acceptable to end-users if the experiments are designed
    and conducted in collaboration with local producers and early adopters. Authorship

    cognitive wireless networks, multi-node cooperative spectrum sensing can effectively
    improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing, but there is a non-linear relationship
    between the number of nodes and sensing accuracy. Nodes with low reliability participate
    in cooperative sensing, which is not conducive to the improvement of sensing accuracy,
    and reduces the energy efficiency of spectrum sensing, which poses challenges
    to the normal operation of cognitive wireless networks. In order to improve energy
    efficiency and sensing performance, this paper proposes the node evaluation and
    scheduling (NES) algorithm and the Secure Spectrum Sensing based on Blockchain
    (SSSB) algorithm, which can evaluate the reliability of sensing nodes in real
    time, and obtain the trust value of the node. The nodes information is stored
    in the management center of blockchain. Blockchain encrypts nodes information
    to ensure that a node corresponds to its own trust value without confusion. Fusion
    Center of cognitive wireless networks select good performance nodes to participate
    in cooperative spectrum sensing. Which can reduce energy consumption while improving
    the sensing performance. The simulation experiment results show that the new algorithm

    I. Introduction With the ever-increasing demand for wireless communication, spectrum
    resources are becoming more and more tense [1], [2], but the spectrum utilization
    rate is relatively low [3], [4]. Cognitive wireless networks proposes to allow
    dynamic spectrum access to authorized frequency bands to make full use of spectrum
    holes, improve spectrum utilization, and ease spectrum resources shortage [5].
    In the process of spectrum sensing, the sensing performance of a single node cannot
    be well achieved due to the influence of geographic location [6], while multi-node
    cooperative sensing can overcome the sensing shortcomings of a single node and
    make preparations by combining information from different geographic locations
    [7]. Therefore, multi-node cooperative sensing is a commonly used sensing method
    in cognitive wireless networks [8]. Multi-node cooperative perception can effectively
    improve the accuracy of perception, but the increase in the number of nodes will
    bring additional energy costs, increasing the energy consumption of the cognitive
    wireless network, and the front end of the cognitive network is battery-powered
    [9], so the energy consumption increases. It will reduce the battery life, which
    will also reduce the working life of the cognitive wireless network [10]. In order
    to extend the working life of cognitive wireless networks, many improved methods
    are used,the method of switching on and off time is adopted to extend the working
    life of the cognitive network [11], but this method has low perception efficiency
    and misses many opportunities for spectrum access. The method of cooperating between
    nodes and the primary user according to the agreement is used to reduce the workload
    of the cognitive network [12]. This method can effectively reduce energy consumption,
    but this method gives priority to meeting the requirements of the main user and
    will reduce the throughput of the cognitive user. The method of grouping relay
    is used to reduce the energy loss caused by information transmission [13]. In
    this method, each node does not need to send the local sensing result to the fusion
    center, but each node first sends it to the patriarch, and then the patriarch
    decides later sent to the fusion center, this method reduces communication overhead,
    but the sensing accuracy is compromised. The method of purchasing the primary
    user information is used to reduce workload of the cognitive network [14]. The
    modified method can greatly reduce the workload of the cognitive user to perform
    spectrum sensing because the primary user’s working time is known in advance.
    But user information costs are high, only used in special occasions, and does
    not have universal significance. A review method is proposed to reduce the number
    of cooperative sensing nodes [15], so as to achieve the purpose of reducing energy
    consumption and communication overhead. In this algorithm, nodes with low reliability
    can be removed, but the sensing performance of all nodes is considered to be unchanged.
    In fact, when the radio environment changes, the performance of the nodes will
    change, which is not reflected in the algorithm. In order to improve the energy
    efficiency of cognitive networks, a dynamic node selection algorithm is proposed
    [16]. The algorithm selects a fixed number of nodes to participate in cooperative
    perception according to the trust value of nodes, which can reduce energy consumption,
    but can not change the number of nodes according to the change of environment.
    In order to improve the energy efficiency and the operation efficiency of cognitive
    network [17], a time-sharing algorithm is proposed. This algorithm makes nodes
    work in turn, which can reduce the energy consumption of each node, but all nodes
    are involved in the work, and some nodes with poor sensing performance will not
    help cooperative sensing, which will affect the operation performance of cognitive
    radio network. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the algorithm [17], a
    node selection algorithm based on deep learning is proposed [18]. The algorithm
    still allows nodes to work in turn, and learns the sensing operation of each node,
    removing the nodes with large energy consumption to participate in the cooperative
    sensing, which can improve the energy-efficiency of cognitive wireless network.
    But in fact, external radio environment is a time-varying, the algorithm is not
    considering the influence of environmental changes on the node sensing performance,
    lack of environment interaction with the outside world radio link, failing to
    reflect changes in the environment [19]. The above method does not take into account
    the energy-efficiency and sensing performance of cognitive wireless network, and
    does not take into account the impact of changes in radio environment on sensing
    performance and energy-efficiency. In fact, the nodes with poor sensing performance
    will not help the cooperative sensing, but will affect the global decision of
    the fusion center [20]. Therefore, in cognitive wireless networks, the nodes with
    poor sensing performance should be removed, and only the reliable nodes should
    be selected to participate in cooperative sensing [21]. However, the performance
    of the node is not fixed, it will change due to its own factors and the changes
    of the external environment. Therefore, in the actual cognitive wireless radio,
    need to consider the impact of environmental changes [22], and improve sensing
    accuracy and energy efficiency. But previous literature did not consider the impact
    of environmental, and did not consider using the blockchain method to select nodes
    with good performance [23]. In this paper, in order to simultaneously improve
    the energy efficiency and sensing accuracy of cognitive wireless networks, a secure
    spectrum sensing mechanism based on blockchain is proposed. The mechanism can
    reflect the change of environment and timely modify the number of nodes participating
    in cooperative sensing, and can evaluate the reliability of sensing nodes in real
    time, and obtain the trust value of the node through the evaluation algorithm.
    The mechanism not only memorizes the energy consumption and sensing performance
    of each node, but also remembers the trust value of a single node. The trust value
    is stored in the reliability list of the blockchain, the management center of
    the blockchain encrypts the list to ensure that a node corresponds to its own
    trust value without confusion. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
    in this paper can give a good consideration to both energy efficiency and sensing
    accuracy, and extend the working life of cognitive wireless networks. The rest
    of the research paper is structured as follows. The second section introduces
    the network model proposed in this paper. In the third section, the node estimation
    and selection algorithm is given. In the fourth section, the blockchain-based
    cognitive wireless network security work algorithm is given. In the fifth section,
    the algorithm’s experimental results and analysis is given. Finally, a conclusion
    is given. SECTION II. System Model This paper designs a cognitive wireless network
    model based on blockchain. The model includes the management center of the blockchain,
    a primary user, a cognitive base station (fusion center), and multiple nodes (cognitive
    users). Some nodes are in spectrum sensing state, and the other nodes are in silent
    state. This model is a centralized cooperative spectrum sensing model [24]. Each
    node can only exchange information with the fusion center. The sensing information
    of each node is sent to the fusion center for processing, and the fusion center
    feeds back information to each node [25]. There is no direct communication between
    nodes, so a centralized architecture helps to improve information processing efficiency
    [26]. The fusion center is not only responsible for communication with the nodes,
    but also for communication with the blockchain management center, sending the
    node information to the management center for storage, and the blockchain management
    center will also call the node information to the fusion center. The blockchain
    management center and the fusion center are an important interaction mechanism
    for selecting reliable nodes. The detailed system model is shown in Figure 1.
    FIGURE 1. Cognitive wireless network model based on blockchain. Show All In Figure
    1, it can be seen that not all nodes participate in cooperative sensing at the
    same time, but some nodes are possible malicious nodes. This is because the nodes
    are grouped, and the node with the highest trust value is selected to participate
    in cooperative sensing, malicious nodes are blocked from participating in cooperative
    sensing. The purpose is to improve energy efficiency and maximize the extension
    the working life of cognitive network. In the premise of satisfying the sensing
    performance, the energy consumption is reduced. The reason for grouping the nodes
    and evaluating the trust value of the nodes is mainly because the geographical
    locations of the nodes are different, and the nodes close to the primary user
    receive strong signals, which can be obtained good perception accuracy on the
    basis of consuming less energy. When the path loss caused by the long distance
    from the primary user is larger, or the channel is not good, and the node with
    severe Rayleigh fading receives weaker signals from the primary user, and needs
    to perform longer sensing operations, and consumes more energy can make sensing
    judgments. Because the primary user’s signal is weak and easily affected by interference,
    these nodes are prone to make wrong judgments. Such judgment results are not conducive
    to the protection of the primary user, which brings challenges to the security
    of cognitive wireless networks. Therefore, it is necessary for the security work
    of cognitive wireless networks to estimate nodes and select nodes with high reliability
    to participate in cooperative sensing. SECTION III. Node Estimation and Selection
    Algorithm In order to improve the security of cognitive wireless networks, it
    is necessary to take the node trust value as an important index to participate
    in cooperative sensing. Therefore, the combination of node trust value and basic
    system architecture can meet the sensing accuracy and reduce energy consumption.
    The blockchain management center can be more effective in preventing data confusion.
    A weighted combination mechanism based on reputation [27] can improve the sensing
    performance of cognitive wireless networks. The algorithm first estimates the
    reliability of all nodes in the system. This estimation is based on the historical
    interactive data. Once a suspicious node is found, it immediately makes an isolation
    decision for the sensing data of the node. The algorithm improves the robustness
    of the system, but increases the additional energy consumption, and the impact
    of environmental changes on the node itself is not considered. In fact, the radio
    environment is time-varying, and changes in the working status of the primary
    user will also affect the sensing of nodes, especially when the location of the
    primary user moves, the nodes with good sensing may become malicious in the next
    moment, while the node with poor performance may become a reliable node. Therefore,
    in order to track changes in the status of nodes, it is necessary to establish
    a real-time evaluation mechanism for nodes. When the node performance deteriorates,
    it can stop its sensing work in time, and when the node performance becomes better,
    it can be transferred to work in time. In order to evaluate and select nodes more
    efficiently, this paper establishes an node evaluation algorithm and nodes selection
    mechanism. The nodes selection algorithm flow chart is shown in Figure 2. FIGURE
    2. Flow chart of the node evaluation and scheduling algorithm. Show All In Figure
    2, the cognitive wireless network estimates the reliability of each node before
    performing spectrum sensing operations, and this estimation is based on historical
    data. When the external environment is stable, the original scheme will continue
    to work, but when the external environment changes, the reliability of the node
    needs to be re-estimated. The trustworthiness value of the node is recalculated
    according to formula (1) [28], and the fusion center will establish nodes list
    and nodes information are sent to the management center of the blockchain to avoid
    errors. The management center intelligently provides node information and is responsible
    for scheduling nodes to participate in cooperative sensing according to the requirements
    of the fusion center. q j = ∑ i=1 k | R j,i |⋅ r j,i ∑ i=1 k | R j,i | (1) View
    Source In formula (1), q j is the initial trust value of the j-th node, | R j,i
    | is the sensing result of the j-th node in the i-th sensing cycle, and r j,i
    is the reward value obtained by the j-th sensing node in the i-th sensing cycle.
    The value of r j,i follows the following principles: when the judgment result
    of the j-th node in a sensing cycle is consistent with the fusion center, then
    r j,i =1 , otherwise r j,i =0 , k is the number of statistical sensing cycles.
    Calculate the initial value of the reliability of each node by formula (1), and
    save the value in the management center of the blockchain. When the environment
    changes, the reliability of the nodes will be re-estimated, and the nodes participating
    in sensing will be adjusted according to the node evaluation and scheduling (NES)
    algorithm. In NES algorithm, three return values and three correction coefficients
    are set, they are performance return value r , energy consumption return value
    g , comprehensive return value υ , performance correction coefficient ρ , energy
    consumption correction coefficient ξ and comprehensive correction coefficient
    ν . The calculation formula of performance return value r is shown in formula
    (2): r= 1 k ∑ i=1 k [(1− X i )( α i ⋅ C G +(1− α t ) C B ) + X i ( β i ⋅ C G +(1−
    β i )⋅ C B )] (2) View Source In formula (2), the value of X i is 1 or 0, when
    the primary user band is busy, it is taken as 1, while the primary user band is
    idle, it is taken as 0. The value of k is the same as that in formula (1), which
    represents the statistical times of sensing period. C G is the reward coefficient,
    and C B is the punishment coefficient. α i and β i are weighted coefficients,
    and their values are shown in formula (3): α i ={ 1, 0, X i =0| H 0 X i =0| H
    1 , β i ={ 1, 0, X i =1| H 1 X i =1| H 0 (3) View Source The value of return coefficient
    g of energy consumption is calculated by formula (4): g= 1 k ∑ i=1 k [ D G Y i
    + D B (1− Y i )] (4) View Source In formula (4), D G is the energy consumption
    reward coefficient, indicating that the node energy consumption is less than the
    threshold value, D B is the energy consumption penalty coefficient, indicating
    that the node energy consumption is greater than the threshold value. Y i is the
    weighting coefficient of energy return value, and its value is calculated by formula
    (5): Y i = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 1, 0, λ 0 − ∑ j=1 M e i,j ≥0 λ 0 − ∑
    j=1 M e i,j <0 (5) View Source In formula (5), λ 0 is a preset energy consumption
    threshold in a sensing period. The calculation of the comprehensive return value
    υ is shown in formula (6): υ=0.4r+0.6g (6) View Source Formula (6) shows that
    the weight of energy consumption return value accounts for 60% and the weight
    of performance return value accounts for 40%. This shows that in this paper, we
    emphasize on satisfying the sensing performance (sensing accuracy) while paying
    more attention to reducing energy consumption. The value of the performance correction
    coefficient ρ is calculated by formula (7): ρ j = ∑ i [ x i,j − X i ] (7) View
    Source The correction coefficient ρ j represents the number of times that the
    j-th node transmits wrong information to the fusion center, and also represents
    the risk factor of the node. x i,j represents the result reported by the j-th
    node to the fusion center in the i-th sensing cycle, and X i represents the decision
    result of the i-th sensing cycle. The value of energy consumption correction coefficient
    ξ is calculated by formula (8): ξ j = ∑ i O i,j ⋅ Y i,j (8) View Source ξ j represents
    the number of times that the energy consumption of the j-th node exceeds the energy
    threshold, and also represents the severity of punishment. O i,j represents the
    switch, with a value of 1 or 0, when the j-th node participates in cooperative
    sensing in the i-th cycle, it is taken as 1, otherwise it is taken as 0.  Y i,j
    indicates whether the energy consumption of the j-th node in the i-th sensing
    cycle exceeds the energy consumption threshold, and its value is calculated by
    formula (9). Y i,j = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 1, 0, e i,j − λ 0 ≥0 e i,j − λ 0 <0 (9) View Source
    λ 0 in formula (9) represents the energy consumption threshold, and its value
    is calculated by formula (10). λ 0 = ∑ j=1 M e i,j M (10) View Source In formula
    (10), M represents the number of all nodes in the cognitive wireless network.
    e i,j represents the energy consumption of the j-th node in the i-th cycle. The
    value of comprehensive correction coefficient ν is calculated by formula (11).
    ν j =0.4 ρ j +0.6 ξ j (11) View Source ν j represents the comprehensive correction
    coefficient of the j-th node, which is obtained by the weighted sum of the performance
    correction coefficient and energy consumption correction coefficient. The performance
    correction coefficient accounts for 40% and the energy consumption correction
    coefficient accounts for 60%. That is, on the premise of satisfying the perceptual
    performance, more energy consumption will be punished more severely. The update
    process of node trust value is shown in equation (12). q n+1 j = q n j +[ϑυ−(1−ϑ)
    ν n j ] q n j (12) View Source In formula (12), q n j is the trust value of the
    j-th node in the previous perception cycle, q n+1 j is the current trust value
    of the j-th node, υ represents the comprehensive return value of the previous
    cycle, and ν n j represents the comprehensive correction coefficient of the previous
    cycle. ϑ is a weighting factor, ϑ∈[0,1] . The larger the value of ϑ , the larger
    the proportion of the feedback coefficient, and the better the sensing performance
    or energy consumption index. On the contrary, it indicates that the sensing node
    needs to be adjusted to improve the sensing performance and energy consumption
    index. The detailed description of node evaluation and selection algorithm is
    shown in algorithm 1. SECTION Algorithm 1 Node Evaluation and Selection Algorithm

    the Fusion Center will re-evaluate the nodes, and call the nodes with high trust
    values from the blockchain management center to perform spectrum sensing. It is
    can greatly improve the efficiency of spectrum sensing, and reduce the useless
    energy consumption and enhancing the robustness of cognitive wireless networks.
    SECTION IV. Cognitive Wireless Network Security Work Algorithm Based on Blockchain
    Blockchain is an underlying technology abstracted from Bitcoin. It is a new application
    of traditional technology in the Internet era, which includes distributed data
    storage technology, wireless networks, consensus mechanism and cryptography [29].
    As a decentralized public database, blockchain uses public key cryptographic algorithms,
    hash functions, consensus mechanisms and other technologies to build a decentralized
    non-authentication system that can be used in e-commerce to ensure user information
    security. Simply put, blockchain can be widely used in Internet finance or a wider
    market. It will further promote the process of economic globalization and will
    have a great impact on the existing financial market structure and even the social
    structure [30]. Blockchain technology has the advantages of low transaction costs,
    strong transparency, and high security. It can effectively improve the efficiency
    of information use, make the transaction process transparent, share supervision,
    and protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties to the transaction.
    Common problems such as high cost, low efficiency, and low data storage security
    in the standardized database provide new ideas [31]. Blockchain is a kind of tamper
    proof, full history database storage technology, usually uses point-to-point technology
    to organize each node. Each node realizes the functions of routing, new node identification
    and data dissemination through multicast. It can appear at any node in the system.
    By using cryptography, it can generate related data blocks. The generated data
    can check the validity of the information, and can also realize the reliable link
    with the next data [32]. In wireless network communication, blockchain technology
    is a kind of technology that can not be tampered with among the same level secondary
    users who do not trust each other or have weak trust without intermediary participation.
    Regarding the historical interaction in the database as a public account book,
    each node stores the historical interaction records of the whole network, and
    the records of data collection, transaction, circulation and calculation and analysis
    are kept on the blockchain, which makes the quality of data obtain unprecedented
    strong trust endorsement, and ensures the correctness of data analysis results
    and the effect of data mining [33]. In view of the advantages of blockchain technology,
    this paper proposes a cognitive wireless network security algorithm based on blockchain.
    A. Algorithm Design Structure The research object of this article is the two-way
    authentication problem between the blockchain IoT device and the cognitive wireless
    network convergence center. Therefore, the system in this article is mainly composed
    of the blockchain system, the cognitive wireless network convergence center, and
    the blockchain IoT device. Users communicate with the blockchain system through
    the fusion center. The specific structure is shown in Figure 3. The IoT device
    sends node information to the fusion center, and the fusion center queries the
    blockchain system for the existence of its node information, and then the node
    sends the data signed by the private key to the fusion center, and verifies whether
    the sensing node has a corresponding private key pair Sign it. If it is, then
    forward the node’s request to the blockchain system, and forward the response
    of the blockchain system back to the sensing node. The data signed by the sensing
    node can confirm the identity of participating in spectrum sensing, and can also
    ensure that its data has not been tampered with or forged. FIGURE 3. Security
    algorithm structure of cognitive wireless network. Show All B. Secure Spectrum
    Sensing Based on BLOCKCHAIN Technology This paper introduces the blockchain technology
    and reputation mechanism into the spectrum sensing process. A new secure spectrum
    sensing method is proposed. This security sensing method includes the evaluation
    of the user’s direct reputation and recommendation reputation. When a cooperative
    node requests to access a certain frequency band, it needs to sense whether the
    frequency band is idle. If it is idle, it will send a recommendation request to
    the fusion center. In order to avoid collusion attack and malicious node behavior,
    the sensing results are more accurate. Using the blockchain technology, the historical
    sensing records in the database and the distance of interaction history is regarded
    as a public ledger, which can be shared by each neighbor node, and no node in
    this scenario can change the ledger information. The specific working process
    of security spectrum sensing based on blockchain technology is shown in Figure
    4. FIGURE 4. Secure spectrum sensing algorithm based on blockchain (SSSB) in cognitive
    wireless networks. Show All After the fusion center sends a perception request,
    the evaluation of a node’s local reputation value is related to the peer requester.
    It is necessary to obtain the requester’s perception calculation record from the
    public account book of the blockchain to calculate its direct reputation value.
    For the sender, the local direct reputation value is calculated by formula (13).
    T i = N i k θ ω i (13) View Source In formula (13), T i represents the i-th sensing
    period, N i is the number of all the sensing periods up to T i time period. The
    meaning of k is the same as in formula (1), indicating the correct number of interactive
    sensing in history [34], θ means the sensing operation intensity, and its value
    is calculated by formula (14), ω i is the influence coefficient of the sensing
    times in the public account book, and its value is calculated by formula (15).
    θ= ω i = 1− e ∣ ∣ − k mn ∣ ∣ ∑ i=1 n ∣ ∣ ∣ h 1 m ⋅ l n ∣ ∣ ∣ (14) (15) View Source
    where h 1 is the number of interactions in l period and m is the size of sensing
    period in each period, n is the total interaction period. It can be seen from
    formula (14) and (15) that the closer is the interaction history in the public
    account book, the proportion will be the greater, and the impact on trust value
    will increase accordingly [35]. When the trust value of the node is not in the
    forefront of all nodes, the node is selected by calculating the comprehensive
    trust value, and the comprehensive trust value of the node is calculated by (17).
    T i,c =ϕ T i +φ ∣ ∣ ∣ T i +θ ∑ i ω i ∣ ∣ ∣ (16) View Source where ϕ,φ, ω i respectively
    represent the weight of the trust value, the direct reputation value and the comprehensive
    reputation value of the node. Among them, the values of ϕ,φ, ω i meet the conditions
    ϕ>0,ϕ≥0, ω i ≥0,ϕ+φ=1 . Every time a recommendation is made, the user’s recommendation
    reputation value will be updated. The security spectrum sensing technology based
    on the blockchain, through the calculation of the comprehensive trust value of
    the nodes in the network. The final decision-making process uses the classic trust
    value decision-making algorithm. The nodes in the network are classified by setting
    the corresponding rejection threshold and trust threshold. If the comprehensive
    trust value is less than the rejection threshold, the node is considered a malicious
    user; if the comprehensive trust value is greater than the trust threshold, the
    node is considered a normal user; if the comprehensive trust value is between
    the rejection threshold and the trust threshold, the node is considered to be
    a node to be observed. The node obtains the right to participate in cooperative
    sensing through the continuous update of the trust value. SECTION V. Analysis
    of the Simulation Experiment The experiment was carried out by the Monte Carlo
    simulation in this paper. This test runs VMware esxi 6.7.0 (build 8169922) bare
    metal virtual machine system on a workstation using two Intel Xeon Gold6128 3.7GHz
    processors, 256 Gb memory and Samsung SM961 / PM961 SSD [36]. In the simulated
    cognitive wireless network, there are 3 auxiliary nodes and 15 sensing nodes [37].
    The corresponding parameters are set as shown in Table 1 [38]. TABLE 1 Simulation
    Parameter Setting The always occupied class means that the frequency band is considered
    to be in the occupied state, i.e. it is always sent 1 whether the primary user
    is using the detected frequency band or not; the always idle class is that the
    frequency band is considered to be in the idle state, that is to say, it is always
    sent whether the primary user is using the detected frequency band or not For
    the actual use of the frequency band, if it does not follow any rules, it is considered
    to be in the idle state or occupied state, that is, random transmission 0 and
    1 [39]. In the simulation experiment of the algorithm, the number of malicious
    users in the system is mainly considered in two cases, as shown in Table 2. TABLE
    2 Malicious User (MU) Parameter Values In the experiment based on the auxiliary
    node, assuming that the primary user band is in a half busy state. The NES algorithm
    in this paper is compared with 4 classical algorithms, which are AND rule, OR
    rule, Majority rule and K-out-of rule respectively [40]. When using the traditional
    4 fusion methods, the number of malicious nodes is set to 4, and the number of
    normal nodes is 15. When using the node evaluation and scheduling (NES) algorithm
    in this paper, the number of malicious nodes is set to 8, and other parameters
    are consistent with the settings in the traditional method. In order to verify
    the sensing performance of the algorithm in this article, the ROC curves of the
    comparison of sensing performance are shown in Figures 5. As can be seen from
    Figure 5, in the case of four malicious nodes in cognitive wireless network, the
    detection probability of the algorithm in this paper is higher than that of the
    classical algorithm under the same false alarm probability. This is because the
    algorithm in this paper considers the environment and other variable factors,
    and the cognitive wireless network has stronger robustness and stronger anti attack
    ability. No matter in any environment, the node information can be updated in
    time, and the node information is encrypted by blockchain technology. The fusion
    center can request the nodes with good performance to participate in cooperative
    sensing, so the sensing performance is always better than the classic algorithm.
    FIGURE 5. Comparison of sensing performance between four classical algorithms
    and NES algorithm in this paper. Show All Figure 6 shows the energy consumption
    comparison between the NES algorithm and the classical algorithm under the same
    conditions. Other simulation experiment parameters are the same as the experiment
    in Figure 5. FIGURE 6. Comparison of energy consumption between four classical
    algorithms and NES algorithm in this paper. Show All It can be seen from Figure
    6 that after the number of sensing cycles exceeds 60, the energy consumption of
    the algorithm in this paper is significantly less than that of the other 4 classic
    algorithms. The more the number of sensing cycles, the longer the sensing time,
    the more energy will be saved. Greatly help cognitive wireless network to extend
    the working life. This is because the algorithm in this paper can always select
    the node with the best performance to participate in cooperative sensing in time,
    so it can save more energy when the sensing performance is better than the traditional
    method. Figure 7 describes the anti-attack ability of the Secure Spectrum Sensing
    based on Blockchain (SSSB) algorithm in the cognitive wireless network. FIGURE
    7. Security performance comparison of cognitive wireless networks. Show All It
    can be seen from Figure 7 that when the NES and SSSB algorithms are used in combination,
    as increasing the number of interactions between the sensing node, fusion center
    and blockchain management center, the security index of the cognitive wireless
    network rises significantly faster. When the number of interactions exceeds 50
    times, the safety index using the SSSB algorithm rose faster than the safety index
    using only the NES algorithm, which fully reflects the effectiveness of the SSSB
    algorithm. This is because the SSSB algorithm incorporates blockchain technology.
    It can greatly improve the anti attack ability and security ability of cognitive
    wireless network. This article incorporates blockchain technology. In order to
    prove that the new algorithm does not increase network overhead, a network traffic
    test experiment was deliberately done. Network traffic test aims to test the algorithm
    and no identity in this paper. To verify the difference of network traffic between
    wireless access points. This protocol increases the network traffic pressure.
    Network traffic test enables. If the network traffic is tested with iftop, the
    query will be sent directly to the blockchain. Compare the request traffic with
    the request traffic authenticated by this algorithm, Query per second (QPS) and
    calculate the network traffic utilization. In order to make the request timely.
    In order to get a response, and thus more accurately measure the impact on the
    network. The number of service nodes selected by the machine is 1 [40]. The network
    traffic test results are shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 Network Traffic Test Results
    It can be seen from the observation results in Table 3, it is concluded that the
    algorithm in this paper has a 0.1% impact on network traffic, and has minimal
    impact on cognitive wireless network performance.This also proves that the algorithm
    in this paper not only has the advantages of improving sensing performance and
    reducing energy consumption, but also has no disadvantages of increasing network
    overhead. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper makes an in-depth study on the model
    of cognitive wireless networks. In the practical application scenarios of cognitive
    wireless networks, there are usually serious errors when the nodes sensing the
    data, which causes the sensing values to deviate from the normal range, or some
    nodes deliberately send the wrong data to the fusion center. Therefore, aiming
    at the security problem of malicious node attack in cognitive wireless network,
    this paper proposes the node evaluation and scheduling (NES) algorithm and the
    Secure Spectrum Sensing based on Blockchain (SSSB) algorithm, which regards the
    user’s interaction history and interaction distance as a public account book,
    and is managed by the blockchain management center, which is convenient for the
    fusion center to call nodes with excellent performance to participate in cooperative
    sensing. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is much
    better than the traditional algorithm, which can not only effectively improve
    the spectrum sensing performance, but also reduce the energy consumption, and
    will not increase the communication overhead of cognitive wireless network. There
    are still many shortcomings in the field of cognitive wireless research. For example,
    in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio, the sensory performance of nodes will
    deteriorate rapidly. The existing methods cannot solve the problem of sensory
    performance under low signal-to-noise ratio. Secondly, the existing research does
    not pay enough attention to network throughput, and follow-up research needs to
    strengthen the research of throughput. Secondly, the application of blockchain
    in cognitive wireless networks needs to be further strengthened. Network security
    is a current research hotspot. Research needs to further use blockchain technology
    to enhance the robustness of cognitive wireless networks. Authors Figures References

    This article focuses on the development of a system based on the long-range network
    (LoRa), which is used for monitoring the agricultural sector and is implemented
    in areas of the Andean region of Ecuador. The LoRa network is applied for the

    soil moisture and ultraviolet radiation. It consists of two transmitter nodes
    and one receiver node, a LoRa Gateway with two communication channels for data

    networks; IoT system 1. Introduction 1.1. Motivation Great technological progress
    directly affects people’s behavior. Humans have adapted themselves to the use
    of the Internet, computer systems, smartphones and sensors, among other devices
    to carry out different daily activities. In the same way, different types of applications
    have been developed to meet our needs, allowing problem solving in many areas
    of interest. One of the main areas that has benefited from technology is the agricultural
    sector. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), the world should produce 70% more food in 2050 than what it produced in
    2006 to feed the growing population around the world [1]. The Agricultural sector
    is turning to the IoT for analysis, management and the search for greater production
    capacities as the demands for the products and its operation increase. The growth
    of communication technologies and sensors for agriculture, their easy usage and
    operation, as well as their low production cost, allow different parameters such
    as humidity, temperature and soil acidity to be measured in different places [2].
    They can even be used in regions of difficult access, such as mountainous areas,
    slopes and deserts, and other possible places where agriculture can be developed.
    In this regard, the use of these technologies allows farmers to analyze the data
    collected by the sensors, predict future climatic conditions and, therefore, improve
    productivity, minimize expenses and preserve the resources used. 1.2. Problem
    Definition and Contribution In Ecuador, the use of intelligent sensors at the
    agricultural level is very limited. Currently, there are sensors that are used
    for census, monitoring and control of multiple variables [3]. The use of these
    wireless sensors allows for efficient energy management. They are scalable. New
    sensors can be incorporated without affecting performance, achieving the implementation
    of dynamic network topologies [4]. The contribution of this work is to reduce
    the technological gap in rural communities in Ecuador, which do not have many
    economic resources, and with this network, farmers will be able to control production
    and pests, based on the climatic changes present in the area. For the coverage
    area where the network is implemented, the applied system offers scalability,
    security, management and an affordable cost for the community, whose economic
    income depends mostly on agricultural activities. In this context, the system
    will serve as a basis for the implementation of techniques such as phytosanitary
    control, intelligent irrigation, and production forecasting among others. 2. Related
    Works Extensive research was conducted on the LoRa network and communication technologies.
    Foremost, it is identified that Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWAN) technologies have
    become popular worldwide [5]; such as LTE-M [6], SigFox, Narrow Band (NB)-IoT
    [7] and long-range LoRa [8]. The latter two being the ones that dominate wireless
    communications. Comparing these two technologies, it was identified that LoRa
    has advantages in terms of battery life, its capacity and cost; while NB-IoT offers
    benefits in terms of service quality (QoS), latency, reliability and range [9,10].
    It was also pointed out that despite the extensive research that has been conducted
    so far on existing LPWAN technologies, there are still challenges to be addressed
    that can be of great assistance to the scientific and academic community. Regarding
    the use of LoRa in agriculture, [11] proposes the development of a mobile gateway
    device with low-power wide-area networks (LoRaWAN), used to increase the productivity
    and efficiency of greenhouses. The results showed that this approach helps current
    agricultural processes, due to the low cost and accuracy of humidity and temperature
    measurements. On the other hand, in [12], a system was developed to transmit uninterrupted
    images taken from a camera in a static environment through LoRa, the purpose of
    which was to reduce the amount of data transmitted while maintaining the quality
    of the image and service. Research on agricultural monitoring with LoRa networks
    was also conducted. In [13], a soil environment monitoring system based on a radio
    frequency identification (RFID) sensor and LoRa is presented to conduct long-term
    and low-cost monitoring. In addition, in [14], a long-range, low-power IoT network
    was recommended to monitor soil moisture; using LoRa as the communication interface,
    which uses the 868 MHz ISM band for signal transmission. On the other hand, a
    model called AgriPrediction [15] was presented, which combines a short and medium-range
    wireless network system with a prediction engine to proactively predict changes
    in crops, thus notifying the farmer of corrective actions. Finally, studies on
    the state-of-the-art and the current situation in agriculture, IoT and the LoRa
    network [16,17,18] were reviewed. These studies represent a great starting point
    to arrive at intelligent agriculture. Other studies referring to the use of IoT
    in agriculture were identified in [19]. They developed an object detection model
    for the monitoring and control of weeds in grasslands in the state of California.
    After a series of tests, the model showed an average of 94% accuracy in image
    detection, which is better than other models identified in the literature. On
    the other hand, in [20], a software framework based on a fuzzy logic system for
    the evaluation and cleaning of pastures is proposed to be designed. Via this framework,
    it is possible to measure the density of weeds and empty spots through images
    and score the state of pasture productivity. In addition, it is possible to produce
    2D weed density maps, which provide a better view of the pastures. Finally, this
    field of study identified a Microservices software framework to implement automatic
    functions in the IoT–Fog–Cloud ecosystem, which will enable the development of
    intelligent decision-making systems based on the IoT context [21]. Another important
    field is the IoT/sensor networks operational optimization. The design, implementation
    and evaluation of an algo-handover rhythm for wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
    presented where different tests were performed, and it was identified that the
    proposed design can reduce the energy consumption by several orders of magnitude
    compared to existing handover algorithms for WSNs [22]. In this same field of
    study in [23], an Energy Efficient and Fault-Tolerant Hierarchical Clustering
    Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is proposed, which the authors named
    (FEHCA). The simulation results are encouraging as they enable better decision
    making on sensing data. As described in previous paragraphs, this research presents
    the development of a LoRa network architecture, which allows monitoring variables
    inherent to agricultural processes such as: ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    soil moisture and ultraviolet radiation in mountainous areas of the Andean region
    of Ecuador. This will enable farmers to make timely decisions regarding agricultural
    activities to improve production and reduce losses due to adverse climatic effects.
    3. LoRa Overview LoRa is a LoRaWAN physical layer technology, licensed free in
    ISM bands, characterized by low bandwidth and a limited number of messages [24,25].
    It uses Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation that allows long-range and low-power
    consumption [26]. In LoRa communication, some parameters can be customized, such
    as the spreading factor (SF), the coding rate (CR) and the bandwidth (BW). The
    values of each parameter depend on the region where the LoRa devices are installed.
    In Europe, it uses bands of 868 MHz, 915 MHz in North America and 433 MHz in Asia
    [25,27]. Nevertheless, the SF can vary between 7 and 12. The higher it is, the
    higher the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the sensitivity, the coverage range, the
    symbol time (Ts) [28] and the time on air (ToA); that is, the packet transmission
    time. LoRa modulation can transmit arbitrary frames using two types of packet
    formats, explicit and implicit. Generally, the packet structure consists of four
    elements: preamble, header (optional), data payload (limited to 255 bytes) and
    an optional payload CRC [27,29]. The format is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. LoRa
    package format. A typical LoRa network operates with a bandwidth of 125 kHz, 250
    kHz or 500 kHz [30]. The increase in bandwidth allows for higher transmission
    speed, but it becomes more susceptible to errors [31]. In Equation (1), the symbol
    time ( 𝑇 𝑠 ) is linked to the bandwidth and the spreading factor (SF). 𝑇 𝑠 = 2
    𝑆𝐹 𝐵𝑊 (1) LoRa includes a forward error correcting code. The code rate (CR) is
    given by 𝐶𝑅= 4 4+𝑛 , with 𝑛∈{1,2,3,4} . Taking into account that the bits of information
    are transmitted by symbol. The useful bit modulation rate 𝑅 𝑏 [32], is defined
    by Equation (2): 𝑅 𝑏 =𝑆𝐹×( 𝐵𝑊 2 𝑆𝐹 )×( 4 4+𝑛 ) (2) To calculate the time on air
    for the transmission of a LoRa packet [27,28,29], Equation (3) is presented: 𝑇𝑜𝐴=
    2 𝑆 𝐹 𝐵𝑊 (𝑁𝑃+4.25+𝑆𝑊+𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐻,0)) (3) 𝐻=[ 8𝑃𝐿−4𝑆𝐹+28+16𝐶𝑅𝐶−20𝐼𝐻 4(𝑆𝐹−2𝐷𝐸) ](𝑛+4)
    where 𝑛 is the value of the parameter belonging to CR = 4/(4 + n).  𝑁𝑃 is the
    Number of programmable symbols of the preamble. 𝑆𝑊 is the length of the sync word.
    𝑃𝐿 is the number of PHY useful payload bytes. CRC is CRC presence (1 = yes; 0
    = no). IH is the presence of the PHY header (1 = no; 0 = yes) and DE is the use
    of data rate optimization (1 = enabled; 0 = disabled). The received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI) is an important measurement parameter that reflects the quality
    of LoRa links [28]. With the noise factor (NF) of the receiver and the transmitted
    power P_TX, it is possible to estimate the SNR of the measured RSSI values, according
    to [28,32]: 𝑆𝑁𝑅=𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐼+174−10(𝐵𝑊)−𝑁𝐹 (4) where 𝑁𝐹 = 6 dB, which is the noise and
    RSSI is the receiver sensitivity −137 dBm [27], BW = 125 Khz, SF = 12 and where
    𝑅 𝑏 = 293 bps. 4. Proposal Development This section explains the design of the
    LoRa System used for monitoring agricultural fields in the Andean region of Ecuador.
    The implementation of a LoRa network without using LoRaWAN is sufficient for the
    case study; since the network of nodes communicating through the gateway is minimal,
    this is low power monitoring [33]. Furthermore, LoRa represents the physical layer
    within a LoRaWAN network. For the coverage area, the applied system offers scalability,
    security, management and an affordable cost for the community population whose
    economic income depends solely on agricultural activities. In this context, the
    system will serve as a basis for the implementation of techniques such as phytosanitary
    control, intelligent irrigation, and production forecasting among others. The
    main elements are described in Table 1. Table 1. Hardware and Software Components.
    4.1. System Architecture The Internet of Things (IoT) design based on LoRa communications
    is composed of different levels and elements. In Figure 2, the general architecture
    of the LoRa network system is presented, composed of end nodes, a gateway and
    an IoT server. Nodes 1 and 2 collect information from the agricultural fields
    by means of sensors, while node 3 is arranged for the activation of an actuator.
    The gateway is in charge of receiving and forwarding the information of the climatic
    variables coming from the final nodes to the IoT server to be visualized in a
    user interface that also controls the activation of a device through node 3. Therefore,
    in order to have a long-distance data transfer capability, the standard LoRa protocol
    is utilized. Figure 2. General architecture of the LoRa network system. 4.2. System
    Description In most cases in the Andean region of Ecuador, agricultural fields
    are not supervised, making it difficult to ensure adequate control of adverse
    weather conditions to improve crop production. In addition, the geographic areas
    dedicated to the cultivation of agricultural products are often difficult to access
    with a rocky orography and a deficit of communication infrastructure [34]. Therefore,
    the need to provide a monitoring and tracking system for LoRa crops is a priority
    and crucial not only for sustainable agriculture, but also for the protection
    of the micro-economies and food livelihoods of indigenous communities through
    controlled supervision. Therefore, a new contribution is made by introducing other
    prototype devices designed and created under experimental testing. The design
    and fabrication of the final nodes together with the gateway are explained in
    detail below, and the configuration of the user interface is illustrated. 4.3.
    Final Nodes The final nodes were custom designed with adaptability criteria capable
    of operating autonomously to facilitate deployment on agricultural fields and
    enable monitoring and control with LoRa wireless communication technology in the
    Andean region of Ecuador. The electronic processor of the final nodes was a TTGO
    LoRa32-OLED V1 module that integrates an ESP32 microcontroller, a 0.96-inch OLED
    display and a LoRa module based on the SEMTECH SX1276 chip with a frequency of
    868–915 MHz and a high transmission range that is very reliable [35]. Additionally,
    it can be programmed by Arduino IDE with some preinstalled libraries OLED, LoRa,
    etc. Figure 3a shows the electronic diagram of the transmitter node 1. For supplying
    electrical power to node 1, a rechargeable 2 Cell 1300 mAh LiPo TURNIGY battery
    at 7.4 V, a DC-DC LM2596 module configured to supply 5 V to the MCU, to the DHT21
    sensors measuring temperature, relative humidity and to the capacitive soil moisture
    sensor HW390 were available. Figure 3. (a) Electronic schematic and (b) manufacture
    of transmitter node 1. For the synergy of the electronic components, a PCB board
    was designed, which is also protected by a customized IP65 internal protection
    grade housing 3D printed with PLA thermoplastic as shown in Figure 3b. Figure
    4a shows the electronic diagram of the transmitter node 2; while Figure 4b shows
    the manufactured device. Unlike node 1; node 2 switches to the 3 Cell 1000 mAh
    LiPo TURNIGY battery at 11.1 V, which has an ML8511 analog sensor for UV radiation
    measurement under 5 V operation. Figure 4. (a) Electronic schematic and (b) manufacturing
    of transmitter node 2. Receiver node 3, performs the function of receiving information
    from the gateway via LoRa wireless communication to control an actuator. Node
    3, unlike the preceding nodes, reforms to a rechargeable 3 Cell 11.1 V 1000 mAh
    LiPo TURNIGY 3 Cell battery and a relay module with a controller interface for
    connecting AC (alternating current) powered equipment/machines, such as a water
    pump. The structure is similar to Figure 4. 4.4. Gateway The function of the gateway
    is to forward and receive the information arriving from the end nodes via LoRa
    wireless communication to the IoT server using standard IP internet protocol [36].
    Figure 5a illustrates the electronic design of the gateway that has an ESP32 microcontroller
    as the central coordinator module; it is an IoT device with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
    support integrated on a single development board. In the present prototype, an
    ESP32 DEVKIT MCU was used, which has an on-board USB serial converter and a micro-USB
    port for power supply, integrated 4 MB flash memory, GPIOs with PWM function,
    I2C, SPI, AD/DA converters, among other functions [37]. The ESP32 DEVKIT MCU allows
    sending and receiving information via the integrated Wi-Fi chip to and from the
    user interface over the IP network. For communication with the end nodes, the
    Heltec Wi-Fi LoRa 32(V2) module was used, which has the integrated SEMTECH SX1276
    LoRa chip and the ESP32 programmable microcontroller and incorporates a 0.96-inch
    OLED display. The chip operates at a frequency of 902–928 MHz with a receive sensitivity
    of −127 dBm, an omnidirectional UHF antenna and a gain of 2 dBi [18]. With the
    Heltec Wi-Fi LoRa 32(V2) modules, 2 independent LoRa wireless channels were created,
    one for transmitting and one for receiving data. The synchronous information flow
    between the ESP32 DEVKIT microcontroller and the Heltec Wi-Fi LoRa 32(V2) MCUs
    was achieved with I2C digital communication, generating a functional gateway for
    LoRa Full Duplex communications. Power supply took place with the HP 120VAC charger
    at 1.6 A/60 Hz, the DC 18.5 V/3.5 A output, and a DC-DC LM2596 module configured
    to provide 5 V to the gateway MCUs. Figure 5. (a) Electronic schematic and (b)
    gateway manufacturing. A PCB board was designed for the synergy of the electronic
    components that are protected against external IP65 weather conditions with a
    custom-made housing printed with 3D PLA thermoplastic as presented in Figure 5b.
    4.5. Server Communication It is in charge of receiving and processing the data
    packets coming from the end nodes and administering and managing the configuration
    required by the network. The data are acquired by the server API; i.e., Thinger.io
    so that users can control the environment of their field in order to use the data
    log and have an action based on field monitoring [38]. 4.6. User Application The
    user interface allows data to be visualized on an IoT platform [39], through the
    deployment of sensor nodes. Data from agricultural fields can be collected and
    transmitted to control actuators. Additionally, from the user application, proper
    monitoring and management of agricultural production are performed [40]. A graphical
    user interface was designed using the IoT platform Thinger.io as shown in Figure
    6. The user interface allows farmers to obtain crop data and information and take
    control of the actuators [36]. In the interface, the value of temperature, relative
    humidity, soil moisture, UV radiation and battery level of the transmitter nodes
    can be displayed. In addition, an actuator such as a water pump can be controlled.
    Figure 6. User Interface. 5. Testing and Experimental Configuration To evaluate
    the performance of the proposed LoRa network, it was implemented and deployed
    in a rural area of the Andean region of Ecuador. In this Section, the deployment
    site and the metrics that characterize the connectivity between LoRa devices are
    analyzed. 5.1. Test Area The environment used to evaluate the coverage of the
    LoRa network was in the rural community of Chirinche Bajo, Salcedo, Ecuador. The
    geographic location of the gateway and end nodes were deployed in an area of 50
    hectares, as illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7. Spatial distribution of nodes
    and gateway on the digital surface elevation model, Chirinche Bajo community,
    Salcedo, Ecuador. As is characteristic of the Andean zones, the Chirinche Bajo
    community has different environmental particularities such as agricultural areas
    with altitudes ranging from 2910 to 3040 m above sea level, slopes of 0.3% to
    15%, terrain with a hard orography, irregularities in the soil and lush Eucalyptus
    trees in the community boundaries. Most of the people in the community are dedicated
    to farming potatoes, corn, onions, pasture, and caring for domestic animals such
    as cattle, pigs and poultry. To plan the deployment, it is important to obtain
    some insights into the communication range [41]. The satellite map in Figure 8
    illustrates the position of the gateway and end nodes distinguished by blue and
    red points, respectively. Table 2 shows the approximate straight-line distance
    of the different positions from the gateway. Figure 8. Longitudinal cross-sectional
    profile of link Nodes—Gateway. Table 2. Node positions and distance (approximate
    in a straight line) from the gateway. 5.2. Communication between Nodes and Station
    The end nodes were located in the agricultural fields of the Chirinche Bajo community,
    while the gateway was located in an inhabitant’s house from where it was linked
    to the Internet through a wireless Wi-Fi connection. Three autonomous networked
    end nodes were considered for the experimental test. Nodes 1 and 2, working at
    a frequency of 915 MHz for uplinks, while node 3 at 904 MHz for downlinks, were
    placed on poles 1 m above the ground, as illustrated in Figure 9a. Eight different
    locations were chosen based on the spatial distribution in agricultural fields
    and topography, in order to cover all possibilities and different types of environments,
    short and long distance, Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), the
    latter being affected by obstructions resulting from houses, trees, crops and
    slopes, as can be seen in Figure 8. Figure 9. (a) Flowchart of the optimized gateway
    algorithm and (b) Flowchart of the optimized end-node algorithm. The LoRa gateway
    has 2 channels at frequencies of 915 MHz and 904 MHz for uplink and downlink by
    full-duplex communication. The gateway was placed on the roof of a house (1°04′58.8″
    S 78°38′54.4″ W) at 4 m from the ground with the antennas placed vertically (normally
    a base station of this type is placed higher to achieve better coverage). In addition,
    the choice of the gateway location is based on two reasons. First, electrical
    power. As the gateway communicates with both the end nodes and the Internet, the
    power consumption is higher. Thus, a direct connection to the power outlet would
    avoid supply problems. Second, the connection to the Internet [42]. The gateway
    can be connected via Wi-Fi directly to the switch located in the house. Thus,
    communication with the IoT platform Thinger.io is ensured. 5.3. Experimental Configuration
    Radio planning, which evaluates the performance of the LoRa network operating
    at 915 MHz and 904 MHz, is presented. Based on the number of LoRa parameters that
    can be configured, a configuration notation is defined for the experimental tests:
    frequency (Fr), bandwidth (BW), spreading factor (SF) and coding rate (CR). Nodes
    1 and 2 transmit information of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity
    and UV radiation) to the gateway at 2000 ms intervals. The data received by the
    gateway were stored on a PC. Node 3 receives the payload packets from the gateway
    and these were sent via Bluetooth to a mobile application for storage. The study
    focuses on nodes sending/receiving packets with a payload length of 16 bytes,
    8 bytes and 4 bytes. The link checks at each location were performed by configuring
    the end node and the gateway with identical transmit/receive parameters going
    through various combinations for three values of spreading factor SF (7, 9 and
    12), keeping a constant value in the coding rate CR (4/5) and 125 kHz in the bandwidth
    parameter (BW). The isotropic transmit power is set at 14 dBm, the maximum allowed
    [43], using antennas with 2 dBi gain. The main parameters are shown in Table 3.
    Table 3. LoRa communication parameters. The LoRa wireless communication parameters
    in Table 2, were customized in an optimized algorithm in C language in the Arduino
    IDE. The optimized algorithm addresses different parameters [44,45] pre-installed
    libraries such as LoRa, OLED, etc.; Fr, BW, SF, CR; variable acquisitions, reception/transmission
    and data flow occurring within a period of 2000 ms. The MCUs used in the research
    had their own optimized algorithm. During the experiments, each end node was configured
    to transmit 100 packets to the LoRa gateway; as well as downstream communication
    node 3 received 100 payload packets. The flowchart of the optimized gateway algorithm
    is illustrated in Figure 9a. A summary of the simplified logic of the end-node
    operation is presented in Figure 9b. 5.4. Metrics During the experiments we used
    different metrics to characterize the connectivity between the transmitter and
    receiver (See Table 4): Table 4. Summary of evaluated metrics. The packet delivery
    ratio (PDR), provides information about the reliability of the communication;
    the PDR is calculated as the number of packets received by the gateway with respect
    to the total number of packets sent, with a value of 100% implying success and
    a value of 0 implying no success [41]. The received signal strength (RSSI) and
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are two physical layer PHY-level indicators of LoRa
    available on-chip, which we use to characterize the signal quality [46]. The connectivity
    range represents the measured distance between the receiver and the transmitter.
    Our objective was to study the connectivity range in the agricultural fields of
    the Chirinche Bajo community. 6. Experimental Results and Analysis The metrics
    considered in the study were packet delivery ratio (PDR), received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI), signal to noise ratio (SNR) and time on air (ToA), which are
    the parameters chosen to assess the performance of the LoRa communication uplink
    and downlink in the different environments of the Chirinche Bajo community. The
    experiments were conducted during weather variations with sun and rain from 5–23
    June 2022. The LoRa gateway was placed in a fixed position during all measurements,
    while the end nodes were placed in different locations as illustrated in Figure
    10. The evaluation was segmented into three groups: the first expedition was in
    the morning hours, the LoRa network was configured with SF at seven, a cloudy
    day with showers and a breeze was present; the average temperature was 16 °C,
    the relative humidity was in the range of 74–86% and the average UV radiation
    was in two indexes. Figure 10. End nodes in test positions. In the second evaluation,
    the SF was parameterized at nine and the weather was partially cloudy. At the
    end of the evaluation (POS G and H), the sun was present, the wind blew with medium
    intensity; the average temperature was 12 °C, the relative humidity was in a range
    of 74–89% and the average ultraviolet radiation was in one index. Finally, on
    the third excursion, it was a sunny day with high-intensity winds, the average
    temperature was 19 °C, the relative humidity was in a range of 53–68% and the
    average ultraviolet radiation was in four indices. This evaluation was carried
    out from 16h00. 6.1. PDR Package Delivery Ratio In this subsection, we present
    the PDR results for uplink communications, i.e., the end nodes send 100 packets
    to the gateway with a payload length of 16 bytes (node 1) and 8 bytes (node 2)
    with a frequency of 2000 ms, at various distances with different SF configurations,
    including SF = 7, 9 and 12. Figure 11a illustrates the PDR for node 1 and Figure
    11b the result for node 2. It can be visualized that the PDR decreases with increasing
    payload length, demonstrating an impact of packet length on frame reception. Being
    in the SF configuration in 12 with a PDR in the range of 42–47% with PL of 16
    bytes in positions D, F and G. Furthermore, it is determined that the PDR success
    rate is different for each end node depending on the test environment; therefore,
    in position A, B, C, E and H, a better PDR is obtained than in positions D, F
    and G. The effect is due to the fact that positions D, F and G are located in
    areas with slopes of about 15%, surrounded by eucalyptus trees, vegetation and
    no line of sight (NLoS), thus generating more interference, more path loss and
    noise to the LoRa radio communication signal. Figure 11. PDR: (a) Nodes 1, (b)
    Node 2. In contrast to the results obtained in [46], the tests carried out in
    a forested area at 90 m, there was no communication for the transmission powers
    tested (7, 13 and 14 dBm); in comparison with the present work, communication
    was achieved for this type of orography; obtaining a PDR of 42–47% in uplinks
    and downlinks a PDR greater than 87%, for forested areas. Node 3 was set up for
    downlink communications, i.e., the gateway sends 100 packets with a payload length
    of 4 bytes to the end node. Figure 12 shows the PDR of node 3. It is determined
    that the PDR with SF of 7, 9 and 12 at positions D, F and G maintains an acceptable
    success rate, since they are the locations with the highest interference, a PDR
    of no less than 87% is displayed. It is important to note that the objective of
    the tests is to check the coverage of the LoRa physical layer using different
    propagation factors. Figure 12. PDR Nodes 3. 6.2. Receiver Sensitivity Since there
    are many models and evaluations of the propagation of LoRa radio signals in various
    environments [28], this experiment focuses on testing the performance of LoRa
    receivers in the Chirinche Bajo community, as there are no studies conducted in
    these areas. The received signal strength indicators (RSSI) of the packets and
    the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were recorded at each of the positions. Figure
    13a,b show the RSSI values received at the gateway from node 1 and 2 with different
    SFs. RSSI values around the −111 dBm and −122 dBm mark are observed at positions
    D, F and G. The configuration with SF equal to nine emerges as the best option
    to achieve the highest throughput with the lowest packet on-air time at locations
    D, F and G. However, the alternative (SF at 12) could also be used. This would
    depend on the application’s tolerance to packet loss. Figure 13. RSSI of the radio
    (dBm): (a) Node 1, (b) Node 2. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the RSSI are
    related, since, in positions D, F and G, there is more interference in the signal
    flow with SNR values in a range of −2.55 and −15.14, as can be seen in Figure
    14a,b. It should be noted that the signal sensitivity is largely influenced by
    the evaluation environment, which, in the case of positions D, F and G, was located
    on a 15% slope surrounded by eucalyptus trees and without a line of sight (NLoS).
    Figure 14. Radio SNR (dBm): (a) Node, (b) Node 2. The RSSI was evaluated in downlink
    communication, with a payload of 4 bytes, the sensitivity was in the range of
    −122 dBm and −125 dBm with SNR in a range of −2.51 and −6.27 in positions D, F
    and G; although, they are lower than in the uplinks, the PDR had higher efficiency.
    Figure 15 illustrates the RSSI of node 3 and Figure 16 shows the SNR with SF of
    7, 9 and 12. Figure 15. RSSI of the radio (dBm) of node 3. Figure 16. SNR of node
    3. 6.3. Time in the Air (ToA) It is noticeable that higher BW bandwidth gives
    a higher data rate [37], with shorter transmission time, as Equation (2) demonstrates.
    However, higher BW degrades the receiver sensitivity, as revealed by Equation
    (4), due to additional noise integration. For the transmission of a LoRa packet,
    its structure comprises three elements: preamble, header (optional) and payload.
    There are two types of LoRa packet format modes, explicit and implicit; where
    the header is removed from the packet, both the CR and payload size are fixed
    and must be manually configured on both sides of the radio link. Therefore, the
    implicit header mode reduces the transmission time of the packet, which is known
    in the LoRa literature as ToA calculated using Equation (3). For the study, we
    worked with the LoRa node parameters in Table 2. The packet structure in transmission
    consisted of the preamble plus the payload of 16 bytes, 8 bytes and 4 bytes with
    different SF. The result showed that the higher the SF, the airtime of a packet
    increases. These results can be seen in Figure 17. Figure 17. LoRa data packet
    transmission time. 6.4. Discussion In the literature, we identified works that
    have developed similar proposals. Many of the articles that were analyzed seem
    to assume that the terrain orography does not have much importance in the implementation
    of the network; these studies are focused on greenhouses. In [2,34,36,38,47],
    the type of orography of the site is not detailed. The different authors propose
    novel systems of intelligent agricultural management and monitoring based on LoRa,
    without considering the orography of the terrain in mountainous areas. Another
    important factor that is not taken into account when applying the network is the
    altitude of the locations, since these studies are located below 1700 m above
    sea level, being a factor that affects the transmission of data packets according
    to [46]. The distance between the gateway and the growing site of a LoRa network
    in rural areas according to [38] is 700 m; reaching a spreading factor of seven
    at 400 m and a spreading factor of nine reaching 500 m, respectively. In this
    context, it is explained that as the propagation factor increases, which is the
    communication delay between the client and the servers, an increase in the communication
    delay was obtained. The proposed system in Andean areas reduces this problem by
    maintaining optimal communication with SF settings of seven and nine in different
    weather conditions as explained in Section 6. According to the results found in
    [2] where they evaluate the performance of a LoRaWAN network, they confirm that
    the performance of the network is influenced by the sending of messages with or
    without acknowledgement, the size of the network, the increase in the number of
    gateways and the distance of placement of the gateway nodes, not to mention the
    weather conditions and even more the terrain orography. Therefore, the study focuses
    on the influence of the packet transmission interval together with the number
    of nodes on the packet delivery rate. Therefore, the importance of this study
    lies in the implementation of a monitoring system based on the LoRa network in
    mountainous areas of Ecuador. 7. Conclusions and Future Works In the literature,
    there are studies on the radio range of LoRa in geographic areas that do not exceed
    1700 m.a.s.l., in which it is stated that the coverage depends on the environment
    in which the network is implemented. So, this research was conducted, since there
    are no previous studies that give a detailed explanation of the LoRa network in
    mountainous areas above 2910 m.a.s.l. in the Andean region of Ecuador. The orography
    impaired the radio-link sensitivity, which was attenuated when located in positions
    with slopes of 15% with the presence of eucalyptus trees in the environment and
    without a line of sight with respect to the Gateway. The objective of implementing
    a monitoring system of climatic variables for the agricultural fields of the community
    of Chirinche Bajo was achieved. In Ecuador, the use of these LoRa networks is
    very limited due to the technological gap that exists in the Andean areas of Ecuador,
    in addition to the fact that agricultural processes are not technical due to the
    low technological knowledge of the population, which hinders the successful implementation
    of new technologies. To evaluate the range and avoid data loss in LoRa radio communication,
    the propagation factor (SF) was set to 7, 9 and 12, keeping the CR constant at
    (4/5) and BW at 125 kHz, in order to assess the sensitivity and integrity in the
    delivery of data packets. The SF setting equal to nine, emerged as the best option
    to achieve the highest throughput with the shortest packet on-air time. However,
    the alternative (FS at 12) could also be used to achieve higher coverage. Although,
    this would depend on the application’s tolerance to packet loss. The performance
    of LoRa communication with an SF of nine achieves a packet delivery success rate
    (PDR) for uplinks no lower than 76% and a PDR for downlinks higher than 92%. The
    scope of the LoRa network architecture is based on tests conducted in a 50-hectare
    field with a maximum range length of 875 m without a line of sight, obtaining
    adequate data delivery. The present work benefited 80 families in the community
    of Chirinche Bajo in the province of Cotopaxi in Ecuador, through the timely monitoring
    of climatic variables that mitigate agricultural losses due to adverse climatic
    effects. To increase the autonomy time of the nodes deployed in the crops, a feasibility
    analysis should be conducted to implement photovoltaic power generators, recharge
    the batteries and increase the operating time. Currently, work is being undertaken
    to improve security aspects by means of encryption algorithms such as Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES) at the moment of transmitting the information. In addition,

  analysis: Study of physical layer security techniques are analyzed first. In this
    domain, the security solutions related to the link-layer of SATCOM systems are
    categorized into two main research domains, i.e., physical-layer security and
    cryptography. In the following, we delve into each area, analyzing the security
    services provided and how such schemes guarantee the desired security objectives.
    Considering the physical-layer security approaches for physical layer confidentiality
    of communications, Section 3.1 introduces information-theoretic security strategies
    and solutions to enhance data secrecy. Specifically, Section 3.1 introduces information-theoretic
    security approaches for physical layer confidentiality of communications, Section
    3.2 focuses on GNSS anti-spoofing techniques, while Section 3.3 includes considerations
    on anti-jamming solutions of SATCOM. To conclude our critical discussion, Section
    3.4 summarizes the main lessons learned while Section 3.5 highlights future research
    directions in the area of physical-layer security. Regarding the physical-layer
    security of SATCOM, we identified three major streams, i.e., information-theoretic
    security, anti-spoofing, and anti-jamming. We discussed, compared, and cross-analyzed
    the most important proposals that were proposed throughout the years, putting
    emphasis on the performance metrics adopted by the different approaches, as well
    as on the link layer parameters, and on the capabilities of the adversary. We
    then moved on to discuss anti-spoofing techniques, providing a broad overview
    of the most important contributions that can be found in scientific literature.
    We then discussed anti-jamming techniques, presenting the main countermeasures
    that have been proposed to mitigate jamming attacks in SATCOM. Once the exposition
    of physical-layer security techniques is over, Section 4 focuses on cryptography
    approaches for SATCOM systems. We analyzed the most important contributions dealing
    with the application of cryptography techniques to SATCOM for both peer authentication
    and key exchange. As it is well known, most of the contributions dealing with
    cryptography for SATCOM applications can be grouped into two macro-categories.
    Therefore, Section 4.1 focuses on techniques for peer authentication, Section
    4.2 discusses key agreement schemes, while Section 4.3 introduces approaches for
    key distribution based on quantum channels. Once the discussion on cryptography
    techniques is completed, the conclusions in Section 6.0 highlight that the design
    and testing of cybersecurity strategies for SATCOMs is still an active research
    domain. In particular, our contribution calls for collaboration between Industry
    and Academia to unlock new business opportunities and services, while enjoying
    the needed level of security for communications, applications, and infrastructures.

    Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and Academia,
    thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising
    impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early
    6G initiatives. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes
    and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding
    communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On
    the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links
    should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities
    characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities
    are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased
    attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services. In
    this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on
    the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying
    and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security
    for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography
    schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified
    branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer
    confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based
    key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most
    essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned,
    and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose
    additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers
    and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite
    communications. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Satellites

    Satellite-based Communications (SATCOMs) play a vital role in the global telecommunication
    systems, having found applications in a plethora of domains throughout the last
    50 years, including radio broadcasting, weather forecast, maritime communications,
    assisted navigation, and military operations, to name a few [1]. While the attention
    of Academia and Industry in the last years was mainly focused on ground communication
    systems, recent business initiatives launched by leading tech companies such as
    SpaceX, Facebook, and Amazon generated new renewed interest in satellite-based
    systems [2], [3]. In particular, satellites are being deployed to provide services
    in a variety of new application domains, e.g., to reach remote locations providing
    unmatched connectivity (as per bandwidth and cost), or to support low-power constrained
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices [4]. As a result, recent commercial and standardization
    activities clearly indicate SATCOMs as one of the most important enabling technologies
    for supporting the development of the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks
    [5]. In addition, the business driving factors also seem to indicate a bright
    future for SATCOMs. Indeed, according to a dedicated research report by Market
    Research Future (MRFR), “Satellite Communication Market Information by Product,
    Technology, End-Use, and Region-Forecast till 2025”, the SATCOM market is anticipated
    to reach USD 41,860 Million by 2025, sporting a 8.40% Compound Annual Growth Rate
    (CAGR). Despite the promising applications and forecasting, the adoption of satellite
    links generally widens the threat surface of a system, introducing new vulnerabilities.
    Indeed, the ease to eavesdrop, tamper, disrupt, and reroute the satellite traffic
    provides the attacker with an extensive portfolio of opportunities to launch cyber-attacks
    at scale and affect the operations of such systems in different ways [6]. To complete
    the scenario, there is also the fact that the military satellite backbone is subject
    to the same (if not bigger) issues [7]. The severity of the cited threats could
    be even higher when considering that most of the current satellite systems either
    do not integrate security at all or run outdated security techniques, unable to
    face the complex attacks launched today [8]. As a result, security solutions for
    SATCOM should be revisited and coupled with the unique features of satellite-based
    systems. Several contributions in the last decade already investigated security
    issues in the context of SATCOM (refer to Table 1 for an overview). Looking at
    the main contributions on SATCOM security, valuable insights are provided by,
    e.g. [11], [12], [14], [15], [18], and [16]. However, they only preliminarily
    identified the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing and GNSS jamming
    attacks and presented the adopted solutions and mitigation techniques available
    from the literature. Moreover, the study by the authors in [10] only summarize
    the schemes targeting data secrecy at the physical layer, with a focus on information-theoretic
    schemes only. Other surveys, such as the one in [19], focused specifically on
    some research areas, such as quantum computing, missing the contextualization
    of such areas to other research in the SATCOM domain. It is also worth mentioning
    the recent contribution by [20], highlighting the threats affecting specific application
    areas where SATCOM links play a role. However, such a survey focuses on the review
    of the literature, rather than on the identification of the research areas where
    such contributions are provided. Moreover, although many contributions are available
    on secure routing, e.g. [21], [22], the focus of our investigation is link-layer
    security in satellite communications, and secure routing is therefore out of scope.
    As a result, we notice that the current literature is still missing a comprehensive
    survey, presenting and exploring all the facets of the threat surface to be considered
    when deploying SATCOM systems at the link-layer, as well as related countermeasures.

    Aperture Terminal 2. Background This section introduces the main notions related
    to SATCOM systems used within our manuscript, including the satellites constellations,
    architectures, and the involved protocols. Overall, this section aims to provide
    the reader with the needed background on SATCOM technologies and their main features,
    that will be used in the sequel of the paper. 2.1. Satellite constellations The
    main features that distinguish satellites orbits are the shape (circular or elliptical),
    the altitude (Low-Earth, Medium-Earth, or Geostationary), the travel direction
    (clockwise or counterclockwise), and the inclination to the plane of the Earth’s
    equator [23]. The most popular of the previously cited features is the altitude:
    we distinguish Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geostationary
    Equatorial Orbit (GEO). The respective altitude ranges from the Earth surface
    are 500 to 900 km for LEO, 5000 to 25,000 km for MEO, and 36,000 km for GEO [24].
    The altitude is directly related to the services offered to the end users. Without
    loss of generality, the farther is the satellite from the Earth surface, the greater
    is the Earth coverage area. Indeed, the Earth Coverage for LEO satellites is quite
    small, for MEO is larger and for GEO is sizeable. For instance, according to the
    authors in [25], a LEO satellite located 550  km over the Earth surface, having
    an elevation of 40 degrees, can cover an area of approx. 1.05 million km squared,
    with an approximate radius of 580  km. At the same time, according to the authors
    in [26], a GEO satellite can cover 40 degrees of latitude, i.e., approximately
    one-third of the Earth surface. Given that the coverage range is directly related
    to the number of satellites to be operated, such a number decreases when the distance
    from the Earth increases. SATCOM uplink and downlink channels adopt different
    frequencies to mitigate the interference on the ground and at the satellite. The
    band, frequency regulations, and recommendations are authorized by Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU). For instance,
    according to the European Space Agency (ESA) [27], SATCOMs frequency bands are
    standardized in the range of 1 ∼ 40  GHz, as reported in Table 3. For instance,
    Inmarsat [28] is a provider of SATCOM services that adopt GEO satellites to provide
    telephone and data services to users worldwide. Companies like SpaceX [29] and
    Iridium [30], [31] are planning to launch in orbit thousands of LEO satellites
    to provide low latency, broadband internet systems, voice, and data services anywhere
    on Earth. Table 3. Satellites frequency bands and applications. Satellite frequency

    The reference communication architecture of a SATCOM system, as depicted in Fig.
    2, is generally characterized by: (i) a space segment including the Satellite
    to Satellite (SS) and the Satellite to Ground (SG) links; (ii) a ground segment,
    defined by the satellite operators (or gateways) and network operators, enabling
    the Ground to Satellite (GS), Ground to Ground (GG), Satellite to Ground (SG),
    forwarding, and the Satellite to User (SU) links; and finally, (iii) a user segment,
    which includes the terminals, e.g., ships, airplanes, and satellite smartphones,
    enabling the additional User to Ground (UG) and the User to Satellite (US) links.
    The space segment of a SATCOM architecture is one of the three main components
    of a SATCOM system. This segment comprises GEO satellites to support business
    in navigation, data, mobile television, and radio broadcasting systems. At the
    same time, MEO satellites are deployed to deliver low-latency and high-bandwidth
    data connectivity to service providers, agencies and industries, and to support
    the network connectivity in the avionic/maritime domain. LEO satellite constellations
    are also adopted for several applications such as imaging, and low-bandwidth telecommunications
    and broadband internet. Each of these satellites is placed in orbit by a launch
    vehicle. The space segment also includes military and defense communication systems,
    as well as commercial SATCOM transponders and payloads. Note that the afore-mentioned
    communication links involving satellites all use frequencies in the L-band, in
    the range [ 1 − − 2 ]  GHz. Download : Download high-res image (354KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. SATCOM architecture. The ground segment can
    help to establish the communication between the satellites and all the terminals
    defined in the user segment. It comprises dedicated Gateway stations, namely Satellite
    Operator, infrastructures for control, Network Operator such as the Network Control
    Centre (NCC) and the Network Management Centre (NMC) supporting the satellite
    access requests from users. The user segment includes the user terminals, such
    as satellite mobile phones, ships, and airplane, to name a few. These devices
    can communicate with satellites by leveraging the link between the ground segment
    and the user segment, such as the forward link [32], while their communication
    with the gateways can take place over any communication technology. The forward
    link consists of both an uplink (base station to satellite) and a downlink (satellite
    to mobile user). Conversely, constellations like Iridium, Globalstar, Thuraya
    and Inmarsat allow a direct connection of the user handsets to the satellites,
    using the User to Satellite (US) link that typically uses frequencies in the L-band.
    While the above discussion covers the traditional SATCOM architecture, many variations
    can be found. In this context, it is worth noting that the 3GPP issued several
    standards over the last few years, with the objective to define the general architecture
    of non-terrestrial satellite networks in the context of 5G networks. Such standards
    are meant for several types of non-terrestrial communications, including GNSS,
    High-Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS), and air-to-ground communications—illustrating
    use-cases, scenarios, channels to be used, and modulation formats, to name a few
    [33]. Finally, from the security perspective, note that attacks can be launched
    in any of the identified segments. Thus, the ground segment should be appropriately
    secured, as well as any communication originating from the satellite should be
    protected, independently from its target destination (ground or space). More details
    on the specific threats will be provided in the following sections. 3. Physical
    layer security schemes for SATCOM In this section, we introduce, review, and classify
    approaches investigating security issues of SATCOM technologies at the physical
    layer. Specifically, Section 3.1 introduces information-theoretic security approaches
    for physical layer confidentiality of communications, Section 3.2 focuses on GNSS
    anti-spoofing techniques, while Section 3.3 includes considerations on anti-jamming
    solutions of SATCOM. To conclude our critical discussion, Section 3.4 summarizes
    the main lessons learned while Section 3.5 highlights future research directions
    in the area of physical-layer security. 3.1. Information theoretic security SATCOMs
    are particularly prone to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of the wireless
    medium and the very large coverage area. Usually, the confidentiality of SATCOM
    communications is provided via traditional cryptographic protocols such as Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES), working at the MAC-layer or above. However, legacy
    satellites deployments often use old and proprietary customized versions of AES,
    frequently found later to be insecure. As a result, motivated adversaries featuring
    powerful capabilities and tools can easily collect a consistent amount of encrypted
    data and possibly compromising communications confidentiality. Moreover, many
    satellites deployments were set up several years ago, when wireless security was
    not conceived as a requirement. Indeed, attacks on SATCOM channels was conceived
    by the operators as hard to achieve, and overall, security was thought as a slow-down
    factor rather than an enabler. Thus, many satellites do not implement any security
    protection, and updating them today would require high costs [34]. Taking into
    account the above exposed issues, in the last years many contributions proposed
    to provide confidentiality to SATCOM scenarios by applying information-theoretic
    security schemes. The rationale supporting such schemes is the following: information-theoretic
    security approaches leverage the inherent randomness and noise of SATCOM communication
    channels to minimize the amount of information that can be extracted at the PHY
    layer by an unauthorized receiver [35]. This is typically achieved by guaranteeing
    that the quality of the channel, expressed in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR),
    exceeds a given bound only at the authorized receiver’s location while remaining
    below the set threshold in other locations, so that an eavesdropper cannot decode
    the received message. Moreover, such schemes typically do not assume any constraints
    for the eavesdropper in terms of processing capabilities or network parameter
    knowledge, and the resulting security features can be quantified analytically
    via dedicated channel-level metrics. The afore-mentioned security features are
    achieved without resorting to cryptography materials (e.g. shared key, certificates)
    or crypto related computations, hence resulting in a very efficient solution (from
    the computational, storage, and bandwidth point of view). We present a comprehensive
    classification of the scientific contributions that achieve confidentiality via
    information-theoretic schemes in SATCOM scenarios in Table 4. In the following,
    we summarize the most important features identified throughout our analysis. Table

    SG ✓ External Single Omni-Directional SC Performance Metrics. Many performance
    metrics can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a scheme proposed to ensure
    confidentiality at the PHY-layer via information-theoretic schemes, including,
    e.g., the secrecy capacity/secrecy rate, average secrecy rate, and secrecy outage
    probability, to name a few. We hereby present the definition of the most important
    ones, leading to the definition of all the others. We assume that a malicious
    user E is interested in eavesdropping the traffic exchanged between two legitimate
    network entities and correctly decoding the information. The Secrecy Rate of the
    communication link is defined as the difference between the capacity of the eavesdropper
    E and the capacity of the legitimate user [56], where the capacity is the maximum
    transmission rate at which an eavesdropper is unable to decode any information.
    The secrecy rate of the legitimate source-to-destination communication link at
    the physical layer is defined as in the following Eq. (1): (1) S = C L − C E ,
    where C L is the capacity of the legitimate channel and C E is the capacity of
    the channel source-eavesdropper. Another important metric is the Secrecy Outage
    Probability (SOP), defined as the probability that the instantaneous secrecy capacity
    drops below a specific threshold value, representing a target secrecy rate [57].
    The other metrics listed in Table 4 can be derived from the ones previously introduced.
    Additional details can be found in surveys dedicated to the topic, such as [35].
    Link. The largest part of the analyzed works considered the Satellite-to-Ground
    (SG) link, applying information-theoretic approaches to secure the communications
    from the satellite to the ground receivers. To the best of our knowledge, only
    four works considered the Ground-to-Satellite link, i.e., [39], [42], [46], and
    [54], while other links are never considered. CSI Availability. One of the prominent
    features allowing to compare the contributions on physical-layer security is the
    amount of information known to the network about the attacker. Looking at the
    adversary model, the most restrictive assumption is the complete unavailability
    of information about the channel experienced by the eavesdropper (in technical
    terms, this is the Channel State Information (CSI)). The vast majority of the
    works assume the perfect knowledge of the channel quality at the eavesdropper
    side. This is the most secure approach to analyze the problem from an information-theoretic
    perspective, as it allows to maximize in analytical terms the difference between
    the legitimate channel and the (potentially) eavesdropped one, i.e. the secrecy
    rate. In practice, the cited objective is guaranteed by either reducing the probability
    of correct signal decoding by the adversary, or maximizing the secrecy rate of
    the main communication links. Few other approaches, instead, assume to know either
    partially (Imperfect) or completely the channel experienced by potential eavesdroppers.
    Such adversary model is often referred to as an active eavesdropper, as it is
    a legitimate network node, interacting with the network at times (so, its CSI
    parameter is known), but also equipped with eavesdropping capabilities on other
    communications. A few contributions, such as [36], [39], [41], [45], [51], [52],
    [54] evaluated the impact of the aforementioned assumption on the related security
    metrics. Adversary. In line with related work, we consider two types of adversaries:
    the internal and the external one. In particular, we define an internal adversary
    as an attacker playing the role of a legitimate network entity, actively participating
    in the network activities by transmitting and receiving information, such as an
    active eavesdropper [58]. We define an external adversary as an attacker who is
    not part of a legitimate SATCOM, also striving to remain not detected–hidden.
    This latter category also comprises the external eavesdropper, needing a simple
    receiving antenna tuned on the same frequency of the legitimate communication
    channel to receive packets successfully. Adversarial Receiving Antennas. The simplest
    adversary model, considered by most of the analyzed contributions, is a single
    eavesdropper, not sharing any information with other receivers [36], [37], [39],
    [41], [42], [43], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [52], [53], [54]. We remark
    that this is the easiest to analyze from the security perspective, as the previously-mentioned
    performance metrics only have to consider a single adversary. Just a few works,
    i.e., [44], [51], considered multiple antennas, even if no collusion between them
    is considered, thus reducing the adversary model to the same of multi single-antenna
    adversaries. Adversarial Antenna Type. All the analyzed contributions consider
    adversaries equipped with omnidirectional antennas, i.e., antennas capturing the
    information independently from the source location and (partially) radio environment.
    While such a model could appear the strongest, it does not consider a realistic
    SATCOM scenario, where obstacles at the ground could alter the profile of the
    received signal, as well as the previously-mentioned performance metrics. 3.2.
    Anti-spoofing schemes Without loss of generality, spoofing refers to disguising
    a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source [18].
    Like any other wireless communication technology, SATCOMs are in principle vulnerable
    to spoofing attacks. The issue is even more cogent because of the presence of
    legacy deployments, as previously described in Section 3.1. Today, several satellite
    systems transmit either unauthenticated messages, or authenticated at the application
    layer, via either symmetric key (implicit authentication) or public key solutions.
    A few examples include GNSS technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS),
    Beidou, Glonass, and Galileo, and weather satellites such as National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Meteor [59]. Given the considerable
    threat surface, the design of anti-spoofing techniques for SATCOM scenarios has
    been largely focused on GNSS technologies due to their widespread use and increasing
    importance in the modern connected society [60]. Today, thanks to the sensitive
    advances in the design of Software Defined Radios (SDRs), performing GNSS spoofing
    attacks is surprisingly easy. An attacker needs an SDR and an omnidirectional
    transmitting antenna; by downloading freely-available tools such as gps-sdr-sim
    [61], the attacker just needs to run a script to emulate a complete satellite
    constellation and move the target wherever in the world, also for a significant
    period of time [62]. Considering that GNSS satellites are also used for time synchronization
    in several IoT deployments, detecting spoofing attacks with lightweight and effective
    techniques is of paramount importance. Table 5 summarizes the most important contributions
    in the topic of GNSS anti-spoofing and cross-compares them across reference system
    features. GNSS Spoofing Detection Means. A large variety of means have been used
    to detect GNSS spoofing attacks. Approaches use either PHY-layer information [59],
    [64], [65], [66], [67], [70], [71], [73], [74], [75], [76], [79], [80], [82],
    [83], [84], [85], [88], [90], or additional communication technologies [31], [62],
    [63], [68], [69], [72], or techniques based on Machine Learning (ML) over heterogeneous
    data [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [89], [90]. All these techniques share the
    basic consideration that the bitstrings in GNSS signals cannot be modified to
    be more secure before being transmitted. Indeed, such modifications would require
    temporarily stopping the operation of the GNSS satellite, causing significant
    and unmanageable costs and effort. Table 5. Comparison of GPS/GNSS Spoofing Detection

    Receiving Antennas. Simplest GNSS spoofing attacks assume that the adversary transmits
    a fake GNSS signal using only a single antenna. Signal cross-correlation detection
    methods identify such attacks by discriminating the injected signal from the expected
    one, as it is transmitted using different devices than the ones the target satellite
    is equipped with. Comparing the correlation of the received signals using more
    than one antenna at the receiver side will result in a significant difference
    in signal characteristics, such as the carrier phase and amplitude. This is just
    an example of a technique employing multiple receiving antennas to detect GNSS
    spoofing, and other examples include the contributions by the authors in [59],
    [65], [67], [68], [70], [71], [76]. Although being relatively cheap to deploy,
    such solutions usually require the deployment of multiple antennas and their connection
    to a single system, i.e., the hardware modification of the receiving device. Often,
    such operations might be too expensive or impractical to be applied due to application-specific
    limitations. Usage of PHY-layer information. GNSS messages transmitted by satellites
    go through different phases of signal processing before being converted into a
    digital form at the receiver side. The anomalies in the characteristics of signals
    during any of these processing phases could be used to detect counterfeit GNSS
    signals [91]. Anomalies can be found in signals features such as received power,
    Carrier-to-Noise Ratio (CNR), quality, correlation, Automatic Gain Control (AGC),
    clock bias, and angle of arrival, to name a few. Such features are used in many
    approaches, e.g., [64], [65], [66], [74], to detect GNSS spoofing attacks. On
    the one hand, such techniques could be compelling and reliable. On the other hand,
    they require the receiving devices to access such information, which is not always
    possible. Indeed, many modern chipsets do not provide PHY-layer information to
    the devices they are connected to or integrated into, preventing the application
    of such approaches. Usage of Ad-Hoc Network Infrastructures. Other contributions
    leverage additional network infrastructures, set up ad-hoc for GNSS spoofing detection.
    This is the case of approaches using dedicated sensors deployments [59], [67],
    [68], [69], [74], [75], [87]. Other approaches, such as [31], [62], use opportunistic
    signals gathered by other communication infrastructures, such as the cellular
    network and the IRIDIUM constellation. While the first set of approaches require
    a dedicated setup, that is not always possible, the security of the second class
    of approaches mostly depends on the adversary model and on its capability to spoof
    also the additional wireless signals. Usage of Dedicated Hardware. Many solutions
    have been proposed in the last years, recurring to dedicated hardware to detect
    GNSS spoofing attacks. Such approaches leverage either specific information available
    from the radio channel [64], [65], [66], [67], [70], [71], [73], [74], [75], [76],
    [80], [82], [83], [84], [88], or specific type of arrays of antennas, or the use
    of dedicated sensors providing inertial measurements [86]. Similarly to previous
    approaches using multiple antennas, such techniques might be very efficient. However,
    they require the adoption of compatible hardware, which sometimes does not represent
    a viable solution. 3.3. Anti-jamming strategies In this section, we discuss the
    most important contributions dealing with anti-jamming methods in SATCOM scenarios.
    Without loss of generality, jamming is defined as the injection of intentional
    interference into the wireless channel in a way to disrupt the operations of a
    legitimate communication channel [92]. Several classes of jammers have been proposed
    in the scientific literature throughout the last years [93]. With reference to
    the portion of time where they are active, jammers can be constant, alternate,
    proactive (if they choose a channel in advance, and jam it) [94], or reactive
    (if they jam a specific channel only when RF activity is detected on that channel).
    Considering the number of frequencies jammed at the same time, jammers can be
    spot (a single jammed frequency) [95], sweep (multiple frequencies, at different
    times) [96], or barrage (multiple frequencies at the same time) [97]. Finally,
    based on the type of signal injected to cause interference, we can have noise-jammers
    (if noise of a different type, e.g., Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is injected
    on the channel), or deceptive-jammers (if they inject a signal similar to the
    legitimate ones). The effectiveness of a jammer strictly depends on the communication
    parameters [98] set by both the transmitter and the receiver [99]. Overall, to
    maximize the performance of the jammer, the adversary should carefully analyze
    the radio link and then design and deploy the appropriate type of jammer. Jamming
    is particularly relevant in the context of SATCOM links, and several contributions
    highlight the inefficacy of currently-deployed communication schemes, e.g., Code
    Division Multiple Access (CDMA), when powerful jammers target the communication
    links [100]. Table 6 reviews the most important contributions providing anti-jamming
    techniques in the SATCOM context and cross-compares them across reference features.
    In the following, we summarize the most important considerations emerging from
    our analysis. Table 6. Comparison of anti-jamming techniques and related system

    Experiments Link. Similarly to previous physical-layer solutions, also anti-jamming
    strategies mostly considered the Satellite-to-Ground communication link, focusing
    on increasing the availability of satellite services on the ground. A few works,
    such as [107], [111], and [119], considered also the Ground-to-Satellite link,
    while only one work, i.e, [119], discussed anti-jamming solutions for the Ground-to-Ground
    link. The Satellite-to-Satellite link is never considered because of the actual
    hardness of the jamming at high distances, though further studies on this segment
    would be valuable. Technology. While some works focused on a generic SATCOM technology,
    most were more specific, and analyzed the jamming issue in GNSS [104], [106],
    [108], [110], [116], [117], [121] and Military SATCOM constellations. Others were
    even more focused, proposing anti-jamming schemes tailored to the specific GNSS
    technology, such as the Chinese Beidou [115], the Russian Glonass [105], and the
    US GPS [101], [102], [103], [112], [120]. Number of Jammers. Most of the analyzed
    works considered single jamming devices that are usually easier to detect and
    isolate from a SATCOM link due to its vast coverage range. Other recent contributions,
    such [107], [109], [111], [113], [114], [119] introduced particular techniques
    to defend the commercial and civilian SATCOMs when one or more jammers are deployed
    in the scenario, thus being more effective in real deployments. Indeed, the deployment
    of multiple jammers is an essential problem in tactical and military scenarios,
    where the adversary is so powerful to make the adoption of the current solutions
    challenging or impractical. Type of Jammer. Characterizing and profiling the type
    of jamming affecting the communication link is the first step towards the deployment
    of an effective anti-jamming solution. Based on such considerations, the authors
    in [109], [112], [116], [117], [119], [121] proposed anti-jamming algorithms able
    to characterize the jamming signals emitted from multiple jammers and still guarantee
    the communication quality. In this context, it is worth mentioning the work by
    the authors in [118], mitigating jamming in SATCOM by proposing a cost-effective
    solution able to thwart jamming through an efficient jamming-dependent adaptive
    frequency hopping pattern. Anti-Jamming Technique. Many scientific contributions
    used physical layer parameters to estimate and guarantee the availability of downlink
    and uplink SATCOMs under jamming. For instance, to face malicious jamming attacks,
    the contributions in [101], [102], [103], [105], [112], [120] recommended the
    use of well-known techniques such as fast orthogonal search, signals cross-correlation,
    turbo codes, and distance theoretical models for the GPS signals. Alternatively,
    the authors in [105] demonstrate that the single-frequency multi-constellation
    receivers offer better jamming resilience than multi-frequency (L1 + L2) GPS receivers
    and that the GLONASS constellation demonstrated a better resilience than GPS.
    Indeed, they propose a multi-constellation solution that adopts GPS and GLONASS
    receivers for maritime applications. No need of Dedicated Hardware. It is worth
    noticing that contributions such as [103], [104], [111], [113], [118], [119],
    [120] do not require any dedicated hardware to deploy the provided solution in
    a real environment. Such solutions can be implemented via simple software updates—a
    cheap and convenient feature. Conversely, the remaining solutions require to intervene
    on the hardware, and their deployment depends on the opportunity, cost, and convenience
    of such a modification. Assessment Methodology. Finally, we notice that most of
    the analyzed approaches were evaluated using simulations. Although simulations
    provide useful details into the performance of the disclosed approaches, they
    often miss some elements of the actual deployment, hard to be modeled and controlled
    into a computer-based environment. Taking into account such considerations, approaches
    such as [102], [105], [108], [110], [120], [121] worked on real deployments, showing
    the effectiveness of their solutions through via practical experiments or real-world
    data. 3.4. Lessons learned In the following, we summarize the main lessons learned
    from the investigation and cross-comparison of the approaches working on improving
    the security of SATCOM deployments via physical-layer solutions. No Satellites
    Hardware Update. All the analyzed approaches do not propose the modification of
    the transmitted signals or the transmitting chain. Indeed, modifying a satellite
    is assumed to be too expensive to be performed, both from the financial and the
    operational perspective. Thus, assuming that the authenticity/availability received
    signal cannot be fully guaranteed, the studied proposals come up with solutions
    able to minimize the impact of different security attacks. Significant Receivers
    Updates. Consequently to the previous point, the proposed security techniques
    have a large impact on the receivers, requiring either hardware or software modification
    that impacts their operations. When uninterrupted operations should be guaranteed,
    deploying a new solution for either confidentiality, anti-spoofing, or anti-jamming
    working at the PHY-layer might find challenges, even if potentially guaranteeing
    high efficiency at low energy and processing costs. Channel State Information
    (CSI) Availability. Looking at information-theoretic schemes for SATCOM confidentiality,
    being aware of the CSI experienced by the passive eavesdropper(s) is critical
    when calibrating the effectiveness of a security solution. Indeed, if the CSI
    experienced by the eavesdropper when communicating with the network is available
    to the transmitter: (i) the secrecy capacity can be maximized; and, (ii) the SNR
    of the adversary is minimized. Data secrecy and secrecy capacity are handled as
    constraints of the overall optimization problem, where the overall aim is to ensure
    that the secrecy rate of the main communication link does not degrade below a
    minimum threshold or, equivalently, the secrecy outage probability does not exceed
    a specified upper bound. Detection vs. Prevention. Approaches working on anti-jamming
    and anti-spoofing mainly focus on detecting the attack once it has been launched.
    This is a crucial difference from approaches providing confidentiality using information-theoretic
    schemes that prevent the attacker from gaining information. Such difference is
    due to the different adversarial models (active in the first two mentioned cases,
    passive in the second one), that lead to different countermeasures. Combining
    approaches for multiple security objectives, e.g., anti-jamming and confidentiality,
    might require new feasibility studies and solutions. 3.5. Future directions We
    can identify a few promising future research directions in the area of physical
    layer security for SATCOM as a result of the investigation carried out in this
    section. Directional Adversarial Antenna. Almost all the contributions in the
    three analyzed sub-areas assumed adversaries equipped with omnidirectional antennas.
    Omnidirectional antennas radiate equal radio power in all directions; thus, they
    can often be assumed as the worst-case for the integrity of the satellite communications.
    However, there are specific situations where an adversary equipped with directional
    antennas can be more disruptive, e.g., in cases where the location of the target
    communication link is well-known. Directional and semi-directional antennas focus
    the radiated power in narrow beams, particularly in one direction only [122].
    From the security perspective, this is an additional powerful feature for an adversary,
    as it can help to reduce the interference caused by other radio activities, improving
    the adversary’s expected performance. This is an interesting scenario to be investigated
    for satellite links’ security, which has still not been fully explored by Industry
    and Academia. Security of the Satellite to Satellite Communication Links. Despite
    being effective, none of the above-described security solutions provided a security
    evaluation of the satellite to satellite communication links. This is because
    of the hardness of both obtaining information about the communication protocols
    used by such links (often protected by intellectual property rights) and by the
    nature of such links, envisioned as a kind of core network, far from users’ services.
    However, due to the wireless nature of such communications, attacks on these links
    are both possible and potentially dreadful, as they can disrupt the availability
    of a SATCOM by just affecting the operation of a single link. For instance, Viasat
    affirms that because LEO satellites are not in constant communication with the
    ground, a satellite to satellite link can ease the data-sharing mechanism between
    adjacent satellites [123]. A malicious user could interrupt these types of communications
    by just jamming such a link. Also, it is unclear if and how physical-layer security
    techniques can be applied effectively for these links. Thus, investigating the
    security of Satellite-to-Satellite links is an appealing future research direction.
    Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS). Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces are one
    of the most attracting topic in the physical-layer security research community,
    and they are gaining momentum  [124]. Thanks to the deployment of a massive number
    of antenna elements on the satellites, it is possible, in principle, to assist
    the non-terrestrial network communications by focusing the electromagnetic energy
    in the intended direction, with consequent benefits in terms of security—receivers
    out of the intended direction are implicitly excluded from receiving signals [125].
    A few recent works investigated the theoretical performance of secure communications
    associated with intelligent reflecting surfaces and the deployment of intelligent
    reflecting surfaces on UAVs and satellites, e.g., [126], [127], [128], just to
    name a few. Therefore, in line with the current trend, we expect a surge of scientific
    contributions in the upcoming period focusing on the application of IRS for SATCOM
    scenarios. On the one hand, such works will explore the validity of previous results
    on PHY-layer security for terrestrial links when deployed to satellite links.
    On the other hand, when IRSs are deployed, new security threats might arise, specific
    to the new technology. Just to provide an example in this direction, an adversary
    could use a drone flying at significant altitude to boost its SNR when receiving
    a signal from an IRS deployed on a satellite, or to move within an area with a
    better coverage without being noticed by terrestrial receivers. GNSS Spoofing
    Detection via Artificial Intelligence. In line with a worldwide scientific trend,
    many recent proposals applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to solving
    GNSS issues, including the detection of spoofing attacks [129]. Specifically,
    AI-based solutions can be used to detect anomalies in the received signals, so
    as to identify the presence of the attacker. For instance, the recent proposal
    by the authors in [130] use cross-correlation of the received signals to detect
    anomalous messages, indicating the presence of an attacker. Still, there are several
    challenges that are to be solved, including the discrimination of legitimate and
    malicious interference, mobility of the attacker, and use of publicly-available
    data of satellites (e.g., ephemeris) to imitate satellites movement. In this context,
    we also notice that several real-world dataset are available and released as open-source,
    such as [131], [132]. Thus, we the are seems ripe to experience a renewed interest,
    likely ignited by researchers and industry with expertise in the application of
    AI algorithms to different domains. Friendly Jamming. Friendly jamming techniques
    disrupt all the communications in a given area by allowing, at the same time,
    legitimate parties to communicate [58]. Friendly jamming can be achieved in several
    different ways, e.g., through pre-shared knowledge of jamming time and frequency
    patterns, or via specific positioning of the legitimate communicating devices,
    in a way that the SNR exceeds the minimum required values only in specific locations,
    where the legitimate receiving nodes are deployed. Overall, deploying friendly
    jamming in SATCOM scenarios may be relevant and useful, e.g., to minimize eavesdropping
    capabilities of the adversary in military scenarios, while still allowing legitimate
    devices to communicate in a cheap way. We notice that none of the security techniques
    discussed in the previous subsections investigated the feasibility of friendly
    jamming in the context of SATCOM. Note that achieving friendly jamming is not
    as easy as jamming a communication link. Indeed, friendly jamming requires controlling
    with extreme precision the timing, the frequency, and the context to be jammed,
    in a way to know precisely when and how to transmit. In this context, analytical
    and experimental results about the feasibility and the degrees of freedom of friendly
    jamming in SATCOM are still needed. Spoofing of non-GNSS constellations, e.g.,
    NOAA. At the time of this writing, the majority of contributions dealing with
    spoofing and anti-spoofing techniques in the SATCOM context focused on GNSS constellations,
    due to their higher impact and involvement in everyday life. However, non-GNSS
    constellations such as NOAA and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) are also widely
    used, e.g., by ships or other devices in remote locations. At the same time, their
    (low) security is comparable to the one offered by GNSS satellites. Solutions
    to detect and overcome spoofing of the signals emitted by such satellites are
    still to be investigated and might represent an appealing research opportunity.
    Powerful Inter-Communications Adversaries. Most of the approaches using signals
    from additional communication infrastructures to detect and overcome GNSS spoofing
    and jamming assumed that the adversary only focused on a single communication
    link. However, a powerful adversary able to inject noise or spoofing signal of
    SATCOM and non-SATCOM technologies, eventually using a high powerful antenna,
    could be disruptive and nullify the effectiveness of such countermeasures. For
    instance, the adversary could fine-tune its attack strategy, so as to deteriorate
    the performance of such detection strategies. Such powerful adversaries are not
    too unrealistic to be thought, and thus, are worth investigating. 4. Cryptography
    techniques for SATCOM Many contributions have proposed to apply cryptography techniques
    to secure SATCOM links. Such works mainly focus on the authenticity and confidentiality
    of SS and SG communications, and adapt security primitives originated from other
    domains to work efficiently with SATCOM systems. We can notice that part of the
    scientific contributions in this area adapt the implementation and network architecture
    of well-known cryptographic solutions to the SATCOM scenario, while the other
    part study the effectiveness and consequences of the introduction of novel paradigms,
    such as quantum computing, with an eye on the requirements of SS and SG communication
    links. In this section, we review and classify contributions dealing with the
    application of cryptography schemes in SATCOM, classifying them based on the provided
    security service. Section 4.1 focuses on techniques for peer authentication, Section
    4.2 discusses key agreement schemes, while Section 4.3 introduces approaches for
    key distribution based on quantum channels. The main lessons learnt from our study
    are reported in Section 4.4, while Section 4.5 outlines promising research directions
    in this domain. 4.1. Authentication SATCOM systems involving users, mobile devices,
    and ground stations (or network control centers) require establishing trust among
    the cited entities. However, due to the presence of the wireless medium, SATCOMs
    are more prone to impersonation attacks. To mitigate this problem, various authentication
    protocols have been proposed in the literature. Table 7 provides a comprehensive
    classification of the most important scientific contributions in the field, cross-comparing
    them across the selected communication architecture, the proposed cryptographic
    technique, the security properties, the security analysis, and the assessment
    methodology. Link. Most of the analyzed works considered the User to Ground Station/Network
    Control Center through Satellite link depicted in Fig. 2, applying standard cryptography
    techniques to secure the channel. Many schemes, i.e., [141], [142], [143], [144],
    [147], [148], considered the protection of the GPS/GNSS communication link, while
    other links are rarely taken into account. Table 7. Comparison of Different Authentication

    Anonymity Formal Experiments Key Sharing Technique. Many different key sharing
    techniques are used for equipping the entities with the crypto material necessary
    to run authentication protocols. The authors in [133], [136], [149] proposed a
    public key cryptographic scheme based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to
    provide peer entity authentication. Conversely, other proposals assume a pre-shared
    key, statically known by one or more users. Some other approaches, i.e., [141],
    [142], [143], [144], [147], [147], [148], adopt the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant
    Authentication (TESLA) protocol conceived by Perrig et al. in [150] to provide
    delayed source authentication for broadcast communications in very resource-limited
    environments, by leveraging only symmetric cryptographic primitives and hash chains.
    Focusing on schemes adopting asymmetric cryptography solutions, the adoption of
    ECC rather than the traditional RSA provides benefits in terms of smaller public
    and private keys for the same security level, faster key generation and signature
    operations, as well as low overhead on CPU and memory usage. Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
    (RSA) schemes are usually very simple to implement, widely deployed in the industry,
    and specific public key operations such as the signature verification are usually
    faster than the ones on ECC, considering the same size of the elements. However,
    the setup of a public-key infrastructure to manage, distribute, and revoke public
    key certificates is costly and time-consuming. Thus, when a public key infrastructure
    is not desirable or affordable, and the efficiency of the crypto operations is
    at premium, symmetric cryptography solutions for digests generation are adopted,
    such as the TESLA protocol [150]. Symmetric solutions allow to execute very fast
    encryption and decryption operations, as well as to generate authentication digests
    that can be produced and verified very quickly. However, differently from public-key
    solutions, solutions based on symmetric cryptography requires the communicating
    parties to share a secret, to be kept private at least for a given amount of time
    (e.g., in case of TESLA). If a shared key is compromised, it should be discarded
    and replaced. However, replacing and updating a key can be a time-consuming activity,
    especially in a context where the communicating entities are orbiting several
    kilometers above the Earth surface. Security Properties. The main security property
    provided by the proposed schemes is mutual authentication, i.e., entities authenticate
    each other before establishing mutual communication. Equal importance is given
    to message authentication, which ensures that the message was actually sent by
    the entity that claimed to have done so. Contributions such as [133], [134], [135],
    [136], [137], [140], [146], [149] guarantee additional properties, such as anonymity
    and user privacy, adopting techniques that hide the user identity during a communication.
    Security Analysis. The schemes proposed by the authors in [133], [139], [143],
    [149] are formally proved as secure with reference to certain formal specifications
    or properties. Some tools that help to prove these properties are ProVerif [151],
    CryptoVerif [152], AVISPA [153], and Tamarin [154], to name a few. Note that only
    the security of the cryptographic scheme can be verified through this mechanism,
    while its integration in the reference system architecture could widen the threat
    surface. Assessment Methodology. Similarly to the works dealing with physical-layer
    security, most of the analyzed schemes use simulation-based evaluation. Only few
    of them, i.e., [145], [147], [148], [149], used real data and deployed proof-of-concept.
    4.2. Key agreement Key agreement protocols (a.k.a. key establishment protocols)
    are used to allow two (or possibly more) entities that could not have anything
    in common to agree on a shared key to be used to secure further mutual communications
    [155]. Nowadays, key agreement protocols via public key cryptography or pre-shared
    keys are used in a range of different security protocols. Although several works
    proposed lightweight key establishment solutions integrating well-known cryptographic
    approaches in a variety of application domains, key establishment mechanisms in
    SATCOM have received only reduced attention. Table 8 provides a comprehensive
    classification of the scientific contributions dealing with key agreement in SATCOM
    scenarios, considering reference system requirements and features. Link. Most
    of the presented approaches focus on the key establishment in SG and SS links.
    It is also worth noting that most of the solutions require a software update that
    can be done via radio link or, in particular situations, by intervening offline
    on the satellite. Table 8. Comparison of Different Key Agreement Methods for SATCOM

    Formal and complexity analysis Cryptography Technique. Many different techniques
    are used to allow the entities to derive a shared secret. Overall, the same considerations
    introduced for the key sharing techniques in Section 4.1 are still valid for key
    agreement protocols adopted in SATCOM links. For completeness, we introduce the
    pro and cons also for the Identity Based Cryptography and the Chaotic Maps. In
    Identity Based Encryption (IBE) schemes, each communicating entity owns a unique
    identifier, adopted to compute the correspondent public key. With such an approach,
    no certificates are needed and no pre-enrollment is required. However, the architecture
    requires a key generation center, which might be vulnerable to key-escrow attacks,
    and therefore, exposed to a risk of information disclosure [164]. Unlike public-key
    cryptography systems, chaotic maps do not require modular arithmetic, being therefore
    very fast for both encryption and digital signature. Moreover, algorithms based
    on chaotic maps might not require that large private keys, being computationally
    efficient. On the downside of such a technique, chaotic maps can produce ciphertext
    that are bigger than the plain-text [165]. Target Security Service. Most of the
    presented schemes focus on the balanced protection of the Confidentiality, Integrity,
    and Availability of data (CIA) by providing, at the same time, identity verification.
    Adversary Model. The Canetti–Krawczyk (CK) and the extended Canetti–Krawczyk (eCK)
    security models [166], are widely used to verify and provide the aforementioned
    security properties for key agreement protocols. These models have been developed
    to build secure protocols that guarantee peer entity authentication and message
    authenticity during the key exchange procedure. Indeed, the main aim of these
    models is to provide a method so that the security protocols proposed in the literature
    can have a match between the implementation and the adoption in a real environment
    by taking into consideration also possible attacks of an active adversary [167].
    Assessment Methodology. In order to evaluate the performance of a key agreement
    protocol, authors can evaluate the offered security properties by using the formal
    analysis or discuss the solution. Further, they can estimate the efficiency via
    simulation tools, like [156], [158], [160], or by performing a complexity analysis
    such as [162], [163]. The only contributions providing performance on a real system,
    i.e., [156], [159], worked on the ground link due to the viability of the approach
    and its reduced costs. 4.3. Quantum key distribution Although the soundness of
    the adopted encryption techniques typically relies on traditional mathematics
    proofs, quantum architectures are coming out of laboratories to be used in many
    contexts, based on different assumptions. Overall, Quantum key distribution (QKD)
    allows two remote parties to securely negotiate a cryptographic key even in the
    presence of an eavesdropper. However, compared to traditional key distribution
    schemes, the security of such distribution mechanisms does not rely on cryptographic
    assumptions (i.e., difficulty of solving specific mathematical problems), but
    on the unique quantum mechanics properties of the adopted communication strategy
    at the physical-layer. Thus, even assuming a powerful adversary with unlimited
    computational capabilities and able to break cryptography assumptions, the robustness
    of the protocols still holds—basically, QKD protocols allow detecting the presence
    of an eavesdropper on the communication link [168]. Currently, several Quantum
    Key Distribution (QKD) solutions have been proposed in the literature, even if
    there is still a gap between the information theory and practical implementations.
    As depicted in Fig. 3, QKD systems work by using photons, i.e., particles which
    transmit light to transfer data [169]. Quantum technology allows two distant entities
    to agree on a common symmetric key even if they do not share any previous knowledge.
    The key is adopted with the respective encryption algorithm to transmit and receive
    encrypted messages over a standard communication channel, even if the One-Time-Pad
    (OTP) encryption scheme is the most used one. The benefit of this “unbreakable”
    encryption is that the data is carried via photons, which cannot be copied or
    eavesdropped without leaving evidence of such an attempt. Indeed, an adversary
    measuring the state of a photon would disturb the channel, hence compromising
    the key agreement procedure and providing a kind of tamper-detection evidence.
    In terms of security, quantum computing could make the current state of the art
    on security obsolete, jeopardizing the protection of data and communications.
    This aspect is leading to an acceleration of the adoption of countermeasures (e.g.
    post-quantum encryption algorithms), especially to protect data and critical infrastructures
    such as SATCOMs [170], [171]. Table 9 provides an overview of the most important
    QKD techniques proposed in the context of SATCOM, and cross-compares them across
    reference system features and requirements. Link. Most of the analyzed contributions
    propose approaches leveraging a quantum technology for SG and SS communication
    links. Note that such communication links might be challenging to manage when
    considering interference, natural phenomena such as sunlight, and the long distances
    among the entities. Download : Download high-res image (154KB) Download : Download

    BB84 Securing Key Exchange Sat to Ground Experiments Quantum Protocols. QKD protocols
    are today already adopted to protect communications through optical communication
    channels. QKD systems are already operational in different contexts, also allowing
    long-distance connections in Point to Point (P2P) communications. Several works
    in the literature such as [172], [173], [175], [183] adopt the well known BB84
    quantum key distribution scheme, developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard
    in 1984. BB84 was originally described using photon polarization states where
    no quantum entanglement was required. Conversely, the authors in [174], and [184]
    propose schemes based on quantum entanglement, i.e., a particular phenomenon where
    particles remain intimately connected, even if separated by long distances [188].
    When it comes to QKD, while the high-level protocols are well understood and are
    taught in university courses, and commercial products are available on the market
    [189], the underlying phenomena that make them possible are rooted on the evolving
    frontiers of physics [190]. As such, a detailed discussion of the cited protocols
    is beyond the scope set for this survey. However, interested readers can resort
    to recent authoritative surveys on QKD available in the literature, such as [191],
    [192], [193], to cite a few. Main Contribution. A large variety of contributions
    used to distribute the cryptographic key via QKD. Approaches use either free space
    QKD [172], [180], or perform feasibility and efficiency analysis with reference
    to some specific schemes [174], [175], [177], [179], [183], [186]. All these techniques
    share the basic consideration that the quantum technology cannot be compromised
    due its intrinsic properties. Assessment Methodology. Differently from approaches
    based on classical cryptography, most of the contributions focusing on QKD carry
    out also an experimental assessment, allowing the authors to demonstrate the feasibility
    of satellite-based quantum communications by experimentally analyzing their efficiency,
    error tolerance, and security properties. 4.4. Lessons learned In the following,
    we summarize the most important lessons learned from the analysis of cryptography
    approaches for SATCOM reported in the previous subsections. Software Modifications.
    Differently from approaches based on PHY-layer security, cryptography solutions
    always require the modification of the software running on the receivers and on
    the satellites. Some approaches actually provided the required modifications,
    while others assume that the advantages of such modifications overcome the cost
    and effort required to install them. Impact of Software Updates in SATCOM. Cryptography-based
    solutions always require a dedicated software update on the satellite, and this
    could also affect the operational status of the SATCOM communication link. Thus,
    the cost of their integration should be carefully taken into account, and they
    should be applied only when other solutions (e.g., PLS-based ones) do not guarantee
    sufficient security. Quantum Key Agreement for SATCOM. Due to its promising level
    of security, quantum computing strategies show appealing advantages for SATCOM
    links, and researchers have already started to evaluate its feasibility due to
    the large involved distances [188]. We expect to see many contributions to come
    on this topic in the following years. 4.5. Future directions Analysis of Security
    Requirements. Most of the works considered in the first two subsections of this
    section only apply well-known cryptography schemes in SATCOM, plugging them in
    without a strong motivation or a detailed description of the underlying security
    requirements. Due to the significant impact that cryptography has on the operation
    and performance of SATCOM deployments, researchers and industry should come up
    with a dedicated security analysis of SATCOM links, explaining precisely what
    the threats are and why cryptography solutions are advantageous compared to Physical-layer
    ones in solving such issues. To the best of our knowledge, such a study is still
    not available in the literature. Communication Channel Availability. In the presence
    of an eavesdropper, a quantum-based communication channel is disrupted, and the
    parties cannot continue to communicate. In principle, this capability could help
    to detect Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks and identify potential eavesdroppers
    quickly. However, it also paves the way for easy Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,
    even harder to detect in the context of SATCOM due to the large reception range
    and coverage area of the communication. In this context, backup solutions for
    guaranteeing the availability of the service are needed, as well as tools to discriminate
    if the channel if compromised because of an eavesdropper, or because of the channel
    noise. Quantum Channel Security Assessment Tools. At the time of this writing,
    no works are available that evaluate the physical-layer security of QKD signal
    generation tools. In principle, passive side-channel attacks can be conducted
    to extract meaningful information from a QKD channel, without affecting and compromising
    the robustness provided by QKD strategies. It is essential to explore this research
    area to provide methods and tools to mitigate this open issue [194]. 5. Emerging
    research challenges The previous sections delved into the most active research
    branches related to the SATCOM domain and provided some appealing future research
    directions in those specific contexts. However, in addition to the identified
    research areas, our investigation highlighted further security-related SATCOM-based
    application domains that are receiving increasing attention from the scientific
    and business community. In the following, we discuss some of them, showing their
    key challenges and potential to attract additional interest in the years to come.
    Cognitive Satellite Terrestrial Networks. Cognitive radio in the context of wireless
    communication systems is a research area that attracted lots of interest in the
    few last years. In a nutshell, cognitive radio systems allow the coexistence of
    primary users (using devices that own the license to use a specific frequency
    band) and secondary users (allowed to share resources with the primary network,
    but not in possession of the license) on the same network and spectrum, sharing
    the same radio resources. A few works applied the concept of cognitive radio networks
    in the context of SATCOM. For instance, the authors in [36], [43], [51], [52]
    propose to secure the communication in cognitive satellite–terrestrial networks.
    They assume a scenario where the primary network is constituted by GEO, MEO, or
    LEO satellites, sending confidential messages to the fixed-satellite operator
    in the presence of eavesdroppers (secondary users) attempting to capture the satellite
    information signal. In their own (secondary) network, the network operator communicates
    with the user terminals. Still, doubts are there on the actual applicability of
    cognitive radio techniques in the context of satellite–terrestrial networks. This
    is mainly because of the extremely wide coverage of satellites, where the CR techniques
    might not work well. In line with a large amount of work done in the context of
    cognitive radio for terrestrial networks [195], we expect increased interest in
    this domain in the next years. Drone-To-Satellite. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
    a.k.a. drones, have gained increased momentum in the last years, in both academia
    and Industry [196]. In the context of SATCOM, one of the most critical challenges
    consists of allowing secure communication between small/commercial UAVs and satellites.
    For instance, the authors in [197] proposed a physical layer security framework
    in space–air–ground (SAGIN) downlink multi-beam satellite-enabled vehicle communications,
    where the UAV is adopted as cooperative node, interacting with the legitimate
    user and acting as a source of artificial noise to mitigate eavesdropping. In
    the same network setup, the authors in [198] investigated the IoT computing offloading
    problem by proposing a reinforcement learning approach to allocate the resources
    of the UAV edge server efficiently. In the same domain, the authors in [199] proposed
    a software defined architecture supporting different vehicles in an efficient
    manner. In line with existing works such as [200], we forecast numerous appealing
    applications involving drones and satellites. Using satellites links, users can:
    (i) drive drones remotely; (ii) stream video from the drone’s camera; (iii) use
    the drone to collect information from remote satellites; and, (iv) use the drone
    for optical remote sensing applications. Due to the well-known security, safety,
    and privacy issues posed by drones usage, and due to the central role of drones
    in the development of the upcoming 6G communication systems [201], we expect significant
    research activity in this domain in the years to come. AI in SATCOM. The usage
    of AI-based techniques is gaining increasing importance in almost any application
    domain, cybersecurity included. In the context of SATCOM, AI techniques could
    be used for many purposes, e.g., to identify physical-layer characteristics of
    the signals emitted by the satellites, to discriminate between authentic and injected
    signals, and for intrusion detection, to name a few . In this context, the authors
    in [202] experimentally show that using a dedicated Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) it is possible to fingerprint the raw IQ samples received from LEO Satellites
    (Iridium) and authenticate the emitting transceiver on board of the satellite,
    despite the large distances. We expect increasing attention towards this research
    domain, targeting additional satellites constellations (GNSS ones included) or
    other applications of AI. Software-defined satellites. The integration of Software
    Defined Networking (SDN) into SATCOM could improve the connectivity coverage and
    performance for using broadband communications by allowing the operators to reconfigure
    the satellites as needed [203], [204], [205]. However, SDN also come with their
    security issues, that are further specialized in SATCOM use-cases [206]. Additional
    research is needed in this context. Network Slicing for the Internet of Space
    Things. The continuous development of nano-satellites is accelerating the deployment
    of low-cost satellite networks [207]. Emerging paradigms, such as the Internet
    of Space Things (IoST), require a network slicing framework to provide the support
    for the plethora of space-application scenarios. A network slice is a part of
    the network that is independent and logically separated from the rest. A specific
    slice has specific security policies, used to protect the slice while meeting
    specific system requirements. However, there are neither common strategies nor
    protocols suitable to design a network slice in the context of SATCOM. Despite
    initial studies in this context are available [208], [209], major work is still
    to be done, and we expect increasing attention towards this topic. Green Satellites.
    The design of environmentally-friendly satellites can help to reduce the environmental
    impact of a satellite, its production cost, and maintenance compared to traditional
    ones. However, reducing the cost and the impact of the satellite inevitably could
    affect the provided security services. This emerging research area, also suggested
    from the ESA [210], leads to a potential redesign of the existing procedures and
    technologies, also including the security domain. Definitively, a novel and interesting
    research topic. Satellites Signals for Opportunistic Navigation. Specific satellites
    signals can be used to pinpoint a specific location on Earth, similar to the GPS.
    A group of researchers developed a working solution based on the cited logic,
    leveraging signals broadcasted by Starlink internet service satellites [211].
    The usage of additional satellite constellations could provide reliability and
    spoofing detection mechanisms for devices on Earth, and more research into the
    robustness of such solutions is needed. Cybersecurity for Commercial Satellite
    Operations. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking
    comments on the draft specification NISTIR 8270, which describes the security
    procedures and the concepts for commercial space operations. The draft considers
    the management aspects, risk management operations, and defines the requirements
    that “might coexist within space vehicle systems”. The NIST is requiring feedback
    on the overall approach, the example use case, and the identified controls for
    the proposed use case [212]. We expect that several research contributions could
    come out due to the study and application of this (yet to come) recommendation
    to real use-cases. Standardization of Security for Non-Terrestrial Networks. In
    the standardization community, and in particular, within the Third Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) committee, satellite communications are specifically
    considered in the design of the Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), anticipating
    the upcoming tight integration between terrestrial, aerial and satellite networks
    [213]. Specifically, the standardization of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) has
    been launched by 3GPP in the 3GPP Release 16 [214]. At the same time, new security
    aspects have been recently defined by the 3GPP in the Release 17 [215], and new
    amendments are planned in the upcoming Release 18 [216]. In this context, none
    specifications edited by the 3GPP specifically took into account network security
    issues for NTNs. As a result, the current approach recommended by the 3GPP consists
    of a straightforward integration of the 5G security architecture and protocols
    into NTNs. Such an integration, however, comes with several challenges, in terms
    of communication overhead, software updates, and unreliability of the wireless
    links. Specifically, security issues in the operation of NTNs have been investigated
    by the Working Group on Satellite 5G, established within the IEEE Future Networks
    Initiative [217]. In one of the latest deliverables of the WG, i.e., [218], they
    drew a roadmap of the priorities to be addressed in this regard, highlighting
    that new security mechanisms might be needed for specific deployments, and that
    the emphasis should be put on the isolation of the end-users from the shared NTN
    network. The WG realized several security-related activities, i.e.,: (i) analyzed
    the state of the art about security for NTNs; (ii) provided a threat analysis
    for the NTN scenario; (iii) identified specific complications derived from using
    of 5G security solutions on 5G-NTN networks, by experimentally verifying them
    on prototyping platforms; and, finally, (iv) identified additional security concerns,
    mainly related to the integration of emerging technologies such as network slicing,
    edge computing, and multicasting over satellite networks (see Section 2.6.2 of
    [217]. The temporary recommendation proposed by the WP was to adopt the IPSec
    protocol suite to secure the communication link, but they also recommended further
    study into the issues at the 3GPP standardization level. However, the 3GPP refused
    to investigate further into the issue, at the time of this writing, still recommending
    a straightforward integration of 5G security into the NTN domain [218]. Nonetheless,
    due to the forecasted performance issues arising from such the integration of
    5G-security into NTNs, we expect significant contributions by the research community
    in the years to come, potentially triggering dedicated and ad-hoc initiatives
    by the 3GPP. Security and Privacy for 6G. 6G networks will accommodate satellites,
    UAVs, and undersea communications [219]. It is crucial that any security proposal
    framed in this context protect the communications while guaranteeing reliability,
    low latency, and secure and efficient transmission services. Physical-layer security
    is the first candidate defense for these new emerging technologies, but emerging
    cryptography-based solutions could also play a role if their integration is carefully
    systematized and orchestrated with the existing services. In the context of 6G
    initiatives, the 3GPP claimed that for the next few years (2030s) additional research
    is needed into this application area. Adapting and integrating the security services
    on satellites with mobile terrestrial/sea systems while meeting the requirements
    of 6G communication services will indeed represent a complex and difficult challenge
    [220]. For the cited scenario, we expect the adoption of real-time security communication
    protocols and emerging architectural solutions, such as Zero Trust [221]. 6. Conclusion
    In this contribution, we have provided a survey of the most significant link-layer
    security issues, threats, and mitigation techniques adopted in the context of
    Satellite-based Communications systems. First, we presented general background
    on the SATCOM architecture, the most important constellations, and network parameters.
    Then, we divided the relevant literature on the topic into two major research
    areas, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography, and we further identified
    dedicated topics in each macro-area, focusing on specific threats. For the physical-layer
    area, we discussed and cross-compared solutions based on the usage of information-theoretic
    security schemes, anti-jamming strategies, and anti-spoofing schemes. For the
    cryptography area, we specifically discussed approaches for authentication, key
    agreement, and key distribution based on the emerging quantum computing paradigm.
    We also identified lessons learned and specific future directions for each of
    the cited threats and research areas. Finally, we presented a few appealing emerging
    challenges in the SATCOM security domain, pointing out the main research challenges
    to be solved and the areas where new contributions from the scientific community
    might have major impact. Overall, we believe that the exposed research challenges
    highlight that the design and testing of cybersecurity strategies for SATCOMs
    is still an active research domain. In particular, our contribution calls for
    collaboration between Industry and Academia to unlock new business opportunities
    and services, while enjoying the needed level of security for communications,
    applications, and infrastructures. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    Italy SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) [15] and the billions
    of sensors that will be deployed in the next decade [5], as well as novel associated
    technological breakthroughs, have been enabling the emergence of a new breed of
    smart applications and services for the benefic or our society in different domains
    or verticals, such as smart farming, smart cities, smart healthcare and smart
    industries. Building interoperable IoT services and applications requires a set
    of middleware components and system development, deployment and operation tools
    and platforms, In order to avoid developing extremely focused and vertical IoT
    applications not able to interact with other applications, common and generic
    middleware services used by different application domains become necessary. The
    widespread availability of IoT-based applications requires adequate platforms
    for both development and operation phases. The former for releasing developers
    from the need of mastering different technologies outside their core business
    and that do not add value to the process [7]. The latter for freeing organizations
    from the need of deploying and testing customized platforms for supporting the
    operation of IoT-based applications. There are some IoT platforms available today,
    both open source and proprietary [4]. There is a tradeoff in the deployment of
    such platforms, which traditionally are hosted in cloud datacenters, but are slowly
    considered to be partially moved to edge infrastructure closer to the users, which
    is known as fog computing [2]. Although many IoT platforms exist today, the arena
    is not clear regarding the suitability of them for the different deployment scenarios
    for different smart applications. IoT tools and platforms must provide an end-to-end
    treatment for the data path, since data is generated by sensors, transmitted to
    the storage place, processed by smart algorithms, decisions are made, which fire
    actions that are finally forwarded to actuators as commands aimed at changing
    some configuration. Also, scalability is a major concern for IoT platforms. It
    has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect system
    scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in an environment
    composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting data [16].
    Currently, there is no scalable de facto open IoT platform but the European Commission
    is pushing FIWARE to fill this gap. The SWAMP project develops and assesses an
    IoT-based smart water management platform for precision irrigation in agriculture
    with a hands-on approach that focuses on pilots in Italy, Spain and Brazil [9].
    The same underlying platform can be customized to different pilots considering
    different countries, climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP platform may be implemented
    in a range of deployment configurations involving both cloud and fog environments.
    In this paper, we analyze the performance of FIWARE under different platform configurations
    comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios for precision irrigation using one
    of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation scenario. Experiments consisted simulated
    sensors sending messages to FIWARE, deployed both in a fog/cloud and a cloud-only
    configuration mode. We performed experiments with a large number of probes simultaneously
    sending messages to the platform, in order to verify and understand it scalability.
    Security and privacy aspects are key components for making it possible to emergence
    of a true market for such IoT platforms for precision irrigation, such as SWAMP
    [8]. However, these aspects have not been evaluated here since they are outside
    the scope of this paper that focuses on performance and scalability of the FIWARE
    Platform when configured for the needs of SWAMP. Our results reveal interesting
    and non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing does not always improve
    the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition of a fog processing
    nodes even proved to worsen the performance. An important and unexpected factor
    in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially, we believed that
    the network would equally impact both configurations (fog/cloud and cloud-only).
    However, the impact was much higher in the fog/cloud configuration. In the remainder
    of the paper, section II presents background and related work. Section III introduces
    SWAMP and the two scenarios for the MATOPIBA pilot. Section IV provides a detailed
    view of research design and methods. The key results are presented in section
    V, followed by discussion of lessons learned in section VI. Finally, section VII
    draws some conclusions and propose relevant future work. SECTION II. Background
    and Related Work This section introduces related background and related work.
    A. IoT and Fog Computing Fog computing is a fairly new paradigm aimed at dealing
    with challenges related to the huge amount of data that inevitably will be generated
    with the increasing utilization of IoT-based systems [2]. It solves serious problems
    such as decreasing latency from real time applications, decreasing data traffic
    between the network edge and core, and softening the processing burden of the
    cloud by performing load balancing. The metaphor comes from the fact that fog
    is a cloud but closer to the ground and to the people [13]. The fog is based on
    a highly virtualized platform that provides computing, storage and communication
    services between users and the datacenter where the cloud is hosted [1], by bringing
    services from the cloud closer to the users. Since its inception the fog has been
    envisioned for operating together with the cloud for making it possible to implement
    IoT-based smart applications. In other words, fog and IoT are related yet independent
    concepts, as the fog can deal with a broader variety of applications and IoT does
    need the fog to come true. A new technological trend that has been used for implementing
    the fog is container-based virtualization that provides a lightweight alternative
    to the traditional hypervisors [12]. Containers do not emulate the underlying
    hardware. Rather, the virtualized OS communicates directly with the host OS, which
    makes the appropriate calls to the real hardware. Lightweight virtualization minimizes
    the use of computational resources of the host machine, since there is no need
    to duplicate the operating system. B. The FIWARE Platform The FIWARE platform
    (fiware.org) has been attraction general attention for being a worldwide open
    source solution fostered and funded by the European Commission under Horizon 2020
    program. It is comprised of a series of software components called Generic Enablers
    (GE) that perform functions needed in a different variety of IoT-based applications
    for smart societies, focusing in cities, farming, industry, healthcare and sustainability.
    GEs can be used to build different applications that exchange information through
    a REST API following the OMA NGSI standard (openmobilealliance.org/release/NGSI),
    based on JSON. The central aspect of the FIWARE NGSI Context Management information
    model is the concept of entities and their attributes. Among the many GEs available
    by the FIWARE, some are considered the key enablers for smart applications. Here
    we only introduce the ones cited and used in our paper. Orion Context Broker:
    Orion is a publish/subscribe context broker, which makes it the main FIWARE GE
    and the heart of the platform. Orion provides an interface where clients can register
    entities and their attributes as well as producers/consumers of those entities.
    Orion only stores the latest version of entity attributes and it needs to work
    together with other GEs or applications in order to maintain historical data.
    Orion is available in fiware-orion.readthedocs.io. IDAS and IoT Agents: IDAS is
    an implementation of the Device Backend Management GE that comprises many IoT
    Agents that map data coming from sensors and going to actuators to the FIWARE
    NGSI information model to be stored in Orion and further processed by other GEs
    or external applications. Since low power sensors do not possess computing, storage
    and transmission capabilities for speaking NGSI, they use different IoT protocols
    such as MQTT, CoAP, Ultralight or LoRaWAN transport, which are converted into/from
    NGSI by IoT Agents. IDAS is available in catalogueserver.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-managementidas.
    STH Comet: Short Time Historic, also known as Comet, works with Orion storing
    entity data as a time series that can be further used by applications or other
    GEs. STH Comet is available in fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io. The use of FIWARE
    by any organization or developer involves the installation of its GEs in an appropriate
    infrastructure where it can run, which might be standalone machines, public clouds
    or preferentially a private cloud using the OpenStack cloud manager. FIWARE has
    been used as a computing platform for many IoT-based applications, such as farming
    and environment [14]. Also, many large scale projects use FIWARE for IoT in agriculture,
    such as IoF2020 (iof2020.eu), as well as startups such as Breeze (breeze-technologies.de),
    Hop Ubiquitous (hopu.eu) and Agricolus (agricolus.com). C. Related Work Scalability
    is a major concern for IoT platforms. Numbers vary but in general it is forecasted
    that in the beginning of the 2020’s there will be about 30 billion connected devices
    [5]. It has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect
    system scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in
    an environment composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting
    data [16]. The performance of FIWARE has been calling the attention its user community.
    A comprehensive study that proposes qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluates
    the performance of various IoT platforms is presented by da Cruz et al. (2018)
    [4]. From 11 platforms analyzed by the qualitative approach, 5 were selected for
    the quantitative performance analysis, including FIWARE. However, since they adopted
    a generic approach, they did not go into the specifics of FIWARE-only a single
    Orion + STH platform configuration was considered – and they did not evaluate
    different infrastructures (as fog computing). Martínez et al. (2016) [11] gives
    a detailed description of the architecture of a testbed of the FIWARE platform
    configured for the precision agriculture domain, which differs from our approach,
    because their test application connects directly to FIWARE using NGSI JSON interface,
    while we included an IoT Agent for MQTT using a scalable IoT sensor simulator
    for generating synthetic data. Lastly, Cardoso et al. (2017) [3] compared the
    performance of FIWARE and their own implementation of ETSI M2M, under different
    running conditions, which makes it difficult to understand the tradeoffs of each
    platform. In this paper, we differ from previous work by evaluating five configurations
    of FIWARE and focusing on the scenarios of smart irrigation in agriculture from
    the SWAMP project [9]. SECTION III. Smart Water Management Platform The primary
    objective of the SWAMP project is to develop IoT based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in precision irrigation domain and to pilot them in
    four places, two pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil [9],
    more information can be found in swampproject.org. Also, it is aimed at improving
    precision irrigation by increasing the awareness of the condition of the crop,
    by monitoring the field based on crop status and environment, and to adjust the
    irrigation prescription map accordingly. A. SWAMP Pilots The four SWAMP pilots
    are based on the similar technical solutions and deal with different crops and
    have different primary goals. CBEC Pilot (Bologna/Italy): the main objective of
    the Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia Centrale (CBEC) pilot is optimizing water distribution
    to the farms. Intercrop Pilot (Cartagena/Spain): Intercrop Iberica addresses several
    challenges since production is in a dry area and its primary goal is making a
    rational use of water. Guaspari Pilot (Espírito Santo do Pinhal / Brazil): The
    Guaspari Winery transfers the wine grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August)
    using irrigation techniques. The main goal for Guaspari is improving wine quality.
    MATOPIBA Pilot (Barreiras/Brazil): The Rio das Pedras Farm is located in the MATOPIBA
    region, and irrigation is mostly performed by center pivots. The main pilot goal
    is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable Rate
    Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production and save energy used
    in irrigation. The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation
    system concept for agriculture. The fundamental idea is to enable optimizations
    of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption based on a holistic analysis
    that collects information from all aspects of the system including even the natural
    water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related to growing particular plants.
    It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees the availability of water
    in situations where water supply is limited and also prevents over- and under-irrigation.
    A fundamental idea in SWAMP is to facilitate the replication of water management
    systems built on top of its platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment.
    Different layers of the architecture have components that are more generic and
    thus less difficult to be ported to other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific
    and thus require new development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. B.
    SWAMP MATOPIBA Scenario In this paper we will evaluate the performance of FIWARE
    when configured for the SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario depicted in Fig. 1 , which represents
    the center-pivot with variable-rate irrigation pilot. The scenario captures both
    the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents a future vision and not
    the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular agricultural plot of
    100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot is further divided
    into different management zones, identified before the crop season and based on
    differences in the soil properties. Two general types of sensors collect data
    for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within the soil at the root system
    depth that continuously measure metrics such as temperature and moisture, and;
    b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral cameras
    or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to the farm’s
    office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control the variable
    rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped with processing
    and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is predicted for
    the sensing devices. We developed multiparametric probes for soil sensing, which
    include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity sensors at three depths
    from the soil surface. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted from a
    few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. The key difference between
    Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) is that the former includes a distributed fog/cloud configuration
    of the platform whereas the latter is solely based on the cloud for hosting all
    software components. Depending on different variables - such as farmers interest,
    availability of infrastructure, intended responsiveness to delay, robustness to
    disconnections, and cost/effectiveness – one or the other scenario may be more
    or less appropriate. For the MATOPIBA pilot, the preferred solution is the fog-based
    one, for providing autonomous processing capacity to the farm as it is located
    in a region where Internet connections may suffer periods of instability. Anyway,
    we evaluate both approaches because the cloud-based one might be used as well.
    In Fig. 1(a) both the center pivot and drones are deemed Field Fog Nodes (FFN)
    for the SWAMP architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor
    aggregation point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the
    SWAMP system. FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the
    SWAMP platform, which usually is an on-premises Typically, when sensors are powered
    with LoRaWAN, the FFN will host the LoRaWAN Gateway and possibly the LoRaWAN Server
    and other supplementary features. The Fog Hub is located in the farm’s office.
    SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with the platform running in the cloud,
    whenever this is the preferred deployment choice. The FFNs send data directly
    to the SWAMP platform located in the Fog Hub at the farm’s offices via different
    wireless technologies, which in Fig. 1(a) is WiFi. For this scenario, the functions
    performed by the SWAMP architecture are divided up into local fog and remote cloud
    components. Heavy processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart
    algorithms (i.e., machine learning), is performed in the cloud. External information
    is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological data and historical
    data. On the other hand, Fig. 1(b) depicts a scenario where no fog is available
    and data generated by sensors are sent directly to the cloud via a typical cellular
    technology that might be 3G/4G or even NB-IoT. Fig. 1. SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario;
    a) Fog-cloud; b) Cloud-only Show All SECTION IV. Research Design and Methods A.
    Evaluation Scenario and Environment One of the main goals of this paper is to
    compare fog/cloud and cloud-only based approaches for smart water management.
    Therefore, based on the SWAMP MATOPIBA pilot specification ( Section 3), we designed
    a FIWARE-based IoT platform that involves obtaining sensor data values up to the
    point of they are transparently consumed by an application that can be deployed
    in the cloud and/or in the fog. The software modules depicted in Fig.3 and Fig.4
    are implemented by lightweight virtualization of Docker containers, including
    the FIWARE modules, whose container images can easily be obtained in that format.
    The other modules of this scenario are: SenSE: the Sensor Simulating Environment
    (SenSE, is an open-source large-scale IoT sensor data generator able to abstract
    real devices and to model different complex scenarios, such as smart farms [16].
    The tool is a traffic workload generator that emulates a huge number of heterogeneous
    sensors representing tens of thousands of IoT sensors sending data simultaneously
    via a typical IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT). Although the sensors are synthetic, the
    traffic is real. In our scenarios, SenSE generates probe data and represents the
    fog field node that forward sensor data to the platform. The source code can be
    download from github.com/ivanzy/SenSE-Sensor-Simulation-Environment. Mosquitto:
    Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source MQTT message broker. Available in mosquitto.org.
    MongoDB: a document-oriented NoSQL database. Available in mongodb.com. Consumer:
    Consumer is a special purpose Express.js web application that subscribes in Orion
    and receives sensor data from the probes. When Orion sends a message to the consumer’s
    API, a timestamp is recorded and is subtracted from the timestamp of the message,
    in such a way we obtain the elapsed time between the generation of the message
    until it reaches the Consumer. The sequence of processing steps and data flow
    starting from the sensor data generation and ending at the consumer is shown in
    Fig. 2. This data flow is deployed in both fog and cloud-only scenarios, depicted
    in Fig. 1. SenSE generates sensor (probe) data and sends it to Mosquitto MQTT
    broker; IoT Agent receives the probe messages from the MQTT broker, stores it
    in MongoDB, translates them to the NGSI format, and finally sends it to Orion
    through HTTP protocol; Orion Context Broker receives NGSI data from the IoT Agent,
    updates entity values, stores them in MongoDB, and sends them to the subscribed
    applications through HTTP protocol and structured as NGSI; Data is delivered to
    the consumer, which stores it and calculates the elapsed since the message was
    generated in the probe (by SenSE), the consumer is subscribed to be notified from
    all probe sensors updates. Fig. 2. Processing steps and data flow Show All In
    the cloud-only experiments ( Fig.3) the sensor data is directed sent to the cloud,
    where all modules are in the same physical machine. Since both Orion and IoT Agent
    are in the same VM, both use the same MongoDB instance. In the fog experiments,
    the first two steps of processing occur in the fog node, which means that the
    MQTT broker and the IoT Agent run in the edge device, and the Orion and Consumer
    are executed in a VM in the cloud. This configuration needs a MongoDB instance
    in each machine, where the fog hosts the IoT Agent and cloud hosts Orion and the
    Consumer. In order to fully understand the evaluation scenario, one needs to comprehend
    the data model of the probe messages. We adopted the Ultralight 2.0 (UL) protocol
    – a lightweight text based protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications
    where the bandwidth and device memory may be limited resources [6]. Each probe
    consists of a set of seven sensors of three different types: Three soil temperature
    sensors in different depths; Three soil moisture sensors in different depths;
    One soil electrical conductivity sensor. Each probe sends a message every 10 minutes
    using the UL protocol over MQTT. The structure of each message is: t1|v|t2|v|t3|v|m1|v|m2|v|m3|v|c|v|ts|v
    View Source where: t1, t2, t3: temperature sensors in different depths; m1, m2,
    m3: moisture sensors in different depths; c: electrical conductivity of the soil;
    ts: timestamp of message generation; v: value of the metric. Fig.3 and Fig.4 show
    the two evaluation scenarios, cloud-only and fog/cloud, respectively. We performed
    the experiments in a lab testbed – all the VMs in the same LAN - and using a network
    emulator (WANem – available to download at wanem.sourceforge.net) to consider
    the impact of network parameters between the place where the data is generated
    (in the farm, where the sensors and fog nodes are located) and the place it is
    processed (the cloud, usually located in some datacenters placed in big cities).
    Although the case where the machines representing the fog and the cloud are in
    the same LAN does not adequately portray the reality, it is important to further
    understand the behavior of the IoT platform and what are the impacts of a constrained
    network. Fig. 3. Cloud/Only FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All Fig. 4. Fog/Cloud FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All The experiments were performed in a private cloud environment implemented
    with OpenStack in a lab testbed. As the experiments were in our own private cloud,
    we could assure that they did not suffer from outside interference from other
    virtual machines running in the same physical servers. Both fog and cloud were
    implemented using virtual machines (VM) in OpenStack, though with very different
    configurations. We used the standard Amazon AWS VM configurations: cloud VM equivalent
    to a t2.medium instance (2vCPU - 4GB of RAM) and the fog VMs (both fog field node
    and fog hub) equivalent to a t2.small instance (1vCPU – 2 GB RAM). Our cloud was
    composed by 6 machines with the following configuration: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
    E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40GHz - 8 cores and GB of RAM. Two different physical machines
    were used. B. Metrics There are two different metric used in our experiments:
    Average elapsed time: the average time elapsed since a sensor data point is generated
    in the probe until it reaches the consumer application. Basically, we are interested
    in the time elapsed since the data is collected until it is ready to be used by
    another application – such as a dashboard or an analytics module; System metrics:
    CPU and memory usage per Docker container, which allows us to observed each application,
    obtained by docker stats command every 5 seconds. C. Experiments Experiments consisted
    of SenSE simulating probes and sending messages to the IoT platform, running in
    the cloud-only configuration or in the fog/cloud configuration. We performed experiments
    with a large number of probes simultaneously sending messages to the platform,
    in order to verify and understand it scalability. Table I shows the factors and
    levels used in the performance analysis. Our experiments varied all factors with
    all levels, consisting of 16 different possibilities. Each experiment took 2 minutes
    and was replicated 30 times, totalizing 16 hours of running experiments. The asymptotic
    confidence intervals were calculated with a confidence level of 99%. Table I Factors
    and Levels To configure the emulated WAN, we tried to replicate a connection from
    a farm to a cloud. Therefore, we made a simple experiment in order to obtain the
    parameters used in the network emulator by pinging a public cloud using a 4G connection,
    and next we estimated the parameters as a 10 Mbps connection with 45ms of delay
    time and 5ms of jitter. SECTION V. Results The results for the elapsed time in
    all configurations are depicted in Fig.5, wherein one can observe the effect of
    increasing the workload in the fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios. The platform
    remained stable during almost all experiments, except for the ones performed with
    a workload of 15,000 probes - that we consider being a very high workload. The
    high confidence interval in those experiments reveals this instability. Regarding
    the comparison between the experiments with the presence of the fog and the ones
    with only the cloud, it is essential to analyze networking issues. First we analyze
    those configurations without the network effects (no WANEm emulator), and next
    the impact of the WAN in the experiments. It is important to reinforce that experiments
    without considering the impact of the network are only for a baseline comparison
    and do not reflect real scenarios. In the experiments using a local network, the
    two approaches had equivalent results, since neither the fog nor the cloud were
    overloaded. The difference between the two approaches –fog and cloud - is that
    in the fog case some software modules (Docker containers) were moved to another
    machine (representing the fog), there was no improvement in the overall performance
    of the system when the cloud was not overloaded. Therefore, our experiments revealed
    that performing load balancing between two different machines does not improve
    the performance of the system. In the case where the cloud is overloaded (15,000
    probes), distributing the processing to another machine (the fog) should have
    improved the overall performance of the system. However, the results show that
    there is an overlap between the confidence interval of the experiments with fog
    and cloud with 15000 probes, with the fog experiments having a slightly better
    performance. This occurs due to the limited computational resources of the machine
    that represents the edge device, so that when the workload increases the fog node
    becomes the bottleneck. Experiments with the network emulator (WANem) had results
    that did not confirm our intuition. In the scenarios with a low workload (1,000
    and 5,000 probes), the cloud approach has a significant better performance than
    the fog. This occurs because in the cloud experiments the network traffic was
    composed of small MQTT packets, which did not impose a major constrain to the
    network. However, in the fog experiments the MQTT traffic is only send to the
    fog, which sends a very verbose NGSI/HTTP traffic via the network to the cloud.
    This traffic suffers much more with the network constrains (latency and limited
    bandwidth). Anyway, there is a clear trade-off between the cloud and fog approaches
    when processing becomes the bottleneck, instead of the network. The almost perfect
    balance occurs with experiments with 10,000 probes, in which both approaches achieved
    the same performance. For higher workloads, the fog has a slightly better performance
    than the cloud. The system metrics – RAM and CPU usage - for the cloud-only experiments
    are depicted in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, for the fog/cloud experiments are showed in
    Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Since the workload in the system is very similar with and without
    the network, we opted to portrait only the results performed considering the network,
    since they illustrate the whole set of experiments. The experiments using the
    fog approach, there were two MongoDB instances - in the fog to help the IoT Agent
    and in the cloud connected to Orion - are identified as Mongo-fog and Mongo-cloud
    respectively. Analyzing Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, it becomes clear that the container
    that demands more processing and it is the potential bottleneck of the system
    is MongoDB. Also, when comparing the cloud-only and fog/cloud results for the
    CPU usage, it is possible to infer that Orion imposes a higher workload in, since
    when the IoT Agent is on the fog node, MongoDB in the cloud has only an approximately
    20% decrease of CPU usage. Unlike the CPU usage, the memory usage has a stable
    behavior, even with the increase of the workload, as shown by Fig.7 for the cloud
    experiments, and in Fig. 9 for the fog experiments. However, there is also a decrease
    of approximately 20% of memory usage when the IoT-Agent is moved to the fog, with
    its own instance of MongoDB. Fig. 5. Response time for the cloud and fog configurations

    SECTION VI. Discussion The experiments were successful in replicating a large-scale
    smart farm environment considering the number of sensors. Also, they showed that
    fog computing does not always improve the overall system performance. However,
    there are complex issues to evaluated in opting for a cloud or a fog approach
    beyond simply adding a machine in the edge of the network. There is a non-trivial
    trade-off between the given application, the available infrastructure and the
    system workload. In the SWAMP scenarios, we expect a smaller number of sensors,
    due to costs and farm sizes, and therefore the experiments that better represent
    real case scenarios are the ones with 1,000 and 5,000 probes. In those cases,
    the addition of a fog processing node proved to be a downgrade regarding performance.
    Nevertheless, the fog has others benefits that compensate the lack of performance.
    In farms in the inward countryside of Brazil, when there is Internet connectivity,
    it is frequently unstable and limited, suffering from frequent disconnections.
    In this case, the fog node is responsible to store sensor data and keep a subset
    of services online when there is no connection to the Internet. An important and
    unexpected factor in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially,
    we believed that the network would equally impact both configurations fog and
    cloud). However, the impact was much higher in the fog configuration. This happens
    because the traffic of JSON/HTTP packets suffer more from network constrains than
    the lightweight UL 2.0 MQTT traffic. Therefore, when deploying a solution in a
    real environment, there is the need to analyze if the gain in processing part
    of the data in another device (the fog) will overcome the limitations imposed
    by the network. Another solution is to use a lightweight protocol when sending
    the data to the cloud form the fog. This set of experiments created higher awareness
    about the scalability tradeoffs of the FIWARE IoT platform. A major concern is
    regarding the default database used by Orion and the IoT Agent (i.e. MongoDB)
    that was the major bottleneck of the experiments. It is a known fact that MongoDB
    does scale as well as other NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra [10]. In the FIWARE
    documentation, there is no guide or configuration regarding using a different
    database for both software and it seems that they were hardcoded for working with
    MongoDB. FIWARE could potentially increase its scalability if it allows the of
    more efficient databases other than MongoDB. Another solution is to place MongoDB
    in a dedicated machine. Although FIWARE has a scalability ceiling due to MongoDB,
    it is suitable for most of the IoT scenarios in smart farms, being capable to
    handle 10,000 probes without major performance issues. It is proven to be a reliable
    tool with several advantages. It provides a standard communication format between
    all services in a given system through the NGSI information model. FIWARE also
    provides a transparent way to applications – such as dashboards and analytics
    – to consume sensor data. The IoT Agent can handle data from different sensors
    and translate them to a standard NGSI and automatically send this data to Orion,
    whose API is very flexible and able to add new sensors on-the-fly. Orion also
    proved to be a reliable and useful tool to manage context information, as it stores
    the last data point of each attribute and provides a simple API to consult it.
    Also, by using the subscribe operation in Orion, applications do not need to perform
    polling in the interesting devices. Rather, when data is changed, Orion notifies
    the subscribed application. SECTION VII. Conclusion We analyzed the performance
    of FIWARE under different platform configurations comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only
    scenarios for precision irrigation using one of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation
    scenario. Our results reveal non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing
    does not always improve the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition
    of a fog processing nodes even proved to worsen the performance. Also, the network
    between the farm and the cloud datacenter causes some unexpected differences between
    different scenarios. The results presented in this paper reveal the tip of the
    iceberg. In order to fully understand the tradeoffs involved in using IoT platforms
    and particularly FIWARE, we need to broaden our scope and perform experiments
    in different configurations, pilots and in scenarios beyond smart farming. Authors

  analysis: 'In this paper, the authors investigate how to minimize the average semantic
    error in communication by considering the meaning of transmitted codewords over
    a noisy channel. Traditional communication systems rely on error rates that are
    agnostic to the semantics of messages. However, in emerging networks, reliable
    communication implies understanding the intended meaning of messages. To address
    this, the authors introduce a novel performance metric, the average semantic error,
    that quantifies how accurately the meanings of messages are recovered. To optimize
    communication strategies, they formulate a Bayesian game where an external entity,

    semantic communication problem. In practice, channel coding is widely used to
    combat noise and improve the reliability of communication. Incorporating channel
    coding into the semantic communication framework would be an important step towards
    making it more practical. Additionally, the authors assume that the words observed
    by the encoder are independent of the agent''s true nature. This assumption simplifies
    the analysis but may not always hold in real-world scenarios. Relaxing this assumption
    and investigating how the encoder''s knowledge of the agent''s nature affects
    the optimal communication strategies would be an interesting direction for future
    work.'

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: This paper proposes a communication framework
    where meanings of transmitted codewords over a noisy channel are explicitly taken
    into account. Furthermore, such communication takes place in the presence of an
    external entity, i.e., an agent, that can influence the receiver. The agent may
    be adversarial or helpful, and its true nature is unknown to the communicating
    parties. Actions taken by the agent are governed by its nature to aim to improve/deteriorate
    the communication performance. We characterize the optimal transmission policies
    to minimize the end-to-end average semantic error, that we define as the expected
    error between meanings of intended and recovered messages, under the uncertainty
    of agent’s true intentions. To do so, we first formulate the communication problem
    as a Bayesian game, and investigate the conditions under which a Bayesian Nash
    equilibrium exists. Next, we consider a dynamic communication scenario in which
    parties take actions sequentially, forming beliefs about the other party. By formulating
    this setting as a sequential game, we investigate the structure of the belief
    system and strategy profiles at equilibrium. Our results indicate that word semantics
    are instrumental in assessing communication performance when messages carry meanings,
    and optimal communication strategies are strongly influenced by the communicating
    parties’ beliefs. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Performance criteria in
    conventional communication systems are based on error rates that are agnostic
    to the semantics of communicated messages. In fact, communication protocols that
    operate in the physical layer do not take into account the difference between
    the meanings of transmitted and recovered messages at all, but rather are concerned
    with the engineering problem of reliably communicating sequences of bits [3].
    Emergent networks, e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, enable advanced
    connectivity between humans and machines [4], [5], where interaction occurs between
    parties of diverse backgrounds, interests, and inference capabilities. For such
    systems, reliable communication implies that the intended meaning of the messages
    is preserved at reception. In effect, these networks allow interaction at a level
    so that the communicating parties can form social relationships [6]. These factors
    motivate a new approach that molds physical and application layer metrics into
    one, i.e., a novel performance criterion that takes into account the meanings
    of the communicated messages, as well as utilizing this measure in a setting that
    abstracts the impact of social influence. This paper introduces an approach in
    which the semantic content of the messages to be communicated over a noisy channel
    is taken into account in optimizing the performance of a communication system.
    Consider the following motivating example. In a conventional communication system,
    errors between semantically similar words, such as car and automobile, are treated
    equally as semantically distant words, such as car and computer. On the other
    hand, the meaning of car is much closer to automobile than computer. In reality,
    if one wishes to transmit the binary sequence corresponding to the message car,
    and if the channel errors prevent its recovery, it would be much better if the
    erroneous received sequence were decoded as automobile as compared to computer.
    We study mechanisms to achieve this, i.e., how to reliably communicate the meanings
    of messages through a noisy channel. To do so, we propose a novel performance
    metric that measures how accurately the meanings of messages are recovered. We
    view the semantic error caused by the noisy channel as the distance between the
    meanings of transmitted and received messages. This is in contrast with declaring
    an error when a message other than the original is recovered regardless of its
    meaning. Our semantic error measure is based on the notion of semantic similarity,
    which quantifies the distance between the meanings of two words [7]–[10], for
    instance, synonyms incur very small if any semantic error. Semantic similarity
    measures are widely used in natural language processing, artificial intelligence,
    computational linguistics, and information retrieval. By minimizing a semantic
    error measure based on the dissimilarity of word meanings, we determine the optimal
    transmission policies to best preserve the meanings of recovered messages. In
    addition to establishing the semantic error metric for communication performance,
    we model the impact of social influence on how the messages are interpreted by
    considering an external influential entity, i.e., an agent, in our communication
    network. This agent can influence the receiver, in particular, how it decodes
    the received signals, by providing side, e.g., context, information. The exact
    nature of the agent, whether adversarial or helpful, is unknown to the communicating
    parties, and is treated as a random variable. An adversarial agent, for instance,
    would target causing errors in message recovery, while a helpful one would act
    to facilitate effective communication. Hence, it is beneficial to tailor the transmission
    policies to take into account the possible intentions of the agent. We model the
    interaction between the communicating parties and the agent by utilizing game
    theory, in particular, as a Bayesian game [11], [12]. Bayesian games consider
    static games with incomplete information due to uncertainty about the characteristics
    of one or more players. The objective of each player, i.e., its payoff function,
    is determined by its characteristics. Bayesian games can be extended to model
    dynamic scenarios, in which players take actions sequentially in multiple rounds.
    Games of this type are called sequential games with incomplete information. The
    sequential game has perfect information if the actions taken by each player are
    observed by all other players, otherwise it has imperfect information [12]. Bayesian
    games have been useful in modeling a diverse range of problems in communication
    networks in which interacting parties have incomplete information regarding various
    network parameters [13]–[22]. In [13], Bayesian games have been leveraged in network
    intrusion detection, for modeling the interaction between defending and attacking
    parties. References [14] and [15] utilize Bayesian games in the context of dynamic
    spectrum access between primary and secondary users, to identify the optimal spectrum
    monitoring strategies for detecting potential thievery of spectral resources by
    the secondary user. Wireless spectrum utilization is investigated in [16] in which
    a Bayesian game is designed to model the interaction between selfish communicating
    parties that operate in the same frequency band, in which the parties have incomplete
    information about the channel conditions of one another. The time-invariant channel
    setup considered in [16] is extended in [17] to take into account channel variations
    as well as channel estimation errors. In [18], a Bayesian game is formulated to
    study resource allocation in a fading multiple access channel, where the communicating
    parties aim to maximize their average achievable rates with incomplete information
    regarding the fading channel gains. Reference [19] applies the Bayesian game model
    to the downlink power allocation scenario in a two-tier heterogeneous cellular
    network, in which the macrocell base station has incomplete information about
    the channel between the femtocell base station and the femtocell user. Bayesian
    games have also found applications in signal processing for communications [21]
    and in adaptive multi-agent sensing scenarios [22]. In a different line of work,
    Bayesian games have been incorporated to design robust distributed wireless communication
    protocols in the presence of jammers, in which the interacting parties have incomplete
    information about the network conditions, such as the identities of other users,
    traffic dynamics, or characteristics of the physical channel, e.g., channel gain
    or noise [23]–[25], or whether the jammer is physically present or absent [26].
    Reference [27] utilizes a Bayesian game to model an underwater acoustic sensor
    network in which nodes communicate in the presence of an adversary, and incomplete
    information results from the uncertainty about the nodes’ exact position. A cognitive
    radio network is considered in [28] in which the power allocation strategies are
    studied for the secondary user to meet a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR), in the presence of a jammer. In this model, the interaction between
    the secondary user and the jammer is modeled as a Bayesian game with power budget
    constraints and incomplete information regarding the channel gains. We view the
    semantic communication problem with social influence as a game with incomplete
    information, played between the encoder/decoder and the agent. The encoder/decoder
    pair wishes to minimize the average semantic error between the meanings of transmitted
    and recovered messages. The agent depending on its nature may either act to aid
    or work against this goal. For the static (Bayesian) scenario in which both sides
    take their actions simultaneously, we investigate the conditions under which a
    pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium exists, and characterize the mixed strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium. After showing that finding the encoding and decoding
    strategies to minimize the average semantic error is NP-hard, we propose two algorithms
    based on simulated annealing and alternating optimization. We next extend the
    communication scenario into a dynamic one, in which the agent and the communicating
    parties can take actions sequentially. We demonstrate a sequential equilibrium
    under which the agent signals its true nature to the communicating parties, by
    always choosing separate actions for when it is adversarial or helpful. In our
    numerical studies, we determine the equilibrium strategies as well as the structure
    of the encoding and decoding functions that minimize the average semantic error.
    Our results confirm that judicious transmission policies can significantly reduce
    the semantic errors that occur between the meanings of intended and recovered
    words. In addition, optimal strategies are greatly influenced by the belief of
    the interacting parties about the true nature of the influential entity. To this
    end, transmission policies depend on the bias of the interacting parties, i.e.,
    whether the individual is believed to be adversarial or helpful. The remainder
    of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we overview the notion of
    semantic similarity. Section III introduces our system model. The Bayesian game
    formulation is described in Section IV. Section V analyzes the Nash equilibrium.
    Section VI studies the structure of the optimal encoding and decoding strategies.
    The dynamic communication game model is introduced in Section VII. Numerical results
    are provided in Section VIII. The paper is concluded in Section IX. SECTION II.
    Semantic Similarity: A Brief Overview Words can take different meanings in different
    contexts. A concept refers to the specific meaning that a word takes in a certain
    context. For instance, the word nickel may refer to a five-cent coin or a chemical
    substance. Semantic relations between different concepts are often represented
    by using word taxonomies [29], such as the WordNet taxonomy illustrated in Fig.
    1a. Semantic similarity quantifies how similar two concepts are [7]–[10]. Word
    similarity quantifies the semantic similarity between a pair of words, with synonyms
    having the highest value. Word similarity measures are often based on a word taxonomy,
    or statistics from a large set of texts, i.e., a text corpus [7]–[10]. The main
    semantic similarity metrics are node-based similarity and edge-based similarity.
    Fig. 1. (a) A word taxonomy fragment from [7]. Concepts are related to each other
    using an is-a relationship, for instance, dime is a coin. The same word may appear
    at several places in the taxonomy as instances of different concepts, such as
    nickel appearing under coin (thus taking the meaning of a five-cent coin) versus
    chemical substance. (b) Examples of edge-based similarity values between various
    words. Show All Node-based similarity between two concepts is measured by the
    information content of their lowest common subsumer [7]. A lowest common subsumer
    refers to the concept that has the shortest distance from the two. For example,
    coin and money are both subsumers of nickel and dime, but coin is lower subsumer
    than money. The information content of a concept is inversely proportional to
    its empirical frequency in the corpus. That is, concepts that appear less frequently
    in text have a higher information content. Edge-based similarity utilizes the
    geometric distance between two nodes in the word taxonomy to find the semantic
    similarity between two concepts [9]. This measure is inversely proportional to
    the length of the shortest path between two concepts. Similarity between two concepts
    increases as the path connecting the two nodes becomes shorter. Similarity between
    two words is defined as the maximum of all similarity values between the concepts
    corresponding to them. Fig. 1b presents examples of edge-based similarity values
    between various words evaluated using the NLTK language processing package [30].
    SECTION III. System Model Notation: In the following, uppercase letters represent
    random variables, whereas lowercase letters correspond to their realizations.
    We use \mathbf {x}=(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) for a vector of length {n}\,\,\in \mathbb
    {Z}^{+} . \mathcal {X} represents a set with cardinality |\mathcal {X}| and \mathcal
    {X}^{n} is the {n} -fold Cartesian product of \mathcal {X} . \mathbb {E}[\cdot]
    denotes the expectation operation. We consider the communication scenario in Fig.
    2a. In this scenario, the encoder observes a message (word) w from a finite set
    \mathcal {W} with probability p(W =w) . It then maps w to a channel input \mathbf
    {x}=(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) using an encoding function g~:~\mathcal {W} \rightarrow
    \mathcal {X}^{(n)} , where \mathcal {X}^{(n)}\subseteq \mathcal {X}^{n} and \mathcal
    {X} is a finite alphabet. The set of all such encoding functions is denoted by
    \mathcal {G} . A noisy channel exists between the encoder and the decoder, which
    is characterized by the conditional probability {p}(\textbf {Y} = \textbf {y}|\textbf
    {X} = \textbf {x}) . The channel output \mathbf {y}=(y_{1},\ldots, y_{n}) is a
    vector of length {n} from the set \mathcal {Y}^{(n)} such that \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}\subseteq
    \mathcal {Y}^{n} where \mathcal {Y} is a finite alphabet. Fig. 2. (a) Semantic
    communication channel. (b) Players of the Bayesian game formulation. Show All
    The agent’s true nature, which could be either adversarial or helpful, is characterized
    by a random variable \Theta governed by the probability, \begin{equation*} p\left
    ({\Theta =\theta }\right)=\begin{cases} \alpha & \mathrm { if } \quad \theta =a
    \\ 1-\alpha & \mathrm { if } \quad \theta =h \end{cases}\tag{1}\end{equation*}
    View Source for some 0 < \alpha < 1, where \theta =\,\,{a} if the agent is adversarial
    and \theta =\,\,{h} if the agent is helpful. We note that \alpha can take any
    value between (0,1), hence comes from an infinite set. However, its value is fixed
    and is known by both the agent and the encoder/decoder pair. Accordingly, the
    encoder and the decoder know the distribution in (1), but do not know the actual
    realization \theta , i.e., the true nature of the agent. It is assumed that \alpha
    is a parameter that can be estimated via various information sources, such as
    by monitoring the data on the past behavior of the agent, or gathering information
    from different applications on its activity patterns. The agent can take actions
    to influence how the decoder perceives the received information. The chosen action
    depends on the agent’s true nature, i.e., adversarial or helpful. In particular,
    the agent draws a random variable p(Q|W, \Theta =\theta) from a finite set \mathcal
    {P} . Each element of \mathcal {P} identifies a conditional probability distribution
    over the set of contexts \mathcal {Q} for each w \in \mathcal {W} , so that \begin{equation*}
    \sum _{q\in \mathcal {Q}}p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta =\theta)=1,\tag{2}\end{equation*} View
    Source where p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta =\theta)\geq 0 for all {q}~\in \mathcal {Q} . The
    decoder then observes a context {q} governed by the probability p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta
    =\theta) . That is, the context information observed by the decoder is affected
    by the distribution chosen by the agent. In that sense, the agent can influence
    the decoder by controlling the distribution p(Q|W, \Theta =\theta) . As an example,
    consider a communication scenario in which the encoder and decoder are smart devices
    deployed with sensors to monitor their environment. Suppose that the agent can
    place the decoder in one of the following two environments, an underwater environment
    vs. a desert environment. Depending on the environment it is placed in, the decoder
    will take different measurements and will have a different view of the context
    in which the communication is taking place. For instance, the animal and plant
    habitat in an underwater environment is different than that of a desert environment.
    This may in turn lead to different interpretations of the received message. Lastly,
    we assume that the words observed by the encoder are independent from the true
    nature of the agent, i.e., \begin{equation*} p(W=w|\Theta =\theta) = p(W=w).\tag{3}\end{equation*}
    View Source The decoder recovers a word \hat {w}\in \mathcal {W} from the channel
    output \mathbf {y} and context {q} using a decoding function h\,\,:\,\,\mathcal
    {Y}^{(n)}\times \mathcal {Q}\rightarrow \mathcal {W} . The set of all valid decoding
    functions is denoted as \mathcal {H} . The channel output, when conditioned on
    the channel input, is independent from the rest of the random variables in the
    model, i.e., we have that {Y} - {X} - WQ\Theta form a Markov chain, \begin{align*}
    p(\mathbf {Y}=&\mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=\mathbf {x}, W=w, Q=q, \Theta =\theta)
    \\=&p(\mathbf {Y} = \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X} =\mathbf {x}) \tag{4}\end{align*}
    View Source where x ={g} ({w} ). The sets \mathcal {G} , \mathcal {H} , and \mathcal
    {P} are finite. We define the semantic distance between two words as, \begin{equation*}
    d(w, \hat {w})=1-sim(w, \hat {w}), \quad w, \hat {w}\in \mathcal {W},\tag{5}\end{equation*}
    View Source where 0\leq sim(w, \hat {w})\leq 1 denotes the semantic similarity
    between w and \hat {w} . Given \Theta = \theta , we define the average semantic

    function {g} , and (10) follows from (3) and (4). SECTION IV. Bayesian Game Formulation
    In this section, we describe our game-theoretic formulation for the communication
    model introduced in Section III. Consider a two-player static Bayesian game. Player
    1 is the system designer who selects the encoding and decoding protocols. Player
    2 represents the agent. An illustration of the two players is depicted in Fig.
    2b. One can think of players 1 and 2 as an abstraction of the following communication
    scenario. Player 1 wishes to design a system to transmit information about the
    traffic status in one location to a user. The user has access to a sensor, e.g.,
    camera, whose measurements can be utilized while interpreting the received information.
    Player 2 controls the location and the settings of the camera, which allows her
    to affect how the measurements are interpreted by the user. As such, the communication
    performance depends on the characteristic of player 2, i.e., whether it is adversarial
    or helpful. The uncertainty about a player’s true nature is termed in the game
    theory literature as its type [31]. We adopt the same terminology in the sequel.
    Player 1 has a single (fixed) type that is known by both parties. Player 2 belongs
    to one of two possible types, adversary, denoted by \Theta =\,\,{a} , or helpful,
    denoted by \Theta =\,\,{h} . The uncertainty about the type of player 2 is characterized
    by the probability {p} (\Theta =\theta) from (1). The type of player 2 is known
    only by itself. The strategy set of player 1 consists of all pairs of encoding
    and decoding functions (g, h) \in \mathcal {G}\times \mathcal {H} , and is denoted
    by \mathcal {S}_{1}\triangleq \mathcal {G}\times \mathcal {H} . We represent the
    strategy chosen by player 1 by s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} . The strategy set of
    player 2 consists of all the elements in \mathcal {P} and is denoted as \mathcal
    {S}_{2}\triangleq \mathcal {P} . We represent the strategy chosen by player 2
    by s_{2}(\Theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} given its type \Theta \in \{a, h\} . That
    is, player 2 follows the strategy s_{2}(a) if it is adversarial and s_{2}(h) if
    it is helpful. We next introduce the payoff functions of the two players. Player
    1 wants to choose the encoding and decoding strategy that minimize the average
    semantic error from (10). Accordingly, we define the payoff function of player
    1 as, \begin{equation*} u_{1}(s_{1}, s_{2}(\Theta), \Theta)=\begin{cases} -D_{a}(s_{1},
    s_{2}(a)) \quad \mathrm { if }& \Theta =a \\ -D_{h}(s_{1}, s_{2}(h)) \quad \mathrm
    { if } & \Theta =h \end{cases} \tag{11}\end{equation*} View Source where s_{1}\in
    \mathcal {S}_{1} , s_{2}(\Theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} for \Theta \in \{a,h\} ,
    and D_{\theta }(s_{1}, s_{2}(\theta)) is as defined in (10). Player 1 wishes to
    maximize its expected payoff \begin{align*}&\mathbb {E}\left [{u_{1}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({\Theta }\right), \Theta }\right)}\right] \\&\qquad =-\sum _{\theta
    \in \left \{{a, h}\right \}}p\left ({\Theta =\theta }\right)D_{\theta }\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({\theta }\right)}\right), \tag{12}\\&\qquad =-\alpha D_{a}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right) -\left ({1-\alpha }\right) D_{h}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right) \tag{13}\end{align*} View Source where the expectation
    is taken over the distribution of the types of the agent. The payoff function
    of player 2 depends on its type. Specifically, if player 2 is adversarial (helpful),
    it wishes to maximize (minimize) the average semantic error from (10). The payoff
    function for player 2 is then defined as, \begin{equation*} u_{2}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({\Theta }\right), \Theta }\right) =\begin{cases} D_{a}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right)&\mathrm { if }~\Theta =a \\ -D_{h}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right)&\mathrm { if }~\Theta =h \end{cases}\tag{14}\end{equation*}
    View Source The two players choose their strategies independently before communication
    starts. We consider a non-cooperative game in which each player wishes to maximize
    its individual payoff. Both players are rational. SECTION V. Bayesian Nash Equilibrium
    A. Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium This section identifies sufficient conditions
    for the existence of a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Specifically,
    we let (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) denote a pure strategy Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium, where the equilibrium conditions are given by, \begin{align*}&-\alpha
    D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right) -\left ({1-\alpha }\right)
    D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right) \\&\geq -\alpha D_{a}\left
    ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right) -\left ({1-\alpha }\right) D_{h}\left
    ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right), \;\; \forall s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}
    \\ \tag{15}\\&\quad D_{a}\left ({s_{1}^{*}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right)
    \geq D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right), \;\; \forall s_{2}\left
    ({a}\right)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}, \tag{16}\\&\quad -\,\,D_{h}\left ({s_{1}^{*},
    s^{*}_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right) \geq -D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right),
    \;\; \forall s_{2}\left ({h}\right)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} \tag{17}\end{align*} View
    Source where s_{1}^{*}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} is player 1’s equilibrium strategy,
    s_{2}^{*}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} is player 2’s equilibrium strategy if she is
    adversarial, and s_{2}^{*}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} is player 2’s equilibrium strategy
    if she is helpful. Conditions (15)–(17) ensure that both players play their best
    responses against each other at equilibrium. Specifically, (15) ensures that player
    1 selects the encoding/decoding function that maximizes (13), whereas (16) and
    (17) ensure that the agent chooses the strategy that maximizes (14) when it is
    adversarial or helpful, respectively. In the following, we identify two pure strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibriums that occur when \alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } and
    \alpha \geq \bar {\alpha } , respectively, for some thresholds \underline {\alpha
    }\leq \bar {\alpha } . Theorem 1 shows that if the likelihood of the agent being
    a helpful one is sufficiently high (\alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } ), the equilibrium
    policies are the same as the setup in which the agent is indeed helpful. Theorem
    2 shows that if the likelihood of the agent being an adversarial one is sufficiently
    high (\alpha \geq \bar {\alpha } ), the equilibrium policies are the same as the
    setup in which the agent is indeed adversarial. We first demonstrate a pure strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium for \alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } and show that the
    encoding/decoding strategy at equilibrium is the same as one that would be selected
    if the agent was known to be helpful. Theorem 1:Define (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a),
    s^{*}_{2}(h)) such that \begin{align*} s^{*}_{1}=&\arg \min _{s_{1}\in \mathcal
    {S}_{1}} D_{h}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)), \tag{18}\\ s^{*}_{2}(a)=&\arg \max _{s_{2}(a)\in
    \mathcal {S}_{2}} D_{a}(s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(a)), \tag{19}\\ s^{*}_{2}(h)=&\arg \min
    _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}} D_{h}(s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(h)). \tag{20}\end{align*}
    View Source Then, (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) denotes a pure strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium whenever the following conditions are satisfied:\begin{align*}&\mathrm
    {i)} ~\alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } \quad \mathrm { for~some } \quad \underline
    {\alpha }~\leq \min _{\substack {s_{1} \in \mathcal {S}_{1}: s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1}\\
    \beta (s_{1}) >0, \kappa (s_{1})>0}} \frac {\beta (s_{1})}{\kappa (s_{1})}, \tag{21}\\&\mathrm
    {ii)}~\mathrm {If }~\beta (s_{1})=0~\mathrm {for~some}~s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}~\mathrm
    {with}~s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1},~\mathrm {then }~\kappa (s_{1})\leq 0, \\{}\tag{22}\end{align*}
    View Source where \beta (s_{1})=D_{h}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h))-D_{h}(s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h))
    and \kappa (s_{1})=\beta (s_{1})+D_{a}(s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a))-D_{a}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a))
    . Proof:We prove this result by showing that whenever (21) and (22) hold, (s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) satisfies the equilibrium conditions (15)–(17). Using
    (13), we first find player 1’s expected payoff if it follows the strategy s_{1}\in
    \mathcal {S}_{1} while player 2 plays s^{*}_{2}(a) if adversarial and s^{*}_{2}(h)
    if helpful, \begin{equation*} -\alpha D_{a}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a)) -(1-\alpha) D_{h}\left
    ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right).\tag{23}\end{equation*} View Source To prove that
    s^{*}_{1} is player 1’s best response, it remains to show for all s_{1}\in \mathcal
    {S}_{1} that, \begin{align*}&-\alpha D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right)
    -(1-\alpha) D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right) \\&\quad -\,\,\left ({-\alpha
    D_{a}\left ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right) -(1-\alpha) D_{h}\left ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)}\right)
    \\&=\beta (s_{1})-\alpha \kappa (s_{1}) \geq 0.\tag{24}\end{align*} View Source
    For s_{1} = s^{*}_{1} , (24) holds by definition. For s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1} , if
    \beta (s_{1}) > 0 and \kappa (s_{1})> 0, we have \beta (s_{1}) \geq \alpha \kappa
    (s_{1}) from (21), hence (24) holds. If instead \beta (s_{1})= 0, we have from
    (22) that (24) again holds. From (18), we observe that \begin{equation*} D_{h}\left
    ({s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)\leq D_{h}\left ({s_{1},s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)\tag{25}\end{equation*}
    View Source and therefore \beta (s_{1})\geq 0 for all s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}
    . Hence, the only remaining case we need to investigate is when \beta (s_{1})>
    0, \kappa (s_{1})\leq 0, which also satisfies (24) since \alpha > 0. Next, we
    find from (14) that if player 2 is adversarial, \begin{align*} D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}^{*}(a)}\right) =\max _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {P}} D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}(a)}\right) \geq D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(a)}\right) \\{}\tag{26}\end{align*}
    View Source for all s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {P} , hence (16) is satisfied. If instead
    player 2 is helpful, we find from (14) that, \begin{align*} -D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)=&- \min _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {P}} D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}(h)}\right) \\[-0.5mm]\geq&- D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(h)}\right) \tag{27}\end{align*}
    View Source for all s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {P} , hence (17) is also satisfied. We
    have now shown that s^{*}_{1} is player 1’s best response against player 2’s strategies
    s_{2}^{*}(a) and s_{2}^{*}(h) , where player 2 plays s_{2}^{*}(a) if adversarial
    and s_{2}^{*}(h) if helpful. At the same time, s_{2}^{*}(a) and s_{2}^{*}(h) are
    player 2’s best response against player 1’s strategy s^{*}_{1} , for when player
    2 is adversarial or helpful, respectively. As a result, (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a),
    s^{*}_{2}(h)) from (18)–(20) is a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Next,
    we identify a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium when \alpha \geq \bar {\alpha
    } and show that the encoding/decoding strategy at equilibrium is the same as one
    that would be selected if the agent was known to be adversarial. Theorem 2:Define
    (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) such that \begin{align*} s^{*}_{1}=&\arg
    \min _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} D_{a}\left ({s_{1}, s_{2}^{*}(a)}\right), \tag{28}\\
    s^{*}_{2}(a)=&\arg \max _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}} D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}(a)}\right), \tag{29}\\ s^{*}_{2}(h)=&\arg \min _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(h)}\right). \tag{30}\end{align*} View Source Then,
    (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) denotes a pure strategy Bayesian Nash
    equilibrium if \begin{equation*} \alpha \geq \bar {\alpha } \quad \mathrm { for~some
    } \quad \bar {\alpha } \geq \max _{\substack {s_{1} \in \mathcal {S}_{1}: s_{1}\neq
    s^{*}_{1} \\ \beta (s_{1})< 0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0}} \frac {\beta (s_{1})}{\kappa
    (s_{1})}\tag{31}\end{equation*} View Source where \beta (s_{1})=D_{h}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h))-D_{h}(s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(h)) and \kappa (s_{1})=\beta (s_{1})+D_{a}(s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a))-D_{a}(s_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(a)) . Proof:The proof follows the same lines as (23)–(27). We initially
    show that s^{*}_{1} is player 1’s best response by demonstrating that it satisfies
    (24). For any s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1} , if \beta (s_{1})< 0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0, we
    have \alpha \kappa (s_{1})\leq \beta (s_{1}) from (31), therefore (24) holds.
    Next, we note that \begin{align*} \kappa (s_{1})=\beta (s_{1}) -\left ({D_{a}\left
    ({s_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right)-D\left ({s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right)}\right)\leq
    \beta (s_{1}) \\{}\tag{32}\end{align*} View Source since D_{a}(s_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a))\geq
    D_{a}(s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a)) for all s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} from (28). As
    a result, we only need to inspect the following remaining cases: i) \beta (s_{1})>
    0, \kappa (s_{1})> 0, ii) \beta (s_{1})> 0, \kappa (s_{1})= 0, iii) \beta (s_{1})=
    0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0, iv) \beta (s_{1})= 0, \kappa (s_{1})= 0, v) \beta (s_{1})>
    0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0. We first observe that (24) holds for i) due to (32) and
    \begin{equation*} \alpha \kappa (s_{1})\leq \kappa (s_{1})\leq \beta (s_{1}) ~\mathrm
    { for } ~0< \alpha < 1.\tag{33}\end{equation*} View Source We next observe that
    (24) also holds for ii), iii), iv) and v) as \alpha > 0. As a result, (s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) is a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Remark
    1:It is useful to note that the results in Theorems 1 and 2 follow a convex combination
    argument, as the agent is either a minimizer or a maximizer, the monotone behavior
    of the equilibrium policies are preserved while the prior on the agent’s type
    changes, until certain thresholds are reached. B. Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
    For the semantic communication game, a mixed strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium
    always exists, as both players have a finite set of types and strategies [31],
    [32]. In this section, we characterize the structure of mixed strategies at equilibrium.
    We first define \phi \in \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{1}) as a mixed strategy for player
    1, where \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{1}) is the set of all probability distributions
    over \mathcal {S}_{1} . Here \phi assigns a probability to each s_{1}\in \mathcal
    {S}_{1} and we denote this probability by \phi (s_{1}) . Accordingly, \phi (s_{1})\geq
    0 for all s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} and \sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \phi
    (s_{1})= 1. Given \Theta =\theta , we next define \phi _{\theta } \in \Delta (\mathcal
    {S}_{2}) as a mixed strategy for player 2 whose type is \theta \in \{ a,h\} .
    Again, \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{2}) is the set of all probability distributions over
    \mathcal {S}_{2} . That is, \phi _{\theta } assigns a probability to each element
    s_{2}(\theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} and we denote this probability by \phi _{\theta
    } (s_{2}(\theta)) . Accordingly, \phi _{\theta }(s_{2}(\theta))\geq 0 for all
    s_{2}(\theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} , and \sum _{s_{2}(\theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \phi _{\theta }(s_{2}(\theta))= 1. At equilibrium, each player again wishes to
    maximize its expected payoff. For player 2, this expectation is over the distributions
    indicated by the mixed strategies. For player 1, the expectation is now over both
    the possible types of player 2 and the mixed strategies. Accordingly, (\phi ^{*},
    \phi ^{*}_{a}, \phi ^{*}_{h}) is a mixed strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium if
    \begin{align*} \phi ^{*}&=\arg \min _{\phi _{1}\in \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{1})}
    \Big (\alpha \sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}}\sum _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \phi (s_{1}) \phi ^{*}_{a}(s_{2}(a)) \\ &\times D_{a}(s_{1}, s_{2}(a), a)) + \!
    (1\!-\!\alpha) \sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \sum _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \!\!\!\! \phi (s_{1}) \phi ^{*}_{h}(s_{2}(h)) \\ &\times D_{h}(s_{1}, s_{2}(h),
    h) \Big), \tag{34}\\ \phi ^{*}_{a}&=\arg \max _{\phi _{a}\in \Delta (\mathcal
    {S}_{2})}\!\sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \sum _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \!\!\!\!\!\phi ^{*}(s_{1})\phi _{a}(s_{2}(a)) \\ &\hspace {4cm}\times D_{a}(s_{1},
    s_{2}(a), a), \tag{35}\\ \phi ^{*}_{h}& =\arg \min _{\phi _{h}\in \Delta (\mathcal
    {S}_{2})}\sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \sum _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \!\!\!\!\!\phi ^{*}(s_{1})\phi _{h}(s_{2}(h)) \\ &\hspace {4cm}\times D_{h}(s_{1},
    s_{2}(h), h). \tag{36}\end{align*} View Source The conventional route to compute
    (34)–(36) is for each player to find the strategy that makes the other player
    indifferent to each one of their pure strategies. It is useful to note that the
    computational complexity of this problem requires careful consideration, and various
    algorithms have been proposed to address this challenge [33], [34]. The interpretations
    as to why players would adopt mixed strategies is an ongoing debate in game theory,
    common views include treating mixed strategies at equilibrium as the steady state
    of a game that is played repeatedly, or interpreting mixed strategies as a result
    of small variations in the payoffs of the players. We refer the reader to [31,
    Sec. 3.2] for a detailed discussion on this topic. SECTION VI. Encoding and Decoding
    Strategies for Minimum Semantic Error In this section, we fix the strategy of
    player 2 by letting |\mathcal {P}|= 1, and focus on the encoding/decoding functions
    that minimize the average semantic error from (10) for a given distribution between
    the words and contexts. We utilize in this section the following notation \begin{equation*}
    p(Q|W) \triangleq p(Q|W, \Theta =a)=p(Q|W, \Theta =h)\tag{37}\end{equation*} View

    the average semantic error from (10) for this setting as, \begin{align*}&D\left
    ({(g, h), p(Q|W)}\right) \\&\triangleq D_{a}\left ({(g, h), p(Q|W, \Theta =a)}\right)
    \tag{38}\\&=\,\,D_{h}\left ({(g, h), p(Q|W, \Theta =h)}\right) \tag{39}\\&= \sum
    _{\substack {w\in \mathcal {W}, q\in \mathcal {Q}, \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}:\\
    \mathbf {x}=g(w)}} p\left ({\mathbf {Y} = \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X} = \mathbf {x}}\right)

    {G}\times \mathcal {H}} D\left ({(g, h), p(Q|W)}\right).\tag{41}\end{equation*}

    {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}} \sum _{ \substack {w\in \mathcal {W}: \\ \mathbf {x}=g(w)}}
    p(W=w|Q=q) \\&\quad \times p\left ({\mathbf {Y} = \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=\mathbf
    {x}}\right) d\left ({w, h(\mathbf {y}, q)}\right),\tag{42}\end{align*} View Source
    where p(Q=q)=\sum _{w\in \mathcal {W}}p(Q=q|W=w)p(W=w) and p(W=w|Q=q)=\frac {p(Q=q|W=w)p(W=w)}{p(Q=q)}
    . From (42), the optimal decoding rule can be determined as follows. For each
    {q}~\in \mathcal {Q} and \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)} , assign h(\mathbf
    {y}, q)=\hat {w} if \begin{align*} f_{d}\left ({q, \mathbf {y}, \hat {w}}\right)\leq&f_{d}\left
    ({q, \mathbf {y}, w^{\prime }}\right) \\=&\sum _{w\in \mathcal {W}: \mathbf {x}=g(w)}

    }\in \mathcal {W} . Similarly, to find the optimal encoding rule for a fixed decoding
    function {h} , one needs to find g \in \mathcal {G} that minimizes (40), \begin{align*}&D((g,
    h), p(Q|W)) \\&\quad =\sum _{ w\in \mathcal {W}} p(W=w) \sum _{\substack { q\in

    ({w, h(\mathbf {y}, q)}\right),\tag{44}\end{align*} View Source leading to the
    encoding rule g(w)= x if \begin{align*} f_{e}\left ({w, \mathbf {x}}\right)\leq&f_{e}\left

    {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}: \\ \mathbf {x}^{\prime }=g(w)}} p(Q=q|W=w)p\left ({\mathbf

    ({w, h(\mathbf {y}, q)}\right)\tag{45}\end{align*} View Source for all \mathbf
    {x}^{\prime }\in \mathcal {X}^{(n)} . Finding the encoding/decoding functions
    that minimize the average semantic error is NP-hard, the details of which is provided
    in Appendix A. We propose two algorithms in the sequel to address the computational
    intensity. Algorithm 1 is based on alternating optimization with an error tolerance
    \epsilon > 0. Starting from a random initial assignment of the encoding and decoding
    functions, the algorithm iterates between two steps until convergence. In one
    step, the optimal decoding function is determined from (43) by fixing the encoding
    function. In the subsequent step, the optimal encoding function is determined
    via (45) by fixing the decoding function. Since the average semantic error is
    non-increasing at each iteration, and is bounded from below by zero, the algorithm
    converges, it may, however, converge to a local optimum. Algorithm 2 is a probabilistic
    metaheuristic based on simulated annealing [35], an effective approximate method
    to reduce the complexity in a large search space for combinatorial problems [36]–[38].
    Its main idea is to, starting from an initial state, i.e., encoder/decoder assignment,
    perturb the state at each round by modifying the assignment. The new assignment
    is kept if it performs better than the old one, otherwise, is kept with a probability
    depending on a temperature parameter, which is reduced gradually, making the fluctuations
    less random as the algorithm progresses. The algorithm stops when the temperature
    reaches a minimum. The performance comparisons of the two algorithms are detailed
    in Section VIII. SECTION Algorithm 1 Alternating Minimization 1: Initialize {g}

    {g} and {h} SECTION VII. Dynamic Communication Game We now consider the dynamic
    communication scenario where the encoder/decoder pair (player 1) and the agent
    (player 2) take actions sequentially. Specifically, at one round the agent takes
    an action, observed by the encoder/decoder pair. In the subsequent round, the
    encoder/decoder pair takes an action. The actions chosen by the encoder/decoder
    pair cannot be observed by the agent, hence the agent is oblivious to the selected
    encoding/decoding strategy. The true nature of the agent, adversarial or helpful,
    is again unknown to the encoder/decoder pair, hence the game has incomplete information
    [12]. Since the actions of some players cannot be observed others, the game also
    has imperfect information [12]. In the dynamic game, care must be taken to address
    the dimensionality of the strategy spaces of the players. The number of possible
    encoding strategies for player 1, for instance, is exponential in the number of
    words to be encoded. To this end, we consider two possible actions for player
    2. The first action induces a distribution under which every context is equally
    likely given each word, i.e., the agent selects a random variable p(Q|W, \Theta
    =\theta) such that p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta =\theta) = \frac {1}{|\mathcal {Q}|} for
    every w \in \mathcal {W} and {q}~\in \mathcal {Q} . As such, this action prevents
    the decoder from using context information while decoding. The second action,
    on the other hand, induces a distribution that enables the decoder to achieve
    a better decoding performance by using context information. Formally, we let \mathcal
    {S}_{2} = \mathcal {P} = \{p_{B}, p_{G}\} denote the strategy set for player 2,
    where p_{B} and p_{G} corresponds to the former (bad) and latter (good) type of
    distribution. For the actions of player 1, we consider two encoding strategies.
    The first one is a robust encoding strategy that minimizes the average semantic
    error against a bad distribution, i.e., p_{B} , by assigning each pair of words
    with different meanings to a different codeword. Hence, errors that may be caused
    at the decoder are solely due to channel noise, and the decoder does not need
    to rely on context information for decoding. The second one is an encoding strategy
    for a good distribution, i.e., p_{G} , which assigns the words that have a low
    chance of appearing in the same context to the same codeword. This encoding strategy,
    while relying heavily on context information for decoding, can provide robustness
    against channel noise by using fewer codewords with greater Hamming distance between
    them. For each encoding strategy, we fix the decoding function to be the minimum
    semantic error decoder in (43). We represent the actions of player 1 by \mathcal
    {S}_{1} = \{g_{ci}, g_{ca}\} , where g_{ci} refers to the former, i.e., context-independent,
    encoding strategy, while g_{ca} is the latter, i.e., context-aided, encoding strategy.
    The average semantic error is then evaluated from (10). Given \Theta =\theta ,
    we denote the semantic error by D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{B}) when player 2 picks a
    bad distribution and player 1 picks a context-independent encoding function, D_\theta
    (g_{ci}, p_{G}) when player 2 picks a good distribution but player 1 picks a context-independent
    encoding function, D_\theta (g_{ca}, p_{G}) when player 2 picks a good distribution
    and player 1 picks a context-aided encoding function, and D_\theta (g_{ca}, p_{B})
    when player 2 picks a bad distribution and player 1 picks a context-aided encoding
    function. We require for \theta \in \{a, h\} , \begin{align*} D_\theta (g_{ca},
    p_{B}) \geq D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{B}) \geq D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{G}) \geq D_\theta
    (g_{ca}, p_{G}) \\{}\tag{46}\end{align*} View Source to ensure that it is better
    to use a context-independent encoding strategy against a bad distribution, and
    to use a context-aided encoding against a good distribution. If player 2 picks
    a good distribution, it is better to use a context-aided encoding strategy than
    a context-independent one. Both players have a finite number of actions. Lastly,
    we assume that both players remember their past actions and observations, i.e.,
    the game has perfect recall [31, Sec. 11.1]. At the outset, the distinction between
    incomplete and imperfect information is for convenience, as the two problems are
    motivated by different scenarios. Incomplete information represents the scenarios
    in which the characteristics (objectives/types) of one or more players are unknown
    to the other players. Imperfect information represents scenarios in which the
    actions taken by one or more players cannot be observed by others. Harsanyi [11]
    showed that this distinction is rather artificial, as the former can always be
    transformed to the latter. To do so, one introduces a new player called the nature.
    The nature’s actions consist of choosing a type for each player. Each player can
    only observe the type chosen for itself, but not the types chosen for others.
    Due to the fact that players cannot observe all of the actions taken by the nature,
    the game has imperfect information. This is now the standard technique for analyzing
    games with incomplete information [12], [39]. Accordingly, we also transform our
    game using Harsanyi transformation, by introducing another player, nature, that
    selects the type of player 2. Player 1 cannot observe the actions of nature. This
    game is illustrated in Fig. 3. Points connected by a dashed line, called an information
    set, cannot be distinguished by the current player. For instance \{v_{3},v_{5}\}
    is an information set for player 1 in Fig. 3, and player 1 cannot distinguish
    between states v_{3} and v_{5} while taking an action. Instead, player 1 forms
    beliefs about the current state of the game and updates them at each round after
    observing the actions taken by player 2. Fig. 3. Dynamic communication game model.
    Dashed lines represent the information sets of player 1 (encoder/decoder pair).
    Resulting payoffs are denoted by blue and red for players 1 and 2, respectively.
    Show All As shown in Section VIII-C, Nash equilibrium for such games may lead
    to equilibrium strategies for which the actions taken off the equilibrium path
    are not rational. Instead, a refinement of Nash equilibrium, known as sequential
    equilibrium, is used for analyzing sequential games with imperfect information
    [40]. Every sequential equilibrium is also a Nash equilibrium. In addition, sequential
    equilibrium ensures that: i) at each information set, the current player takes
    the best, i.e., sequentially rational, strategy, ii) strategies are consistent
    with the beliefs the players hold. We next formally state these necessary conditions,
    referring to [12], [31], and [40] for details. Let \sigma denote a behavioral
    strategy, which, at each information set, assigns a probability distribution to
    the set of available actions for the current player. It specifies the probability
    that the current player takes a specific action if the game is at one of the nodes
    belonging to the information set. We define \sigma _{i} as the behavioral strategy
    of player {i}\,\,= 1, 2 and \sigma = (\sigma _{1}, \sigma _{2}) . If player {i}
    takes an action at information set \mathcal {I} , \sigma _{i}(k|\mathcal {I})
    is the probability that she takes action {k} . We define a belief system \mu to
    represent the beliefs the players holds about the current state of the game at
    each information set. As such, \mu _{\mathcal {I}}(v) is the probability that
    the player taking an action at information set \mathcal {I} believes the game
    is currently at node {v}~\in \mathcal {I} , such that \begin{equation*} \sum _{v\in
    \mathcal {I}}\mu _{\mathcal {I}}(v) = 1 ~\mathrm { for~all } ~\mathcal {I}.\tag{47}\end{equation*}

    governed by the behavior strategy \sigma from node {k} to node {t} . Let \mathcal
    {T}_{\mathcal {I}} denote the set of all terminal nodes that can be reached from
    \mathcal {I} , and u_{i}(t) denote the payoff user {i} receives at node {t}~\in
    \mathcal {T}_{\mathcal {I}} . We then define the expected payoff for player {i}
    at \mathcal {I} by \begin{equation*} \mathbb {E}\left [{u_{i}\left ({\sigma |\mathcal
    {I}, \mu }\right)}\right] = \sum _{v\in \mathcal {I}} \mu _{\mathcal {I}}(v) \sum

    by fixing her strategy at all other information sets [41]. We let P_\sigma (v)
    be the probability that a node {v} is reached in the game under strategy \sigma
    , which is given by the product of the behavioral strategies and nature’s moves
    on the path from the root node to node {v} . Then, under strategy \sigma , an

    is a sequential equilibrium if it is consistent and sequentially rational. Proposition
    1:The dynamic semantic communication game has a sequential equilibrium. This proposition
    immediately follows from the fact that every finite sequential game with imperfect
    information and perfect recall has a sequential equilibrium [40]. We note that
    Fig. 3 demonstrates a signaling game, in which the action chosen by a player signals
    its type to the other party [12]. Equilibrium structures in such games are often
    classified as: a separating equilibrium if different types of player 1 always
    chooses different actions, allowing player 2 to perfectly infer its type; a pooling
    equilibrium if player 1 always chooses the same action irrespective of its type,
    thus hiding its type from player 2; a hybrid equilibrium in which player 1 randomizes
    between its actions. It can be shown that the unique equilibrium for the game
    in Fig. 3 is a separating equilibrium in which the agent always chooses a bad
    distribution if adversarial, and a good distribution if helpful. The game in Fig.
    3 allows each player to take a single action. Fig. 4 shows a larger game, where
    players again take actions one after the other, but they take two actions in total
    instead of one. Specifically, this larger game corresponds to the scenario in
    which the game in (3) is played twice. For space considerations, we only focus
    on the larger game in Fig. 4, and show that a similar separating nature exists
    in the actions of the agent. Accordingly, we assume that the payoffs received
    in Fig. 4 is the summation of the payoffs received at these two stages. For larger
    games, one can approximate sequential equilibrium via the quantal response equilibrium
    using [42], [43]. In the sequel, we demonstrate a sequential equilibrium for Fig.
    4. Fig. 4. Dynamic communication game model. Information sets of player 1 (encoder/decoder
    pair) and player 2 (agent) are represented by blue and red dashed lines, respectively.

    View Source The assessment (\sigma, \mu) is a sequential equilibrium. Proof:The
    proof is provided in Appendix B. The equilibrium in Proposition 2 suggests that
    adversarial and helpful agents always choose separate types of actions. An adversarial
    agent always chooses a bad distribution so that for each word, every context will
    be equally likely, whereas a helpful agent always chooses a good distribution.
    Against a bad distribution, the encoder always chooses a context-independent encoding,
    one which assigns each pair of words with different meanings to distinct codewords,
    irrespective of the belief it holds about the true nature of the agent. Against
    a good distribution, the encoder always chooses a context-aided encoding and leverage
    context information by assigning the words that have a small chance of occurring
    under the same context to the same codeword. We note, however, that this equilibrium
    structure depends on how the payoffs for the two parties are defined. For instance,
    if the payoffs were defined with respect to the average semantic error received
    at the last stage of the game instead of the sum of the errors at every round,
    then an adversarial player 2 might prefer to hide its nature by taking helpful
    actions until the last round. SECTION VIII. Numerical Results We consider a binary
    symmetric channel (BSC) with a crossover probability of \rho , i.e., the abstraction
    of binary communication over an additive white Gaussian (AWGN) channel with bit
    error probability \rho , between the encoder and the decoder. We focus on fixed
    length binary vectors of length {n} for the channel input and outputs, leading
    to the channel transition probability \begin{equation*} p\left ({\mathbf {Y} =
    \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=\mathbf {x}}\right)=\rho ^{l\left ({\mathbf {y}, \mathbf
    {x}}\right)} (1-\rho)^{n-l\left ({\mathbf {y}, \mathbf {x}}\right)},\tag{55}\end{equation*}
    View Source where {l} (y, x) is the Hamming distance between \mathbf {y} and \mathbf
    {x} . We consider a set of two contexts \mathcal {Q}=\{q_{1}, q_{2}\} . We select
    the words for our evaluations from a benchmark word set used in the semantic similarity
    literature [44], and let p(W=w)=1/|\mathcal {W}| for all w\in \mathcal {W} . We
    use the edge-based semantic similarity from Section II, illustrated in Fig. 1b.
    This is a corpus-independent similarity measure which allows us to avoid biasing
    our results in favor of a specific corpus. A. Base Model With |\mathcal{P}|= 1
    We initially study the structure of the encoding/decoding functions from Section
    VI by letting |\mathcal {P}|= 1 and fixing the conditional distribution between
    the contexts and words. We then study how Algorithms 1 and 2 perform in practice,
    by comparing them with an exhaustive search method that traverses over all the
    possible encoding/decoding functions to find the optimal assignments for the set
    of words, \begin{equation*} \mathcal {W}=\left \{{\mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile},
    \mathrm {bird}, \mathrm {crane}}\right \},\tag{56}\end{equation*} View Source
    where we set the remaining parameters as {n}\,\,= 3 and \mathcal {X}^{(n)}=\mathcal
    {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}\times \{0,1\}\times \{0,1\} . We consider two contexts such
    that, \begin{equation*} q_{1} = \mathrm {things~originating~from~non{-}living~beings},\end{equation*}
    View Source and \begin{equation*} q_{2} = \mathrm {things~originating~from~living~beings}.\end{equation*}
    View Source Accordingly, we let \begin{equation*} p(Q=q_{1}| W = w) = \begin{cases}
    1 \quad \mathrm { if } & w=\mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile} \\ 0 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w= \mathrm {bird} \\ 0.5 \quad \mathrm { if } & w= \mathrm {crane} \end{cases}\tag{57}\end{equation*}
    View Source noting that p(Q=q_{2}| W=w)=1-p(Q=q_{1}| W=w) , and crane is meaningful
    in both contexts, where it takes the meaning of an object that lifts and moves
    heavy objects in context q_{1} , and a large bird with a signature long neck in
    context q_{2} [29]. The same does not apply for the remaining words, however.
    For instance, car and automobile are irrelevant in context q_{2} , whereas bird
    is irrelevant in context q_{1} . We provide the semantic error values evaluated
    from Algorithms 1 and 2 in Table I, compared with exhaustive search results. The
    parameters used in the implementation of Algorithm 2 are T_{m}= 10, T_{f}= 2.5\times
    10^{-8} and N_{max}= 50000. Table I indicates that Algorithm 2 performs close
    to exhaustive search. The performance of Algorithm 1, on the other hand, is inferior
    to both exhaustive search and Algorithm 2 as \rho grows larger. This result hints
    that Algorithm 2 is a better candidate than Algorithm 1 for evaluating the semantic
    error minimizing encoder/decoders for larger sets, for which exhaustive search
    is intractable. As such, we utilize Algorithm 2 in the sequel to determine the
    encoding and decoding policies for the following larger set of words, \begin{align*}
    \mathcal {W}=&\Biggl \{{\mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile}, \mathrm {gem}, \mathrm
    {jewel}, \mathrm {coast}, \mathrm {shore}, \mathrm {stove}, \mathrm {food},} \\&\quad
    \mathrm {fruit}, \mathrm {bird}, \mathrm {forest}, \mathrm {monk}, \mathrm {brother},
    \mathrm {magician}, \mathrm {crane}, \\&\quad {\mathrm {journey}, \mathrm {voyage},
    \mathrm {furnace}, \mathrm {noon}, \mathrm {midday}}\Biggr \},\tag{58}\end{align*}
    View Source where we let p(Q=q_{1}|W=w)= 1 for w \in {gem, jewel, coast, shore,
    stove, journey, voyage, furnace, noon, midday} and p(Q=q_{2}|W=w)= 1 for w \in
    {food, fruit, forest, monk, brother, magician}. We select {n}\,\,= 4 and \mathcal
    {X}^{(n)}=\mathcal {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}^{4} . TABLE I Average Semantic Error Comparisons
    Semantic error values are as shown in Table I. Table II presents the corresponding
    encoding function, i.e., codeword assignments, for \rho \in {0.001, 0.01, 0.1,
    0.2}. We observe from Table II that semantically closer words, such as car and
    automobile, are assigned to close codewords, as well as gem and jewel or noon
    and midday. Several semantically distant words are also assigned to the same codeword,
    such as car and brother when \rho = 0.001 or magician and voyage when \rho = 0.1.
    Since these words never occur in the same context, the decoder can use the context
    information to distinguish them. Upon comparing the completion time of Algorithm
    2 for |\mathcal {W}|= 20 in Table I with exhaustive search when \rho = 0.2, we
    have observed that Algorithm 2 takes 1609 sec to complete, whereas exhaustive
    search could not terminate in a reasonable time frame. TABLE II Encoding Function
    ( {g} ( {w} )) From Algorithm 2 for w \in\mathcal{W} Our results show that, to
    minimize error between the meanings of the recovered words, one should assign
    semantically closer words, i.e., words that are closer to each other in meaning,
    to closer codewords, those with a smaller Hamming distance. In that sense, words
    that are closer in meaning should be assigned to codewords that are confusable
    due to the noisy channel conditions. B. Bayesian Game We next implement the Bayesian
    game from Section IV by letting \rho = 0.1, {n}\,\,= 3, \mathcal {X}^{(n)}=\{000,
    001, 110, 101, 111\} and \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}^{3} . To reduce the dimensionality
    of the strategy spaces, for each given (pure) encoding strategy, we fix the decoder
    to the minimum error decoder described in (43). The coder now has to decide on
    the probability distribution only over the encoding functions, instead of both
    the encoder and the decoder, i.e., s^{*}(g,h)=s^{*}(g) . We evaluate the mixed
    strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium by using the game theory tool Gambit [42].
    We initially focus on the set of words from (56), and consider a context set \mathcal
    {Q}=\{q_{1}, q_{2}\} . For the agent, we define a strategy set \mathcal {S}_{2}=\{p_{B},
    p_{G}\} as follows. Given \Theta =\theta , if the agent takes the action s_{2}(\theta)=p_{B}
    , the induced conditional probability between the words and contexts is \begin{equation*}
    p(Q=q_{1}|W=w,\Theta =\theta)=0.5 \;\; \forall w\in \mathcal {W},\tag{59}\end{equation*}
    View Source whereas if the agent takes the action s_{2}(\theta)=p_{G} , the induced
    probability is\begin{align*} p\left ({Q=q_{1}|W=w,\Theta =\theta }\right) = \begin{cases}
    1\phantom {.5} \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile}
    \\ 0\phantom {.5} \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \mathrm {bird} \\ 0.5 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w = \mathrm {crane} \end{cases}\\{}\tag{60}\end{align*} View Source Hence,
    under strategy p_{B} , contexts are uniformly distributed for each word, and the
    decoder cannot use context information to distinguish between any pair of words.
    Table III demonstrates the evaluated equilibrium points for \alpha = 0.9 and \alpha
    = 0.1. In our results, we have observed 12 and 4 Nash equilibrium points for \alpha
    = 0.9 and \alpha = 0.1, respectively. Each point corresponds to a pure strategy
    Nash equilibrium. The agent’s equilibrium strategy is s^{*}_{2}(a) if adversarial
    and s^{*}_{2}(h) if helpful. The coder’s equilibrium strategy is s_{1}^{*}=g(w)
    where {g} ({w} ) is the encoding function given in Table III. We observe that
    at equilibrium, synonyms car and automobile are assigned to the same codeword.
    When the agent is believed to be helpful, i.e., \alpha = 0.1, \textit {bird} is
    assigned the same codeword with car and automobile. Since under the helpful agent’s
    strategy bird never occurs in the same context with car and automobile, the decoder
    can use the context information to distinguish them. On the other hand, when the
    agent is believed to be adversarial, i.e., \alpha = 0.9, car, bird, and crane
    are all assigned to distinct codewords, since under an adversarial agent’s strategy
    the decoder cannot use the context information to distinguish the words. In this
    case, the Hamming distance between car and bird is greater than the distance between
    bird and crane. TABLE III Nash Equilibrium (NE) Strategies for the Coder and the
    Agent When \alpha= 0.9 and \alpha= 0.1 for |\mathcal{W}|= 4 C. Dynamic Game We
    implement the dynamic game in Fig. 4 from Section VII for the set of words from
    (56) with \alpha = 0.2, \rho = 0.1, {n}\,\,= 3, \mathcal {X}^{(n)}=\{000, 001,
    110, 101, 111\} and \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}^{3} . For the agent’s actions,
    we let p_{B} and p_{G} as defined in (60). For the actions of the coder, we define
    the context-independent encoding function g_{ci} and the context-aided encoding
    function g_{ca} as, \begin{align*} g_{ci}(w)=&\begin{cases} 0 0 0 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w = \{\mathrm {car, automobile}\} \\ 1 1 0 \quad \mathrm { if } & w =
    \{\mathrm {bird}\} \\ 1 1 1 \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \{\mathrm {crane}\} \end{cases}
    \\ g_{ca}(w)=&\begin{cases} 0 0 0 \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \{\mathrm {car, automobile}\}
    \\ 0 0 0 \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \{\mathrm {bird}\} \\ 1 1 1 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w = \{\mathrm {crane}\} \end{cases}\end{align*} View Source and note
    that g_{ci} assigns each word with a different meaning to a different codeword,
    whereas in g_{ca} , we observe that the decoder cannot immediately distinguish
    bird from car or automobile, since they are assigned to the same codeword, and
    extra information is required to distinguish them. By using (43) to determine
    the corresponding decoding functions, we evaluate the average semantic error values
    in (46) using (10), from which we find that \begin{align*} D_\theta (g_{ca}, p_{B})=&0.2260
    > D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{B}) = 0.0877 \\ > D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{G})=&0.0433 > D_\theta
    (g_{ca}, p_{G}) = 0.023.\tag{61}\end{align*} View Source We then evaluate the
    mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the dynamic game via a Linear Complementarity
    Program (LCP) using Gambit [34]. The equilibrium strategies are given in Fig.
    5, where the edge labels indicate the probability that the corresponding action
    is played. The right (left) branch corresponds to the action g_{ca} (g_{ci} )
    for the coder and p_{G} (p_{B} ) for the agent, respectively. It can be observed
    from the edges taken with probability 1/2 that the strategies off the equilibrium
    path are not necessarily rational. Unlike sequential equilibrium, these strategies
    are irrational if the player ever reaches to these states. Fig. 5. Mixed strategy
    Nash equilibrium of the dynamic game. Show All SECTION IX. Conclusion We have
    considered the transmission of a source that carries a meaning through a noisy
    channel. An external entity can influence the decoder, whose true characteristic,
    e.g., friend or foe, is unknown to the communicating parties. We have formulated
    the semantic communication problem both as a static Bayesian game, for which we
    identified the Bayesian Nash equilibria, and as a dynamic game with imperfect
    information, for which we characterized a sequential equilibrium. Our results
    show that semantics-aware transmission schemes improve communication performance
    of intended meanings even in the presence of influencing agents with potentially
    adversarial actions. We note that in current communication systems such as LTE,
    content is strictly separated from the communication layer. The proposed semantic
    error measure is a new paradigm for designing future networks where communication
    may take place between humans and smart devices, such as smart home assistants
    or IoT devices. Unlike traditional communication systems, in these emerging networks,
    understanding the semantic content of the messages is not only performed by humans,
    but also by these smart devices. As a result, semantic inference is a direct part
    of the communication problem. Our goal in this paper has been to define a semantic
    error measure as a first step for integrating the semantic inference and physical
    communication problems. By integrating these two problems via the use of a semantic
    error measure, one may design messages carefully to save system resources and
    avoid transmitting irrelevant information. As this is an emerging area, there
    are several interesting future directions. One challenge is the complexity of
    the optimal encoding and decoding functions as the number of words increase. Accordingly,
    one may choose to replace words with sentences/phrases and measure the semantic
    similarity between sentences instead of words to scale up the system. Another
    interesting future direction is to take into account manipulation in the decoded
    message or false information, which is not considered in the current model. This
    includes considering more general scenarios with more capable agents, who can
    alter the content of decoded messages as well as influencing both the encoder
    and the decoder, with various malicious goals. Lastly, the estimation of the parameter
    \alpha from past behavior patterns is an important future direction. Appendix
    A Proof of NP-Hardness of the Communication Problem To prove the NP-hardness of
    the semantic communication problem, we need to show that there exists an NP-complete
    problem that is reducible to it in polynomial time. In the following, we show
    that there exists a polynomial-time transformation that reduces the quadratic
    assignment problem (QAP), which is known to be NP-complete [45], [46], to the
    semantic communication problem. The rationale behind this transformation is to
    show that, if one had a polynomial time algorithm to solve the semantic communication
    problem, then one could solve any QAP in polynomial time, by first transforming
    it to the semantic communication problem in polynomial time. This demonstrates
    that the semantic communication problem is at least as hard as QAP. Since QAP
    is known to be NP-complete, semantic communication problem is NP-hard. Definition
    4 (QAP[45]):Define a one-to-one function \pi ~:~\mathcal {W}\rightarrow \mathcal
    {L} where \mathcal {L}=\{1,\ldots, |\mathcal {L}|\} with |\mathcal {L}|\geq |\mathcal
    {W}| , non-negative integer costs \gamma (w,w^{\prime }) and distances r(\pi (w),
    \pi (w^{\prime })) for w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} , and a bound {K}\,\,\in
    \mathbb {Z}^{+} . The QAP finds whether there exists a \pi such that \begin{equation*}
    \sum _{w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W}, w\neq w^{\prime }} \gamma \left ({w,w^{\prime
    }}\right) r\left ({\pi (w), \pi (w^{\prime })}\right)\leq K.\tag{62}\end{equation*}
    View Source We follow the terminology from [45], and refer to [47] for generalizations.
    We let p(\mathbf {Y}= \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=g(w)) denote {p}(\textbf {Y}=\textbf
    {y}|\textbf {X}=\textbf {x}) where x ={g} ({w} ). Consider the decision form of
    the semantic communication problem from (40), i.e., given D_{max} , whether there
    exists g~:~\mathcal {W} \rightarrow \mathcal {X}^{(n)} and h\,\,:\,\,\mathcal
    {Y}^{(n)}\times \mathcal {Q}\rightarrow \mathcal {W} such that, \begin{align*}&\sum
    _{\substack {w\in \mathcal {W}, q\in \mathcal {Q}, \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}:\\

    D_{max},\tag{63}\end{align*} View Source by using the fact that d(w, h(\mathbf
    {y}, q))\,\,= 0 whenever w =h(\textbf {y}, q) , and note that solving (63) is
    no harder than minimizing (40) [45]. By showing that (63) is NP-complete, we can
    prove that finding the encoding and decoding functions that minimize (40) is NP-hard.

    w^{\prime } but g(w)=g(w^{\prime }) . Then, \exists \, \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal

    q) \neq w^{\prime } . Without loss of generality, let h(\mathbf {y}, q) \neq w^{\prime
    } . Then, (w^{\prime }, \mathbf {y}) leads to (73) and causes in a contradiction.
    Hence, g is one-to-one. Then, we can let \forall w\in \mathcal {W} , \begin{equation*}

    Source where we use the fact that (w, \mathbf {y})\in \mathcal {F}\cup \mathcal
    {R} for all w\in \mathcal {W} , \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {S} with w \neq h(\mathbf
    {y}, q) , and therefore (w,g(w^{\prime }))\in \mathcal {F} for all w, w^{\prime
    }\in \mathcal {W} with w \neq h(g(w^{\prime }), q) , since by definition of \mathcal
    {R} , (w,g(w^{\prime }))\notin \mathcal {R} for all w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal
    {W} . Note that if (w,g(w^{\prime }))\in \mathcal {F} for some w, w^{\prime }\in
    \mathcal {W} , then h(g(w^{\prime }), q)= w^{\prime } , and as a result, (w,g(w^{\prime
    }))\in \mathcal {F} for all w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} with w \neq w^{\prime
    } . Observe also that if (w,\mathbf {y})\in \mathcal {F} for some w\in \mathcal
    {W} , \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {S} , then \mathbf {y} = g(w^{\prime }) for some
    w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} . Therefore, (w,\mathbf {y})\in \mathcal {F} if and
    only if \mathbf {y} = g(w^{\prime }) for some w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} such
    that w \neq w^{\prime } , from which, (75) follows, since \pi (w) = g(w) from
    (74). Then, (76) follows from (66), whereas (77) is from (68) and that (w, \mathbf
    {y})\in \mathcal {F}\cup \mathcal {R} for all w\in \mathcal {W} , \mathbf {y}\in
    \mathcal {S} with w \neq h(\mathbf {y}, q) . Hence, (62) has a solution. Lastly,
    we note that (63) is in NP since a nondeterministic algorithm need only guess
    a (g,h) pair and check in polynomial time whether (63) is satisfied. Hence, deciding
    whether there exist encoding/decoding functions whose average semantic error is
    below a threshold is NP-complete. It then follows that finding the semantic-error
    minimizing encoder/decoder is NP-hard. Appendix B Proof of Proposition 2 We first

  limitations: The paper assumes the words observed by the encoder are independent
    of the agent's true nature, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios.
    Additionally, it does not consider the impact of channel coding on the semantic
    communication problem, which is widely used in practice.

  title: The Semantic Communication Game
  verbatim_quote1: This paper proposes a communication framework where meanings of
    transmitted codewords over a noisy channel are explicitly taken into account.
    Furthermore, such communication takes place in the presence of an external entity,
    i.e., an agent, that can influence the receiver. The agent may be adversarial
    or helpful, and its true nature is unknown to the communicating parties.
  verbatim_quote2: We characterize the optimal transmission policies to minimize the
    end-to-end average semantic error, that we define as the expected error between
    meanings of intended and recovered messages, under the uncertainty of agent’s
    true intentions.

  analysis: 'Body Acoustics provides useful information about organ and mechanism
    activities.

    This information can be captured by non-invasive monitoring methods involving
    recording acoustic signals, such as phonocardiography (PCG), vibrocardiography
    (VCG), motion cardiography (MCG), and mechanocardiography (MCG), that can be analyzed
    using signal processing and machine learning methods.

    In this review, we present these diagnostic and monitoring methods that are being
    developed based on body acoustics for different types of medical conditions, including
    cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous system disorders.'

    based on body acoustics to investigate a wide range of medical conditions, including\
    \ cardiovascular\ndiseases, respiratory problems, nervous system disorders, and\

    \ Introduction\nHuman body organs and mechanisms generate acoustic signals, including\
    \ sounds\nand vibrations, that propagate through the surrounding tissues and reach\
    \ the body surface.\nOn the body surface, these signals can be measured and monitored\
    \ noninvasively by\nacoustic sensors such as microphones, accelerometers, and\
    \ gyroscopes. They can contain\ninformation about the normal or abnormal activity\
    \ of their sources, i.e., the organs or\nmechanisms that generated them. For instance,\
    \ cardiovascular or respiratory-induced\nsounds can be monitored using a stethoscope\
    \ on the chest’s surface [1]. Any cardiovascular\nor respiratory abnormalities\
    \ may alter these sounds on the chest, e.g., by changing the\nsound signals at\
    \ their origin or the material properties of the tissues that the signals pass\n\
    through. The variations of these signals can be investigated in order to detect\
    \ and identify\nthe abnormality (Figure 1). Advancements in wearables and sensing\
    \ technology, coupled\nwith the developments in computing, signal processing,\
    \ and machine learning methods\nhave enabled the long-term, real-time measurement\
    \ and analysis of these signals even\noutside of healthcare facilities, which\
    \ may result in the earlier diagnosis of diseases and the\ntimely referral of\
    \ the patients to their caregivers.\nThis paper reviews the diagnosis and monitoring\

    \ Diseases\nOne in every four Americans dies due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)\
    \ every year,\nwhich makes CVDs the leading cause of death in the United States\
    \ [2]. The earlier detection\nof the potential signs of the disease would make\
    \ early treatments possible, and may prevent\nsubsequent cardiovascular complications\
    \ [3]. Despite many efforts, the development of\nnovel robust diagnosis methods\
    \ is still an urgent need for the earlier detection of many types\nof CVDs. This\
    \ may become possible through the more-frequent evaluation of the patient’s\n\
    status, for example, by low-cost user-friendly remote monitoring methods that\
    \ can be used\noutside of the healthcare facilities. The current commercial remote\
    \ monitoring devices\nare mainly based on electrocardiography (ECG). However,\
    \ some CVDs such as structural\nabnormalities in heart valves may not be clearly\
    \ seen in the ECG signal because they do\nnot change the electrical depolarization\
    \ of the myocardium [4]. In the research setting,\nother methods such as cardiovascular-induced\
    \ sounds and vibrations on the chest’s surface\nhave been also widely investigated\
    \ [5–7]. These signals provide information about the\nmechanical aspects of cardiovascular\
    \ activity, and thus may contain diagnostic information\nthat is complementary\
    \ to the existing methods such as ECG.\nAfter these signals are measured using\
    \ the sensing systems, they are usually analyzed\nusing feature extraction and\
    \ machine learning methods to classify them into healthy and\ndiseased groups.\
    \ For example, the temporal and spectral contents of cardiovascular sounds\nBioengineering\
    \ 2022, 9, 149\n3 of 17\nhave been explored by methods such as wavelet transform,\
    \ power spectral density, and\nmel-frequency cepstrum [8–11]. The extraction of\
    \ the time and frequency features of the\nheart vibrations has been performed\
    \ through short-time Fourier transformation, wavelet\ntransformation, Wigner-Ville\
    \ distribution, and polynomial chirplet transformation [12–15].\nThe acoustic\
    \ signals can be also decomposed into their components using methods such\nas\
    \ ensemble empirical mode decomposition and variational mode decomposition [16,17].\n\
    Additional features can be extracted from the resulting modes, or these modes\
    \ can serve\nas signal features themselves. These decomposition methods can also\
    \ assist with signal\nﬁltration by excluding the modes which are believed to be\
    \ related to noise. Furthermore,\nsome studies have suggested that the inclusion\
    \ of respiration information would organize\nthe signal features into separate\
    \ groups that could lead to the more accurate classiﬁcation\nof heart vibrations\
    \ into normal and abnormal groups [18–23]. Throughout the different\nphases of\
    \ the respiration cycle, there is variation in the temporal and spectral characteristics\n\
    of heart-induced vibrations. For example, after segmenting vibration signals into\
    \ smaller\nsegments where each one represents one cardiac cycle, the segments\
    \ that occur during\nthe high-lung-volume phase are different from those during\
    \ the low-lung-volume phase\nin both the time and frequency domains. This suggests\
    \ that breaking the heart vibration\nsignals into two different groups based on\
    \ the respiration cycle information can result in a\nbetter signal characterization\
    \ [19]. Other popular signal processing and analysis methods\nof the cardiovascular-induced\
    \ sound and vibration signals have been reviewed in previous\nwork [5,6,24–26].\n\
    In recent studies, cardiovascular vibrations played a vital role in the development\
    \ of\nmethods for the monitoring of cardiovascular activity and the early detection\
    \ of irregulari-\nties. The axial and torsional components of these vibrations\
    \ may be recorded noninvasively\non the chest surface using sensing systems that\
    \ include accelerometers and gyroscopes.\nThese axial and torsional vibrations\
    \ are called seismocardiograms (SCG) [27,28] and gy-\nrocardiograms (GCG) [29,30],\
    \ respectively. These precordial vibrations are generated by\ncardiac movements\
    \ such as heart contraction, the opening and closure of the heart valves,\nand\
    \ blood ﬂow momentum and turbulence [5,6]. SCG and GCG signals can be measured\n\
    from different locations on the chest. Some of the common measurement locations\
    \ include\nthe sternum, the right upper sternal border, and over the heart apex\
    \ [5]. Other popu-\nlar vibration-based cardiovascular activity monitoring methods\
    \ include ballistocardiogra-\nphy [31,32], vibrocardiography [33], kinocardiography\
    \ [34], and mechanocardiography [35].\nThese noninvasive cardiac-health monitoring\
    \ methods have a duality in their applications;\nspeciﬁcally, they have use in\
    \ a clinical setting as well as in the home.\nCardiac vibration signals can provide\
    \ information about the heart rate and cardiac\ncycle duration. Each cardiac cycle\
    \ is composed of two main segments: the systolic and\ndiastolic phases. In one\
    \ cycle, the systolic portion is usually shorter than the diastolic\nportion [36].\
    \ In addition, the duration of the cardiac cycle depends on the respiration\n\
    phase in which the cardiac cycle occurred [22]. The variations in the heart rate\
    \ can be\nmeasured from the cardiac cycle duration, which can be determined by\
    \ heart vibration\nsignals [22,37,38]. These variations are known as predictive\
    \ factors of different CVDs, such\nas sudden cardiac death [39]. Furthermore,\
    \ the temporal features of the heart activities\nsuch as cardiac time intervals\
    \ and ﬁducial points (e.g., the opening and closure time of the\ncardiac valves)\
    \ can be also determined and analyzed using heart vibration signals [40–42].\n\
    These measurements assist in providing insight into the functions of the heart.\
    \ For example,\na recent study estimated the cardiac time intervals from impedance\
    \ cardiography, PCG,\nand SCG [43]. The estimations of each method were compared\
    \ with the gold standard\nvalues that were measured by multimodal echocardiography.\
    \ The results suggested that\nSCG had a signiﬁcantly higher accuracy than the\
    \ other methods for the estimation of the\npre-ejection period and the total systolic\
    \ time.\nCardiovascular vibrations assisted in the diagnosis and monitoring of\
    \ different clinical\nconditions. Earlier studies have been conducted to measure\
    \ the heart motion of anes-\nthetized pigs during surgery using a three-axis accelerometer\
    \ [44]. The accelerometer\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n4 of 17\noutput was ﬁltered\
    \ at 1 Hz in order to retain the movements due to the heart beating and\nremove\
    \ the low-frequency respiration vibrations. The results suggested that accelerome-\n\
    ters could locate irregular patterns that may indicate heart circulation failure—a\
    \ sign of\nnumerous CVDs. In another early study on human subjects, the functioning\
    \ of the left\nventricle has been observed through signals derived from SCG in\
    \ order to detect myocardial\nischemia [45]. Alterations in cardiac muscle contractions\
    \ were noted and analyzed. The\nﬁndings were conclusive enough to be used to diagnose\
    \ patients with ischemia. More\nrecent studies have used cardiac vibrations to\
    \ diagnose medical conditions such as heart\nfailure [46,47], coronary artery\
    \ disease (CAD) [48], valvular disease [49], ischemia [50],\natrial ﬁbrillation\
    \ [50–52], atrial ﬂutter [53], aortic stenosis [54,55], and myocardial infarc-\n\
    tion [56]. Further uses of left ventricular monitoring using SCG have been also\
    \ proposed in\nareas such as cancer patients’ cardiotoxicity assessments [57].\n\
    Auscultation has also been used to monitor cardiac health and activity for many\n\
    years. Phonocardiography (PCG) is another common technique to record cardiovascular\n\
    acoustics using a traditional or digital stethoscope [10,26]. In addition to normal\
    \ heart\nsounds (S1 and S2), a PCG signal may contain components that indicate\
    \ pathological\nconditions. For example, the presence of a third heart sound,\
    \ S3, which occurs right after\nS2, can be a sign of congestive cardiac failure\
    \ [58]. Figure 2 shows ﬁve sample normal\nand abnormal PCG signals. The presence\
    \ of a cardiovascular abnormality or malfunction\nsuch as an aneurysm or stenosis\
    \ may create turbulence in the downstream blood ﬂow in a\nvessel [59,60]. The\
    \ turbulent ﬂow generates sounds in speciﬁc frequency bands (depending\non the\
    \ morphology and severity of the abnormality) that transmit to the vessel wall,\
    \ then\nto the surrounding tissues, and eventually to the body surface. These\
    \ variations may\nthen be analyzed using signal processing and machine learning\
    \ methods to detect the\nabnormality. For example, CAD is caused by large amounts\
    \ of plaque deposit buildup in\nthe coronary arteries, which limits blood ﬂow.\
    \ Currently, the most accurate way to test for\nCAD is coronary angiography, which\
    \ is both invasive and expensive. Non-invasive ways\nto detect CAD include low-cost\
    \ methods that are based on the non-invasive measurement\nof heart sounds using\
    \ digital stethoscopes [61]. In order to diagnose CAD, one study\nobtained the\
    \ diastolic sound segments by stethoscope in CAD patients and analyzed them\n\
    using a multivariate classiﬁer [61,62]. Subtle differences were noted between\
    \ the diastolic\nsound from healthy individuals and patients with CAD, which suggested\
    \ that a digital\nstethoscope has potential for noninvasive CAD diagnosis.\nComputational\
    \ ﬂuid dynamics and post-processing numerical techniques are other ef-\nfective,\
    \ noninvasive approaches to analyze the sounds emitted from the human body [63,64].\n\
    Acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations have been recognized as the primary ﬂow-induced\
    \ source of\nthe sound through arteries and lung airways. These pressure ﬂuctuations\
    \ can be further\nexcited by blood ﬂow turbulence due to medical conditions such\
    \ as stenosis and aneurysm.\nThe pressure ﬂuctuations are correlated with highly\
    \ turbulent shear stresses and vibration\non the internal arterial wall leading\
    \ to the structural response of the surrounding tissue.\nComputational ﬂuid dynamics\
    \ simulations can investigate the sounds coming from highly\nturbulent ﬂuctuating\
    \ ﬂow through the arteries, and explain the mechanisms of the clinical\nobservations.\
    \ This provides information that can help predict a variety of cardiovascular\n\
    diseases [59,60]. In the past studies, vessel wall shear stress and pressure were\
    \ used as\nindicators of an unhealthy artery with a high potential risk of complications\
    \ leading to\nabnormal sound signals propagated through the tissue [65–70]. In\
    \ these studies, adverse\nhemodynamic conditions at critical times during a heart\
    \ cycle were investigated to ﬁnd\nthe correlation of transient pressure ﬂuctuations\
    \ due to highly turbulent kinetic energy\nwith structural vibrations and stresses\
    \ associated with elevated risk of hemolysis, platelet\nactivation, and potential\
    \ development of thrombosis. It was concluded that the highest tur-\nbulent stresses\
    \ through an unhealthy artery can be 4–14% higher than the stresses through\n\
    a healthy artery at peak systole. Moreover, the results from the pressure ﬂuctuations\

    \ the time-varying ﬂow ﬁeld into spatial\nand temporal parts through proper orthogonal\
    \ decomposition (POD) can also help provide\ninsights into the acoustic sources\
    \ in the ﬂow [59,60]. The decomposed time-varying ﬂow\ncan be reconstructed to\
    \ describe the modes of coherent ﬂow structures as sound sources\nand the time\
    \ evolution of these modes. Additionally, POD analysis followed by a frequency-\n\
    based temporal ﬁltering method can visualize the coherent structures at speciﬁc\
    \ frequencies\nto provide useful information on the localization of sound sources\
    \ with maximum sound\npressure levels through unhealthy systems. Additional information\
    \ on the process of\nthe POD method can be found in [59,60]. It should be noted\
    \ that the importance of the\naccurate post-processing of CFD results with state-of-the-art\
    \ methods such as the POD has\nbeen highlighted in previous studies. For example,\
    \ it is suggested that POD can recon-\nstruct features of complex recirculating\
    \ ﬂows through small vessels [71], while the spatial\nresolution of 4D-ﬂow MRI\
    \ is not sufﬁcient to resolve these ﬂow features accurately [72].\nPOD has also\
    \ been used to study the ﬂow through mechanical aortic valves [73], cerebral\n\
    aneurysm [74,75], and coronary arteries [76].\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n6\
    \ of 17\n3. Respiratory Illnesses\nFor centuries, simple and low-cost acoustic\
    \ procedures such as auscultation, percus-\nsion, and tactile fremitus have allowed\
    \ physicians to evaluate and address respiratory\nsystem diseases [77,78]. With\
    \ advances in sensing technologies and the aid of advanced\nsignal processing\
    \ techniques, the more reliable feature extraction and classiﬁcation of the\n\
    respiratory sounds and vibrations have been developed, leading to a better understanding\n\
    of both normal and abnormal lung acoustics. In order to classify signals that\
    \ differentiate\ndisease from health in a person, efﬁcient feature extraction\
    \ is needed. Different meth-\nods have been employed to properly extract features\
    \ from lung sounds and vibrations in\nthe time, frequency, and time–frequency\
    \ domains. Examples of these would be Fourier\ntransformation, mel-frequency cepstrum,\
    \ wavelet transformation, and Hilbert–Huang\ntransformation [77].\nVarious locations\
    \ on the body produce respiratory sounds which need different mea-\nsurement techniques\
    \ and devices. For example, airway impedance is measured from the\nlips [79].\
    \ In other applications, respiratory acoustics would be recorded from the neck\
    \ or\nchest surface. When the signals are measured on the neck (e.g., at the suprasternal\
    \ notch\nover the extrathoracic trachea), they present larger amplitudes than\
    \ recordings from the\nchest [80–82]. Measurements from the neck cover frequencies\
    \ from 80 Hz to 1500 Hz, which\nincludes the frequency range of many diseases\
    \ (Table 1). In general, the frequency range\nof interest for the analysis of\
    \ lung sounds is 100–2000 Hz. Because the chest behaves as a\nlow-pass ﬁlter,\
    \ it hinders higher-frequency components [77]. The frequency components\nbelow\
    \ 100 Hz are also usually eliminated in order to remove the acoustic signals from\
    \ other\nsources such as the heart, muscles, and electrical inference.\nTable\

    \ pulmonary disorder\n233–311 [85]\nPneumothorax\n400–600 [86]\nAcoustic signals\
    \ have been used to study the respiratory system in health and disease.\nFor example,\
    \ vibration response imaging (VRI) revealed variations in respiratory-induced\n\
    vibrations between smoker and non-smoker individuals in healthy asymptomatic sub-\n\
    jects [87]. VRI is a 2D grayscale imaging technique that measures respiratory\
    \ acoustic\nvariations using an array of piezo-acoustic sensors on the body’s\
    \ surface [88]. Further-\nmore, a wide range of acoustic-based methods have been\
    \ investigated and developed to\ndetect respiratory conditions including asthma\
    \ [1,89–94], obstructive sleep apnea [95–97],\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disorder\
    \ [1,93,98–101], tracheal stenosis [102], pneumoth-\norax [86,103–105], pneumonia\
    \ [1,106–108], pleural effusion [109], cystic ﬁbrosis [110,111],\nand COVID-19\
    \ [112,113]. Some of these methods and medical conditions will be discussed\n\
    in more detail in the rest of this section.\nSpirometry is currently one of the\
    \ most common procedures which is performed to\nevaluate pulmonary function [114].\
    \ This test utilizes sound waves that come from the\npatient’s breathing patterns\
    \ to diagnose respiratory diseases. During this procedure, the\npatient breathes\
    \ deeply and slowly into a mouthpiece that is connected to a spirometer. This\n\
    technique, however, can be limited by the patient’s ability to perform the test\
    \ accurately,\nmaking it increasingly difﬁcult for elderly people and younger\
    \ children [77].\nDue to these limitations, there have been alternative methods\
    \ to diagnose children\nwith pulmonary medical conditions such as asthma. For\
    \ example, the forced oscillation\ntechnique uses tidal breathing, which requires\
    \ little effort from children. This technique\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n7\
    \ of 17\nrequires subjects to be in a seated position with straight backs and\
    \ neutral or extended\nneck positioning [115]. In addition to the subject’s positioning,\
    \ the cheeks and ﬂoor of\nthe mouth should be supported by another person or physician.\
    \ The forced oscillation\ntechnique is commonly tested using a mouthpiece that\
    \ features a bacterial ﬁlter and a nose\nclip-on. In order to detect asthma using\
    \ this technique, the system analyzes the relationship\nbetween the airﬂow and\
    \ airway pressure from a respiration cycle (respiratory resistance\nand reactance).\
    \ Another way to use bioacoustics to diagnose respiratory diseases is the use\n\
    of tracheal sounds [102], which can be proven in people who suffer from obstructive\
    \ sleep\napnea [116]. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing\
    \ is disrupted for\nlonger than ten seconds and at least ﬁve times per hour throughout\
    \ a single sleep period.\nIn this case, the tracheal sounds come from the surface\
    \ vibrations on the suprasternal\nnotch. Acoustic-based sensors are able to track\
    \ the pressure changes produced by the mass,\nelastance, and resistance of the\
    \ trachea [116]. These sensors are inserted into a protective\nplastic chamber\
    \ with a deep cuff. This creates an airtight space between the transducer\nand\
    \ the skin. Adhesive tape is also usually used to keep the sensor placed right\
    \ above the\nsuprasternal notch and ensure a good sensor–skin coupling.\nSleep\
    \ apnea is deﬁned as a condition where the airﬂow is reduced by more than 90%\n\
    for more than 10 s in an adult subject [117]. Different airﬂow techniques have\
    \ been used for\nthe diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in sleep laboratories\
    \ and clinics [118–120]. These\ntechniques included respiratory inductance plethysmography,\
    \ oronasal thermal airﬂow\nmeasurements, and nasal pressure measurements. One\
    \ study assessed the effectiveness\nof tracheal sound measurements in the detection\
    \ of apnea [118]. The results suggested\nthat tracheal sound measurements are\
    \ efﬁcient and reliable enough to accurately pick up\nand provide a noninvasive\
    \ way to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea. Furthermore, the\ntracheal sound signals\
    \ could detect apnea on occasions when it was missed by the other\ndiagnostic\
    \ techniques (Figure 3). Because apnea affects the oxygen delivery to different\n\
    organs, it causes a muscle metabolic reﬂex, which in turn affects the blood pressure\
    \ and\ncardiac contraction [119]. Based on this, it is suggested that maximum\
    \ expiratory apnea\nincreases the kinetic energy of the heart, which can be measured\
    \ using cardiac vibration\nsignals such as SCG and BCG [120].\nBioengineering\

    \ begun to explore alternative approaches, one of which is VRI [93].\nThis technology\
    \ focuses on lung function by recognizing the relationship between the gas\nﬂow\
    \ in the lungs and the vibration energy. This process requires patients to be\
    \ seated facing\nthe VRI machine with multiple sensors placed on the back while\
    \ respiratory cycles are\nrecorded [77]. The placement of sensors varies from\
    \ study to study [123]. For example, one\nstudy used two V-array sensors placed\
    \ on the back, 1.5 cm above the mesoscapula [124].\nThey were positioned in parallel\
    \ from right to left, with 5 cm allocated for a spin on the\ntwo sides. There\
    \ were three to ﬁve, 12-s cycles of natural breathing that were recorded for\n\
    the acquisition of data. After testing 62 subjects, the drastic change (p < 0.001)\
    \ in the VRI\nimages before and after treatment proved that this new VRI technology\
    \ was successful in\nthe evaluation of curative effects for pneumonia.\nChronic\
    \ obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of illnesses with the poten-\n\
    tial to block airﬂow and create problems related to the ability to breathe [125].\
    \ It is currently\nthe third leading cause of death in the world [126]. One way\
    \ to diagnose COPD is using a\nstethoscope, the accuracy of which relies on there\
    \ being no human error in the dissection\nof the auscultations [1]. Newly developed\
    \ digital stethoscope increase the reliability in\ndiagnosis substantially [77].\
    \ By combing the conventional stethoscope with computerized\nsystems, the digital\
    \ stethoscope could produce an efﬁcient technique for the discovery of\ncommon\
    \ COPD conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis [127,128]. Other\n\
    studies have been carried out to test the accuracy of digital stethoscopes in\
    \ the diagno-\nsis of various respiratory illnesses [129]. However, these devices\
    \ may also capture the\nsurrounding noise signals, which should be carefully removed\
    \ [130].\nIn addition to the assessment of respiration acoustics using sensing\
    \ systems, numerical\nmodels have been used to investigate the sound transmission\
    \ and vibration propagation\nwithin the respiratory system [131]. Clinical investigations\
    \ of ﬂow through the lung airways\nare challenging because of the complex geometry\
    \ of lung airways, the transient nature\nof the airﬂow during the respiration\
    \ cycle, and difﬁculties in locating small obstructions\ninduced by the chronic\
    \ pulmonary diseases in the medical images [132,133]. Numerical\nmodels can provide\
    \ a comprehensive analysis of ﬂow, which can potentially help explain\nairﬂow\
    \ complications and support medical decision-making. This detailed information\n\
    may not, however, be obtained with in-vivo measurements. For example, Hu et al.\
    \ [132]\ndemonstrated an innovative noninvasive diagnostic method using computational\
    \ mod-\neling and neural network techniques to localize the small obstructions\
    \ in the peripheral\nlung based on the ﬂow velocity contour shifts. In another\
    \ study, the effects of different\nseverity levels of upper airway deformation\
    \ on the airﬂow structure were studied nu-\nmerically in order to show the existence\
    \ of turbulence ﬂow and an increase in the ﬂow\nﬂuctuations [134]. Although these\
    \ numerical models can provide detailed information on\nrespiratory ﬂow, they\
    \ are computationally expensive and usually require a few hours or\ndays of processing\
    \ time.\n4. Other Diseases\nBiomedical acoustics have been also used to develop\
    \ monitoring methods for other\nmedical conditions. For instance, the digestive\
    \ system generates sounds and vibrations that\ncan be used for diagnosis purposes.\
    \ Bowel sounds can be categorized into four typical types\nbased on their waveform\
    \ and frequency content [135]. These include single burst, multiple\nbursts, continuous\
    \ random sound, and harmonic sound types (Figure 4). Alternatively,\nconsidering\
    \ time-frequency features, abdominal sounds and vibrations can be classiﬁed\n\
    into two groups of intestinal bursts and regularly sustained sounds (short and\
    \ long duration\nsounds, respectively) as well as three sets of interfering noise,\
    \ including respiration, snoring,\nand motion-related noise sets [136,137]. Table\
    \ 2 lists the time and frequency signatures of\ndifferent types of bowel sounds.\
    \ Although some studies suggest that bowel sounds do\nBioengineering 2022, 9,\
    \ 149\n9 of 17\nnot provide clinically relevant information [138], other studies\
    \ have used the noninvasive\nmonitoring and analysis of stomach and bowel sounds\
    \ for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal\ntract diseases. These medical conditions\
    \ include abdominal conditions such as appendicitis,\nintestinal obstruction,\
    \ irritable bowel syndrome, inﬂammatory bowel disease, pyloric\nstenosis, postoperative\
    \ ileus, and cholecystitis [139–146]. Despite respiratory and cardiac\nacoustics,\
    \ the monitoring of gastrointestinal acoustics usually requires continuous data\n\
    acquisition of several minutes, as gastrointestinal sounds do not occur frequently\
    \ [147].\nyp\nq\ny\n[\n]\ng\n,\nmultiple bursts, continuous random sound, and\

    \ also used to monitor the conditions of patients with nervous\ndisorders such\
    \ as Parkinson’s disease [148,149] and multiple sclerosis [150]. For exam-\nple,\
    \ accelerometers can evaluate the movement data of patients with multiple sclerosis,\
    \ a\nchronic neurological disease. These data can be then used to assess the daily\
    \ activities of\nthe patients and provide clinical feedback in order to manage\
    \ the symptoms of multiple\nsclerosis [150]. Tremor is the involuntary and rhythmic\
    \ oscillatory movements of a body\npart, and is a symptom of many disorders, including\
    \ cerebellar disease, peripheral neu-\nropathy, orthostatic tremor, and Parkinson’s\
    \ disease [151]. The frequency of the tremor\ncan range between 3 Hz (slow) and\
    \ 12 Hz (rapid). These frequencies and the amplitude\nof the tremor can be continuously\
    \ monitored using wearable accelerometers in order to\nevaluate the severity of\
    \ the disease [152]. Other studies have used acoustic signals for\nthe non-invasive\
    \ diagnosis and monitoring of other medical conditions, including voice\ndisorders\
    \ (e.g., phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction) [153,154], dysphagia [155–157], fetal\n\
    health and development [158], and cartilage-based conditions such as osteoarthritis\
    \ and\nchondromalacia [159,160].\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n10 of 17\n5. Conclusions\
    \ and Future Directions\nAdvances in the development of lighter, cheaper, and\
    \ more sensitive and accurate\nsensors have resulted in a resurgence in research\
    \ on body acoustics for the non-invasive\ndiagnosis of different medical conditions.\
    \ In addition, the recent improvements in com-\nputational resources have made\
    \ the real-time continuous monitoring of the patients a\nreality inside and outside\
    \ of clinical settings [31,161,162]. These developments can lead\nto the formation\
    \ of large databases of body acoustics. The analysis of this big data using\n\
    methods such as deep learning may provide a better understanding of the body acoustics,\n\
    and may establish novel non-invasive diagnosis methods. These signals may also\
    \ provide\ncomplementary information to other monitoring methods. For example,\
    \ while an ECG test\nassesses the electrical activity of the heart, acoustic signals\
    \ such as sounds and vibrations\ncan provide a more in-depth understanding of\
    \ the mechanical activity of the cardiovascular\nsystem. This complementary information\
    \ can lead to the detection of early signs of CVDs.\nAcoustic signals may also\
    \ assist in the non-invasive localization of the abnormalities\ninside the body\
    \ [163]. Simultaneous measurements of acoustic signals from multiple\nlocations\
    \ on the body surface using sensor arrays can provide information on the 3D\n\
    location of the acoustic source (e.g., cardiovascular diseases or lung pathologies).\
    \ For\nexample, the location of heart valves may be estimated by the analysis\
    \ of the outputs of a\nmicrophone array [106,164].\nDespite the many studies on\
    \ the utility of acoustic signals for medical diagnosis, there\nare still open\
    \ questions and challenges that hinder the transformation of these research\n\
    studies into commercial products. One of the challenges in the use of acoustic\
    \ signals\nfor medical diagnosis is the presence of different noise sets in the\
    \ signal of interest. The\nacoustic signals that are recorded on the body’s surface\
    \ consist of sounds and vibrations\nfrom other sources that are not of interest.\
    \ For example, a fetal PCG is a mixture of acoustic\nsignals from the fetus, different\
    \ organs of the mother, and other external noises [158]. In\naddition, any fetal\
    \ movements can add an artifact to the fetal PCG. On the other hand,\nthe acoustic\
    \ signals recorded from a pregnant woman are contaminated by signals that\noriginated\
    \ from the fetus. Robust noise ﬁltration methods should be established in order\
    \ to\nisolate the signals of interest from noise.\nAnother challenge is that the\
    \ temporal and spectral contents of the acoustic signals\ndepend strongly on the\
    \ acquisition location. For example, heart-induced vibrations on\nthe chest’s\
    \ surface may change by 30% with a sensor location change of 1 cm [5]. Other\n\
    parameters such as the postural position and transmission medium (e.g., the amount\
    \ of\nsoft tissue between the signal source and the sensor) also affect the contents\
    \ of the acoustic\nsignals. In addition, these signals usually change from one\
    \ subject to another. Therefore,\nthe analysis methods should be developed such\
    \ that they are robust, inclusive, and accurate\nunder different conditions.\n\
    In conclusion, the utilization of new generations of sensing technologies in com-\n\
    bination with signal processing methods and rigorous experiments to understand\
    \ the\nphysiological genesis of the acoustic signals may translate them from a\
    \ research interest to\na powerful tool for the diagnosis of medical conditions.\n\

  analysis: 'The paper focuses on exploring strategies to develop automated systems
    for real-time irrigation management, primarily with a focus on data most applicable
    to irrigation management and their typical sources. It particularly emphasizes
    bulk water as a test case for developing robust models for bespoke molecular systems.
    Although training strategies found to work well in elemental materials were employed
    initially, these were found to be detrimental to the stability of potentials for
    more complex molecular environments. Even with a high correlation on energies
    in unseen test data, some potentials were not stable for more than a few femtoseconds.
    The paper notes that it is essential to consider the retrospective validation
    strategy ultimately limits the applicability of these models.


    The paper outlines a prospective error metric to develop robust models for gas-phase
    and condensed-phase molecular systems. This error metric is based on the time
    required for the cumulative error to reach a given threshold (ET), with a larger
    sacc indicating a more robust potential. The authors argue that testing data should
    follow the splitting of a dataset into training and test sets. They suggest that
    randomly placing water molecules does not, in itself, afford a stable potential
    and that a smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor is essential to account
    for atomic environments. It is also suggested that selecting frames from classical
    molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures of 100-1000 K is not an effective
    strategy to generate training data.


    The paper demonstrates that data decomposition by treating intra- and inter-molecular
    components separately, using two separate GAP models that are then added to give
    the combined prediction for energies, provides a potential that is stable for
    picoseconds. The authors also demonstrate that training a potential on random
    points in the full 3D PES, rather than using an evenly spaced grid, allows for
    the evaluation of error over the full PES. Using an acceptable error of 0.2 kcal
    mol^-1 per H2O molecule for a description of bulk water, they find that this potential
    affords sacc > 10 ps with just a few hundred ground truth evaluations. This is
    comparable to the sacc value of 7.6 ± 0.7 ps obtained for a fully reactive water
    neural network (NN) trained on ≈7000 reference configurations.'

    \ ﬁelds†\nTom A. Young,\na Tristan Johnston-Wood,\na Volker L. Deringer\n*b\n\
    and Fernanda Duarte\n*a\nPredictive molecular simulations require fast, accurate\
    \ and reactive interatomic potentials. Machine\nlearning oﬀers a promising approach\
    \ to construct such potentials by ﬁtting energies and forces to high-\nlevel quantum-mechanical\
    \ data, but doing so typically requires considerable human intervention and\n\
    data volume. Here we show that, by leveraging hierarchical and active learning,\
    \ accurate Gaussian\nApproximation Potential (GAP) models can be developed for\
    \ diverse chemical systems in an autonomous\nmanner, requiring only hundreds to\
    \ a few thousand energy and gradient evaluations on a reference\npotential-energy\
    \ surface. The approach uses separate intra- and inter-molecular ﬁts and employs\n\
    a prospective error metric to assess the accuracy of the potentials. We demonstrate\
    \ applications to\na range of molecular systems with relevance to computational\
    \ organic chemistry: ranging from bulk\nsolvents, a solvated metal ion and a metallocage\
    \ onwards to chemical reactivity, including a bifurcating\nDiels–Alder reaction\
    \ in the gas phase and non-equilibrium dynamics (a model SN2 reaction) in explicit\n\
    solvent. The method provides a route to routinely generating machine-learned force\
    \ ﬁelds for reactive\nmolecular systems.\nIntroduction\nMolecular simulations\
    \ are a cornerstone in computational\nchemistry, providing dynamical insights\
    \ beyond experimental\nresolution.1 Realistic simulations of (bio)chemical reactions\n\
    require the inclusion of the chemical environment where they\noccur (e.g. solvent\
    \ and/or enzyme) and oen extended time-\nscales.\nTherefore,\ngeneration\nof\n\
    accurate\nand\neﬃcient\napproaches has been central to the development of this\
    \ eld.\nEmpirical interatomic potentials (force elds), in combina-\ntion with\
    \ molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations, have been widely used\
    \ to sample the potential-\nenergy surface (PES). However, they are limited in\
    \ accuracy\nand transferability.2 Moreover, most of these potentials are\nparameterised\
    \ for isolated entities with xed connectivity and\nthus unable to describe bond\
    \ breaking/forming processes. In\ncontrast, ab initio methods provide an accurate\
    \ description of\nthe PES, which is particularly critical for reactions in solution.\n\
    However, because of their high computational cost and unfav-\nourable scaling\
    \ behaviour, they are limited to a few hundred\natoms and simulation times of\
    \ picoseconds in ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD) at the DFT level, and practically\n\
    impossible at the computational ‘gold-standard’ [CCSD(T)].3\nMachine learning\
    \ (ML) approaches have the potential to\nrevolutionise force-eld based simulations,\
    \ aiming to provide\nthe best of both worlds,4–6 and have indeed begun to provide\n\
    new insights into a range of challenging research problems.7–16\nThe development\
    \ of an ML potential applicable to the whole\nperiodic table mapping nuclear coordinates\
    \ to total energies\nand forces is, however, precluded by the curse of dimension-\n\
    ality. Within small chemical subspaces, models can be achieved\nusing neural networks\
    \ (NNs),6,17–21 kernel-based methods such\nas the Gaussian Approximation Potential\
    \ (GAP) framework22,23\nor gradient-domain machine learning (GDML),24 and linear\n\
    tting with properly chosen basis functions,25,26 each with\ndiﬀerent data requirements\
    \ and transferability.27 GAPs have\nbeen used to study a range of elemental,28–30\
    \ multicomponent\ninorganic,31,32\ngas-phase\norganic\nmolecular,13,33\nand\n\
    more\nrecently condensed-phase systems, such as methane34 and\nphosphorus.35 These\
    \ potentials, while accurate, have required\nconsiderable\ncomputational\neﬀort\n\
    and\nhuman\noversight.\nIndeed, condensed-phase NN36,37 and GAP tting approaches\n\
    typically require several thousand reference (“ground truth”)\nevaluations.\n\
    Active learning (AL), where new training data is added based\non the current state\
    \ of the potential, has been used for gener-\nating databases and accelerating\
    \ the tting process.31,38–42\nNotable examples in materials modelling include\

    \ potentials\nbecome even more important when exploring chemical reac-\ntions\
    \ in molecular systems, which oen require a description at\na computational level\
    \ beyond DFT, and therefore require\nreference data at the same level. Very recently,\
    \ AL approaches\nhave started to be adopted for tting reactive potentials for\n\
    organic molecules based on single point evaluations at\nquantum-chemical levels\
    \ of theory. Notable examples include\nthe modelling of gas-phase pericyclic reactions,12\
    \ the explora-\ntion of reactivity during methane combustion,50 and the\ndecomposition\
    \ of urea in water.41\nIn the present work – with a view to developing potentials\
    \ to\nsimulate solution phase reactions – we consider bulk water as\na test case\
    \ and develop a strategy which requires just hundreds\nof total ground truth evaluations\
    \ and no a priori knowledge of\nthe system, apart from the molecular composition.\
    \ We show\nhow this methodology is directly transferable to diﬀerent\nchemical\
    \ systems in the gas phase as well as in implicit and\nexplicit solvent, focusing\
    \ on the applicability to a range of\nscenarios that are relevant in computational\
    \ chemistry.\nResults and discussion\nDespite GAP tting being increasingly used\
    \ for inorganic\nsystems, we found that the same tting strategies did not easily\n\
    transfer to the description of complex molecular environments.\nEven with a high\
    \ correlation and low error on energies in\nunseen test data, some potentials\
    \ were not stable for more than\na few femtoseconds. In the following section,\
    \ we therefore\noutline a training strategy along with a prospective error metric\n\
    to develop robust models for gas-phase and condensed-phase\nmolecular systems.\n\
    A prospective error metric\nThe initial step in validating supervised machine\
    \ learning (ML)\ntends to follow the splitting of a dataset into training and\
    \ test\nsets, training the model, then evaluating its performance on the\ntest\
    \ set with a squared error (RMSE/MSE) or a correlation (R2)\nmetric. As with model\
    \ overtting, this ‘retrospective’ validation\nstrategy ultimately limits the\
    \ applicability of these models.51–57\nIn an ML potential, the minimum required\
    \ domain of appli-\ncability is the region of conguration space likely to be\
    \ sampled\nduring a simulation with the potential. However, this region is\nnot\
    \ known a priori, making the choice of test data problematic if\nnot impossible\
    \ for use in a standard train/test data split\napproach. In addition, one would\
    \ also like to ensure high\naccuracy in regions sampled on the ground truth surface\n\
    (especially for early versions of an evolving potential), but being\nable to quantify\
    \ this accuracy requires dynamics at the ground\ntruth method level in the rst\
    \ place, which is much more\nexpensive than sampling with an eﬃcient potential.\n\
    Using a train/test set split with high structural similarity\nbetween the two\
    \ sets can lead to highly misleadingly accuracy\nwhenever the potential is to\
    \ be taken outside the training region\nin computational practice. For example,\
    \ splitting an AIMD\ntrajectory of water into a training and test set with an\
    \ odd/even\nframe split (50 : 50) and training a simple GAP model yields an\n\
    energy error on the order of 1 kcal mol\x011 (Fig. S1a†). However,\nsimulations\
    \ with this potential in the same conguration space\nsample unphysical congurations\
    \ within 10 fs (Fig. S1b†),\nmaking an RMSE over a priori test data an insuﬃcient\
    \ metric in\nquantifying the quality of a potential.\nConsidering that single-point\
    \ reference energy evaluations\nare reasonably cheap, a ‘prospective’ validation\
    \ scheme is\npossible, where the error metric operates in the conguration\nspace\
    \ sampled in a simulation. With this in mind, we propose\na temporal cumulative\
    \ error metric (sacc, eqn (1)), dened as the\ntime required for the cumulative\
    \ error (absolute diﬀerence\nbetween true (E0) and predicted (EGAP)) to exceed\
    \ a given\nthreshold (ET); the larger sacc, the more robust the potential.\nNote\
    \ that the time for which a potential is stable in MD can far\nexceed sacc, as\
    \ shown in the following. Here only errors above\na lower-bound threshold value\
    \ (El) contribute to the cumulative\nerror. The lower threshold is required to\
    \ account for the\nresidual error that is due to the nite radial cut-oﬀ of the\
    \ model.\nIn the following we take ET to be 10 times El, but it may be\nadjusted\
    \ depending on the simulation context.\nsacc ¼ time : ET\\\nX\ni˛frames\nmax\n\
    \x02\x03\x03E0\ni \x01 EGAP\ni\n\x03\x03 \x01 El; 0\n\x04\n(1)\nThis metric has\
    \ several advantages in that (a) it ensures that\na potential with high accuracy\
    \ will result in stable dynamics; (b)\nit allows the user to specify the level\
    \ of accepted error according\nto the quality of the training method, thus not\
    \ penalising where\nthe error is within the diﬀerence between the ground truth\
    \ and\nthe true PES (i.e. a larger threshold may be suitable for a less\naccurate\
    \ reference method); (c) it penalises large errors, even if\nthey only occur for\
    \ single congurations, which is important as\nsuch errors may lead to instabilities\
    \ in the ML-driven MD\ntrajectory and (d) it enables a quoted accuracy to include\n\
    regions that may not be accessible to direct evaluation at the\nground-truth level\
    \ (e.g. long-time behaviour). Overall, this\nmetric depends on the lower bound\
    \ and total error, interval\nbetween evaluations, and the simulation on which\
    \ it is evalu-\nated; so while not unique, it is – crucially – prospective. We\n\
    found this metric to be essential in developing an eﬃcient\ntraining strategy\
    \ and accurate potentials for bulk water (Fig. 1).\nWater models\nFor bespoke\

    \ in\nmind, here we train GAP models to simulate bulk water, aiming\nto minimise\
    \ the number of required ground truth evaluations\nas well as the required human\
    \ intervention, while maximising\nstability (measured by sacc). A selection of\
    \ training strategies is\ndiscussed in the following paragraphs and their results\
    \ are\noutlined in Fig. 1.\nWe initially employed training strategies found to\
    \ work well\nin elemental materials by, for example, tting a combined\npotential\
    \ with two- and three-body GAPs. However, this\napproach was found to be detrimental\
    \ to the potential's\nstability. This can be understood considering a water dimer\n\
    (HO–Hc/OH2); here, a two-body description that treats the two\nO–Hc interactions\
    \ on the same footing is a poor approximation,\nin view of the diﬀerent order\
    \ of magnitude between the inter-\nactions at their respective minima (Fig. S3†).\
    \ Therefore, we\ndecided to proceed employing a smooth overlap of atomic\npositions58\
    \ (SOAP) descriptor for an exclusively many-body\ndescription of atomic environments\
    \ (with the exception of AL-\nI + I, which uses 2 + 3 body for the intramolecular\
    \ component\nas discussed later).\nWe also explored diﬀerent approaches to generate\
    \ the\ndatabase and their inuence on the generated potential. An\nemerging approach\
    \ to generate training data for elemental\nGAPs is to initialise the database\
    \ with randomised congura-\ntions (with reasonable constraints, as in ab initio\
    \ random\nstructure searching59), and to gradually explore conguration\nspace\
    \ with evolving versions of the potential (see, e.g., ref. 60).\nHowever, randomly\
    \ placing water molecules does not in itself\naﬀord a stable potential. A similar\
    \ result is observed when the\nmost diverse congurations are selected using the\
    \ CUR algo-\nrithm60,61 (Fig. S4†) or when applying intramolecular displace-\n\
    ments, following minimisation (Fig. S4†). Selecting frames from\nclassical MD\
    \ simulations at temperatures of 100–1000 K was\nalso found to be an ineﬀective\
    \ strategy (Fig. S5†), reaching sacc\nof only a few fs (“MM-MD”, Fig. 1c). This\
    \ is in line with the\nresults reported in ref. 13. Note that this is not because\
    \ the GAP\ncannot t reference energies and forces from MM congura-\ntions (Fig.\
    \ S6†), but because of a poor conguration space\noverlap with the ground truth\
    \ PES (Fig. S7†). Selecting cong-\nurations from an AIMD simulation at 300 K\
    \ (AIMD, Fig. 1c) was\nan improvement over training on random and MM-generated\n\
    congurations, with sacc \x03 10 fs. However, by adding addi-\ntional AIMD congurations\
    \ the increase in accuracy saturates\nquickly even if those are obtained at higher\
    \ temperatures\n(Fig.\nS8†).\nUsing\nAIMD\ncongurations\ncan\nalso\ninvolve\n\

    \ at\na third of the required reference data.\nOnly when the relevant length and\

    components separately (Fig. 1b) a potential that is stable for\npicoseconds is\
    \ obtained (AL-I + I, Fig. 1c). We note that this\napproach is related to the\
    \ hierarchical tting of GAPs34,63 and\nrelated ML models33,64–66 using diﬀerent\
    \ levels of computational\napproaches, and the decomposition strategy by Wengert\
    \ and co-\nworkers.67 In the present work, we employ the same ground-\ntruth method\
    \ throughout rather than combining diﬀerent\nlevels of theory for the input data,\
    \ but as in prior studies we\ndescribe the stronger (e.g., covalent) and weaker\
    \ intermolecular\nterms with separate ts that are aerwards combined to give\
    \ the\nnal model. The intramolecular GAP for water contains only 2-\nand 3-body\
    \ terms and the training data are chosen using an\nevenly spaced grid over the\
    \ full 3-atom PES (8 \x04 8 \x04 8 grid\npoints in rOH and rHH, \x030.1 ˚A spacing,\
    \ Fig. S9†). Energy and\nforce evaluations of this potential are a simple sum\
    \ of intra- and\ninter-molecular terms, but require the former to be evaluated\
    \ in\nan\nexpanded\nsimulation\nbox\nto\nensure\nno\nnon-bonded\nhydrogen atoms\
    \ are present within the cut-oﬀ radius of the 2-\nand 3-body descriptors on oxygen\
    \ (Fig. S10†). Here the intra-\nmolecular PES is fairly low-dimensional, so a\
    \ full and reason-\nably dense grid is available, which in turn allows us to dene\
    \ an\nerror measure over the whole PES, where we nd the error to be\ninversely\
    \ correlated with sacc (Fig. 1d). Using an acceptable error\nof 0.2 kcal mol\x01\
    1 per H2O molecule for a description of bulk\nwater, which is similar to that\
    \ achieved in a recent NN t of\nwater,36 we nd that this potential aﬀords sacc\
    \ > 10 ps with just\na few hundred ground truth evaluations (AL-I + I, Fig. 1c).\
    \ To put\nthis value in context, we measured sacc for the fully reactive\nwater\
    \ NN of Cheng et al.,36 which was trained on \x037000 refer-\nence congurations\
    \ (DFTB energy/forces) and has shown to\nprovide a highly accurate water model\
    \ over multiple states. For\nthis state-of-the-art ML potential, a sacc value\
    \ of 7.6 \x05 0.7 ps for\nliquid at 300 K is obtained, comparable to the one obtained\
    \ for\nthe new AL-based potentials of the present work (>10 ps). Of\ncourse, direct\
    \ comparison requires caution because the two\npotentials are diﬀerent in scope:\
    \ the NN potential employs\na large reference database to develop a general water\
    \ model,\nwhereas the present study targets robust potentials for liquid\nwater\
    \ with minimal computational eﬀort, in turn allowing the\nuser to apply similar\
    \ approaches to other chemical systems (as\nwill be shown below).\nThe model tted\
    \ using our approach (AL-I + I) yields radial\ndistribution functions (RDFs) in\
    \ good agreement with the\nground-truth method, initially chosen to be DFTB, both\n\
    considering the location and intensities of the peaks corre-\nsponding to the\
    \ rst and second coordination shells (Fig. 2a–c).\nThis is despite the relatively\
    \ short-range atomic cut-oﬀs (3 ˚A, O\nonly) used. Only in the O–O pair RDF there\
    \ is a slight deviation\nfrom the DFTB ground truth, precisely where the potential\
    \ is\nzero outside the 3 ˚A cut-oﬀ radius of the SOAP descriptor.\nInterestingly,\
    \ for a DFT-quality GAP simply re-evaluating ener-\ngies and forces on DFTB-derived\
    \ active-learnt congurations is\ninsuﬃcient, with the DFTB congurations being\
    \ high in energy\nat the DFT level (\x035 eV, Fig. S11†). However, applying an\
    \ active\nlearning strategy with a PBE reference method and a slightly\nlarger\
    \ 3.5 ˚A cut-oﬀ generates excellent agreement with the AIMD\nsimulation from ref.\
    \ 62, in only a few hours of total training\ntime (Fig. 2d–f). At this level of\
    \ theory, the local structure of\nliquid water is predicted largely correctly,\
    \ with two distinct\npeaks in the O–H RDF, corresponding to rst and second\n\
    solvation shells with the largest deviation from the ground truth\nagain in the\
    \ O–O pair around the descriptor cut-oﬀ. The real\nsignicance, of course, is\
    \ in moving to more accurate ground-\ntruth methods, for which a full MD simulation\
    \ would not be\nstraightforward: indeed, using the same method, a hybrid DFT-\n\
    quality water model can be generated within a few days, which\nwould be inaccessible\
    \ with other methods (the generation of the\nGAP model required \x035 days on\
    \ 20 CPU cores, Fig. 2g–i). These\nresults suggest that the training strategy\
    \ (and hyperparameter\nselection) presented here is suitable independent of the\
    \ refer-\nence method.\nOther solvent systems\nOrganic reactions oen take place\
    \ in solvents other than water.\nUsing an identical training strategy to the one\
    \ described for\nwater, we trained GAPs for a selection of organic solvents with\n\
    various\ntypes\nof\nintermolecular\ninteractions.\nTo\nquickly\ngenerate the reference\
    \ simulation data for this proof-of-\nconcept, a DFTB ground truth is employed;\
    \ chlorinated\nsolvents were not selected due to a large discrepancy between\n\
    the DFTB-generated and experimental C–Cl bond dissociation\nenergy (Fig. S12†).\
    \ A uniform grid over the intramolecular PES is\nnow no longer possible; thus,\
    \ AL is used to develop an initial\nintramolecular potential trained using GAP-MD\
    \ at 1600 K\n(Fig. S13†). This temperature is used to sample higher-energy\ncongurations\
    \ more eﬃciently. In all cases, only hundreds of\nground truth evaluations were\
    \ necessary to generate GAPs\naﬀording stable dynamics, with sacc values on the\
    \ order of\npicoseconds (Table 1, Fig. S14, ESI Section S1†). For a repre-\nsentative\
    \ example, the computed RDFs for acetonitrile compare\nwell with the ground truth\
    \ (Fig. S15†). As with the water models\nabove, to quantitatively evaluate bulk\
    \ properties training an\naccurate reference method and the inclusion of nuclear\n\
    quantum eﬀects would be necessary.34,36 Nevertheless, this\nexample demonstrates\
    \ that the training method is applicable to\na range of chemical systems beyond\
    \ water. In this sense, the\nstrategy presented here can be considered “transferable”\
    \ as it\ncan be directly applied to obtain ML potentials for other\nchemical systems.\

    \ fragment containing one full ligand and three pyri-\ndine molecules coordinated\
    \ to a Pd2+ metal ion (68 atoms) was\nused to t a GAP for the entire cage (138\
    \ atoms) in the gas phase.\nThis potential was trained in a few days (\x031400\
    \ CPUh). We used\nthe resulting GAP to perform nanosecond MD simulations on\n\
    the whole metallocage at 300 K in the gas phase. This simula-\ntion took one day\
    \ and \x03100 CPUh to complete. For comparison,\nan equivalent AIMD simulation\
    \ would take around 50 years with\nthe reference level of theory employed here.\
    \ The exibility of the\nsystem was monitored and compared to the one obtained\
    \ using\nclassical\nMD\nsimulations\nin\ndichloromethane\nsolvent.70\nCompared\
    \ to classical MD simulations, using helicity as\na measure of exibility, our\
    \ potential describes the cage as\nbeing more rigid; this suggests that the classical\
    \ potential\noverestimates the dynamic exibility (Fig. 4). This diﬀerence is\n\
    expected as the classical potential has no C–C^C–C dihedral\nbarrier, which is\
    \ presumably correctly captured in the GAP. This\nexample illustrates the general\
    \ applicability of the approach to\nincreasingly complex systems, where the training\
    \ of a simpler\nbut representative fragment is suﬃcient to capture the relevant\n\
    features of the full system.\nReaction dynamics in gas and solvent phase\nThe\
    \ high dimensionality and ensuing exibility of ML poten-\ntials make them highly\
    \ suitable to study reaction dynamics – the\nlatter usually require many costly\
    \ electronic structure calcula-\ntions to obtain atomic-level descriptions of\
    \ reaction mecha-\nnisms, solvent eﬀects or post-transition state (TS) dynamics.71,72\n\
    In the following section, we show that our data-eﬃcient strategy\nenables accurate\
    \ reactive potentials (sacc > 100 fs) with only\na few hundreds of DFT evaluations\
    \ for a set of prototypical\norganic reactions.\nGas phase bimolecular nucleophilic\
    \ substitution. The SN2\nnucleophilic substitution reaction is fundamental in\
    \ organic\nchemistry and has been extensively studied using AIMD and\nanalytically\
    \ t PES.71,73 However, even with eﬃcient approaches\nto tting PES, AIMD methods\
    \ still require tens of thousands of\nenergy evaluations.74 Here, we generated\
    \ a reactive GAP to study\nthe reaction between chloride and methyl chloride as\
    \ a proto-\ntypical case oen employed to validate QM/MM reactions and\nfor which\
    \ extensive literature exists (see ref. 75 and references\ntherein). By initialising\
    \ active learning from the transition state\n(TS), the true intrinsic reaction\

    \ and unlike our previous attempt to generate\na DFT-quality GAP by evaluating\
    \ energies and forces on DFTB\nactive-learnt congurations, here, upliing a DFT-level\
    \ GAP\nto an accurate wavefunction-level GAP is possible. This\nmethod allows\

    \ from the TS with just 55\nenergy and (numerical) force evaluations at the CCSD(T)\
    \ level\n(Fig. 5b and S16†). The resultant GAP is considerably more\naccurate\
    \ than the underlying DFT energy prole (dashed,\nFig. 5a). Active learning can\

    This example demonstrates that with no a priori knowledge,\napart from the structure\
    \ of TS1, the topology of the bifurcating\nsurface can be revealed eﬃciently using\
    \ GAP dynamics. This\nstrategy is completely automated, requiring training of\
    \ a few\nhours to days, thus providing a promising approach to routinely\nexamine\

    \ substitution. The\nability to accurately describe bond-breaking/forming paths\
    \ in\nthe condensed-phase is crucial if this strategy is to be applied to\nincreasingly\
    \ complex processes, such as enzymatic reactions.\nTowards\nthis\ngoal,\nand\n\
    having\ngenerated\npotentials\nfor\ncondensed-phase molecular systems and gas-phase\
    \ reactions,\nwe decided to extend our active learning strategy to explicitly\n\
    solvated reactions; once again, using the SN2 reaction between\nchloride and methyl\
    \ chloride as a test case. SN2 reactions have\nbeen used as a test case for a\
    \ recent ML potential, but those\nstudies have been limited to the gas phase and\
    \ used thousands\nof training points.21 Literature examples of ML potentials to\n\
    study reactions in explicit solvent are limited. Recently, Parri-\nnello and co-workers\
    \ reported an NN potential to study urea\ndecomposition in water.41 Training a\
    \ model for the implicitly\nsolvated reaction proceeds in a similar way as for\
    \ the gas phase\nanalogue and aﬀords a surface close to the ground truth\n(Fig.\
    \ 7a).\nAdopting an identical strategy to the one employed for\ncondensed phase\
    \ systems, the intra- and inter-molecular PES\ndynamics can be propagated from\
    \ the TS and the eﬀect of\nexplicit solvation interrogated (Fig. 7b). This only\
    \ requires\nknowing a priori the gas-phase TS for the training to be\ncomplete\
    \ in explicit water. Interestingly, the behaviour in\nexplicit water (blue, Fig.\
    \ 7b) diﬀers from the implicit counter-\npart (red, Fig. 7b). This can be understood\
    \ considering that in\nimplicit solvent reorganisation is instantaneous, which\
    \ results\nin oscillations in the C–Cl bond characteristic of a gas phase\nreaction.\
    \ In contrast, the dynamics are more complex in explicit\nsolvent, with a slower\
    \ transition from the product channel.\nAdditionally, one of the 10 trajectories\
    \ re-crosses the barrier\naer 170 fs of simulation (Fig. S22†), where the solvent\
    \ has not\nreorganised to accommodate the anionic chloride yet, making\nthe path\
    \ to products shallower in energy.\nThe component-wise separation of the system\
    \ also leads to\nthe possibility of training to a more accurate ab initio surface\
    \ for\nthe gas phase reaction, in a similar way to QM/MM, but here\na ML(A)/ML(B)\
    \ partition is available where A and B are two\ndiﬀerent ground truth methods.33\
    \ Application of this kind of\nhierarchical ML potential tting will be the subject\
    \ of further\nwork.\nLimitations\nIn its current implementation, this method is\
    \ well suited for\nstudying systems of up to 50 atoms if training is expected\
    \ to be\ncompleted in a day, using a single node of 20 CPUs. For larger\nsystems,\
    \ the speed will depend on the complexity of the PES,\nwhere even using inexpensive\
    \ methods thousands of training\ncongurations and several iterations cycles may\
    \ be needed to\nlearn the diﬀerent atomic environments. In contrast, training\n\
    can be achieved eﬃciently for large systems with higher\nsymmetry, and eﬀectively\
    \ lower dimensional PES. This is the\ncase, for example, for the supramolecular\
    \ cage shown above,\nwhich contains 138 atoms and can be modelled appropriately\n\
    with a GAP that has been trained using a smaller system of only\n68 atoms (Fig.\
    \ 4). Furthermore, the current intra + intermolec-\nular decomposition remains\
    \ xed throughout the simulation\nmaking the water potential generated initially\
    \ incapable of\nauto-ionisation. Re-determining the connectivity (and therefore\n\
    re-assigning the “intra” components) every few steps during the\nsimulation might\
    \ help to address this limitation. However,\nprovided the model has been trained\
    \ in a region where\na chemical change has occurred, the molecular components\
    \ in\nthat region do not need to retain their connectivity. This is the\ncase,\
    \ for example, in the SN2 reaction shown in Fig. 7, where the\nconnectivity changes\
    \ between the two molecular units that\nconstitute the solute.\nFig. 7\nSolution-phase\

    Studying dynamic processes and the eﬀect of explicit solvation\non chemical reactions\
    \ demands a rapid method to develop\nbespoke force-eld models with high accuracy.\
    \ Here, we\ndemonstrated that within the Gaussian Approximation Poten-\ntial (GAP)\
    \ machine learning framework, accurate and robust\nmodels\ncan\nbe\ndeveloped\n\
    eﬃciently\nfor\ngas-phase\nand\ncondensed-phase molecular reactions. Our strategy\
    \ starts from\na small number of randomly selected points in the congura-\ntion\
    \ space, from which active learning training of intra- and\ninter-molecular components\
    \ of the energy and forces is carried\nout. The developed method is publicly available\
    \ (https://\ngithub.com/duartegroup/gap-train). We also dene a prospec-\ntive\
    \ error metric, which is found to be crucial in developing\nrobust active-learning-based\
    \ potentials, whereas correlation on\na predened test set is insuﬃcient to assess\
    \ the quality of such\na potential. We illustrated the generality of this approach\
    \ by\nmodelling bulk water, Zn(II) in aqueous solution, and chemical\nreactions\
    \ in the gas phase and explicit solvent, including post-\nTS cyclisation and SN2\
    \ reactions. The diversity of the examples\npresented here demonstrates the general\
    \ applicability of the\nstrategy and encourages applying this approach in the\
    \ model-\nling of more complex reactions in homogeneous and hetero-\ngeneous environments.\n\
    Methods\nAll Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAPs) were trained\nusing the\
    \ GAP and QUIP codes (singularity distribution, commit\n#66c553f) and a Smooth\
    \ Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)58\nkernel with radial cut-oﬀ values dened\
    \ in gure captions all\nwith a smoothness (satom) of 0.5 ˚A; other hyperparameters\n\
    dened in Table S1.† For a single component condensed-phase\nsystem such as water,\
    \ two GAPs were tted for the intra and\nintermolecular components, respectively,\
    \ while for the solute–\nsolvent systems, such as the SN2 reaction between chloride\
    \ and\nmethyl chloride, three GAPs were tted: one for the gas-phase\nsolute,\
    \ a second for gas-phase solvent and a third one for the\nintermolecular interactions;\
    \ see Table S2,† entry 6 for details.\nAn example of the input script required\
    \ to train a bulk water\nmodel is shown in Fig. 8. In all systems the intramolecular\
    \ water\npotential was trained at the reference level on an evenly spaced\ngrid\
    \ (512 points, rOH ˛ [0.8–1.5] ˚A, rHH ˛ [1.0–2.5] ˚A). Other\nintramolecular\
    \ GAPs employed SOAP descriptors with cut-oﬀs\nshown outlined in the gure captions.\
    \ Intermolecular GAPs\nwere trained by subtracting intramolecular energies and\
    \ forces\nof all the dened components from the reference total energy.\nPotentials\
    \ for all pure condensed phase systems were trained\nand applied at or close to\
    \ their experimental liquid densities\nusing 10 solvent molecules (e.g. 10 H2O\
    \ molecules in a 343 ˚A3\ncubic box). Aqueous Zn and explicitly solvated SN2 reactions\n\
    used 20 water molecules in a cubic box with side length of 10 ˚A.\nAll les required\
    \ to reproduce the examples shown here can be\nfound\nin\nhttps://github.com/duartegroup/gap-train/tree/\n\
    master/examples/paper_examples.\nGAP-MD simulations were performed with ASE78\
    \ interfaced\nto QUIP with the quippy wrapper using the Langevin integrator\n\
    with 0.5 fs timesteps at 300 K unless otherwise specied.\nCondensed phase MD\
    \ simulations were performed with three-\ndimensional periodic boundary conditions\
    \ following mini-\nmisation and equilibration for at least 20 ps. Initial congura-\n\
    tions, CUR61 selection and all learning curves were generated\nwith the gap-train\
    \ module, which was used to run the auto-\nmated tting.79 All active learning\
    \ was performed using a ‘diﬀ’\nstrategy, where a conguration is added to the\
    \ training set if jE0\n\x01 EGAPj is larger than a threshold. With system-dependent\n\
    hyperparameter\noptimisation,\nusing\na\nthreshold\non\nthe\nmaximum atomic variance\
    \ predicted by the Gaussian process\n(‘gp_var’) can result in accelerated learning\
    \ (Fig. S25†). CUR\nselection used SOAPs averaged over atoms in a conguration\n\
    using the Dscribe80 package (‘inner’ averaging, over entries of\nthe expansion\
    \ coeﬃcient vector). Intra + inter (I + I) energy and\nforce evaluations used\
    \ an expansion factor of 10 to ensure no\nintermolecular atoms were within the\
    \ intra GAP cut-oﬀ. The\nNumPy81\nbased\nimplementation\nintroduces\na\nnegligible\n\
    computational overhead for expanding the box (\x030.1 ms per\nstep real time)\
    \ but requires two GAP calculations on the inter\nand intra components, currently\
    \ carried out in serial. All\ngenerated potentials, with the exception of the\
    \ revPBE0-D3\nwater potential and metallocage, were trained in less than\na day\
    \ on 10 CPU cores. The revPBE0-D3 water potential was\nconstructed without any\
    \ prior data in 5 days (1 intra + 4 inter)\nand used 20 CPU cores, while the metallocage\
    \ fragment was\ntrained for 3 days also on 20 CPU cores. Explicit SN2 reaction\n\
    dynamics simulations were performed using intra components\nfor H2O and [Cl/CH3Cl]\x01\
    , where the latter, due to the nite\natomic cut-oﬀ employed, has the correct\
    \ dissociation behaviour\nwhen Cl\x01 and CH3Cl are distant.\nPeriodic DFTB calculations\

  title: A transferable active-learning strategy for reactive molecular force fields
  verbatim_quote1: 'Using a train/test set split with high structural similarity

    between the two sets can lead to highly misleadingly accuracy

    whenever the potential is to be taken outside the training region

    in computational practice. For example, splitting an AIMD

    trajectory of water into a training and test set with an odd/even

    frame split (50 : 50) and training a simple GAP model yields an

    energy error on the order of 1 kcal mol-1 (Fig. S1a†). However,

    simulations with this potential in the same conﬁguration space

    sample unphysical conﬁgurations within 10 fs (Fig. S1b†),

    making an RMSE over a priori test data an insuﬃcient metric in

    quantifying the quality of a potential.'
  verbatim_quote2: 'We initially employed training strategies found to work well

    in elemental materials by, for example, tting a combined

    potential with two- and three-body GAPs. However, this

    approach was found to be detrimental to the stability of potentials

    for more complex molecular environments. Even with a high

    correlation and low error on energies in unseen test data, some

    potentials were not stable for more than a few femtoseconds.'

  analysis: "This paper presents a hybrid recovery-assisted flooding scheme for cognitive\
    \ radio ad hoc networks (CRAHN) which takes into account interference from primary\
    \ users (PUs) in order to mitigate the buffer occupancy issue while providing\
    \ statistical guarantees on data delivery reliability. It uses a combination of\

    Internet of Things (IoT) technology, efficient medium access control protocols
    that enable the coexistence of cognitive sensor networks with current wireless
    infrastructure are as essential as the cognitive power in data fusion and processing
    due to shared wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio (CR) is introduced to increase
    spectrum efficiency and support such an endeavor, which thereby becomes a promising
    building block toward facilitating cognitive IoT. In this paper, primary users
    (PUs) refer to devices in existing wireless infrastructure, and secondary users
    (SUs) refer to cognitive sensors. For interference control between PUs and SUs,
    SUs adopt dynamic spectrum access and power adjustment to ensure sufficient operation
    of PUs, which inevitably leads to increasing latency and poses new challenges
    on the reliability of IoT communications. To guarantee operations of primary systems
    while simultaneously optimizing system performance in CR ad hoc networks (CRAHNs),
    this paper proposes interference-aware flooding schemes exploiting global timeout
    and vaccine recovery schemes to control the heavy buffer occupancy induced by
    packet replications. The information delivery dynamics of SUs under the proposed
    interference-aware recovery-assisted flooding schemes is analyzed via epidemic
    models and stochastic geometry from a macroscopic view of the entire system. The
    simulation results show that our model can efficiently capture the complicated
    data delivery dynamics in CRAHNs in terms of end-to-end transmission reliability
    and buffer occupancy. This paper sheds new light on analysis of recovery-assisted
    flooding schemes in CRAHNs and provides performance evaluation of cognitive IoT
    services built upon CRAHNs. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume:

    I. Introduction Cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) technology features advanced
    machine intelligence toward improved data sensing and analysis [1], [2], which
    is particularly appealing to applications involving sensor networks. To fully
    incorporate cognitive IoT technology in sensor networks, intelligent, and efficient
    medium access control protocols enabling the coexistence of sensor networks with
    current wireless infrastructure and simultaneously optimizing the performance
    of IoT applications are emergent challenges. Consequently, in addition to cognitive
    power in data sensing and computation, another crucial factor toward cognitive
    sensor networks is the cognition in spectrum access in order to fully deploy cognitive
    IoT. Over the past decade, cognitive radio (CR) has received dramatic attention
    as it holds tremendous promise for increasing the utilization of scarce radio
    spectrum shared by primary (licensed) systems (PSs) and secondary (unlicensed
    or conditionally licensed) systems (SSs), e.g., cognitive sensor networks. In
    particular, recent works on cognitive IoT technology have identified CR as a critical
    building block that supports cognitive sensor networks [3]–[7], where PSs refer
    to existing wireless infrastructure and SSs refer to CR networks. Using CR terminology,
    secondary users (SUs) sense surrounding environment and adapt their operations
    around those of the primary users (PUs) to opportunistically exploit available
    resources while limiting their interference to PUs. In interweave paradigm [8],
    SUs seek and exploit the temporary spectrum opportunities without causing any
    interference to PUs. To further improve the spectrum usage, SUs in underlay paradigm
    are allowed to concurrently transmit with PUs as long as sufficient operation
    of PUs is ensured. When IoT applications are built upon CR-enabled cognitive sensor
    networks, the information delivery dynamics are jointly affected by the activities
    of PUs and CR medium access protocols, which inevitably leads to increasing latency
    for communications among IoT devices. This paper aims to study the data delivery
    dynamics of flooding schemes in cognitive sensor networks, which specifies the
    effect of packet delivery control and dynamic spectrum access on buffer occupancy
    and end-to-end reliability in data transmission, and therefore provides a novel
    analysis framework for evaluating the performance of information delivery in cognitive
    sensor networks. In ad hoc environment with one channel and slotted ALOHA MAC
    protocol, access probability control is an instinctive solution for spectrum access
    adaptation in underlay paradigm. In a nut shell, each SU tosses a coin independently
    with its access probability and transmits if it gets a head. By adjusting the
    access probability, the subset of SUs acting as interferers could be controlled
    to prevent violating PU’s outage constraint, i.e., outage probability relative
    to a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold. To concatenate
    cognitive sensors as a CR ad hoc network (CRAHN), quality of service (QoS) provisioning
    for end-to-end packet transmissions is an essential must. However, the severe
    interference challenges conventional path-determined single-path routing toward
    QoS guarantee in CRAHN [9], [10], for example, the destination might not receive
    the packet within a prespecified period. To tackle the aforementioned challenges,
    the well known flooding scheme without pre-established path is considered as an
    appropriate choice [11], [12], that is, data is propagated from the source node
    to the destination node with the assistance of other nodes as relays. While such
    solution decreases delivery delay and increases the reliability for end-to-end
    transmissions in CRAHN [13], [14], nodes might receive huge copies not destinated
    to themselves, which is known as the buffer occupancy problem [15]. To resolve
    this issue, two famous recovery schemes, global timeout [16], [17], and vaccine
    [18], have been introduced to remove unnecessary data at the intermediate nodes
    in order to mitigate the resource consumption for epidemic data delivery. The
    rationale behind the recovery scheme is that once the destination has successfully
    received one copy of the packet, the network nodes shall remove copies from their
    respective buffers and stop the packet propagation process as soon as possible.
    In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid recovery scheme combining the advantages
    of global timeout and vaccine schemes for the flooding in CRAHN to increase end-to-end
    SU transmission reliability while maintaining acceptable buffer occupancy. Two
    flooding schemes, static flooding, and mobile flooding, are proposed to investigate
    the effects of mobile nodes on end-to-end SU transmission reliability [19]. Motivated
    by the behavior that transportation of diseases much resembles data dissemination
    dynamics in flooding, we apply epidemic model to investigate the information delivery
    phenomenon, aiming at exploiting the advantages of time efficiency. Moreover,
    the complicated interference is carefully considered in our model by applying
    stochastic geometry modeling [20] instead of the traditional interference graph
    [21]. Specifically, we could derive the end-to-end successful transmission probability
    in flooding while simultaneously meeting the outage constraints for both PUs and
    SUs. The simulation results validate the correctness of our model in the sense
    that the complicated information delivery dynamics can be characterized by our
    schemes. In particular, we show that with the aid of mobility, the end-to-end
    transmission reliability can be drastically improved, which obeys the recent theoretical
    derivations and observations [19], [22]. Moreover, we observe from the simulation
    that by exploiting recovery scheme, our flooding schemes would significantly reduce
    buffer occupancy. As a result, this paper serves as a powerful and efficient tool
    for analyzing information delivery dynamics in cognitive sensor networks. The
    remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce the background and
    survey the related works in Section II. Section III presents the system model
    for the following analysis. Section IV investigates interference at SUs by using
    stochastic geometry, and Section V further analyzes the interference-aware static
    and mobile flooding schemes with hybrid recovery by using epidemic models. Section
    VI provides an analysis and the numerical validation of the proposed schemes.
    Finally, Section VII concludes this paper. SECTION II. Background and Related
    Works A. Recovery Schemes In [15], several novel ideas stemmed from biological
    phenomenon are proposed to delete unnecessary replication in order to mitigate
    the resource consumption due to packet circulating and replication. Two famous
    schemes are introduced as follows. Global Timeout Scheme: Before the global timer
    expires, nodes replicate packets and forward to nodes who have not receive packet
    yet. Upon global timer expires, all nodes delete packets from their buffers. Vaccine
    Scheme: With the aid of “antipacket” spreading, vaccine scheme is the most vigorous
    mechanism to efficiently save buffer occupancy. Specifically, once the destination
    receives the packet, it propagate a antipacket in an epidemic fashion. The nodes
    receiving antipacket will delete the packet from their buffer, join the antipacket
    spreading process, and upon antipacket reception they are redeemed from infection
    by the same packet later. Consequently, the situation that copies of a packet
    may endlessly circulating through the network can be controlled. B. Epidemic Model
    Inspired from epidemiology, information dissemination in communication networks
    has been found to surprisingly resemble the transportation of epidemics [18],
    [23]–[26]. The interactive dynamics of the compartmental model can be characterized
    by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [23]. The most classical epidemic models,
    such as susceptible-infected (SI) model, SI-susceptible (SIS) model, and SI-recovered
    (SIR) model are widely used in analyzing the dynamics of information dissemination
    over networks. Here, we use SIR model to analyze the information spread among
    SUs in CRAHNs. Analog to conventional SIR model, a noninformed (i.e., susceptible)
    node receives a packet and keeps it in the buffer as if the node is infected,
    and an infected node discards the packet when the packet is either outdated or
    successfully delivered to the destination. The latter case is as if the node is
    immune to the virus (an infected node recovers from the disease forever). However,
    it still remains open on connecting fundamental wireless communication characteristics,
    such as interference and medium access with epidemic model, which is one of the
    major contributions of this paper. C. Related Work In the following, we review
    the related literatures for both end-to-end transmission reliability analysis
    and epidemic model with recovery schemes in CRAHNs. Regarding analytical models
    for studying end-to-end features (such as reliability and delay) of routing schemes
    in ad hoc networks, we concentrate on the works based on stochastic geometry since
    a tractable closed-form solution is provided. Xu and Wang [27] proposed models
    to analyze the upper bound of end-to-end delay on a route in traditional ad hoc
    network, while only Vaze [28] investigated the complicated throughput-delay-reliability
    tradeoffs in such network. Jacquet et al. [29] further studied the delay and routing
    selection in opportunistic routing. The extended work [30] investigates the transmission
    capacity in multipath routing. However, all mentioned literatures only consider
    the role of intrasystem interference on the outage constraint of a node. When
    considering a secondary network consisting of both intrasystem interference among
    SUs and PUs as well as intersystem interference between SUs and PUs, things become
    more complicated. Our previous work [31] applied stochastic geometry to model
    the behaviors intersystem and intrasystem interference and analyzed the end-to-end
    transmission delay of single-path and multipath routing schemes in CRAHN. The
    distributions and the lower bound of information dissemination latency in CRAHN
    is addressed in [32] and [33], respectively. Han and Yang [34] further investigated
    the effects of dynamic PU traffic on the end-to-end delay. Song et al. [21] focused
    on the delay of broadcasting in CRAHN under the awareness of topology. QB2IC [13]
    and BRACER [14] proposed by Song and Xie investigate the interference-aware broadcast
    in terms of end-to-end reliability and delay. Moreover, mobility has been proved
    to facilitate end-to-end transmission reliability from the perspectives of information
    theory [22]. Huang et al. [19] further proposed a spectrum-aware mobility-assisted
    routing scheme considering channel availability in relay selection. Recently,
    epidemic models is widely utilized to evaluate the performance of data delivery
    in different networks of interest. In cases, where networks are intermittently
    connected, such as delay tolerant networks [35], a message is delivered in a store-and-forward
    manner and the transportation resembles the spread of epidemics [24], which is
    known as epidemic routing [36]. However, huge buffer space are wasted for replication
    redundancy in epidemic routing and thus controlling replication has been well
    studied. It can be achieved by leveraging historical encounter information [37]
    or geographic information [38], [39] to choose the target for relaying or to control
    the number of replying copies. Another branch proposed to reduce the unnecessary
    overhead in data dissemination is infection recovery. Haas and Small [15] proposed
    five packet discarding methods to improve buffer occupancy and the methods are
    analyzed by using ODE models in [16], [18], and [36]. By including social relationships
    among users, recovery scheme is adjusted adaptively to speed up the delivery process
    [40]. Moreover, Galluccio et al. [41] applied technique of network coding into
    epidemic routing to further reduce the number of ineffective transmissions between
    nodes. SECTION III. System Model A. Network Model In this paper, we cast cognitive
    sensor networks as a CRAHN, where the spatial distribution of SUs is assumed to
    follow a homogeneous poisson point process (PPP) with density λ SU . Let Φ SU
    ={ Y k } denote the set of locations of the SUs and P SU denote the transmit power
    of an SU. The media access control protocol of the secondary network is assumed
    as slotted ALOHA with access probability p , i.e., each SU is allowed to be active
    with probability p . The set of active SUs is a PPP with density pλ and is denoted
    as Φ SU ={ Y k ∈ Φ SU  :  B k (p)=1} , where B k (p) are independent and identically
    distributed Bernoulli random variables with parameter p associated with Y k .
    Each SU has an outage constraint with maximum outage probability ϵ SU . The CRAHN
    coexists with a primary ad hoc network, where the spatial distribution of primary
    transmitters (PTs) is assumed to follow a PPP with density λ PT . Each PT has
    a dedicated primary receiver (PR) at distance r PT away with an arbitrary direction
    so that the PRs also form a PPP with density λ PT . The set of locations of PTs
    is denoted as Φ PT ={ X i } and the transmit power of a PT is P PT . Each PR has
    an outage constraint with maximum outage probability ϵ PR . B. Channel Model We
    consider the effects of path loss attenuation, Rayleigh fading with unit average
    power G (i.e., exponentially distributed with unit mean), and background noise
    power N in our channel model. The path-loss exponent of transmission is denoted
    by α . The successful reception of a transmission at an user depends on if SINR
    observed by the user is larger than an SINR threshold (denoted by η ). C. Flooding
    Scheme Two flooding schemes are considered in this paper and the details are described
    below. Static Flooding: Since complete information of end-to-end path is in general
    unavailable between the source and the destination SUs, the data are delivered
    in a store-and-forward fashion, that is, all SUs successfully receiving the data
    flood by source SU will participate in relaying the data to other SUs in a flooding
    fashion until the data is received by the destination SU. Mobile Flooding: The
    data transportation is similar to static flooding (i.e., once receiving the data,
    SU will relay in a flood fashion) except that SUs are mobile. Random direction
    mobility model [42] is applied for all SUs. SU will randomly choose a direction
    to travel in, a speed at which to travel, and a time duration for this travel.
    Each time the SU reaches the new position, flood operation is performed. D. Hybrid
    Recovery Scheme By taking advantages of global timeout and vaccine schemes, we
    propose a hybrid recovery scheme, that is, a global timer T is set and antipacket
    is spread to mitigate the buffer occupancy. In particular, when the destination
    node receives packet successfully, it starts flooding the antipacket. The nodes
    receiving antipacket will discard the packet (i.e., go to recovered state) and
    join the antipacket spreading process. No matter if the vaccine scheme is performed
    or not, all nodes will delete packets once the global timer T expires. It is crucial
    to find an optimal T , which implicitly determines the system end time, to mitigate
    the heavy buffer occupancy issue, while providing statistical guarantees on data
    delivery reliability. Typically, S(t) , I(t) , and R(t) are denoted as the susceptible,
    infected, and recovered subpopulation at time instant t , respectively, and S(t)+I(t)+R(t)=M+1
    is the total population consisting of M nodes (excluding the destination node)
    and one destination node. E. Performance Metric We focus on analyzing the tradeoff
    between reliability and buffer occupancy. Regarding reliability, the packet reception
    rate P(T) is applied, which is defined as the probability that the destination
    will receive the packet before the global timer T expires. Typically, we use a
    maximum unsuccessful reception probability ϵ T to constraint P(T) , that is, P(T)≥1−
    ϵ T . (1) View Source Buffer occupancy Q(T) is also considered an important metric,
    which is defined as the total number of infected SUs at every moments until T
    [36], that is, Q(T)= ∫ T 0 I(t)dt. (2) View Source SECTION IV. Analysis of Interference
    at SU A. Outage Constraint of Primary Receiver Sensitivity To mitigate the interference
    to PRs, SUs exploit slotted ALOHA as the distributed spectrum access protocol.
    As shown in Fig. 1(b), each SU tosses a coin independently in each time slot and
    accesses the spectrum with head probability p ˜ , where p ˜ is the parameter of
    independent identically distributed Bernoulli random variables, B i ( p ˜ ) .

    to traditional wireless ad hoc networks. (b) Outage constraint of PS. Blue slashed
    nodes are deactivated according to the active probability p ˜ . (c) Avoidance
    region. Red dotted nodes are deactivated since they are in the vicinity of PR,
    while other blue slashed nodes are deactivated according to the active probability
    p ˆ . Show All Lemma 1:To avoid interference from SUs violating the outage constraint
    at a PR, the permissible active density of SUs is λ ˜ SU =([(−ln(1− ϵ PR )−( η
    PR / P PT r −α PT )N)/ r 2 PT η δ PR K α ]− λ PT )(( P PT / P SU ) ) δ , and the
    active probability is p ˜ =( λ ˜ SU / λ SU ) . Proof:The receiver sensitivity
    of a PR is maintained when only p ˜ portion of SUs are allowed to transmit. This
    subset of SUs, denoted as Φ SU ( p ˜ )={ Y i  :  B i ( p ˜ )=1} with density λ
    ˜ SU = p ˜ λ SU , is obtained by independent thinning of Φ SU with probability
    p ˜ . We have the outage constraint \begin{equation} \mathbb {P}\left ({\frac
    {\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm{ PT}}P_{\mathrm{ PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}{N+ I_{\mathrm{
    SU}}+I_{\mathrm{ PT}}} \geq \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}\right ) = 1 - \epsilon _{\mathrm{
    PR}} \end{equation} View Source where \mathcal {G}_{\mathrm{ PT}} is the channel
    power gain, \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}} is the SINR threshold of PR, I_{\mathrm{ SU}}=\sum
    _{Y_{i}\in \Phi _{\mathrm{ SU}}(\widetilde {p})}\mathcal {G}_{Y_{i}}P_{\mathrm{
    SU}}\| Y_{i} \|^{-\alpha } is the interference from SUs to a typical PR, and I_{\mathrm{
    PT}}=\sum _{X_{i}\in \Phi _{\mathrm{ PT}}}\mathcal {G}_{X_{i}} P_{\mathrm{ PT}}\|
    X_{i} \|^{-\alpha } is the interference from other PTs. \| {\cdot } \| denotes
    the distance to the origin, and the channel power gain \mathcal {G}_{X_{i}} and
    \mathcal {G}_{Y_{i}} of the interfering links are also exponentially distributed
    with unit mean. The left hand side of (3) can be evaluated as [43]\begin{align}&\mathbb
    {P}\left [{\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm{ PT}} \geq \frac {\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{
    PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}\left ({N+I_{\mathrm{ SU}}+I_{\mathrm{ PT}}}\right
    )}\right ] \notag \\&=\exp \left ({-\frac {\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{ PT}}r_{\mathrm{
    PT}}^{-\alpha }}N}\right ) \mathbb {E}\left [{\exp \left ({-\frac {\eta _{\mathrm{
    PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{ PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}I_{\mathrm{ SU}}}\right )}\right
    ] \notag \\&\quad \times \mathbb {E}\left [{\exp \left ({-\frac {\eta _{\mathrm{
    PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{ PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}I_{\mathrm{ PT}}}\right )}\right
    ] \notag \\&= \exp \left ({-\frac {\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{ PT}}r_{\mathrm{
    PT}}^{-\alpha }}N}\right ) \notag \\&\quad \times \exp \left \{{-\left ({\widetilde

    )^{\delta }+\lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}}}\right ) r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{2} \eta _{\mathrm{
    PR}}^{\delta } K_{\alpha }}\right \} \end{align} View Source and from (3) and
    (4), when [(-\ln (1-\epsilon _{\mathrm{ PR}}) - ({\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}/{P_{\mathrm{
    PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha })}N)/ {r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{2} \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}^{\delta
    } K_{\alpha }}] \geq \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} we obtain the permissible active
    density \begin{align} \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}=&\left ({ \frac {-\ln
    \left ({1-\epsilon _{\mathrm{ PR}}}\right ) -\frac {\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{
    PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}N} {r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{2} \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}^{\delta
    } K_{\alpha }} - \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} }\right )\left ({\frac {P_{\mathrm{ PT}}}{P_{\mathrm{
    SU}}}}\right )^{\delta } \notag \\\triangleq&\sigma P_{\mathrm{ SU}}^{-\delta
    } \end{align} View Source where K_{\alpha }=({2\pi ^{2}}/{\alpha \sin (2\pi /
    \alpha )}) and \delta = 2/\alpha . Furthermore, if a PT does not impose interference
    on other PRs (e.g., code division multiple access is exploited), additional SUs
    are allowed to be activated due to looser outage constraint. Corollary 1:Additional
    \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} ( ({P_{\mathrm{ PT}}}/{P_{\mathrm{ SU}}} )) ^{\delta }
    density of SUs are activated when I_{\mathrm{ PT}}=0 . Proof:This is a direct
    result of (5) when \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} is set to be 0. B. Avoidance Region
    If an SU is close to a PR, deactivation of the SU (instead of following slotted
    ALOHA with certain access probability) may increase the overall permissible active
    density while maintaining the same receiver sensitivity of the PR as illustrated
    in Fig. 1(c). With the capability of dynamic spectrum access, an SU is deactivated
    when it is located within radius \rho r_{\mathrm{ PT}} of a PR, where \rho is
    a reasonably small non-negative value named avoidance region radius coefficient.
    That is, each PR has an SU-avoidance region with radius \rho r_{\mathrm{ PT}}
    , and the permissible active density of SUs increases following the next lemma
    [43]. Lemma 2:The permissible active density of SUs satisfying the outage constraint
    of PR sensitivity is enhanced from \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}} to \widehat
    {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}\geq \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}} , and \widehat
    {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}= \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}} \cdot [{\pi /2}/({\pi
    /2-\tan ^{-1}(\sqrt {({P_{\mathrm{ PT}}}/{\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}P_{\mathrm{ SU}}})}\rho
    ^{2})})] when \alpha =4 . Proof:If an SU is deactivated when it is located within
    radius \rho of a PR, each PR has an SU-avoidance region with radius \rho . The
    probability of an SU located in \mathcal {B}({\mathrm{ PR}};\rho ) is 1-\exp (-\lambda
    _{\mathrm{ PT}}\pi \rho ^{2}) , where the notation \mathcal {B}(x;r) represents
    the circle of radius r centered at x . The interference from SUs at a typical
    PR located at origin becomes \begin{equation} I''_{\mathrm{ SU}} = \sum _{Y_{i}
    \in {\Phi _{\mathrm{ SU}}^{\widehat {p}} \setminus \mathcal {B}\left ({0;\rho
    }\right )}}G_{Y_{i}}P_{\mathrm{ SU}}\parallel Y_{i}\parallel ^{-\alpha } \mathbf
    {1}_{Y_{i} \not \in \mathcal {B}\left ({PR;\rho }\right )}. \end{equation} View

    \left ({-2\pi \widehat {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ ST}} \cdot \exp \left ({-\lambda _{\mathrm{

    to all susceptible nodes. The node who successfully received the packet will be
    infected and join the subsequent flooding process. After the destination receives
    the packet (i.e., T_{D} ), the hybrid recovery is performed and antipackets are
    spread from the destination in the flooding fashion. The node who successfully
    receives the antipacket (no matter currently in susceptible or infected state)
    will delete the packet from the buffer and transition to recovered state. In hybrid
    recovery scheme, only the node who is currently in infected state will join the
    antipacket spreading process. When the global timer expires at T , all infected
    nodes would directly transition to the recovered state and stop spreading. Taking
    the active density of SUs into account to satisfy the outage constraints of primary
    systems, we incorporate avoidance region in Section IV-B to formulate the performance
    of static flooding scheme. Fig. 2. Illustration of the static flooding scheme.
    The source node (denoted as S ) is infected at t=0 . Susceptible nodes who successfully
    receive the packet from the infected nodes will transition to infected state.
    Show All Proposition 1:For the static flooding scheme with global timeout duration
    T and vaccine recovery scheme deployed by avoidance region in CRAHNs, the information
    delivery dynamics can be characterized by \begin{align} \begin{cases} \frac {dI\left

    with static flooding scheme in (10), the propagation of packets and antipackets
    is further affected by the active probability \widehat {p} in CRAHNs. Assuming
    the traffic of an SU and its neighboring nodes follows a Poisson process with
    arrival rate g=\beta \widehat {p} packets per unit time. The infection rate is
    the collision-free probability \begin{equation} \psi \left ({t}\right )=e^{-g
    \cdot \left ({\frac {I\left ({t}\right )+R\left ({t}\right )+P\left ({t}\right

    since the interference from neighboring SUs are regarded as contentions for an
    SU. The same argument applies to \mu (t) . Suppose there is a circular region

    = \lambda _{\mathrm{ SU}}\pi R_{c}^{2} , and the average number of neighbors of
    an SU (i.e., the SUs who successfully receive the packet) can be computed as \begin{align}
    \beta=&\lambda _{\mathrm{ SU}} \int _{0}^{R_{c}} \mathbb {P}\left ({\frac {\mathcal

    SU}}}^{({1}/{2})} when \alpha =4 , where \begin{equation*} k_{5} = \frac {\lambda
    _{\mathrm{ SU}} \pi }{2} \sqrt {\frac {\pi }{\eta _{\mathrm{ SU}}N}} \exp \left
    \{{ \frac {{\lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}}}^{2} P_{\mathrm{ PT}} \pi ^{4} }{16N} }\right

    complementary error function. Note that the buffer occupancy is Q(T)=\int ^{T}_{0}I(t)dt
    by Little’s formula [36]. Therefore, there is clearly a tradeoff between global
    timer T and buffer occupancy. With Lemmas 1, 2, and (12), we then derive \beta
    \widehat {p} , the average number of active neighbors per SU. Corollary 2:When
    \alpha =4 , the effective average number of neighbors in CRAHNs is \begin{equation*}
    \beta \widehat {p}=\sigma k_{5} \pi \left \{{ 2 \lambda _{\mathrm{ SU}} \left
    [{ \frac {\pi }{2}-\tan ^{-1}\left ({ \sqrt {\frac {P_{\mathrm{ PT}}}{\eta _{\mathrm{

    View Source Proof:By Proposition 1, \beta = k_{5} {P_{\mathrm{ SU}}}^{({1}/{2})}
    when \alpha =4 , and by Lemma 2, \widehat {p} = ({\widehat {\lambda }_{\mathrm{
    SU}}}/{\lambda _{\mathrm{ SU}}}) . Hence, we obtain the corollary. Note that \beta
    shall be larger than some threshold \beta _{\mathrm{ th}} to prevent the network
    from disconnecting, which mainly depends on channel fading and path loss and is
    numerically analyzed in [45], e.g., \beta _{\mathrm{ th}}=4.52 when there is no
    fading effect. Moreover, Q(T) is a function of P_{\mathrm{ SU}} (or \beta ) and
    T since it is the integral of infected subpopulation up to time T . In order to
    minimize Q(T) , we formulate the optimization problem as \begin{align} \text {Minimize}&~~Q
    \left ({P_{\mathrm{ SU}},T}\right ) \notag \\ \text {Subject to}&~~P_{\mathrm{
    SU}} \geq f^{-1}\left ({\beta _{\mathrm{ th}}}\right ),~ P\left ({T}\right ) \geq
    1-\epsilon _{T} \end{align} View Source where \beta =f(P_{\mathrm{ SU}}) from
    (12). The lower bound of P_{\mathrm{ SU}} is to meet the condition that \beta
    \geq \beta _{\mathrm{ th}} to prevent the network from disconnecting, and the
    packet reception rate up to time T is constrained with the maximum unsuccessful
    reception probability \epsilon _{T} . From Corollary 2, \beta \widehat {p} is
    a monotonically decreasing function of P_{\mathrm{ SU}} , decreasing P_{\mathrm{
    SU}} induces lower delivery delay due to increment of active SUs, and henceforth
    lower T and Q(T) . When \alpha =4 , we have \beta =k_{5} {P_{\mathrm{ SU}}}^{({1}/{2})}
    \geq \beta _{\mathrm{ th}} and the optimal transmission power of SU becomes P_{\mathrm{
    SU}}^{*} = (\beta _{\mathrm{ th}}/k_{5})^{2} . In addition, it is trivial that
    the optimal global timer T^{*} satisfies \begin{equation} P\left ({T^{*}}\right
    ) = 1-\epsilon _{T}. \end{equation} View Source We obtain the optimal global timer
    T^{*} through control the maximum unsuccessful reception probability \epsilon
    _{T} . The buffer occupancy can be obtained by \begin{equation} Q\left ({T^{*}}\right
    )=\int ^{T^{*}}_{0}I\left ({t}\right )dt. \end{equation} View Source The packet
    reception rate and buffer occupancy can be obtained when we bring optimal global
    timer T^{*} into (14) and (15) since Q(T^{*}) is an increasing function in T^{*}
    . B. Mobile Flooding Scheme Fig. 3 shows the propagation behaviors of the interference-aware
    hybrid-recovery-assisted mobile flooding scheme. The data transportation of mobile
    flooding is similar to static flooding. The only difference is that nodes will
    move and transmit simultaneously in mobile flooding scheme. Fig. 3. Illustration
    of the mobile flooding scheme. The source mobile node (denoted as S ) is infected
    at t=0 . Susceptible nodes who successfully receive the packet from the infected
    mobile nodes will transition to infected state. Show All Proposition 2:For the
    mobile flooding scheme with global timeout duration T and vaccine recovery scheme
    deployed by avoidance region in CRAHNs, the information delivery dynamics can
    be characterized by \begin{equation} \begin{cases} \frac {dI(t)}{dt} = \widehat
    {p} \psi (t) \beta I(t)\frac {M-I(t)-R(t)}{M} &\\ \quad \qquad -\widehat {p} \psi
    (t) \beta (R(t)+P(t)) \frac {I(t)}{M} & \\ \frac {dR(t)}{dt} = \widehat {p} \mu
    (t) \beta (R(t)+P(t)) \frac {I(t)}{M} &\\ \quad \qquad +\widehat {p} \mu (t) \beta
    (R(t)+P(t)) \frac {M-I(t)-R(t)}{M} & \\ \frac {dP(t)}{dt} = \widehat {p} \psi
    (t) \beta \frac {I(t)}{M}(1-P(t)), &~\text {for } t \le T \\ I(t)=0 {~\text {and
    }} R(t)=0, &~\text {for } t > T \end{cases}\qquad \end{equation} View Source where
    \psi (t) is the infection rate function at time t , \mu (t) is the recovery rate
    function at time t , \psi (t)=\mu (t)=e^{- \beta \widehat {p}([({I(t)+R(t)+P(t)})/{M}])T_{F}}
    , \beta is the average number of neighbors per SU, and \widehat {p}=({\widehat
    {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}}/{\lambda _{\mathrm{ SU}}}) is the active probability
    of an SU. Proof:Since mobility is shown to promote homogeneous connections or
    encounters among all mobile nodes in environment [18], [23], [36], the information
    dissemination dynamics can be captured by the homogeneous mixing SIR model in
    Proposition 2, which is distinct from the propagation model for static flooding
    in Proposition 1. Moreover, owing to mobility, in average an active mobile node
    can successfully broadcast to \beta nodes, and the information dissemination dynamics
    are further affected by the active probability \widehat {p} and collision-free
    probability \psi (t) as discussed in Proposition 2. SECTION VI. Performance Evaluation
    This section investigates the performance of the proposed interference-aware recovery-assisted
    schemes in CRAHN by using analytical models and simulation experiments. We adopt
    the system parameters from [43] and [46] for simulating a CRAHN. The simulator
    was implemented using C++ on a single machine with 4-core CPU 3.6 GHz and memory
    of 16 GB DDR3. The details of parameter setup and corresponding notations are
    listed in Table I. Please note that the set of system parameters has been cross-validated
    in [43] and [46] for efficient and reliable operation of both primary and secondary
    systems. TABLE I Simulation Parameters In each round of the simulation process,
    we distribute PUs and SUs by using PPP with means 6.4 and 640, respectively. Among
    SUs, we randomly select one source node and one destination node for the packet
    transmission. All SUs successfully receiving the packet flood by source SU will
    participate in relaying the packet to other SUs in a flooding fashion until the
    packet is received by the destination SU. The successful reception of a packet
    between two nodes depends on rules of SINR and avoidance region. Regarding the
    hybrid recovery, when the destination node receives packet successfully, it starts
    flooding the antipacket. The nodes receiving antipacket will discard the packet
    and join the antipacket spreading process. Moreover, all nodes will delete packets
    once the global timer T expires. For mobile flooding, SU randomly chooses a direction
    with a random speed and time duration in each movement. After reaching the new
    position, SU performs the flood operation for packets and antipackets. The simulation
    results are collected in each round and we totally execute 20 000 rounds for a
    particular parameter setup. The averaged results are presented as follows. Dynamics
    of I(t), R(t), and S(t) in Static Flooding: Fig. 4 illustrates the number of susceptible,
    infected, and recovered nodes with respect to time t in static flooding with the
    proposed hybrid recover scheme as well as the number of susceptible and infected
    nodes with respect to time t in traditional static flooding without recovery scheme,
    where T=65 . In this case, the destination node will receive the data averagely
    at 15 and thus the global timer expires at the same time. We can observe that
    the simulation results approximately close the proposed analytical model for the
    hybrid recovery-assisted static flooding scheme. This figure also shows that the
    number of infected nodes increases until the destination node receives the packet.
    When the destination receives the packet, it performs antipacket spreading process,
    which enforces the nodes who receiving the antipacket transition to recovered
    state, thereby decreasing the number of infected nodes. Comparing with the results
    of traditional static flooding scheme without recovery, the number of susceptible
    nodes after T_{D} decreases slightly. It is due to that nodes originally in susceptible
    state will transition to recovered state once they receive the antipacket. On
    the other hand, the number of infected nodes in recovery-assisted flooding scheme
    at any reference time t>T_{D} is smaller than that in flooding without recovery
    scheme. It is due to two reasons. First, the nodes originally at infected state
    will transition to recovered state once they receive antipacket. Second, recovered
    nodes will not transition to infected state even they receive the packet. Consequently,
    the effects of antipacket spreading on the alleviation of infected nodes can be
    observed. After the global timer expires, all infected nodes transition to the
    recovered state, which follows (10) and assists the removing process of unnecessary
    packets. Obviously, the interval of global timer shall be later than the interval
    when the destination has received the packets. Otherwise, all nodes transition
    to the recovered state and the destination will receive the packet with no chance.
    Dynamics of I(t), R(t), and S(t) in Mobile Flooding: Fig. 5 illustrates the number
    of susceptible, infected, and recovered nodes with respect to time t in mobile
    flooding with the proposed hybrid recover scheme as well as the number of susceptible
    and infected nodes with respect to time t in traditional mobile flooding without
    recovery scheme, where T=18 . In this case, the destination node will receive
    the data averagely at 8 and thus the global timer expires after T_{D}=8 . We can
    observe that the time dynamic phenomenon of susceptible, infected, and recovered
    nodes in the analytical model spread slowly than the simulation results and it
    may be the problem of parameter setup. Obviously, the spreading speed in mobile
    flooding is faster than that in static flooding since the advantages of mobility
    are fully taken. Effects of T on P(T) in Recovery-Assisted Static and Mobile Flooding
    Schemes: The global timer T of two flooding schemes with respect to packet reception
    probability P(T) is shown in Fig. 6. It is observed that P(T) is a monotonic increasing
    function of T since when T is larger, the destination has higher probability to
    receive the packet. In addition, we find that the mobile flooding scheme has better
    performance than the static flooding scheme due to its mobility feature, which
    suggests that for a given T , the probability of successful packet delivery of
    mobile flooding scheme is higher than that of static flooding scheme. Similarly,
    for a fixed packet reception probability, the static flooding scheme needs to
    take more time than the mobile flooding scheme to achieve the same performance.
    Consequently, the results suggest that mobility can indeed improve data delivery.
    Effects of T on Q(T) in Recovery-Assisted Static and Mobile Flooding Schemes:
    Fig. 7 shows the optimal global timer T of two flooding schemes with respect to
    buffer occupancy Q(T) . We can observe that Q(T) is an increasing function of
    T since the buffer occupancy is the accumulated sum of infected nodes over time.
    Moreover, we also observe an intrinsic result that mobile flooding scheme spends
    less time to achieve same buffer occupancy compared with static flooding scheme,
    which can be explained by more frequent data replication. From Figs. 6 and 7,
    we can observe an interesting tradeoff between reliability and buffer occupancy,
    that is, as T increases, both P(T) and Q(T) increase. As a result, we can use
    (14) to control the maximum packet loss rate since it well approximates the empirical
    packet reception probability. For instance, to achieve no more than 5% of packet
    loss rate, the global timer for the static and mobile flooding schemes should
    be 30 and 15, respectively. The pursuit of higher successful probability (i.e.,
    the global timer is larger than 30 in static flooding) will result in the price
    of high buffer occupancy and thus the global timer who satisfies (14) is the optimal
    one. Fig. 4. Number of nodes with respect to propagation time t in static flooding

    VII. Conclusion In this paper, we study a promising architecture for cognitive
    sensor networks, where each sensor supporting IoT communications is equipped with
    CR technology for dynamic and efficient spectrum access. By casting such a cognitive
    sensor network as a CRAHN, we propose a hybrid interference-aware flooding scheme
    for CRAHNs that utilizes global timeout and antipackets for information dissemination
    control. The information delivery dynamics in CRAHNs incorporating the influences
    of PR sensitivity, mobility of SU, and the control of recovery scheme are analyzed
    using a novel epidemic model. The integration of stochastic geometry and epidemic
    model provides efficiency and accurate analysis on reliability of end-to-end SU
    communications and buffer occupancy. The simulation results show that the implementation
    of the proposed flooding scheme indeed mitigates the buffer occupancy burden while
    providing statistical data delivery guarantees. Moreover, with the aid of mobility,
    information dissemination is shown to possess distinct characteristics that facilitates
    information dissemination. Consequently, this paper provides performance evaluations
    and modeling guidelines for efficient flooding in CRAHNs, which offers new insights
    on buffer occupancy and data delivery reliability analysis for cognitive IoT applications
    built upon CRAHNs. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    The article proposes a methodology for optimizing the process of irrigation of
    crops using a phytoindication system based on computer vision methods. We have
    proposed an algorithm and developed a system for obtaining a map of irrigation
    for maize in low latency mode. The system can be installed on a center pivot irrigation
    and consists of 8 IP cameras connected to a DVR connected to a laptop. The algorithm
    consists of three stages. Image preprocessing stage - applying an integrated excess
    green and excess red difference (ExGR) index. The classification stage is the
    application of the method that we choose depending on the system’s operating conditions.
    At the final stage, a neural network trained using the Resilient Propagation method
    is used, which determines the rate of watering of plants in the current sector
    of the location of the sprinkler. The selected methods of pretreatment and classification
    made it possible to achieve an accuracy of plant identification up to 93%, growth
    stages - up to 92% (with unconsolidated maize sowing and good lighting). System
    performance up to 100 plants in one second, which exceeds the performance of similar
    systems. The neural network showed an accuracy of 92% on the training set and
    87% on the test set. Dynamic analysis of spatial and temporal variability leads
    to an increase in productivity and efficiency of water use. In addition, given
    the ubiquitous distribution of agribusiness management systems, this approach
    is quite simple to implement in the farm’s conditions. Artificial neural networks

    I. Introduction According to statistics, agricultural production on a global scale
    over the past half-century has grown 2.5-3 times, and the growth of acreage was
    about 12%. In addition, according to UNESCO data, agriculture is undoubtedly the
    largest consumer of water, while 70% of the total freshwater intake is used for
    irrigation [1]. In water-stressed regions, irrigation is of fundamental importance,
    as irrigated agriculture accounts for 16% of the world’s cultivated area, which
    produces 30% to 40% of the world’s food [2]. At the same time, the area of irrigated
    land has more than doubled over fifty years and comprises on average more than
    16% of all agricultural land, and the volume of water withdrawn for irrigation
    has almost doubled. FAO’s projected 1-2% annual growth in global irrigated areas,
    as well as trends in climate change (temperature and precipitation), in the next
    20 years could lead to a significant increase in water consumption (according
    to FAO estimates by 14%) and energy, which in turn puts forward the problem of
    saving water, energy and material and technical resources, protecting the natural
    environment [2]. Traditional methods of planning irrigation based on visual inspection
    lead to significant water losses and raise the issue of optimizing irrigation.
    All of this has contributed to the emergence of various methods of controlled
    irrigation such as sprinkler, drip, and furrow irrigation. The introduction of
    these methods allows to reduce water losses by 30–70% and contributes to the sustainable
    development of irrigated agriculture [3]. Further development of optimization
    methods led to the emergence of the so-called precision irrigation, which allows
    you to estimate the amount of water, irrigation time, and maintains the exact
    water content in the soil, depending on the needs of the growth and development
    of crops. In this regard, technologies of precision farming have become widespread,
    which involve considering spatial and temporal variability and differentiating
    the use of resources [4], [5]. In this regard, a key problem of irrigation management
    arises - its optimization both from the point of view of irrigation technique
    and from the point of view of technology. Classical water resources management
    is based on the use of uniformly introduced resources across the field, considered
    as a single spatial unit and if the actual operating parameters of the sprinkler
    equipment coincide with the theoretical ones. However, on the one hand, sprinkler
    technology is a complex dynamic system, the operation of which is influenced by
    many stochastic factors. On the other hand, the object of the impact of technology
    - the field is a complex biological system with Spatio-temporal heterogeneity
    of the characteristics of soil, climate, plants, and, therefore, uneven need for
    irrigation [6], [7]. The operation of irrigation equipment plays an important
    role in irrigated agriculture. Optimizing irrigation equipment is an important
    strategy for conserving resources, increasing productivity, and improving production
    efficiency. Among the various systems, one can distinguish Center Pivot Irrigation
    Systems, which account for up to 23% of the total area irrigated by sprinkler
    irrigation systems [8]. And in Russia, for example, about 22% of the total irrigated
    area is irrigated with such systems. A. Precision Agriculture, Digitalization,
    and Artificial Intelligence In connection with the role played by Center Pivot
    Irrigation systems (CPI), numerous studies are being carried out to improve the
    technical parameters of these systems: improving the uniformity of irrigation,
    modeling sprinklers, and lateral corner joints [9]–[11]. In addition, the Precision
    Agriculture methodology appears for such systems as well. Variable Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) considers Spatio-temporal variability by delivering a variable amount of
    water to a specific area following crop water requirements. At the same time,
    for sprinkler systems of circular action, VRI assumes either irrigation at a controlled
    speed (assumes a change in the irrigation rate in the direction of a moving sprinkler
    by changing the speed of its movement) or irrigation with a controlled zone (involves
    a change in the irrigation rate both along the side pipeline and in the direction
    of movement sprinkler) [12]. Many scientists have been involved in the development
    and improvement of VRI methods [12]–[14] since the creation of optimal VRI solutions
    is rather difficult and must consider a large number of factors. Some scientists
    considered the properties of water in the soil as a basis for monitoring, others
    - the state of plants. Thus, in the study [12], automatic control of the speed
    of movement is based on technologies for monitoring the electrical conductivity
    of the soil and altimetry, the moisture content in the soil, and vegetation indices
    obtained from satellite images. In [13], the interaction between spatially changing
    soil properties and the time-varying dynamics of water in crops is investigated.
    It is shown that modeling soil moisture depletion can be an effective planning
    tool in VRI. A decision support system for variable rate irrigation is presented
    in a study [14]. The system is based on the vegetation index (VI), obtained after
    processing multispectral images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles. And the
    evapotranspiration model and the crop water stress index are derived from their
    established relationships with the vegetation index. Work [15] summarizes the
    advantages and disadvantages of the variable rate irrigation methodology. Until
    now, these methods need further development and improvement as further studies
    of space-time variability are needed to make these improvements. Digitalization
    is becoming one of such powerful tools for increasing the efficiency of both irrigation
    and agriculture in general. The current stage of development of precision farming
    and digital agriculture makes it possible to widely use such tools based on artificial
    intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is the basis for intelligent agriculture.
    Thus, [16] provides an overview of best practices in the implementation of sensor
    irrigation systems, along with the most used nodes and wireless technologies.
    In such systems, wireless sensor networks and all kinds of sensors (soil moisture,
    soil temperature, ambient temperature, etc.) are actively used. Optimization of
    irrigation is achieved in various ways, in [17] - by precise control of the water
    valve using neural network forecasting of soil water demand, and in [18], for
    example, by integrating an automated irrigation system with an irrigation decision
    support tool. In addition, all sorts of applications are created for data analysis
    and decision support at all stages of the agricultural cycle. SWAMP platform [19]
    for intelligent water management based on the Internet of Things for precision
    irrigation. The system for optimal irrigation of crops [20] is based on a wireless
    sensor network using nodal sensors in the field and data management via a smartphone
    and a web application. [21] presents a study on the integration between various
    tools to improve water efficiency in agriculture (field sensors and remote sensing).
    The systems considered in [22], [23] involve data monitoring, their preliminary
    processing, integration, synchronization, and storage with subsequent use for
    intelligent irrigation. Thus, the digitalization of agriculture makes it possible
    to make the transition from classical control systems to systems with artificial
    intelligence. In recent years, many researchers in the development of the Precision
    Agriculture methodology in general and for irrigation management use such a tool
    as artificial neural networks. The range of applications of artificial neural
    networks in agriculture is very wide. Researchers are using these tools to model
    agricultural production, replacing classical mathematical models. They can be
    both part of precision farming systems and decision support. An overview of the
    application is presented in [24], [25] and includes forecasting in agriculture,
    intelligent monitoring of diseases and pests, and weed control. Artificial intelligence
    methods are also used to optimize storage and transportation processes. In addition,
    AI methods contribute to the improvement of the automation of various processes.
    The introduction of artificial intelligence in agriculture is associated with
    the problems of the systematic collection of data from multiple sources of storage
    and analysis. Approaches to solving these problems are outlined in [26], [27]
    and represent pilot projects for the analysis of advanced control systems in various
    natural and climatic conditions. One of the key artificial intelligence techniques,
    such as machine learning, has significant potential for solving numerous problems.
    The work [28] provides an overview of the use of machine learning in agriculture,
    namely, the management of water resources, soil, and animal husbandry. Big data
    and machine learning (ML) open new possibilities for understanding agricultural
    processes using data, along with this, there are numerous problems of integrating
    these technologies that require research and solution [29]. Machine learning is
    an important decision support tool, for example in [30] it has found application
    in yield forecasting, including making decisions about crop types and cultivation
    technologies during the growing season. Artificial intelligence methods are gaining
    importance in agricultural robotics. A study of the similarities and differences
    between industrial and field robots is presented in [31], along with a suggestion
    of potential methods for use on farms. B. Artificial Intelligence in Irrigated
    Agriculture In recent years, data-driven models have begun to play a key role
    in comparison with classical physical models. Methods of artificial intelligence,
    machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks show good predictive characteristics,
    more quickly and efficiently process large arrays of Spatio-temporal data. This
    is especially important for irrigation management due to the large Spatio-temporal
    variability of external conditions and, often, the need for continuous calibration
    in real-time. These methods have numerous applications for irrigation and water
    management. Some systems [32] are based on an intelligent algorithm that considers
    the received sensor data together with the parameters of the weather forecast
    (precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV radiation) for the near future.
    In others [17], [33], irrigation is optimized by precise control of the water
    valve, current sensors using neural networks forecasting soil water demand, or
    fuzzy inferences [34] by creating prescriptive maps to control the rotation speed
    of the central axis based on remote sensing. The combination of big data and machine
    learning technologies with remote sensing technologies leads to the creation of
    new methods and algorithms presented in [35]. And [36] presents the development
    of a combined intelligent agricultural machine that can automatically weed and
    irrigate at a variable rate on a cultivated field. Some approaches to the intellectualization
    of CPI control systems are considered in [37]. One of the directions is the creation
    of intelligent decision support systems. In [38], a comparative study of various
    algorithms and training methods (ANN, linear regression (LR), random forest regression
    (RFR) and auxiliary vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and adaptive
    gain (AdaBoost) algorithms were carried out to determine the admissibility of
    the erroneousness of the experts’ decisions. Such systems are also developed at
    the level of management of irrigation systems. The AWARD system [39] uses artificial
    neural network techniques to predict water level, a fuzzy logic control algorithm
    to estimate the sluice adjustment period, and hydraulic equations to adjust the
    sluice level. An example is DLiSA’s intelligent irrigation system based on a deep
    learning neural network for predicting the volumetric moisture content in the
    soil, the period of irrigation, and the spatial distribution of water, considering
    the need for it [40]. In addition, models of artificial neural networks and machine
    learning are used to calculate important irrigation parameters, such as soil moisture
    [41], soil salinity [42], horizontal daily global solar irradiation predictive
    modeling [43], modeling the water-soil regime and transport of dissolved substances
    [44]. And, artificial neural networks, machine learning to use to develop strategies
    for irrigation management with given economic parameters to reduce water and energy
    consumption without compromising crop yields [45]–[47]. Yang et al. [48] proposed
    an integrated CNN model based on hyperspectral and RGB images taken at 5 stages
    of corn growth. Pang et al. [49] based on drone images using the combined convolutional
    neural network MaxArea Mask Scoring RCNN, areas of poor germination of corn were
    identified. The authors noted the high processing speed, however, does not allow
    the use of this system for real-time applications. Zhong et al. [50] recorded
    different stages of plant growth using a method based on a combination of time
    series with convolutional neural networks. Kuznetsova et al. [51], [52] use high-speed
    computer vision techniques YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 on a robotic crop picker. Despite
    a large amount of research, there are still many open problems in the field of
    optimal irrigation management using CPI systems. The variable rate irrigation
    approach has undoubtedly proven to be effective. However, an analysis of the current
    state of research on VRI optimization by CPI systems allows us to identify the
    main problem points: The complexity of collecting the required data set, the lack
    of time series data on the state of a particular field, and crop yields in this
    field, considering the temporal climatic variability. Difficulty in choosing appropriate
    data analysis methods to find a compromise between the two paradigms for monitoring
    spatial variability - water properties in soil and plant health. Difficulty in
    applying more accurate methods of intellectual analysis in dynamics during the
    entire agricultural season. Difficulty in the technical implementation of the
    proposed solutions, for example, expensive sensors, sensors, and other equipment.
    With current advances in proximal and non-invasive sensing technologies, IOTs
    can provide a wealth of information about soil, crops, and related environmental
    properties, and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze all this data are
    contributing to new approaches to improve the situation. The use of computer vision
    systems for condition monitoring seems to be quite interesting due to the relatively
    inexpensive implementation and the possibility of using more accurate methods
    of intellectual analysis. Optimal variable rate irrigation management requires
    a combination of both computer vision systems and additional climate and remote
    sensing data to detect Spatio-temporal dynamic variability in crop water requirements.
    The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for optimizing irrigation
    by creating dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions. It is based on the implementation
    of regular monitoring of the state of crops and the environment through phytoindication,
    as well as forecasting the dynamic variability of the state of water availability
    to improve irrigation. The proposed solutions offer a combination of neural network
    approaches, from the use of multilayer artificial neural networks to pattern recognition
    and convolution neural networks. The algorithm of the proposed approach is as
    follows: At the first step, the Phyto monitoring of the state of the agricultural
    crop and the environment is carried out based on computer vision using convolution
    neural networks. At the second step, a dynamic variable forecast is constructed
    based on the time series of data of average daily air temperature (T), amount
    of precipitation (R), Air humidity (AH), Wind speed (WS), and Normalized Difference
    Water Index (NDWI) -ability of water availability based on multilayer artificial
    neural networks. As a result, we obtain dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions
    based on the classification procedure of the results of the first two neural networks.
    SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Materials The study was conducted in the
    Saratov region of the Russian Federation. Russia has significant soil and water
    resources, but the largest part of its land used for agricultural production is
    in areas of risky agriculture with insufficient or excessive modes of natural
    moisture. Only 2% of the land in the Russian Federation is in optimal moisture
    conditions. The main share of agricultural products (in value terms) is produced
    in the arid zone, where more than 78% of arable land is concentrated. The land
    reclamation fund of the Russian Federation amounted to an area of 9.45 million
    hectares of which 75% was used, including 4.67 million hectares of irrigated land,
    of which 82% was used and 4.78 million hectares of drained land, of which 68%
    were used [46]. The Volga region is one of the largest regions of Russia, where
    land reclamation is developed. The Saratov Region occupies about 10% of the total
    area of the Volga Federal District. The Volga Federal District is in third place
    among the federal districts in terms of reclaimed lands and the leader in terms
    of the percentage of irrigated lands in good condition. Among all regions, the
    Saratov region ranks first in the district in terms of the area of reclaimed land
    - 19%. The main climatic parameters of the irrigated zone of the Saratov region
    are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 The Main Climatic Parameters of the Study Area
    The sums of air humidity deficits in the warm season increase from north to south
    from 1800 to 2200 millibars. On the contrary, the sums of active temperatures
    decrease in the same direction from 3500 to 3000 °C. The zonal soils of the left-bank
    regions (the main irrigation zone) of the Saratov region are classified as southern
    chernozems, chestnut of various subtypes (dark-chestnut, light-chestnut, and chestnut
    proper), as well as brown semi-desert in the extreme southeast of the left bank.
    In terms of the content of organic matter, the soils of the Left Bank are rather
    poor: it varies within 3.0 … 5.0% in southern chernozems, 2.5 … 4.0% in dark chestnut
    soils; 1.5 … 3.0% for light chestnut and chestnut. In the natural and climatic
    zone of the Saratov region, there is significant spatial variability of natural
    conditions, primarily soil, geomorphological, hydrogeological. Analysis of the
    data of the geoinformation system for monitoring irrigated lands showed that within
    the framework of the site of one farm, they can be located on 133 contours of
    29 soil differences. Moreover, individual irrigated fields were located on several
    soil differences - from 2 to 5. The quantitative and qualitative composition of
    irrigation techniques plays an important role both in the condition of irrigated
    lands and in increasing the efficiency of agricultural production on irrigated
    lands. In Russia about 22% of CPI systems are used; in the melioration complex
    of the Saratov region, these systems are the main ones. To collect data, experimental
    studies were carried out in the Engelsky district of the Saratov region of Russia
    (experimental farm ≪ Povolgy ≫ of the Saratov State Agrarian University). The
    irrigated area is equipped with the Center Pivot Irrigation (CPI) system ≪ Cascade
    ≫ . It is equipped with GPS trackers, cameras and real-time data is displayed
    in the ≪ Agrosignal ≫ digital platform for agribusiness management (Figure 1).
    In addition, the ≪ Agrosignal ≫ system allows collecting data on weather, soil
    condition, and basic agrotechnical information about crops, equipment operation
    based on weather station sensors, remote sensing, etc. In this study, the following
    data were used: Climatic data - wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative
    air humidity, temperature and humidity of foliage and soil, atmospheric pressure,
    amount of precipitation. Indices - Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). CPI
    information - speed. FIGURE 1. The ≪ Agrosignal ≫ system window. Show All An example
    of a date-set of climatic data for a month (June 2020) is given in Table 2. The
    Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) provides information on both the spatial
    distribution of water stress on vegetation and its temporal development. The example
    of an image of the NDWI index for the experimental site is shown in Figure 2.
    TABLE 2 Data-set: Climatic Data FIGURE 2. NDWI index snapshot. Show All The second
    component of our system is based on biological methods for diagnosing anthropogenic
    changes - this is both the state of the agricultural crop itself and the state
    of the environment. The active use of these methods is associated with the quick
    reaction of organisms to any deviations in the environment from the norm. In our
    study, these are the parameters of the soil condition in the irrigated area. Control
    is necessary for almost all-important parameters of the state of the soil. These
    include the provision of soil with moisture, mechanical composition, type of oxidation-reduction
    regime, etc. We use an approach based on determining the qualitative properties
    of the soil using indicator plants. It is based [53] considering the species diversity
    of macrophytes and their indicator significance. Phytoindicators are called plants,
    plant communities, or their features that indicate some specific properties of
    the environment. Phytoindication is one of the practical uses of various traits
    and properties of individual plants or plant communities and their complexes to
    obtain qualitative and sometimes quantitative characteristics of the environment.
    With the help of plants, it is possible to identify individual characteristics
    of soils: their texture, moisture, acidity, salinity, nutrient supply. Figure
    3 shows plant bioindicators used in our study. FIGURE 3. Plants—bioindicators
    and the main crop: 1) Cirsium arvense, 2) chamomile, 3) wormwood, 4) main crop—corn.
    Show All B. Calculation of the Vegetation Index For better localization of plants
    in the image, we use the vegetation index. This increases the contrast between
    vegetation and soil. Three bands of the spectrum are used as color sources: red
    (R), green (G), and blue (B). Since the encoding of each band is carried out in
    the range from 0 to 255, we normalize the image using (1): r= b= R R+G+B ;g= G
    R+G+B ; B R+G+B ;r+g+b=1 (1) View Source Considering the peculiarities of the
    object of study of video filming, we are interested in the index of excess green
    (ExG) (1) and excess red (ExR) (2). Based on these indices, the ExGR index (3)
    is created. ExG= ExR= ExGR= 2g−r−b 1.4r−b ExG−ExR (2) (3) (4) View Source The
    ExGR index results (Figure 4) in an image in which pixels range from positive
    (plant) to negative (soil and residues) values. This allows segmentation without
    the need for additional processing tools such as Otsu, Niblack, etc. FIGURE 4.
    Images of corn plants at different stages of growth: 1), 3), and 5) color image
    and 2), 4), and 6) image binarized using the ExGR index. Show All C. Using a Descriptor
    The HOG method assumes that the type of distribution of image intensity gradients
    makes it possible to accurately determine the presence and shape of objects present
    on it. The image is split into cells. Histograms hi of the directed gradients
    of the interior points are calculated in the cells. They are combined into one
    bar chart h = f ( h 1 ,…, h k ), after which it is normalized in brightness. The
    normalization factor can be obtained in several ways, but they show approximately
    the same results. We will use the following: h L = h ∥h∥ 2 2 + ε 2 − − − − − −
    − − √ (5) View Source where ∥h∥ 2 – used norm, ε – some small constant. When calculating
    the gradients, the image is convolved with the kernels [−1, 0, 1] and [−1, 0,
    1]T, as a result of which two matrices Dx and Dy of derivatives along the x and
    y axes are formed, respectively. These matrices are used to calculate the angles
    and magnitudes of the gradients at each point in the image. Figure 5 (2, 4, 6)
    shows the result of applying the HOG method to an image processed using vegetation
    index 5 (1, 3, 5). For clarity, only the magnitude of the gradient is shown (the
    brighter the pixel, the larger the gradient). FIGURE 5. Images of corn plants
    at different stages of growth: 1), 3), and 5) in grayscale, obtained using the
    ExGR index and 2), 4), and 6) obtained by the HOG method. Show All The scale-invariant
    feature transform (SIFT) descriptor is used to extract feature points from the
    image, which are later used in classifiers. The key point in finding them is building
    a pyramid of Gaussians and the difference of Gaussians. Gaussian - image blurred
    with a Gaussian filter: L(x,y,σ)=G(x,y,σ)∗I(x,y), (6) View Source with coordinates
    (x,y) and blur radius σ ; G(x,y,σ) – Gaussian kernel; I(x,y) – the value of the
    original image; ∗ - convolution operation. The difference of Gaussians is an image
    obtained by pixel-by-pixel subtraction of the Gaussian of the original image from
    a Gaussian with a different blur radius ( kσ ): D(x,y,σ)=L(x,y,kσ)−L(x,y,σ) (7)
    View Source A pyramid of Gaussians and Gaussian differences is constructed. When
    moving from one level of the pyramid to another, the dimensions of the images
    are halved. After building the pyramids, the singular points are determined, which
    are the local extrema of the difference of the Gaussians. False key points are
    discarded, and for the remaining ones, their orientation is calculated. The magnitude
    of the gradient m and the direction of the gradient θ is determined from the (8)-(9):
    m(x,y)= θ(x,y)= ( (L(x+1,y)−L(x−1,y)) 2 + (L(x,y+1)−L(x,y−1)) 2 ) 1/2 tan −1 (
    L(x,y+1)−L(x,y−1) L(x+1,y)−L(x−1,y) ) (8) (9) View Source In the SIFT method,
    the descriptor is a vector. Take a 4×4 square area centered at the singular point,
    rotate following the direction of the singular point. Each element of the area
    indicates the magnitude of the gradient in eight directions. D. Image Classification
    Using BOVW BOVW is used to improve the performance of descriptors. This approach
    considers the blocks as key parts of the plant, and each block’s HOG represents
    the local information of the corresponding part. Next, we cluster the HOG of all
    the blocks in the training set into homogeneous groups using K-means, and the
    centers will be the mean value of the blocks’ HOG within the cluster. (We then
    group the HOGs of all the blocks in the training set into homogeneous groups using
    K-means, and the centers will be the average of the HOGs of the blocks in the
    cluster.) These centers will play the role of Visual-Words in BOVW (Figure 6).
    FIGURE 6. Steps to create a Visual-Words. Show All SECTION III. Experiments and
    Results A. Installation 8 IP cameras were installed on the irrigation system,
    connected to an 8-channel video recorder, constantly filming plants. For more
    efficient video recording, the cameras were not evenly fixed to the irrigation
    system. The first camera was installed at a remote point of the irrigation system.
    The removal of the rest was determined by (10): r i =K∗ (2i−1)/2 − − − − − − −
    − √ (10) View Source where i is the ordinal number of the chamber, starting from
    the axis of rotation of the irrigation system, ri is the distance to it. The K
    coefficient is obtained by substituting the number of chambers involved and the
    distance from the axis of rotation to the most distant point of the irrigation
    system into this formula. In our case, with a radius of the irrigation system
    equal to 370 meters, the coefficient is 95.5 meters. We used camcorders with a
    fixed focal length of 3.6 mm, matrix size 1/2.8, which allowed us to take pictures
    with a viewing angle of up to 96 degrees. The protection class of the camera is
    ip67. The protection class was fundamentally important because the cells were
    constantly exposed to streams of water. The large viewing angle of the video camera
    allows you to track the same plant from different angles while moving it. This
    allows you to collect much more information on each object under study, and therefore
    more accurately determine its state and phase of development. We abandoned cameras
    with a viewing angle greater than 100 degrees because we must perform additional
    preprocessing methods to correct aberrations that significantly distort the image.
    In addition, the greater the angle at which the plant is located to the vertical,
    the more overlap of parts of nearby growing plants on it, and this leads to serious
    errors in classification. Considering the height of the cameras above the ground
    (in our case, 1 meter, we came to the optimal sliding window with a size of 1
    * 1 m. Now about the shooting speed. The IP cameras used operate at a frequency
    of 30 Fpx. There is no point in processing all these frames. This would make our
    computer vision system extremely slow. The number of processed frames per second
    depends on the speed of movement of the irrigation unit and is determined from
    the following considerations: each plant that falls into the sliding window must
    be processed at least 2 times. For a linear speed of 0.5 m / s, the point farthest
    from the bore axis, from the outermost video camera, 1 image should be processed
    in 1 second. If you take images from all 8 cameras (the closer the camera is to
    the axis of rotation, the fewer shots you need to take per second), you need to
    process no more than 5 shots per second. If the number of weeds is not significant
    and the rotation speed of the extreme point does not exceed 1 m/s, the computer
    vision system works in real-time. When setting up the video system, special attention
    had to be paid to protecting the camera lenses from water droplets and fogging.
    If we use a cone-shaped casing from direct moisture penetration. B. Image Processing
    Techniques Initially, the vegetation index was calculated from the photograph,
    which was used to obtain a grayscale and binary image. For further image processing,
    we tested three high-performance methods: SIFT-SVM, HOG-BOVW-BPNN, and binarization
    by the ExGR - CNN index. For comparison, the outdated HOG-CNN method was tested
    along with them. The first two methods were applied to grayscale images, and the
    third to a binary image. All algorithms used in the work are implemented using
    the OpenCV Python library. The classification was made according to the following
    criteria: corn Figure 4, weed from the list of indicators Figure 3, weed. When
    corn is identified, the stage of growth is determined. To train the methods, a
    dataset was used, of 1500 corn plants at different stages of development. The
    dataset was marked by agricultural scientists working on the farm. In addition,
    a dataset with indicator plants was used (from 500 to 800 for each variety). The
    results of the methods are shown in Tables 3 and 4. TABLE 3 Results of the Work
    of Methods for the Determination of Indicator Plants and Corn Plants TABLE 4 The
    Results of Methods for Determining the Stage of Growth of Corn It can be seen
    from the results obtained that the classical HOG - CNN method is significantly
    inferior to any of the three selected. SIFT-SVM is not inferior to the other two
    in terms of processing speed, but the results of its work are slightly worse than
    the other two. We were unable to choose the best among the two remaining methods.
    Even though in the CNN method we used 3 x 3 convolutional kernels (this greatly
    accelerated it), the HOG-BOVW-BPNN method is 20% faster, but its classification
    results are slightly lower in sunny conditions. In cloudy weather, the results
    are reduced for both methods, but the HOG-BOVW-BPNN method is more stable in reducing
    the illumination level [54]. We assume that it makes sense to use both methods
    depending on the conditions. The results of these methods (tables 3 and 4) significantly
    exceed the results presented in works on computer vision in recent years [48]–[50].
    This is merit not only of modern methods of computer vision but also of successful
    shooting conditions. The sprinkler removes dust from plant leaves and the ExGR
    imaging method works most efficiently. C. Dynamic Maps of Irrigation Prescriptions
    A schematic representation of the key algorithm is shown in Table 5: TABLE 5 Algorithm
    In the previous works of the authors, a program [55] was developed for determining
    the optimal parameters of humidification in the calculated soil layer for the
    main crops, including corn, for a given region. This system also considers the
    phases of growth and development of the crop, the type, and the granulometric
    composition of the soil. Climate data is one of the main parameters, both in classical
    models such as AQUACROP and in models using artificial neural networks to predict
    crop water demand and water availability. In the developed system, a multilayer
    neural network model with input, hidden, and output layers were used. For training,
    the Resilient Propagation method was used, which has proven itself well in this
    kind of problem. Our work considers several criteria when creating an irrigation
    map. In addition to the standard ones, such as humidity, temperature, etc. we
    consider the current state of the crop itself relative to the planned one and
    the presence of indicator plants. The neural network we use (Figure 7) was trained
    using a sample labeled by agronomists based on many years of research on the dependence
    of the state of the crop on the moisture deficit for a given climatic zone. For
    each specific case from the sample, they compared the irrigation correction factor.
    The HOG descriptor in the monitoring system was not chosen by chance in our work.
    One of the main advantages over other descriptors is that it is very resistant
    to lighting changes. Its performance changes slightly in the conditions in which
    shooting is usually done. FIGURE 7. The process of obtaining a map of irrigation
    of crops for corn: a) map of deviation of the real development of corn plants
    from the norm; b) a map of the location of indicator plants; c) current NDWI;
    d) water availability variability map; e) maps of irrigation of crops for corn.
    Show All Based on the results obtained using the HOG - BOVW - BPNN method and
    binarization according to the ExGR - CNN index, the growth stages of plants caught
    in the camera lens are determined. These data are compared with the planned indicators
    for the given area. Figure 7 (a) presents the results of the deviation in development
    from the planned indicators for 10–15 days of growth (6 plant’s leaf). Figure
    7 (a) shows the center of the reference scale. Each new division differs from
    the previous one by 1 day of vegetation. The scale is not limited to five values
    and extends both in one direction and in the other direction. The yellow area
    is normal, the red area indicates a lag in plant development from the norm, and
    the green areas are ahead. Our model also considers the distribution of indicator
    plants over figure 7(b). The yellow area corresponds to an area with an undetected
    predominance of plants that prefer moist soils and dry-loving ones. In terms of
    numbers, this is either a complete absence of both types of plants or, the overweight
    of one of the types is no more than two times. This corresponds to a value of
    3 on the scale figure 7(b). Other values are determined according to the principle:
    prevalence of moisture-loving over dry-loving in the range from 2 to 4 times;
    prevalence of moisture-loving over dry-loving in the range from 4 to 8 times;
    etc. Similarly, zones with a predominance of dry-loving plants are determined.
    Another element that we will consider when planning the irrigation of the field
    is NDWI figure 7(c). We receive the current value of this indicator once every
    10 days. To establish the correct irrigation regime, we created a neural network
    that, using previous NDWI results and weather reports, predicts the dynamic variability
    of water availability for some time ahead. All parameters supplied to the neural
    network are presented in numerical values: NDWI color gradations are set according
    to the standard. They are converted into numerical values in the range from 0
    to 1, where 0 is white (lack of moisture in the soil), 1 is dark blue (wetland).
    Intermediate values are calculated according to the shades of blue. Cloudiness
    is determined by discrete values from its absence - 0, to complete obscurity of
    the sun’s clouds - 3. Air humidity - relative humidity ranging from 0 to 100%
    Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius. Wind speed is measured in meters per
    second. When training the neural network, we used NDWI data in size (100 images),
    data from weather stations for the period of the NDWI study. The neural network
    was trained using the Resilient Propagation method [56]. At the final stage of
    obtaining a map of watering corn, data from steps 1 and 2 are passed through the
    second neural network, which determines the lack of moisture in the soil. This
    neural network was trained using the Resilient Propagation method [55] Based on
    the dataset obtained in the experimental farm ≪ Povolgy ≫ of the Saratov State
    Agrarian University in 2020 and previously marked by agronomical scientists. The
    result of the network is a map of the field, divided into sections, indicating
    the amount of water required to irrigate 1 square meter of this section of the
    field. Considering the peculiarities of the sprinkler system, the whole field
    was divided into sectors figure 7(e). The parameters of each sector were determined
    based on the parameters of the sections of which it consists of. On this map,
    the yellow area is the base area. It determines the average amount of moisture
    required for a given field. The red area means that this sector requires more
    moisture than average, the green area requires less moisture relative to the norm.
    The distribution of percentages of the total area under the influence of the prescription
    in each irrigation plan with a dynamic prescription for 6 irrigation actions is
    shown in Figure 8. FIGURE 8. Distribution of percentages of the total area under
    the influence of the dynamic prescription. Show All Computer vision’s-based monitoring
    allows for a dynamic assessment of the actual state of culture and depending on
    the stage of development. Along with the forecast of water availability, this
    makes it possible to overestimate the irrigation rate. So, for example, for irrigation
    actions 5-6, which corresponded to August-September, zones were identified where
    the culture reached late stages of growth and, as a result, a decrease in the
    amount of irrigation is possible, in contrast to standard prescriptions, as can
    be seen in Figure 8. We carried out a comparative analysis of water consumption
    when implementing a standard irrigation strategy and a variable irrigation strategy
    based on dynamic prescription maps. Let us introduce the notation: P i − standard
    irrigation rate corresponding to the i-th irrigation action. S – the area of irrigation
    plot, S j – part of the area of the irrigation plot under the influence of the
    prescription j. S= ∑ 5 j=1 S j (11) View Source Then the irrigation amount with
    standard irrigation, corresponding to the i-th irrigation action. IA i st =S P
    i (12) View Source Irrigation amount with dynamic prescription, corresponding
    to the i-th irrigation action. IA i D = ∑ 5 j=1 S j ( k i j P i ), (13) View Source
    where k i j – irrigation correction factor for S j , corresponding to the i-th
    irrigation action, k i j ={0,8;0,9;1;1,1;1,2} . Irrigation correction factor k
    i j is a numerical expression of the dynamic prescription map obtained as a result
    of the third step of the algorithm. Further development of the method involves
    an increase in the set of k i j values, which will lead to an improvement in the
    efficiency of irrigation water use and productivity. The decrease in the amount
    of irrigation water (in%) because of the implementation of a variable irrigation
    strategy instead of the standard one can be calculated because of maps of dynamic
    prescriptions, the number of irrigation measures, and the established correction
    factors based on (11)-(13). The data of experimental studies of the volume of
    irrigation with standard irrigation and the volume of irrigation with dynamic
    irrigation for the purpose show an increase in this indicator in each irrigation
    action from 0.3% to 1.8%, which gives an increase in total for all irrigations
    of 7.4%. At the same time, the efficiency of the use of irrigation water, which
    links the yield of crops per unit of water used, increases due to an increase
    in yield by 8.9%. SECTION IV. Discussion The irrigation technique plays an important
    role both in the condition of irrigated land and in improving the efficiency of
    agricultural production on irrigated land. In Russia, as well as on a global scale,
    about 22 -23% of CPI systems are used. One method for irrigation management is
    VRI, but the high implementation and management costs limit its application. On
    the one hand, the recently appeared agribusiness management systems such as “Agrosignal”
    allow collecting huge amounts of data, and on the other hand, even the simplest
    analogs of CPI systems have control panels with speed control modules, which makes
    it possible to implement inexpensive irrigation control systems … For this, it
    is necessary to develop maps of irrigation prescriptions that consider the spatial-temporal
    variability of the irrigation site. The purpose of this study was to develop neural
    network methods for determining dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions for automatic
    speed control using 1) phytoindication based on computer vision of the states
    of crops; 2) phytoindication based on computer vision of the state of the soil
    by plants - indicators; 3) intellectual analysis of data from monitoring systems
    of environmental conditions, the water indices, as well as the knowledge base
    of the optimal parameters of irrigation of crops in the region. The question of
    defining irrigation zones is fundamental in this kind of research [13], [14].
    From a formal point of view, the difference in approaches depends on the sets
    of available data, methods, and tools for their analysis. In [12], three main
    areas are indicated: measurements of soil electrical conductivity, monitoring
    of vegetation indices based on satellite images, and data on yield. The study
    [12], was based on mapping the NDVI at a certain time for different purposes.
    From the point of view of methods, artificial intelligence methods were used to
    calculate important parameters of irrigation, such as soil moisture and salinity,
    modeling the water-soil regime and the transfer of solutes [41]–[44]. However,
    all these approaches have drawbacks and require further research. There is an
    acute issue of the need to create maps of prescriptions in dynamics since the
    state of plants and the environment has a high dynamic of changes. The so-called
    dynamic spatial-temporal adaptation is needed. And the accuracy of such adaptation
    can be achieved only by using a combination of artificial intelligence methods.
    In our study, to determine dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions for automatic
    speed control, we used the methods of artificial neural networks, data mining,
    and phytoindication based on computer vision of the state of crops and the state
    of the soil by plants - indicators. Our model is field-tested in 2020. The key
    factors in assessing the impact of an irrigation strategy are crop yields and
    the amount of irrigation water used. An 8.9% increase in corn yields was recorded
    compared to a plot using conventional irrigation. In addition, the data indicate
    an improvement in the efficiency of irrigation water use. The limitation of this
    study is the impossibility of assessing the productivity of each site through
    the yield map, which will be done in the future. Phytoindications based on computer
    vision of the state of the soil by plants - indicators can be an additional simple
    and cheap tool for analyzing the state of the soil in contrast to the rather expensive
    and not always available to farmers methods of chemical analysis. This study demonstrates
    the possibility of widespread use of artificial intelligence methods, contrary
    to the opinion about the complexity and high cost of such solutions. Further research
    will focus on scaling the results for different farms and climatic conditions
    with a full assessment of economic efficiency. SECTION V. Conclusion Climate change
    has direct implications for the availability of water, which requires the development
    of strategies to optimize its use. Conventional irrigation systems are based on
    the application of a uniform flow across the field, considered as a single spatial
    unit. However, fields can often have spatial heterogeneity in soil characteristics,
    relief, microclimate, and crop development. Improving the efficiency of water
    use is one of the main tasks facing the heads of farms today. A large area of
    crops with a pivot irrigation system both in Russia and in the world requires
    a differentiated response to irrigation management. The study is focused on the
    development of neural network methods (from multilayer artificial neural networks
    to pattern recognition and convolutional neural networks) to optimize irrigation
    by creating dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions using 1) regular monitoring
    of the state of crops and the environment through phytoindication; 3) predicting
    the dynamic variability of the state of water supply, as well as a knowledge base
    on the optimal parameters of irrigation of crops in the region. Since agribusiness
    management systems, such as the “Agrosignal” system we use, are now often used
    by farmers, the use of complex methods of artificial intelligence is becoming
    more accessible. The results of the implementation showed a positive trend in
    decreasing spatial variability and increasing corn yields in this field. Sensor
    information, remote sensing, and neural network techniques have proven to be effective
    in defining dynamic control zones and are attractive due to the ease with which
    they can be implemented at the field scale. This relatively simple approach is
    quite inexpensive for the farmer and can be implemented on a large scale, which
    represents an important and sustainable contribution to improving water use efficiency
    in agriculture, especially in the current scenario of global warming and decreasing
    available water for agriculture. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    of Things (IoT) provides connectivity to the objects that monitor and sense the
    environment to integrate physical world with digital world. If IoT is enabled
    in the Smart Grid (SG), it can benefit from advantages of the IoT such as interoperability,
    connectivity, etc. By combining the IoT with energy harvesting (EH) and cognitive
    radio (CR) techniques, the problems of SG, such as harsh channel conditions and
    limited battery power, may be resolved. Hence, incorporation of EH and CR reveals
    a new networking paradigm for IoT-enabled SG. To this end, we first introduce
    CR usage in the IoT-enabled SG, and explain the advantages and challenges of CRs.
    Furthermore, we propose EH approaches for the resource constraint of wireless
    devices in the IoT-enabled SG. Operation and node architecture of energy harvesting
    cognitive radios (EH-CR), and network architecture of the IoT-enabled SG are described
    to explain details of our networking paradigm. Open issues and future research
    directions are discussed to enable this new paradigm. Similar content being viewed

    at different IoT layers Article 10 May 2021 Internet of Things: Challenges and
    Opportunities Chapter © 2014 1 Introduction The IoT paradigm provides connectivity
    to objects for information exchange from one remote place to another via the Internet
    [1, 2]. These objects sense the physical world and harvest information about it,
    and send the harvested data to remote users via the Internet. It provides the
    accessibility of information from anywhere in anytime. These objects form interconnected
    networks that are self-configurable and intelligent. Hence, the IoT is utilized
    in a number of applications such as e-health monitoring, transportation, environment
    monitoring, and logistic management [3]. As the IoT extends the wireless communication
    by providing connectivity among the objects, SG supports evolution of electrical
    power system by the utilization of next generation communication techniques [4,
    5]. It paves the road for more agile grid with increased efficiency, reliability
    and security. The energy demand, aging infrastructure of the electric grid and
    varying energy production due to renewable energy resources are some challenges
    of the SG. Furthermore, it provides real-time remote monitoring of the SG equipments
    for power provisioning, estimating failures, capacity limitations and blackouts
    [4, 6]. This provides an effective monitoring of the electric grid and control
    for safe, reliable and efficient power delivery in the SG [7]. Wireless sensor
    networks are main components of the IoT, and they form a digital skin of the observed
    system. From this point of view, enabling the IoT in the SG is a fundamental step
    toward the realization of it. The SG can benefit from the application of the IoT
    technology since the IoT enables smart monitoring of the environment, which is
    the main goal of the SG. Utilization of the IoT provides efficient management
    of resources by smart meters, home gateways, smart plugs and connected appliances
    via the Internet since it ensures efficient communication between consumers and
    utility providers, which provides efficiency in energy production and consumption
    [8]. Satisfaction of consumers’ requirements and energy production from alternative
    resources cause a very dynamic environment and require efficient management of
    the electric grid. Autonomous monitoring, diagnosis and control, and efficient
    operation of the power equipments for the power generation, and distribution require
    monitoring and actuating devices [9]. Hence, the inclusion of the IoT in the SG
    is important. This will increase the utilization of information and communication
    technologies in the SG and provide effective management of power grid system [10].
    Empowering the SG with the IoT technology will lead a new paradigm, i.e., IoT-enabled
    SG. An IoT-enabled SG architecture can be seen in Fig. 1, which shows that the
    elements of the SG communicate over the Internet. The nodes, which are named as
    energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CR) in sequel, are our IoT wireless devices,
    and they access the Internet via access point. The condition of power grid elements,
    their energy production, the consumption of the energy are observed and measured
    via the IoT devices. The observations and measurements are sent over multiple
    hops to reach the Internet gateway, i.e., access point, to send them to remote
    areas for necessary actions to be taken in the IoT-enabled SG. Power consumption
    in industrial, commercial and residential sites can be monitored, and the power
    generated by renewable energy resources can be observed in real time via the Internet.
    For this architecture, SG benefits from the advantages of IoT, which are support
    for the communication of heterogeneous wireless devices, flexibility and context-awareness.
    This provides also better management of the grid with the Internet connection
    between SG components, which increases accessibility. Fig. 1 IoT-enabled SG Architecture
    Full size image Enabling wireless technologies for the communication across the
    Internet are Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, and satellite [11]. On the other hand, the standards
    used in the IoT environments are IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 for local areas.
    Hence, IoT devices to realize the SG operate mostly on ISM bands. However, these
    bands are heavily utilized. The over-utilization decreases the communication quality
    and increases the energy consumption of the resource-constrained wireless devices
    in the SG due to collisions. Furthermore, communication links have high packet
    error rates and variable link capacity due to the SG specific challenges such
    as electromagnetic interferences and equipment noise [9, 12, 13]. Hence, the channel
    conditions are generally harsh in the SG environment [14], which results in a
    dynamic delay and capacity variations in the SG networks. To overcome these challenges,
    CR technology can be utilized in the SG applications [15] so that the IoT nodes
    in the SG can access spectrum bands, which have better channel characteristics,
    in a dynamic manner. CR has special functionalities, which enables it to utilize
    licensed bands opportunistically, are spectrum sensing, spectrum decision and
    spectrum hand-off [16]. With the spectrum sensing, idle licensed channels are
    determined. Afterwards, CR can resolve the problems of spatio-temporal variation
    on the channel characteristics, reliability, latency, harsh propagation conditions
    and collisions due to excessive use of certain channels by utilizing idle licensed
    channels [9]. Wireless nodes in the IoT-enabled SG are resource constrained. In
    spite of the recent advancements in ultra-low power (ULP) transceiver and processor
    technologies, a conventional battery tends to deplete less than a year. This issue
    necessitates periodic replenishment and maintenance, however, the excessive numbers
    of the deployed elements, the tasks that are being fulfilled and the randomness
    of depletion times make this option impractical. Therefore, the need for a self-sustaining
    mechanism becomes more apparent to overcome limited power supply difficulty of
    IoT nodes. Although an auxiliary and/or a totally distinct source can contribute
    this aim sufficiently, EH methods come to the forefront as the energy that can
    be provided by these techniques is theoretically unlimited. As there are numerous
    potential alternatives, i.e, environmental and non-environmental, to gather energy,
    temperature and motion variations; electromagnetic fields, radio frequency signals;
    and light propagations can be regarded as the well-studied ones of these techniques.
    EH eases the problem of limited supply for IoT-enabled SG. There are two fundamental
    problems in the domain of IoT, which are spectrum scarcity and resource constraint.
    They are intensified if the IoT is utilized in the SG since wireless channel conditions
    and environment in the SG are harsher than those of any other IoT domain. In this
    paper, we propose a new networking paradigm, energy harvesting cognitive radio
    networking (EH-CRN) for IoT-enabled SG, which utilizes two important techniques,
    namely energy harvesting and cognitive radio. The contributions of this paper
    are to provide a framework to merge these techniques to eliminate the problems
    of IoT-enabled SG and to introduce challenges, the potential advantages of this
    new paradigm, and to present network and node architectures. To this end, we first
    explain the usage of CR in the IoT-enabled SG. Afterwards, we outline the existing
    EH techniques and how they can contribute to the realization of IoT-enabled SG.
    We overview the operation of the energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CRs),
    and explain their node and network architectures. We also state open issues and
    future research directions to realize EH-CRN for IoT-enabled SG. The paper is
    organized as follows. CR usage in IoT-enabled SG is explained in Section 2. EH
    techniques for IoT-enabled SG are outlined in Section 3. The node and network
    architectures, their operation, and open research issues are discussed in Section
    4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Cognitive radios in IoT-enabled smart
    grid The centralized management of the electric grid has experienced a paradigm
    shift toward the SG. It enables the two way communication, which connects the
    consumer side and the utility companies [5]. This paradigm provides an efficient
    management and control of the grid in a better way. SG brings the capability of
    monitoring of demand and supply in real time. Hence, SG adds new services to the
    customers, in which they can adjust their energy consumption according to the
    demand and supply balance. To enable the concept of the SG, it should be integrated
    with the next-generation information and communication technologies having the
    ability of sensing and broadband wireless communication, supporting ubiquitous
    computing and adaptive control [17]. This will increase the stability of the electric
    grid, decrease unnecessary power consumption, predict communication blackouts,
    and provide security of the grid and power provisioning. According to [17], sensing,
    transmission and control are the basic functionalities that are being offered
    by the SG infrastructure. Smart meters and sensors are the key components for
    sensing operations. Depending on the transmission scheme, sensed data reach to
    the controller or centralized coordinator/gateway via multiple hops. The SG covers
    a large geographical area, which makes the communication infeasible due to the
    harsh environmental conditions and the increased distance between communicating
    parties. Hence, the communication architecture of the SG is divided into three
    main groups, which are home/building area networks (HANs/BANs), neighborhood area
    networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs) [15, 17,18,19]. The sensors in
    homes are essential parts of HAN. They send their readings to the local access
    points. HANs in a neighborhood constitutes a NAN, and a NAN connects the grid
    to the core utility systems [15]. SG’s WAN is the network that covers the core
    network and the backhaul network [15]. For the connection of these networks wireless
    communication is utilized. When we look at the overall SG network, there is a
    hierarchical communication infrastructure [19]. Sensor nodes may be deployed in
    different parts of the electrical power system, which make them vital components
    of the SG. The deployment of the sensor nodes on the grid realizes the efficient
    and reliable power flow from the generation units to the end users [14]. These
    sensors provide monitoring of the power systems and diagnosing failures, which
    prevent the outages, and increase the reliability and efficiency of the electric
    grid [14, 21]. The SG benefits from the advantages of wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs), which are easy deployment, collaborative effort for sensing, support for
    increased coverage, flexible operation and low cost. This provides inexpensive
    monitoring and diagnostic system for the SG [22]. The use of wireless sensor nodes
    poses some challenges in the SG. These challenges can be summarized as harsh channel
    conditions, reliability and latency requirements, bit error rate and channel capacity
    variation, and the limited power capability of the sensor nodes [14]. Conditions
    in SG may deteriorate the wireless channel by high humidity, dirt, dust and vibrations
    [23]. These environment-related parameters are also harmful for the sensor nodes.
    Furthermore, different SG applications would have various quality of service (QoS)
    requirements. For instance, monitoring a transformer vault demands a strict delay
    requirement to decrease the repair time by reporting the failure within a restricted
    time. Hence, the deployed sensor nodes should satisfy different levels of QoS.
    Also, the electrical systems in the SG cause variation in the noise level and
    interference in these environments may be high. These situations result in variation
    of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which causes deviations
    in the channel capacity. Furthermore, limited battery power and processing capability
    require highly energy-efficient protocols. The most important challenge is the
    collisions and resulting redundant energy consumption due to over-utilization
    of the unlicensed bands. Although there are some studies to increase the context
    awareness of the SG, few of them consider the spectrum-awareness of the devices
    deployed in the SG [24]. These studies provide recognition in the spectrum usage.
    CR technology is proposed to support spectrum-awareness in wireless communications.
    The motivations behind this technology are to overcome the spectrum scarcity challenge
    and to dynamically use the underutilized licensed spectrum bands [25]. CR technology
    provides sharing licensed spectrum bands with primary users (PUs), which are the
    owners of these bands. In order to utilize these bands while the PUs are not active,
    CRs can change their transmitting parameters to operate on the vacant channel
    [26]. There are two main characteristics of CRs, which are cognitive capability
    and reconfigurability [25, 26]. With the cognitive capability, the idle spectrum
    bands are detected, and the best channel among these idle channels is selected
    for the communication without any interference to the PUs. With reconfigurability,
    CR can operate in different frequencies and reconfigure its parameters for the
    best performance. The use of the idle licensed spectrum bands increases spectrum
    utilization and decreases the traffic in ISM bands. Hence, collisions due to the
    excessive utilization of the unlicensed spectrum bands are decreased, which provides
    efficient spectrum usage and energy-efficiency. The cognitive capability of the
    nodes is possible with cognitive functionalities. They are spectrum sensing, spectrum
    decision and spectrum hand-off. Spectrum sensing gives the ability of revealing
    the radio spectrum band usage in the licensed bands. Spectrum decision is the
    process that the band for the transmission is decided. Furthermore, a radio with
    CR capability must vacate the licensed channel if this channel become occupied.
    This process is performed by the spectrum hand-off functionality. Using these
    features, nodes with CR capability can coexist with the licensed users, which
    are the license holders of that spectrum band. Although CR provides advantages
    for the wireless communication, it poses challenges such as dynamic radio environment.
    If CR technology is utilized in the SG, it also intensifies the challenges posed
    by the SG itself. The IoT paradigm has a goal to connect every electronic device
    to the Internet [1, 2]. It leads to the integration of different technologies
    and communication techniques. Hence, the devices within the IoT should communicate
    with different types of communication devices. The IoT is regarded as a union
    of wireless devices via the Internet to observe and sense the environment, and
    to monitor the surrounding. This paradigm has been evolving the way we communicate,
    most importantly, the standards of living since it finds many application areas
    such as transportation manufacturing, logistics, management of cities etc. [2].
    With the emergence of the IoT, the Internet has been evolved in such a way that
    Network of Interconnected objects senses the environment and actuates accordingly
    by using Internet services for communication, data transfer and analysis of the
    sensed data [1]. From this point of view, the SG has the same characteristics
    since it covers the electrical grid to sense for providing intelligence on demand
    and supply side. Furthermore, the sensing from houses to the generation side provides
    less energy loss, immediate response to the grid failures and easy adaptation
    to new systems [27]. Hence, integration of the SG with the IoT helps better monitoring
    and management of the electrical grid. This integration will also provide IoT
    services such as broad connectivity, privacy, interoperability between the heterogeneous
    wireless devices and access to the cloud computing systems. Internet connection
    of the SG and addressing the sensing and actuator devices in the Internet domain
    provide flexibility, reliability, efficiency and adaptation. Hence, SG can adopt
    the services provided by the IoT. However, the Internet connection via wireless
    links and the communication between the sensing and actuator devices in the SG
    suffers from the harsh channel conditions such as high path loss exponent and
    shadowing deviation [14] and changing spectrum characteristics over time and space
    [7]. Hence, CR may also be solution to overcome these challenges to provide unique
    reliability and requirements by dynamic spectrum access and decrease the energy
    consumption of the wireless devices by avoiding the collisions with adapting its
    operating frequency according to the spectrum sensing. 2.1 Advantages of CR in
    IoT-enabled SG Cognitive cycle operations provides awareness in frequency usage.
    Dynamic adaption to the frequency bands and opportunistic usage of the licensed
    channels increase the spectrum utilization and communication efficiency. The advantages
    of CR in IoT-enabled SG can be outlined as follows [7]. Adaptation to the environmental
    conditions: The harsh conditions of a band can be eliminated by changing the operating
    frequency to channels with less noise level. Accessing to underutilized licensed
    spectrum: With the spectrum sensing, idle channels are utilized, efficiency of
    these bands is increased. Resistance to the varying link capacity: Due to varying
    channel conditions, CR can dynamically hop to the frequency bands with higher
    link capacity. The ability of existence with different type of networks: Due to
    the CR capability, they can coexist with different type of networks since they
    can opportunistically access to the spectrum. This advantage supports operation
    with different technologies due to IoT feature in SG. 2.2 Challenges of CR capable
    IoT-enabled SG The challenges for the realization of the SG are empowered by inclusion
    in the IoT paradigm and the utilization of CR. The IoT requires scalable, energy
    efficient and flexible solutions. Furthermore, the solutions must support spectrum-awareness
    if CR is utilized. Hence, the challenges of CR capable IoT-enabled SG can be outlined
    as follows [14]. Excessive overall data transfer: Since there is a large number
    of wireless devices in the IoT-enabled SG, the overall sensing data conveyed to
    the control center may result in huge amount. Opportunistic wireless transfer
    of this data will pose a great challenge without any excessive interference to
    PUs. Balancing the energy resources: Due to the variations between the demand
    and supply, balancing the energy resources and the determination of their share
    is a difficult task. Spectrum-aware communication between the demand and supply
    side with the harsh environmental condition of the IoT-enabled SG poses a challenge.
    Dynamic licensed user activity: Interference to the licensed users should be less
    than a certain threshold. Variation in the traffic: Due to the activities on the
    user side, the traffic flowing from the user side to the supply side varies. Satisfying
    different levels of QoS: SG can have a wide variety of QoS level due to diverse
    SG applications. Satisfaction of all the users in SG is a challenging task. 3
    Existing methods of energy harvesting Existing techniques of energy scavenging
    is broadly categorized into two groups as Harvest-Use and Harvest-Store- Use,
    where these can be further sub-categorized as controllable and uncontrollable
    [28]. By regarding this separation and the frequency of preference some leading
    EH methods are discussed below, and a detailed comparison is presented in Table
    1. Table 1 Comparison of the existing EH techniques [31] Full size table 3.1 Energy
    harvesting from light sources Power extraction from light sources is a well-known
    technique of EH in which the energy carried by photons is converted into utilizable
    electrical power with respect to a chemical phenomenon, namely photo-voltaic (PV)
    effect [28, 29]. In outdoor, solar energy is efficiently exploited to power various
    systems and applications, thanks to its sufficient power rating, and implementation
    flexibility. One of the most well-established applications of sunlight EH, in
    terms of wireless networking, can be regarded as intelligent surveillance and
    advanced control of grid assets over the Internet since the electrical power grid
    related elements are in widespread. This aspect also contributes to the realization
    of SG and Smart City visions. However, as a corollary of being environmental,
    the energy that can be gathered by sunlight illumination is highly affected by
    ambient factors. For indoor applications, more specialized PV materials, which
    are better suited for diffused lights, are being developed for profiting from
    any kind of light propagation to build HANs/BANs [28]. Although the period of
    harvesting is much longer on the contrary of sunlight’s daytime constraint, the
    energy that can be gathered by artificial lights is roughly one third of sunlight
    energy. 3.2 Thermal energy harvesting Thermal EH is based on a physical phenomenon,
    i.e., Seeback Effect, which occurs between conductor pairs. In brief, due to a
    thermal difference the junction expands in a certain direction that results in
    utilizable electrical power. The attainable energy can be easily adjusted by changing
    connection of the pairs as series and/or parallel [28]. Thermo-electric generation
    (TEG) can be regarded as an innate method for SG communications, where the temperature
    gradients between the grid assets and the environment are being utilized for providing
    energy to the wireless devices attached [30]. In small scale, mostly peltiers
    and/or thermocouples are preferred for low-power requiring time-uncritical consumer
    electronics solutions. It is also possible to energize the circuitries that are
    obliged to monitor the human bodies or any body-attached control systems by using
    the very same approach. As the devices are more likely to operate self-sustainably,
    they may suffer from the quite low power extraction efficiency of the TEG process
    [28, 31]. 3.3 Kinetic energy harvesting As the name suggest, kinetic energy conversion
    (KEC) means profiting from any mechanical stress and/or vibration resultant motion
    variation to gather power for wireless devices. KEC includes electrostatic, piezoelectric
    and electromagnetic methods to extract energy from mostly uncon- trollable but
    somehow predictable environmental sources, as well as partly-controllable and
    mostly unpredictable man-made actions [29]. Airflow EH, in particular, can be
    considered as one of the well-established power provision methods for SG applications,
    in which the wireless autonomous devices destined to surveil the grid are powered
    by KEC-capable anemometer like mechanisms. As these systems provide longevity
    and maintenance-free operation for the networks to be built, the available power
    is highly threatened by many factors, such as daytime and weather conditions.
    Although the vibrations alternate the wind power in SG communications, they require
    specialized harvesters as the frequency of each vibrating element differs. For
    indoor applications, piezoelectric materials are mostly preferred to operate HANs
    and BANs intermittently [28, 31]. 3.4 Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting With
    the unprecedented grow in wireless technologies in recent years, electromagnetic
    (EM) waves become more attractive for especially EH applications [28, 29]. Because
    of the nature of wireless communication, EM signals have the characteristics of
    being easily attainable and efficiently utilizable, which open up the potential
    of building battery-less WSNs that profit from ambient and underutilized RF waves.
    For urban areas, RF energy is about to unseat the conventional methods of EH that
    are destined to run remote services of Smart Cities. For indoor, EM waves emitted
    from modems, routers, smart phones, and laptops are first collected, then converted
    into AC and DC by using power receiving antennae, transducers, and rectifiers,
    respectively. Although the RF EH provides quite satisfying solutions regardless
    of the environmental parameters, being distortive for the communication; having
    strict deployment requirements; depending highly on an unpredictable source compel
    its utilization in mission-critical applications [31]. 3.5 Energy harvesting from
    electromagnetic fields In addition to above-mentioned harvesting techniques, low-power
    operative wireless devices can be also powered by exploiting electromagnetic fields
    around the conductive materials energized at any level. Magnetic field (M-field)
    EH, in particular, is based on coupling the surrounding field flow of AC current
    carrying conductors by clamping them with current transformers [29,30,31]. This
    power transfer-based technique provides acceptable rate of stable power as long
    as there exist sufficient current flow on the conductor that is being utilized.
    Being bulky and requiring additional safety procedures due to the mechanical contact
    are the factors that restrict its employment in certain applications. However,
    for online condition monitoring of overhead power lines and environmental sensing
    around grid assets, it is the most efficient solution in contrast with the ambient
    sources such as sunlight and airflow. Electric field (E-field), in similar, exploits
    the electric charges induced on a conductive material due to a voltage difference.
    The field that is being emitted is obstructed by again a conductive material,
    where a displacement current starts to drain. The charges conveyed are first converted
    into DC and then accumulated in a storage element after regulated. As the source
    of this gathered energy is the ambient field, this method can be termed as E-Field
    EH (EFEH) [30, 31]. EFEH depends only on the existence of voltage potential. Since
    the voltage and the frequency are firmly regulated and exactingly maintained,
    the E-field is stable and also predictable in its behavior. Therefore, it can
    be referred as the most promising way of composing long-term and self-operable
    communication services notwithstanding the environmental parameters. 4 Energy
    harvesting cognitive radios in IoT-enabled smart grid We separately investigate
    the usage of CR and EH in the IoT-enabled SG in prior sections. This section explains
    how the nodes operate by utilizing these technologies in the IoT-enabled SG. Spectrum-aware
    communication and energy harvesting capabilities of these nodes are the key elements
    for successful operation of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, the wireless devices in
    an IoT-enabled SG are named as energy harvesting-cognitive radios (EH-CRs). As
    EH-CRs have additional capabilities, their node architecture would be different
    from conventional wireless nodes in the IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, these capabilities
    require considering the network architectures of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, we
    overview operation of EH-CRs, their node architecture, and the architectures of
    the network consisting of these nodes. 4.1 Operation of EH-CRs Overcoming the
    spectrum scarcity challenges with CR and solving the limited energy supply problem
    with the EH techniques provide significant benefits in the SG domain. Furthermore,
    including the SG in the IoT results in very diverse application areas. This fact
    necessitates a clear understanding of operation of the IoT-enabled EH-CRs. The
    SG is a visionary concept that connects the demand and supply sides by enabling
    two way communication. These connection is provided by the deployment of wireless
    sensing devices and actuators. Hence, the proper operation of these devices is
    quite important. In the IoT-enabled SG, there are different operation schemes
    for the wireless devices. The deployed devices in homes may access directly to
    their gateways or they may reach their Internet gateways through multiple hops.
    During the operation, EH-CRs use spectrum-aware communication techniques for the
    transmission, and EH methods to energize the device. Depending on the sub-network
    architectures, the packet generated by sensing are conveyed in one or multiple
    hops in dynamic radio environment to reach the Internet for realizing IoT-enabled
    SG. They utilize the licensed spectrum bands since they coexist with PUs. Furthermore,
    they scavenge energy by utilizing EH techniques. 4.2 Node architecture of EH-CRs
    We propose a node architecture for IoT-enabled EH-CRs that supports self-sufficient
    and spectrum aware communications. In this architecture, we include three main
    units, which are ultra-low power (ULP) communication, ULP processing, and power
    provision units. A detailed structure is depicted in Fig. 2. The ULP communication
    unit performs channel switching, channel sensing, modulation and power control
    duties at the expense of miliwatts. Furthermore, sensory operations are performed
    in the sensor unit, which is controlled by the ULP processing unit. The sensed
    information is processed in ULP, and it is transferred to the ultra-low power
    communication unit. Fig. 2 Node Architecture of EH-CRs Full size image The power
    provision unit includes energy harvester, rectifier, regulator and energy buffer,
    i.e., super-capacitor, sub-units. As the name suggest, this unit is responsible
    for providing utilizable energy to the each part of the sensor node. In other
    words, profitable sources are captured, converted (if necessary), regulated and
    stored to be distributed to the rest of the system. The processing unit mainly
    decides on operating parameters and manages every process carried out by the sensor
    node. The ULP communication unit has an Internet-capable RF front-end, demodulator
    and decoder to provide the communication with CR functionalities. This node architecture
    is designed to support self-sufficient and spectrum-aware communications in the
    IoT-enabled SG. 4.3 Network architecture of IoT-enabled SG Using the node architecture
    of EH-CRs, we establish a network architecture for the IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore,
    we also utilize the general SG network architecture while establishing it for
    the IoT-enabled SG. The general SG network architecture has a multi-layer architecture
    and spread over a very geographical region, which poses challenges and limitations
    in wireless communications. Furthermore, this network architecture includes a
    number of sub-networks that have different QoS and other communication requirements.
    There are three main components for the SG network architectures, namely, HAN,
    NAN and WAN as seen in Fig. 3 [18, 19]. IAN in Fig. 3 refers to industrial area
    network, which is a sub-network of NAN located at industrial sites. BAN in Fig.
    3 refers to building area network, which is again a sub-network of NAN consisting
    of wireless nodes located in buildings. In our architecture, we split the IoT-enabled
    SG network like in the conventional SG networks. However, we consider the capabilities
    of EH-CRs while proposing our network architecture. We investigate the sub-networks
    of the IoT-enabled SG in the following subsections. Fig. 3 Network Architecture
    of IoT-enabled SG Full size image 4.3.1 Home area networks HANs cover houses and
    buildings. They provide real time monitoring for adjustment of energy consumption.
    Furthermore, they have the capability of control, managing and track of the devices
    at homes and buildings [32]. These networks bring intelligence to the houses,
    i.e., Smart Homes (SHs) [33]. Remote control and tracking, management of heat
    and light, and health-care monitoring are some of the applications of SHs. Home
    is the smallest part of the grid and provides context-aware services to the HAN
    users. The most important elements in HANs are smart meters, which have the capability
    of measuring the energy consumptions of the nodes [34]. WSNs are the key components
    to realize the SG in HANs that can be used home applications related to demand
    and energy management [35]. The collaborative nature of WSNs helps to exchange
    of the sensory information from the home appliances and systems, and makes this
    information accessible via the Internet with the inclusion of IoT. The development
    of the SG have increased the usage of HANs, which utilizes protocols such as ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, and 6LoWPAN. However, they use ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands,
    which are highly utilized and become insufficient for the transmission. This also
    increases the collision and deteriorates the network performance. Hence, CR plays
    a key role to eliminate these problems in HANs. CR is also being utilized in the
    SG domain to manage high volume of data and to satisfy different QoS levels [36].
    In our network architecture, the nodes in home communicates with the access point
    by dynamic spectrum access techniques to overcome the difficulties in the SG.
    This scenario is seen in Fig. 3 with exploitation of different EH methods such
    as harvesting from solar and thermal energy. The EH methods extend the lifetime
    of EH-CRs in HANs. 4.3.2 Neighborhood area networks NANs provide the connection
    between HANs. These networks are also named as field area networks (FANs) due
    to their connection of field devices such as advanced metering infrastructures
    (AMI) and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) [18]. NANs gather the energy consumption
    information from the homes in a neighborhood and sends it to utility companies
    via WANs [36]. NANs also connect SHs and the utility companies. It provides real-time
    communication for pricing and control. Furthermore, main fields of NAN applications
    can be named as distribution automation, load management and so on. Depending
    on the application, the network radius of NANs may be up to 10 km with a rate
    of 0.1 - 10 Mbps [19]. Multi-hop capable wireless nodes may be utilized such as
    ZigBee and Wi-Fi nodes [20]. Wireless sensor nodes may be utilized for this purpose.
    However, they may face the spectrum scarcity challenge in addition to the SG challenges
    such as harsh channel environment. CR again stands as a solution for these problems.
    In our networking paradigm, the nodes in NANs also access the licensed spectrum
    opportunistically. Gateway nodes are with cognitive radio capability. Their energy
    is supplied by the EH methods, which depend on the available energy resources
    in that neighborhood. Figure 3 shows a NAN that gateway node is connected to the
    different sub-networks such as HAN, IAN and BAN. Furthermore, nodes in NANs need
    more energy since they communicate with the nodes in HANs. Hence, efficient EH
    techniques should be employed. 4.3.3 Wide area networks WANs cover large areas
    and connects much smaller networks to form the communication backbone [37]. NANs
    forms WANs, the NANs communicates with the utility center via the Internet through
    WANs [36]. The observations and the real-time measurements of the substations
    and end users are conveyed to the control center traversing WANs, where the data
    from control centers is transmitted in the same manner [37]. IEDs are the sensor
    and actuator nodes, which are deployed in critical parts of the electrical grid
    such as transformers, circuit breakers, etc. [38]. The communication between the
    nodes of WANs requires high bandwidth and low delay due to the accumulated data
    from HANs and NANs. For instance, 5 Mbps data rate and 100 milliseconds delay
    is required for seamless communication [39]. The current WSN solutions may not
    satisfy these requirements due to inherent. CR provides the use of the licensed
    channels with high bandwidth to support the demands. If gateway noes can not access
    base stations in WANs, they reach them in multiple hops by utilizing idle licensed
    bands. 4.4 Open issues and future research directions In this paper, we have proposed
    a new networking paradigm, namely energy harvesting cognitive radio networking
    in IoT-enabled Smart Grid. The nodes have two capabilities, which are energy scavenging
    and spectrum-aware communications. Furthermore, these nodes operate in a very
    harsh domain, which is IoT-enabled Smart Grid. To enable EH-CR networking in IoT-enabled
    SG, we have explained the operation of EH-CRs, the node architecture and their
    network operation in a IoT-enabled SG. This new paradigm yields some open issues
    and future research directions, which are outlined as follows. Spectrum management
    frameworks must be designed according to the networking architecture of the IoT-enabled
    SG and the CR capability of the nodes. Furthermore, EH aspects of these nodes
    should be considered to enable efficient power consumption to support battery
    free operation. Energy harvesting and the energy consumption due to the cognitive
    cycle operations should be considered to balance the energy expenditure for perpetual
    lifetime. Furthermore, the spectrum-aware communication challenges such as arrival
    of PU during opportunistic communication should be considered in IoT-enabled SG
    with the intrinsic harsh channel conditions. Coverage and connectivity of the
    IoT-enabled SG should be studied according to the spectrum-awareness and energy
    harvesting points of view. New power control method can be utilized considering
    the harvested energy in IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, the connectivity of IoT-enabled
    SG should be investigated in such a setup. The heterogeneity of IoT-enabled devices
    should be handled since these devices use different communication technologies.
    The compatibility with EH-CRs and the other IoT devices deployed in SG must be
    investigated in terms of communication. Spectrum-aware routing protocols should
    be designed to enhance the lifetime of the nodes with EH techniques. The routing
    techniques should also consider the different network architectures of SG such
    as HAN, WAN, NAN. Application specific EH methods should be offered to support
    battery free operations of EH-CRs. Furthermore, hybrid energy harvesting approach
    may be proposed to exploit different EH methods in EH-CR nodes. EH methods must
    be utilized in accordance with required operation in different parts of the IoT-enabled
    SG since different nodes in different subnetworks of the IoT-enabled SG uses different
    amount of energy for the communication due to different transmission ranges. 5
    Conclusion In this paper, we propose a totally new networking architecture, namely,
    Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networking for Internet of Things-enabled Smart
    Grid. EH techniques are planned to be utilized for increasing the lifetime of
    wireless devices deployed in IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, as the SG has harsh
    channel conditions and spectrum scarcity problems in its network architecture,
    we propose to use CR to overcome these issues. This new networking paradigm is
    investigated in terms of general operation, node and network architecture aspects.
    Open issues and future research directions are presented to realize EH-CR networking
    in the IoT-enabled SG. References Gubbi J, Buyya R, Marusic S, Palaniswami M (2013)

  verbatim_quote3: '"The challenges for the realization of the SG are empowered by
    inclusion in the IoT paradigm and the utilization of CR. The IoT requires scalable,
    energy efficient and flexible solutions. Furthermore, the solutions must support
    spectrum-awareness if CR is utilized. Hence, the challenges of CR capable IoT-enabled
    SG can be outlined as follows [14]."'

    \ Introduction\nAn Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), also known as drone, is an aircraft\
    \ without\npassengers on board. Thus, the term “unmanned” implies a total absence\
    \ of humans\nwithin the aircraft [1]. In this regard, UAVs need not only hardware\
    \ and software capable\nof providing stability and preprogrammed ﬂight navigation\
    \ control [2], but also robust,\neffective, and secure communication technologies\
    \ that enable them to communicate with\nbase stations, air trafﬁc controllers,\
    \ other UAVs, or other devices and computers [1].\nAlthough UAVs were initially\
    \ designed for military action, the mass production\nof high-performance, low-cost,\
    \ intelligent UAVs has made them suitable for different\napplications. These applications\
    \ include video streaming, amateur photography and\nﬁlming, people and environment\
    \ monitoring, rescue and research, trafﬁc control, and\ndisaster recovery [3,4].\
    \ In fact, UAVs are currently being considered as an important\npart of the next\
    \ generation of wireless networks 5G with the so-called cellular-connected\nUAVs\
    \ [5], where they play a critical role to provide great performance improvements,\
    \ thus\nbringing more opportunities to the Internet of Things (IoT) and more diversity\
    \ for 5G\ncommunications.\nLikewise, while performing their missions, the UAVs\
    \ may work within an IoT [6]\ncontext when equipped with IoT devices. Herewith,\
    \ the UAVs will form an innovative IoT\nplatform operating in the skies, thus\
    \ being part of a new concept known as the Internet\nof Flying Things (IoFT) [7].\
    \ For this purpose, UAVs need to support instantaneous and\nreal-time communication,\
    \ and offer access to high-resolution ﬁles (e.g., videos streaming\nand high-deﬁnition\
    \ images), even if they are in an overcrowded area. That is the reason\nwhy 5G\
    \ networks are considered a key enabler for the IoT and the IoFT. In this sense,\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 830. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21030830\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 830\n2 of 27\nthe ultra-reliable and low latency (URLLC) mode\
    \ of communication expected with 5G\nnetworks would not only provide the UAVs\
    \ with the necessary IoT requirements but also\nprovide coverage at high altitudes.\
    \ Furthermore, the tasks of 5G networks may support\nremote change, and the planning\
    \ of ﬂight routes will be enhanced with the potential\nbeneﬁts of a 5G communication,\
    \ thus preventing UAVs from colliding with each other [8].\nRegarding the impact\
    \ on spectral usage expected for the massive connections of UAVs\nin 5G, an important\
    \ issue to be addressed is how these devices will be connected to future\nnetworks\
    \ in a spectral efﬁcient manner. It is known that despite the need for more robust\n\
    and secure communication UAVs traditionally operate within unlicensed spectrum\
    \ bands\n(i.e., open/free spectrum), such as IEEE S-Band, IEEE L-Band, and ISM,\
    \ ﬁxedly deﬁned in\ntheir hardware. Therefore, the UAVs increasingly face competition,\
    \ thus competing with\na growing number of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and\
    \ tablets), operating within\nother wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi and bluetooth)\
    \ that use the same spectrum bands.\nHowever, besides interfering the UAVs communications,\
    \ this competition will not be\nbearable anymore, once a massive number of UAVs\
    \ is expected to be connected, which will\nlead to a serious problem of spectrum\
    \ scarcity and security-related problems [9]. In this\ncontext, Cognitive Radio\
    \ (CR) emerges as a promising technology to solve these issues by\nenabling Dynamic\
    \ Spectrum Access (DSA) [10].\nProposed by Mitola [11], CR is a smart wireless\
    \ communication implemented in a\nSoftware-Deﬁned Radio (SDR). An SDR sets its\
    \ transmission frequency in software rather\nthan in hardware, thus allowing the\
    \ CR to intelligently switch to different channels. To\nswitch channels, CR senses\
    \ the radio spectrum environment around it and adapts its own\nconﬁgurations accordingly\
    \ to increase reliability and efﬁcient spectrum usage [10]. Further-\nmore, CR\
    \ is considered a key enabling technology for 5G in emerging IoT applications\
    \ [12].\nTherefore, CR can provide UAVs with promising features for their massive\
    \ deployment,\nsuch as reduced energy consumption and delay, opportunistic spectrum\
    \ use based on\napplication requirements, and a security enhancement, as CR does\
    \ not suffer the effects of\nsome conventional attacks.\nThese features would\
    \ allow CR-based UAVs to perform in situations where traditional\nUAVs face limitations,\
    \ or are often subject to being hacked. Moreover, CR alongside 5G\nwould permit\
    \ the UAVs to work in an IoFT role within an IoT context. This would fulﬁll\n\
    the increasing growth of applications requiring highly connected devices, such\
    \ as Smart\nCities [13]. However, although UAVs and CR are well-established research\
    \ ﬁelds, the\nintegration between the two is fairly unexplored [9]. Many issues\
    \ remain open, such as the\nimpact of the UAVs mobility on CR and the deﬁnition\
    \ of hardware compatible with both.\nThese open issues allow new research opportunities\
    \ and advances into the state-of-the-art.\nIn this paper, we provide a comprehensive\
    \ overview of background on CR for UAV\ncommunication, and the ongoing research\
    \ regarding the integration between the two. We\nalso specify the steps to build\
    \ a simple and low-cost CR-based UAV testbed. Finally, we\npresent key opportunities\
    \ and future challenges in the ﬁeld.\n2. Related Works\nThe ﬁrst step towards\
    \ the proper development of a CR-based UAV is choosing a suit-\nable SDR-UAV combination.\
    \ With a particular emphasis on SDR hardware and software\nthat can be used for\
    \ aerial wireless exploration and analysis, Powell et al. [14] provides a\ncomparative\
    \ overview of SDRs. They address speciﬁcations for SDR hardware, features of\n\
    available SDR hardware that are acceptable for small UAVs, and measurements of\
    \ power.\nThey also present SDR software speciﬁcations, open-source SDR software\
    \ available, and\nSDR software calibration/benchmarking. Finally, the authors\
    \ present Aerial Experimenta-\ntion and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless\
    \ (AERPAW) as a case study, and address\nvarious different experiments that can\
    \ be sponsored by SDRs on that platform to verify/test\npossible wireless advancements,\
    \ protocols, and technologies.\nCR aircraft applications are also the subject\
    \ of recent surveys. Jacob et al. [15] carried\nout a survey on CR for aeronautical\
    \ applications. Although their survey is not directly\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n\
    3 of 27\nrelated to UAVs, they present valuable information about studies involving\
    \ CR and UAS.\nNotwithstanding, Saleem et al. [9] undertook a survey on the integration\
    \ of CR with\nUAVs. They discussed and highlighted a variety of challenges, issues,\
    \ and future research\nin the ﬁeld.\n3. Background\nHerein, we introduce some\
    \ background information required to understand this work.\nFirst, we give an\
    \ overview of UAVs. Second, we present a general description of the\nconcepts\
    \ related to CR and its operation.\n3.1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\nUAVs are described\
    \ with different terms, such as drones and Unmanned Aerial\nSystems (UAS). These\
    \ terms vary according to the research ﬁeld, often describing the same\nthing\
    \ though [1]. In this work, UAV is deﬁned as an aerial vehicle, with an embedded\n\
    computer platform, capable of ﬂying with no human pilot on-board.\nUAVs can be\
    \ remotely controlled and/or autonomous, and they can perform a variety\nof tasks.\
    \ Although initially purposed for military tasks, there is an increasing growth\
    \ in\ncivilian, commercial, and scientiﬁc applications (e.g., trafﬁc surveillance,\
    \ communication\nrelays, disaster management, data and image acquisition, etc.)\
    \ [16].\nAs shown in Table 1, UAVs can be classiﬁed according to their weight,\
    \ altitude\nand endurance [9]. Figure 1 shows an example of a mini UAV, the Inspire\
    \ 2, by DJI, as\ncategorized by Table 1 [17]. This UAV weighs around 3.3 kg and\
    \ its ﬂight reaches up\nto 27 min.\nTable 1. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) classiﬁcation.\

    \ weighing around 3.3 kg and capable of a ﬂight time up to\n27 min [17].\nAlthough\
    \ there is a wide variety of UAVs, this work focuses on their communication,\n\
    considering micro and mini UAVs battery, space, and weight constraints.\nFor mini\
    \ and micro UAVs, the battery represents an important portion of their weight.\n\
    The DJI Inspire 2, for example, typically works with a pair of 4280 mAh batteries,\
    \ weighing\n515 g each. Although over 30% of this UAV weight is assigned to batteries,\
    \ it is only able to\nﬂy 27 min per charge.\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n4 of 27\n\
    3.2. Cognitive Radio Networks\nThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute\
    \ (ETSI) deﬁnes CR as a radio\nthat can sense and understand the radio environment\
    \ and policies, and monitor usage\npatterns and users’ needs; autonomously and\
    \ dynamically adapts according to the radio\nenvironment, so that it can achieve\
    \ predeﬁned objectives, such as efﬁcient utilization of\nspectrum; and learn from\
    \ the environment and the results of its own actions, so it can\nfurther improve\
    \ its performance [18].\nCR is also able to operate as a secondary user (SU) within\
    \ a spectrum band of a li-\ncensed user or primary user (PU). In [12,19], the\
    \ Resolution ITU-R 58-2 of the International\nTelecommunications Union (ITU) states\
    \ that “the introduction of CRSs in any radiocommu-\nnication service needs to\
    \ ensure that coexistence within radiocommunication services and\nthe protection\
    \ of other radiocommunication services sharing the band and in the adjacent\n\
    bands are maintained or improved” [20]. In practice, clearer parameters on how\
    \ that action\nis done is usually deﬁned by local regulatory agencies.\nCR is\
    \ described as an intelligent SDR with the following components:\n1.\nspectrum\
    \ sensing: identiﬁes the available spectrum and detects PUs when operating\nin\
    \ a licensed band,\n2.\nspectrum management: selects the best available channel,\n\
    3.\nspectrum sharing: coordinates accessibility to the available channel with\
    \ other users,\nand\n4.\nspectrum mobility: vacates the channel when a PU arrives.\n\
    Figure 2 shows the interaction among the CR components. First, the spectrum sensing\n\
    component is responsible for collecting data from the radio environment, and it\
    \ keeps\nsending the gathered radio data to the spectrum management component.\
    \ When a PU\nis detected, it also notiﬁes the spectrum mobility component, then\
    \ a spectrum handover\nmust be executed. The spectrum management component is\
    \ responsible for submitting the\nchannel with higher availability to the mobility\
    \ component of the spectrum, because when\nthe current channel needs to be vacated,\
    \ a new channel is used. Finally, to organize the\nallocation of spectrum bands,\
    \ the spectrum sharing portion is responsible for interacting\nwith the radio\
    \ environment.\nFigure 2. The interaction among CR components. Adapted from the\
    \ work in [21].\nIn practice, CR consists of a hardware associated with an intelligent\
    \ software. Usually,\nthe hardware consists of a radio platform, generally an\
    \ SDR, and a computational platform.\nMost computational platforms used for CR\
    \ applications are single-board computers, such\nas the ODROID [22], the Raspberry\
    \ Pi [23], and the BeagleBoard [24]. The Universal\nSoftware Radio Peripheral\
    \ (USRP) from Ettus Research [25] and the Wireless Open-Access\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 830\n5 of 27\nResearch Platform (WARP) from Rice University are both SRDs\
    \ and the most common\nradio platforms used in CR [26,27].\nFigure 3 shows one\
    \ of the most usual SDR hardware in research experiments: the\nUSRP B200 by Ettus\
    \ Research. It provides full-duplex wireless communication within\na frequency\
    \ range starting from 70 MHz varying up to 6 GHz. Its architecture offers\ncompatibility\
    \ with a variety of software and frameworks, such as C++, Python, GNU\nRadio,\
    \ Amarisoft LTE 100, and OpenBTS.\nFigure 3. USRP B200 by Ettus Research. Its\
    \ price is currently $905.00.\n4. CR-Based UAVs\nA CR-based UAV may be seen as\
    \ a UAV with an SDR platform embedded to it. It\nshould also contain a computational\
    \ unity that interacts with the SDR platform in order to\nautonomously take decisions\
    \ regarding the radio spectrum usage. In this section, we ﬁrst\ndiscuss the need\
    \ for CR-based UAVs, potential applications, and hardware/software char-\nacteristics.\n\
    4.1. The Need for CR-Based UAVs\nHerein, we deﬁne the most prominent aspects regarding\
    \ the paramount importance\nof CR in the context of UAVs.\n4.1.1. Security\nCommunication\
    \ security is critically important for UAVs. These aircraft are also\nconsidered\
    \ critical systems, a security issue, which can be used to manage conﬁdential\n\
    information, thus, in a UAV, may often represent a serious safety issue. Some\
    \ conventional\nattacks, such as jamming and location spooﬁng (sometimes referred\
    \ to as GPS spooﬁng or\nGNSS spooﬁng), could lead the base station to lose the\
    \ UAV. This problem is particularly\nevident in overcrowded or hostile areas.\n\
    Jamming is an attack in the physical layer which causes a high interference to\
    \ a spec-\ntrum band by overloading it. It may provoke the attacked devices to\
    \ present an excessive\nenergy consumption due to package retransmission, or even\
    \ interrupt its communication\nchannel [7]. When a CR is under a jamming attack,\
    \ it simply understands that spectrum\nband as being busy or overcrowded, and\
    \ then it switches its transmission to a new channel,\nthus avoiding the attack.\
    \ In order to succeed in their jamming attempt, the attackers would\nhave to keep\
    \ detecting the new CR frequency and switch to the same frequency. For this,\n\
    however, the attackers themselves would need to also be equipped with a CR device\
    \ and\nmore sophisticated algorithms.\nLocation spooﬁng attacks also happen in\
    \ the physical layer, and they have become\nmore frequent. It happens when an\
    \ attacker uses a signal that is stronger than and mimics\nthe attributes of a\
    \ genuine location satellite signal to spoof the receiver [7]. By using a\nlocation\
    \ spooﬁng attack, attackers may capture UAVs and/or take control of their ﬂight\n\
    path. Such attacks have become easy to launch [28]. However, location spooﬁng\
    \ attacks are\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n6 of 27\nmuch more complex to execute to\
    \ CR devices. The work in [29] provides some strategies\nfor spooﬁng attack detection\
    \ and countermeasure solutions in CR networks.\nTherefore, UAVs may beneﬁt from\
    \ CR technology security. Conventional jamming\nand GPS spooﬁng strategies may\
    \ be easily avoided by CR. These attacks are only possible\nto CR when the attacker\
    \ is also using a CR with different and speciﬁc strategies; therefore,\nattacking\
    \ a CR device is a more complex problem than attacking conventional wireless de-\n\
    vices. Herein, we deﬁne the most prominent aspects regarding the paramount importance\n\
    of CR in the context of UAVs.\n4.1.2. Energy Efﬁciency\nAlthough CR devices may\
    \ represent a computational overload to UAVs, they may\nbe capable of actually\
    \ reducing energy consumption to these aircraft. Because the UAVs\noperate in\
    \ overcrowded spectrum bands, they are susceptible to a high number of loss,\n\
    thus increasing packet retransmission. The energy consumed for packet retransmission\n\
    may be greatly reduced when a UAV is equipped with a CR.\nLi et al. [30] proposed\
    \ a method to maximize energy efﬁciency based on a joint\noptimization with medium\
    \ access control (MAC) and physical layers, considering CR\nnetworks. In their\
    \ scenario, a CR user senses different channels simultaneously and uses\nsome\
    \ idle ones for data transmission. The authors showed that the more channels the\
    \ CR\ndevice is able to use, the more efﬁcient is its bits/joule ratio throughput.\
    \ The bits/second\nratio also increased with the number of channels used.\n4.1.3.\
    \ Spectrum Scarcity\nDespite a massive growth in the number of wireless connected\
    \ devices, most of the\nradio spectrum is underutilized. Because of the ﬁxed spectrum\
    \ allocation policy, a big\nportion of the radio spectrum is reserved to sporadic\
    \ PUs, while other spectrum portions\nare overloaded, such as Wi-Fi and mobile\
    \ bands. Moreover, the UAVs traditionally operate\nwithin unlicensed spectrum\
    \ bands (i.e., open/free spectrum), such as IEEE S-Band, IEEE L-\nBand, and ISM,\
    \ ﬁxedly deﬁned in their hardware, under the same ﬁxed spectrum allocation\npolicy\
    \ [31].\nIn this context, CR emerges as a promising technology to solve these\
    \ issues by enabling\nDSA [10]. CR-based UAVs are able to select idle spectrum\
    \ bands for communicating.\nThus, the UAV overall communication quality increases\
    \ when using CR, especially in\novercrowded areas.\n4.1.4. Application Requirements\n\
    UAVs may often be deployed in missions where they are expected to broadcast live\n\
    video and to send high deﬁnition pictures to the base station. However, live stream\n\
    broadcast tolerate packet loss, but require a high bandwidth for the timely data\
    \ delivery.\nSending high deﬁnition pictures is the opposite operation, as the\
    \ UAV may need a low\nbandwidth with no packet loss tolerance, but with delay\
    \ tolerance [9].\nWhile traditional UAVs may face this problem, CR-based UAVs\
    \ may easily deal with\nit. CR-based UAVs may change their communication frequency\
    \ accordingly to application\nrequirements. Thus, a UAV equipped with CR technology\
    \ may be live streaming video\nand switch to a low bandwidth to send a large ﬁle\
    \ when required. This feature not only\noptimizes the overall network performance\
    \ of CR-based UAVs, but it also opens new\napplication opportunities for these\
    \ aircraft. For instance, they can be used to improve\nthe communication performance\
    \ of terrestrial users in 5G, through the UAV-assisted 5G\ncommunications [32].\n\
    4.2. Potential Applications\nIn the last few years, emerged a growing trend to\
    \ rely on UAVs as a support tool\non critical missions, such as military surveillance\
    \ [33], forest ﬁre monitoring [34], crop\nmonitoring [35–37], trafﬁc surveillance\
    \ [38], border patrolling [39], natural disasters area\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n\
    7 of 27\nsurveillance and support [40–42], and commercial drones [43]. However,\
    \ these areas\nusually suffer from infrastructure issues that could possibly lead\
    \ to spectrum scarcity or\nanomalous PUs behavior [44,45]. Thus, an integration\
    \ between UAVs and CR could be\nuseful for these scenarios due to its spectrum\
    \ sensing and handover capabilities.\nAs well as the spectrum uncertainty scenario\
    \ set up by emergency conditions, densely\npopulated areas such as big cities\
    \ can likewise go through overcrowded frequency bands,\nmainly motivated for the\
    \ growing volume of wireless network users. Although spectrum\nscarcity is perceived\
    \ as a harmless effect, the falling of a UAV in a crowded area due to\nan unstable\
    \ communication could inﬂict much damage depending on the aircraft size\nand set\
    \ up [46]. One potential advantage of CR utilization is the potential increase\
    \ in the\nQuality of Service (QoS) caused by applying the spectrum handover capabilities\
    \ to identify\nand relocate to less occupied frequency bands, thus adding to the\
    \ stability of the data\ntransmission between UAVs and their base stations.\n\
    In order to avoid the spectrum scarcity caused by densely populated areas, the\
    \ UAV\ncan previously adjust its ﬂight path considering the spectrum availability,\
    \ as applied in [47]\nusing cellular data network. To accomplish this application,\
    \ it can be done a mapping\nof several frequency bands of the area in which the\
    \ UAV would be deployed, therefore\nenabling the occupancy pattern recognition\
    \ and, subsequently, prediction by machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms [48].\n4.2.1.\
    \ Internet of Flying Things\nThe increased demand for highly connected devices\
    \ originated the concept of IoT. In\nIoT, a massive number of “things” (i.e.,\
    \ devices) are connected to the Internet, in order\nto exchange information for\
    \ the most diverse applications and purposes, from gains in\nefﬁciency to expansion\
    \ of functions.\nBecause of the IoT rise, there is a major demand for integrating\
    \ UAVs with this network.\nHowever, due to the special features involving Flying\
    \ Ad hoc Networks (FANETS) and\nthese aircraft, the IoFT was created. IoFT is\
    \ a new research ﬁeld that differs to IoT in scope\nof research, despite being\
    \ related areas.\nIoFT speciﬁc challenges range from regulatory issues to hardware\
    \ and software limita-\ntions. Regarding security, as the UAVs are critical embedded\
    \ systems, so a network security\nissue may generate a safety issue. The security\
    \ challenges in IoFT are diverse, involving\nthe physical, data link, transport,\
    \ session, and application layers [7].\n4.2.2. UAV-Aided 5G\nUAVs may play an\
    \ important role for 5G and beyond 5G (B5G), as future dronecell\nnetworks [49].\
    \ Because cellular-connected UAV communication has unique characteristics\nrelated\
    \ to ground conventional cellular communication, this ﬁeld offers new research\n\
    challenges and opportunities. Zeng et al. [5] presented an overview of 5G in UAV\
    \ commu-\nnications, as well as emerging technologies and potential challenges.\n\
    CR is an enabling technology for using UAVs in 5G networks. In 5G, CR-based UAVs\n\
    may simultaneously access the wireless channel and fulﬁll their different roles\
    \ in trafﬁc\nsurveillance, disaster management, and package delivery [32].\n4.3.\
    \ Hardware Characteristics\nUsually, CR hardware consists of a radio platform,\
    \ typically an SDR, and a computer\nplatform. The Wireless Open-Access Research\
    \ Platform (WARP) from Rice University [26]\nand the USRP from Ettus Research\
    \ [25] are the most commonly deployed radio platforms\nfor CR [27].\nA recent\
    \ implementation of SDR, however, has been carried out using various methods\n\
    rather than considering the integration with UAVs. As a consequence, for UAVs,\
    \ overhead,\nenergy consumption, and time delays associated with conventional\
    \ SDR are constraints.\nAlternatively, Young and Bostian [27] built the SKIRL,\
    \ a simple and low-cost RFIC-based\nRF CR platform suitable for the experimentation\
    \ of small radio-controlled UAVs. The Hope\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n8 of 27\nRF\
    \ RFM22B [50] was used as the radio platform, whereas the BeagleBoard-xM [24]\
    \ single\nboard was deployed as the computer unit. This was done to reduce resource\
    \ consumption\nand simplify CR design.\nFigure 4 shows the physical dimensions\
    \ of the USRP B200, 97 × 155 millimeters, and\nthe Hope RF RFM23B, 16 × 16 millimeters.\
    \ For UAVs, particularly for micro UAVs, where\nphysical space is limited, so\
    \ if a large board is inserted to it, series of changes may be\ntriggered in the\
    \ aircraft system, conﬁguration, and scale. Thus, this difference in size is\n\
    critical. Moreover, the energy consumption of the Hope RF RFM22B is just 0.306\
    \ Wh in\nthe worst case scenario. The USRP B200, on the other hand, may have up\
    \ to 4.092 Wh\nof energy consumption. Because the energy capacity of a LiFe SourceHCAM6426\
    \ UAV\nlithium battery, a typical UAV battery, is just 12 Wh, energy consumption\
    \ is a key aspect to\ntake into account in this context.\nFigure 4. Physical aspects\
    \ of the Hope RF RFM23B on the left and the USRP B200 on the right. The\nboards\
    \ are shown in different size scales. Adapted from the work in [51].\n4.4. Software\
    \ Characteristics\nThe CR software design and applications can be divided into\
    \ multiple categories, from\nMAC protocols and routing algorithms to machine learning\
    \ approaches used to predict\nchannel occupancy. In this work, we summarize three\
    \ of those categories: (i) spectrum\nsensing algorithms, focusing mainly on transmitter\
    \ detection and identiﬁcation of spectrum\nholes [52,53]; (ii) methods to perform\
    \ the spectrum handover [54]; and (iii) and simulation\nsoftware [55].\n4.4.1.\
    \ Spectrum Sensing\nThe literature commonly refers to spectrum sensing as the\
    \ procedure of gathering\nand analyzing radio data to establish the spectrum occupancy\
    \ [56]. In order to detect\ntransmitters, some well-known methods can be employed,\
    \ i.e., Energy detector, Matched-\nﬁlter, and Cyclostationary feature detection.\
    \ These algorithms are connected with two\nhypotheses formally deﬁned as [57,58]\n\
    x(t) =\n(\nn(t),\nH0\ns(t) + n(t),\nH1\n(1)\nwhere H1 indicates the presence of\
    \ a licensed user, whereas H0 represents the null hypothe-\nsis. x represents\
    \ the received signal, t is the time sample, and s and n denote the PU signal\n\
    and the additive noise, respectively.\nIn cases where the signal receiver has\
    \ no prior information about the PU signal, the\nenergy detector algorithm may\
    \ be deployed at a low computational cost. It functions by\ncomparing a signal\
    \ sample from the data to a predeﬁned threshold, where a value higher\nthan the\
    \ threshold suggests the presence of a primary user, whereas a value smaller than\n\
    the threshold implies the lack of band utilization. The main downside of this\
    \ approach is\nthe ﬁxed threshold value, as noise power can differ over time possibly\
    \ assuming unknown\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n9 of 27\nbehavior. In this case, the\
    \ threshold could be surpassed by the noise power, indicating an\ninvalid PU presence\
    \ in a given spectrum band [59,60].\nThe matched-ﬁlter contrasts the current signal\
    \ with previous collected samples from\nthe same transmitter, in comparison to\
    \ the energy method. It appears to be more precise,\nhas a shorter sensing time\
    \ and maximizes the ratio of signal to noise (SNR). However, the\nneed for prior\
    \ knowledge of the form of the transmitter signal restricts its feasibility only\n\
    to the point where licensed users cooperate [61].\nIn order to check whether or\
    \ not the transmitted signal has periodicity, the cyclostation-\nary feature detection\
    \ adopts a spectral correlation function (SCF) [62]. Unlike the previous\napproaches,\
    \ it helps the CR user to distinguish between noise and user signal, improving\n\
    the efﬁciency of the algorithm in channels where there is greater noise [63].\
    \ Because of\nits computational complexity, perhaps the most serious drawback\
    \ of this approach is the\nneed for long processing time, an undesired characteristic\
    \ for small energy consumption\nsystems such as UAVs.\nFinally, machine learning\
    \ approaches have been adopted in the literature to enhance\nthe detection of\
    \ transmitters. The authors of [64] achieved an overall success rate of over\n\
    99.50% in predicting PU presence by using an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) at\
    \ different\nSNR frequencies. Similarly, Zhang et al. [65] proposed a cooperative\
    \ detection device\ncombining the energy detector with ANNs, adding a basic ANN\
    \ for each SU, and a base\nstation responsible for ﬁnal decision-making, referred\
    \ to as the Fusion Center. Matinmikko\net al. [66] proposed a new Fuzzy logic\
    \ system to adapt each spectrum scenario to the most\nsuitable transmitter detection\
    \ algorithm. The reader may refer to the works in [67,68] for\nfurther information\
    \ concerning spectrum sensing techniques.\n4.4.2. Spectrum Handover\nThe channel\
    \ occupied by an unlicensed should ideally be vacant when a PU arrives.\nThis\
    \ is desirable in order to generate minimal interference to the primary user transmission.\n\
    The literature generally refers to the process of hoping to another channels as\
    \ spectrum\nhandover. It involves distinct strategies with regards to its integration\
    \ with spectrum\nsensing, such as non-handover, pure proactive, pure reactive,\
    \ hybrid, and ML approaches,\nwhich incorporates the preceding [54].\nIn the non-handover\
    \ strategy, the SU remains idle until the PU leaves the channel,\nresuming the\
    \ transmission of data later. Although spectrum sensing is limited solely to\n\
    current channel monitoring, the drawback of this concept is unveiled during a\
    \ long PU\ntransmission, which signiﬁcantly restricts the transmission time available\
    \ to the SU, in\nterms of detection of PU arrivals and departures.\nUnlike non-handover,\
    \ before and after the arrival of the PU, both pure proactive and\nreactive strategies\
    \ concentrate on handover to an idle channel, respectively. The pure\nproactive\
    \ algorithm tries to predict the arrival of the PU while perceiving the atmosphere\n\
    to locate a spectrum hole based on the trafﬁc pattern of the channel. On the contrary,\
    \ after\nthe identiﬁcation of the PU, the pure reactive approach only senses and\
    \ switches to an\nunused channel. A potential disadvantage in the pure proactive\
    \ method may be created by\na poor prediction of trafﬁc, leading to an unnecessary\
    \ handover, whereas the pure reactive\napproach may have a greater handover delay\
    \ just after a PU arrival due to the execution of\nthe spectrum sensing stage.\n\
    The hybrid handover strategy, taking advantage of the advantages of both methods,\n\
    incorporates both the proactive spectrum sensing phase, perceiving the spectrum\
    \ holes\nbefore the arrival of the PU, and reactive handover action. Therefore,\
    \ due to the proactive\nprocess, the handover delay is reduced, and not every\
    \ PU arrival needs to be predicted\nby the algorithm. However, the backup channel\
    \ can become obsolete before use, as in\nthe proactive method, thus driving the\
    \ algorithm to perform a supplementary spectrum\nsensing phase.\nThe literature\
    \ has stressed the utility of ML algorithms to overcome the complexities\nof spectrum\
    \ handover. Trigui et al. [69] developed a method of negotiating multi-agent\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 830\n10 of 27\nsystems that enables SUs to migrate opportunistically\
    \ to the most adequate spectrum\nband provided its characteristics, achieving\
    \ around 97% of spectrum utilization. An\ninvestigation on the Hidden Markov Model\
    \ (HMM) application for spectrum handover\nand simulated data showed that in detecting\
    \ transmission opportunities, this technique can\ngive SUs greater accuracy [70].\
    \ Finally, in order to achieve dynamic handover management,\nAnandakumar and Umamaheswari\
    \ [71] suggested a supervised Machine Learning (ML)\napproach referred to as Spectrum\
    \ Particle Swarm Optimization (SpecPSO), using Visitor\nLocation Register and\
    \ Home Location Register databases to train the algorithm.\n4.4.3. Simulation\
    \ Tools\nAll levels of abstraction, from the physical layer to protocols and routing,\
    \ should\nbe associated with a full CR simulation program. We have not found a\
    \ method in the\nliterature that embodies all these characteristics. The only\
    \ way to do this, to the best of\nour knowledge, is to combine open source resources,\
    \ such as radio simulators (e.g., GNU\nRadio [72] and CogWave [73]) and general\
    \ network simulators (e.g., Omnet++ [74] and\nns-3 [75]).\nGNU Radio is a free\
    \ and open source software designed to use its graphical user\ninterface ﬂow graphs\
    \ to simulate radio transmissions and signal processing (GNU Radio\nCompanion).\
    \ It could be compared to LabView [76] and Simulink [77]. Standard ﬂow\ngraph\
    \ blocks encompass waveform generators, modulators, instrumentation sinks, math\n\
    operators, ﬁlters, and Fourier analysis. It also facilitates the development of\
    \ new blocks\nusing the programming language C++, as well as the design of the\
    \ ﬂow graph using Python.\nIn addition, GNU Radio can be connected to SDR hardware,\
    \ thus allowing simulations\nfrom the testbed to be used.\nAnother open-source\
    \ program suggested for designing CR waveforms is CogWave. It\ninvolves many modulation\
    \ systems, including multichannel DAA-OFDM, Fathers, and\nothers from GNU Radio\
    \ (e.g., OFDM, BPSK, and QPSK). During run-time, CogWave is\nable to reconﬁgure\
    \ the modulation scheme and can communicate with SDR hardware, as\nwell as GNU\
    \ Radio, to provide real-time transmission between USRP devices.\nOmnet++ and\
    \ INET [78] have been widely used in the literature to simulate CR\nnetworks for\
    \ general network simulators [79–81]. Omnet++ offers a C++ component-based\narchitecture\
    \ where modules and components can be assembled using a graphical user\ninterface\
    \ or a high-level network description language, similar to ﬂow graphs in GNU\n\
    Radio (NED). Its modular architecture therefore eases the reusability of the built\
    \ models.\nFurthermore, INET offers protocols, templates, routing, and mobility\
    \ simulation as an\nopen-source model library for Omnet++.\nAnother well-established\
    \ tool is the ns-3. It is an open discrete-event simulation\nenvironment for network\
    \ research that provides C++ libraries of models for wired protocols,\nIP and\
    \ non-IP, wireless, dynamic routing protocols, and so forth. For instance, the\
    \ ns-3 has\nbeen applied in the simulation of CR networks regarding spectrum handover\
    \ [82], data\ncollection [83], and channel sharing [84].\nIt is necessary to note\
    \ that many programming languages can be used to build a custom\nsimulator, as\
    \ they provide access to several network and scientiﬁc libraries (e.g., Java,\
    \ C++,\nPython, and Julia). However, most simulation scenarios encountered in\
    \ the literature are\ncomplex enough to require thousands of lines of code, turning\
    \ this option impractical for\nmost of the problems.\n4.5. Spectrum Mobility\n\
    When a PU resumes transmission through the same channel as the SU, the latter\
    \ has\nto vacate the channel by suspending its transmission and restart communication\
    \ through a\nvacant channel. This CR feature is called Spectrum Mobility [54].\n\
    It is considered a daunting problem due to the erratic behavior of the wireless\
    \ medium\nin combination with the high mobility of UAVs. Thus, network protocols\
    \ for ground-based\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n11 of 27\nnetworks could not perform\
    \ as expected for UAVs, and their high mobility should be taken\ninto account\
    \ when designing CR-based UAV transport protocols [9,85].\nOne of the forms in\
    \ which an SU does not trigger disruption in a PU-licensed band\nis to perform\
    \ a spectrum handover as soon as the SU detects the existence of the PU. In\n\
    general, UAVs take their places in a CR network as SUs, and they are likely to\
    \ conduct\na high number of spectrum handovers, as they will be on a mission throughout\
    \ their\nroute in the presence of various PUs. Therefore, spectrum handover is\
    \ a key element in\nCR-based UAVs.\nA general spectrum handover process is shown\
    \ in Figure 5. A SU keeps monitoring\nthe spectrum environment during the evaluation\
    \ phase by sensing it. The link maintenance\nprocess begins when a handover signal\
    \ is identiﬁed, then the SU pauses its transmission\nand performs a channel handover\
    \ to a backup channel and resumes its transmission,\nreturning to the evaluation\
    \ phase.\nA handover trigger could be provided by a PU or by the SU itself, depending\
    \ on the\napplication purposes and signal quality. Depending on the spectrum handover\
    \ strategy,\na backup channel could be searched proactively during the assessment\
    \ process, and a\nchannel handover could also be performed proactively.\nOn the\
    \ other hand, both backup channel scanning and channel handover are per-\nformed\
    \ reactively in a reactive technique. A new backup channel has to be checked,\
    \ and\nanother channel handover attempt is made if a channel handover is not successful\
    \ due\nto any incident affecting the target channel (e.g., a PU started a transmission\
    \ through the\ntarget channel) [54].\nFigure 5. Spectrum handover process. Adapted\
    \ from the work in [54].\nConsiderable energy consumption is required in a spectrum\
    \ handover. Furthermore,\nsome communication problems, such as packet loss and\
    \ delay, may increase during the\nspectrum handover process. In a spectrum handover,\
    \ delay is also a signiﬁcant performance\nfactor [86].\nFigure 6 demonstrates\
    \ the effect of the spectrum handover delay over a SU after many\nPU channel reclaims.\
    \ In that case, an SU establishes a connection whose operation requires\nthe completion\
    \ of 7 time slots. However, due to successive PU arrivals, the process needs\n\
    9 time slots. Nevertheless, as the existence of a PU on channel Ch1 is quite short,\
    \ the ﬁrst\nSU channel handover was unnecessarily executed, which means that the\
    \ SU was submitted\nto excessive channel handover costs [87].\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 830\n12 of 27\nFigure 6. Spectrum handover delay caused to an SU. Adapted from\
    \ the work in [87].\nUAVs designed for real-time multimedia broadcasting can cause\
    \ unsatisfactory user\nexperience, as spectrum handover latency can have a signiﬁcant\
    \ effect on delay-sensitive\napplications. For optimal transmission, therefore,\
    \ delay reduction has to be considered [88].\n5. Developing a Simple and Low-Cost\
    \ CR-Based UAV Testbed\nOne of the main obstacles when integrating CR into UAVs\
    \ is the energy consumption.\nDevices such as USRP B200 [25] have a consumption\
    \ around 4.1 Wh, whereas a commercial\nquad-rotor UAV like DJI Phantom 4 [89]\
    \ has a LiPo 4S battery with 81.3 Wh of capacity,\nwhich ensure a max ﬂight time\
    \ up to 28 min. This issue has been subject of empirical\nevaluations in Young\
    \ and Bostian [27], where the authors apply the Hope’s RF RFM22B [50]\nto greatly\
    \ reduce the energy utilization (0.3 Wh), although it likewise reduces the coverage\n\
    range from USRP’s 70 MHz–6 GHz Hope’s 433–915 GHz.\nThe employment of miniaturized\
    \ SDR devices could also help to reduce the additional\nweight load of UAV. For\
    \ instance, Phantom 4 weights 1380 g, whereas USRP B200 weights\n350 g. In comparison,\
    \ Hope’s RF RFM22B weights only 1.8 g. The additional load could\ninﬂuence not\
    \ solely the weight capacity of the aircraft, but also the energy consumption.\n\
    Ultimately, the impact on the load capacity of the UAV poses as a major drawback\
    \ on\nmobile manipulating UAVs [90].\nFinally, there is no conclusive information\
    \ referring to the maximum transmission\ndistance of both USRP’s and Hope’s SDRs,\
    \ as well as for other manufacturers. A limited\ntransmission distance can be\
    \ a tricky feature, potentially limiting the assimilation of CR\ninto UAV Swarms.\
    \ One probable solution to this shortcoming is the use of signal ampliﬁers;\n\
    however, it is essential to note that additional weight load could result in less\
    \ ﬂight time,\nespecially in swarms where the UAVs individual weight could reach\
    \ 500 g in medium\nrange devices or even less in short range devices.\n5.1. The\
    \ Testbed Components\nThe ﬁrst step towards building this testbed is to develop\
    \ and test a CR platform\nwith the purpose to integrate it with the UAV. We developed\
    \ one using a Raspberry Pi 3\nconnected to an RTL SDR 820T2 [91] as the radio\
    \ front-end with a basic antenna. The RTL\nSDR 820T2 is a simple and low-cost\
    \ USB SDR receptor, which frequency coverage varies\nfrom 30 MHz to 1.8 GHz.\n\
    Although the RTL SDR 820T2 does not support wireless data transmission (it only\n\
    supports wireless data reception), its low-cost feature makes it a valuable tool\
    \ for CR\nexperiments, as most of the gaps are not found in the transmission itself,\
    \ but in the received\ndata processing and decision-making. For example, to evaluate\
    \ a given spectrum handover\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n13 of 27\nalgorithm, a CR\
    \ device is not required to transmit wireless data itself. It only needs to sense\n\
    the environment and decide whether to vacate the channel.\nWe choose a Parrot\
    \ AR.Drone 2.0 [92] UAV to be integrated with the CR platform\nbuilt for this\
    \ work. Because Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 is a typical commercial drone widely\nused\
    \ for entertainment, it ﬁts the “keep it simple” requirement of this testbed,\
    \ and it is\nalso appropriated to test the CR platform suitability to mini-UAVs.\
    \ Because the Parrot\nAR.Drone 2.0 is not open in hardware nor in software (except\
    \ for an SDK intended for\nthe development of smartphones, smartwatches, or VR\
    \ glasses applications [93]), it is not\npossible to make any changes directly\
    \ to the UAV. Therefore, here we use Parrot simply as\nthe UAV platform; the Raspberry\
    \ Pi 3 is used as the CR computer component. However,\nboth the CR platform and\
    \ the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 run Linux operating systems [93];\ntherefore, this work\
    \ results are equally valid not only for Linux-based computer platforms\n(like\
    \ the Raspberry Pi 3), but also for open-source/open-hardware Linux-based UAVs.\
    \ Note\nthat for such UAVs it may be possible to use the same single board as\
    \ the computational\nunit of both the CR and the UAV itself.\nMoreover, this UAV\
    \ provides a USB port on its top. This port can be used as an\ninterface to connect\
    \ the CR platform to it. Figure 7 shows a picture taken in the laboratory\nof\
    \ the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 without its hull, in which it is possible to see its\
    \ USB port.\nFigure 7. The Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 without its hull, highlighting\
    \ its USB port.\nBecause of the low energy supply provided by the Parrot AR.Drone\
    \ 2.0, it was neces-\nsary to efﬁciently adapt the CR platform. We changed its\
    \ operational system to Ubuntu\nMate, in order to have a better general compatibility\
    \ with third-party software and more\ncontrol over unnecessary background processing.\
    \ It was also integrated with RLTSDR-\nScanner, which is an open-source cross\
    \ platform Python frequency scanning tool for RTL\nSDR [94].\nFinally, it was\
    \ possible possible to deploy the CR-based UAV prototype outdoors.\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ the prototype developed and deployed in this work. Because of the\ninﬂuence\
    \ that an indoor environment could cause to radio data collection (for instance,\n\
    because of walls, other devices, etc.), outdoor data collection is a key factor\
    \ to determine\nthe quality of the collected data.\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n14\
    \ of 27\n \n \nFigure 8. The CR-based UAV prototype developed for this work.\n\
    5.2. Outdoor Radio Data Collection of a Jamming Attack\nThe experiment we conducted\
    \ in this work comprises executing a typical jamming\nattack to the CR-based UAV\
    \ prototype outdoor. The CR should detect the jammed fre-\nquency range as busy\
    \ and then switch to a backup frequency, thus avoiding the jamming\nattack consequences.\n\
    In this experiment, we used a jammer device capable of jamming the frequency\n\
    432 MHz and the CR-based UAV testbed. First, we deployed the CR-based UAV sensing\n\
    the 432 MHz frequency. Second, we used the jammer device to execute the jamming\
    \ attack\nto that frequency. The CR-based UAV then sensed the high signal level\
    \ in that frequency\nand it autonomously switched to its backup frequency. Although\
    \ it was an outdoor\nexperiment, it was important to isolate it, keeping it away\
    \ from other variables. Therefore,\nwe experimentally deﬁned its backup channel\
    \ as 440 MHz and its level threshold to −40 dB.\nIt was necessary to avoid that\
    \ other PUs and/or SUs interfered in the experiment, and to\nreduce the incidence\
    \ of false alarms.\nFigure 9 shows that the CR-based UAV prototype performed as\
    \ expected under a\njamming attack.\nFigure 9. Data collected using the CR-based\
    \ UAV. It kept using the 432 MHz frequency until it sensed\na transmission level\
    \ over the threshold. It then switched to its backup channel at 440 MHz.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 830\n15 of 27\nFor a clearer understanding of the radio spectrum environment\
    \ within the frequency\nrange from 432 MHz to 441 MHz, we used the CR platform\
    \ to make a data collection\nduring a jamming attack, in similar circumstances\
    \ to the CR-based UAV testbed experiment.\nFigure 10 shows the data collected.\
    \ It highlights the 432 MHz frequency level discrepancy\nunder the jamming attack,\
    \ related to other frequencies within the measured range.\nFigure 10. Data collected\
    \ using the CR platform. It shows a map of the level in dB measured within\nthe\
    \ frequency range from 432 MHz to 441 MHz throughout the time.\nThese results\
    \ show that even switching to a channel around the same frequency bands\ncould\
    \ be enough to avoid a jamming attack, considering the attacker does not have\
    \ access\nto the new channel. Furthermore, note that we used a simple reactive\
    \ algorithm based\non static channel noise threshold, but especially proactive\
    \ algorithms may beneﬁt from\nsuch data collections, as Machine Learning techniques\
    \ could be trained and tested over\nreal-scenario data.\n6. State-of-the-Art of\
    \ CR-Based UAVs\nWe conducted a review in November 2020 in search of works involving\
    \ UAVs and\nSDR and/or CR. The main idea was to ﬁnd the state-of-the-art of CR-based\
    \ UAVs. As\nSDR-based UAVs represent somehow a step backwards for CR-based UAVs,\
    \ they were also\nincluded in this review.\nWe evaluated a total of 520 publications\
    \ from four different digital libraries. However,\nthe majority of these articles\
    \ were identiﬁed marginally related to the scope of this work.\nThus, the ﬁnal\
    \ studies dataset obtained after analyzing them regarding the following\nexclusion\
    \ criteria consisted of 64 articles:\n1.\nnon-English publications. Although we\
    \ used English language keywords, we found\na few publications in other languages.\
    \ We had to exclude them merely because we\nwould not be able to analyze them\
    \ in depth;\n2.\npapers that are not downloadable online;\n3.\npublications that\
    \ are not related to CR, SDR, or UAVs as deﬁned in this work (other\nresearch\
    \ ﬁelds);\n4.\npapers focusing on CR or SDR applications other than UAVs wireless\
    \ communication.\nFigure 11 outlines the number of publications per year, among\
    \ those selected in this\nreview. It shows an increasing interest over the recent\
    \ years in this research ﬁeld. Although\nthe year of 2020 was evaluated from January\
    \ until November, it already has a high number\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n16 of 27\n\
    of publications. Note that a number of papers might have been published from January\n\
    2020 to November 2020, but were not yet available online.\nFigure 11. Related\
    \ publications per year. The year of 2020 was evaluated from January until November.\n\
    Figure 12 presents keywords graph and occurrence mapping for all 64 articles selected\n\
    on this review. We consider keywords with at least two occurrences and at least\
    \ one\nlink to other keywords. Thereby, the keyword mapping consists of 34 keywords\
    \ in total.\nIn Figure 12, it is possible to note an expressive amount of links\
    \ correlating UAV-related\nkeywords and SDR-related keywords. However, although\
    \ CR-related keywords are present\nin Figure 12, there are few links correlating\
    \ them to UAVs. Thus, Figure 12 outlines the\npaucity of studies on the integration\
    \ of CR and UAVs.\nFigure 12. Keywords graph and occurrence mapping for all 64\
    \ articles selected on this review.\nIn order to measure how ﬁt each selected\
    \ publication is to CR-based UAVs research\nﬁeld, we analyzed each paper regarding\
    \ the following aspects:\n1.\nthe work presents a theoretical analysis (Q1);\n\
    2.\nthe work presents practical results (Q2);\n3.\nthe work involves a real SDR-based\
    \ UAV (Q3);\n4.\nthe work is centered on CR-based UAVs (Q4);\n5.\nthe work involves\

    \ be separated in two groups: one using SDR-based UAVs\nfor different applications,\
    \ and another studying the impact of integrating CR technology\nwith UAVs, mainly\
    \ with theoretical analysis and simulation results.\nA notable exception to this\
    \ is Sklivanitis et al. [119]. The authors designed, developed,\nand validated\
    \ through real indoor and outdoor experiments a CR platform for UAVs. Their\n\
    experiment involves on-ground CR nodes interacting with a CR-based UAV, and it\
    \ shows\nthat their proposed platform optimizes wireless networks subject to interference,\
    \ thus\nmaximizing their throughput. To the best of our knowledge, their work\
    \ presents the ﬁrst\nCR-based UAV real experiment in the literature.\n7. Challenges\
    \ and Future Research Directions\nTo better grasp how the occupation pattern behaves\
    \ in spectrum bands, a channel\nwhite-space mapping may be helpful. As the authors\
    \ of [90] demonstrated, distinct areas\non the map (Figure 13) may have a varied\
    \ spectrum behavior. Therefore, a data exploration\nstudy like this is essential\
    \ to improve the PU arrival prediction and, consequently, enhance\nthe spectrum\
    \ handover. In addition, a white-space mapped area may be crucial in order to\n\
    achieve an UAV ﬂight path guided by spectrum occupancy.\nAlthough some studies\
    \ [153–156] have successfully employed Machine Learning algo-\nrithms to predict\
    \ the PUs arrivals, most of them use simulated data. Even though simulated\ndata\
    \ have importance in proof-testing new approaches, real data are indispensable\
    \ when\nintegrating UAVs to CR. Likewise, these studies generally concentrate\
    \ on prediction of one\nor few channels, although a large range of channels may\
    \ be preferable on UAV context.\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n19 of 27\nFigure 13. Amount\
    \ of 6 MHz TV channels available for SUs in the United States in 2015. Adapted\n\
    from the work in [90].\nAs noted before, the proportion of SDR devices presents\
    \ as a major challenge. Al-\nthough devices such as Hope’s RF RFM22B may initially\
    \ comply with this requirement,\na device with a wider frequency range may be\
    \ desirable for the use in UAV communica-\ntion. In consonance with hardware improvements,\
    \ to the extent of our knowledge, there\nhas been no study concerning the software\
    \ adjustments required when combining SDR\nand UAVs.\n8. Conclusions\nIn this\
    \ paper, we presented an overview on CR-based UAVs, as well as their hardware\n\
    and software requirements. We also indicated the ﬁrst steps taken towards integrating\
    \ CR\nwith UAVs, and a review of the state-of-the-art of CR for UAV communications.\
    \ This work\nhas also shown that several questions remain unclear, in particular\
    \ regarding the impact\nof CR to UAVs energy consumption, and the effects of UAVs\
    \ mobility to CR spectrum\nmobility and spectrum sharing. We also speciﬁed steps\
    \ to build a simple and low-cost\nCR-based UAV testbed.\nFuture work shall consider\
    \ a channel occupation mapping aiming at achieving an\nUAV ﬂight path guided by\
    \ spectrum occupancy. PU arrivals prediction based on Machine\nLearning algorithms\
    \ on real data collected by UAVs is a key element concerning the study\nof CR\
    \ algorithms for UAVs. Finally, CR hardware and software that meet the constraints\n\
    and requirements of UAVs are also needed.\nAuthor Contributions: Papers compilation,\

    content Highlights • Novel site-specific water production functions (WPFs) were
    developed and tested. • New zoning procedures for variable rate irrigation were
    established. • The k-NN WPF accurately predicted cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. • Sector zoning was predicted to enhance cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. Abstract Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority issue
    since available fresh water resources are limited. Water production functions
    (WPFs), mathematical relationships between applied water and crop yield, are useful
    tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield reduction due to
    deficit irrigation. This study aimed at (i) designing and evaluating site-specific
    WPFs (using k nearest neighbors (k-NN), multiple linear regression, and neural
    networks), (ii) simulating yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone
    control VRI center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs, (iii) using the
    best WPF to investigate different cotton irrigation and zoning strategies using
    integer linear programming, and (iv) comparing soil-based and WPF-based zones
    for sector control VRI systems. A two-year cotton irrigation experiment (2013–2014)
    was implemented to study irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship across different
    soil types. The site-specific k-NN WPFs showed the highest performance with root
    mean square error equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
    The result indicated that variable rate irrigation with limited sector control
    capability could enhance cotton lint yield under supplemental irrigation when
    field-level spatial soil heterogeneity is significant. The temporal changes in
    climate and rainfall patterns, however, had a great impact on cotton response
    to irrigation in west Tennessee, a moderately humid region with short season environment.
    We believe site-specific WPFs are useful empirical tools for on-farm irrigation
    research. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords CottonPrecision

    1.1. Variable rate irrigation The demand for food and fiber is increasing as the
    world’s population grows. Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority
    issue since available fresh water resources are limited. Row crop supplemental
    irrigation is rapidly expanding in the moderately humid region of west Tennessee
    because of a trend of stabilizing yields by irrigation and high commodity prices.
    However, the soils of west Tennessee exhibit high spatial and temporal variability
    of soil characteristics that relate to moisture availability for crop production
    at the field-level. It has been shown in a variety of studies that soil characteristics
    such as soil water holding capacity and depth of soil significantly affects crop
    yield, hence irrigation strategies should be adjusted in regard to the soil type
    (Duncan, 2012). Consequently, variable rate irrigation (VRI) is recommended as
    the appropriate irrigation scenario to address field-level spatiotemporal heterogeneity
    and thus how, when, and where to irrigate (Duncan, 2012). VRI is expected to improve
    water-use efficiency, increase productivity, save fuel and decrease nutrient leaching
    (Pan et al., 2013). Several authors have stressed the potential water conservation
    that has been observed using VRI systems (Evans et al., 1996, Duke et al., 1997,
    Sadler et al., 2005, Hedley and Yule, 2009). For instance, Hedley and Yule (2009)
    compared VRI and conventional uniform irrigation methods and found that 9–19%
    of irrigation water was saved, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching. The state-of-the-art
    zone control VRI systems, allow farmers to adjust irrigation applications across
    fields, by pulsing individual sprinklers or banks of sprinklers on and off. The
    sector control VRI systems cut pie shape zones simply by adjusting the revolution
    speed of the center pivot between given pairs of angles. Pan et al. (2013) analyzed
    soil water status through spatial and temporal data and suggested this method
    as a means to assess the potential of VRI and to schedule irrigation. Recently,
    Haghverdi et al. (2015b) used integer linear programing (ILP) to find the optimum
    number and spatial arrangement of irrigation management zones for center pivot
    systems with limited sector control capability. They used soil properties to delineate
    management zones, yet suggested to investigate crop response to water amount across
    different soil types as a means to provide crop-specific irrigation management
    zones. In practice, the level of irrigation management being followed by the majority
    of producers is relatively low, while experience with successful zone control
    VRI management is rare among producers and service providers. Initially, the larger
    price tag, accompanied with the fear of complexity that is associated with using
    zone control VRI, are the two main stumbling blocks experienced by farmers. The
    sector control VRI systems require less capital investment and the operation/maintenance
    is also easier than that of zone control VRI. Most of the center pivots that farmers
    use today are equipped to allow a limited number of pie shape sectors to be made,
    without any additional control panel upgrades. The knowledge and full use of this
    capability is the perfect and most appropriate step in bridging the gap between
    current practice and cutting-edge zone control technology (Haghverdi et al., 2015b).
    Currently, it is not easy to quantify the potential production benefits of zone
    control and sector control VRI systems over conventional uniform irrigation systems
    in a given field, further contributing to producers’ present hesitancy and reluctance,
    with regards to investing in VRI systems. However, before the benefits of VRI
    can be achieved, it is necessary to identify the spatial heterogeneity of soil
    within a given field and delineate homogenous management zones wherein identical
    inputs of water can be applied. In practice, the number of zones depends on the
    target input, available equipment and the crop(s) planted. However, a corollary
    expectation is that varying the inputs within the management zones will facilitate
    optimal yields. This desire leads to the development of water production functions
    (WPF) where crop yield is mathematically related to the amount of irrigation water.
    1.2. Water production functions The term production function (PF) may be assigned
    to any mathematical relationship between crop yield and input components such
    as water, fertilizers and energy (De Juan et al., 1996). In practice, almost all
    the derived PFs require crop water use as an independent variable. PFs predict
    total dry matter (or marketable product of each crop) as a dependent variable,
    while the independent variables are transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET) or
    the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). The PFs are categorized into
    crop water production functions (CWPFs) and water production functions (WPF) that
    use ET and IW as independent variables, respectively. IW may consist of different
    components such as the crop water requirement, pre-planting irrigation, leaching
    requirement, and rainfall (Igbadun et al., 2007). Recently, some studies have
    aimed to revisit and rebuild the concept of PF including the development of a
    WPF for water logging stress on corn (Kuang et al., 2012) and a rice water – fertilizer
    PF (Ai-hua et al., 2012). Tong and Guo (2013) included an estimation of uncertainty
    in CWPF along with the optimal allocation of water resources in an irrigation
    area. Saseendran et al. (2014) established location-specific CWPFs using long-term
    averaged data for corn in Colorado. They used the RZWQM2 model (Ahuja et al.,
    2000) and historical weather data to develop average corn CWPFs across years and
    locations. Sadler et al. (2002) applied WPFs at field level and observed significant
    differences in corn response to irrigation within and across soil map units. Holan
    et al. (2008) formulated spatially dependent WPFs that later were used by Stone
    and Sadler (2015) who reported high accuracies for the spatial modeling of corn
    yield. Wang et al. (2007) derived cotton and wheat water-salinity PFs. Dinar et
    al. (1986) derived cotton CWPF under saline conditions in California to improve
    irrigation management. Classical PFs are useful tools for irrigation management
    and economic analysis of yield reduction due to deficit irrigation, but there
    are some shortcomings associated with them. The behavior of complex ecological
    systems is non-linear, but most PFs are based on easily built linear regression-based
    equations and are thus not particularly powerful representations of these systems
    (Dai et al., 2011, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). However, recent studies have investigated
    the use of more robust and non-linear techniques to predict yield and model complex
    systems, particularly powerful empirical algorithms derived from machine learning
    data mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al., 2010, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). Data mining
    could be defined as the process of capturing important and useful information
    from large data sets (Mucherino et al., 2009). An extensive review on data mining
    methods and their application in agricultural related studies was gathered by
    Huang et al. (2010). Machine learning algorithms were employed to some extent
    for predicting yield of different crops. Fortin et al. (2010) used artificial
    neural networks (ANNs) for predicting potato tuber growth as well as its in-field
    variations in Canada. They reported that if enough data is input to an ANN model,
    one can precisely model site-specific tuber growth. Dai et al. (2011) adopted
    ANN and multi-linear regression models to simulate the response of sunflower yield
    to soil moisture and salinity. This resulted in ANN models having higher precision
    than regression for modeling relationships between crop yield and soil moisture
    and salinity at different crop growth periods (Dai et al., 2011). Haghverdi et
    al. (2014b) derived some novel WPFs and compared data mining-based methods with
    traditional regression procedures. They utilized ANN and decision tree modeling
    algorithms to derive water salinity PFs for spring wheat and found the results
    promising. 1.3. Site-specific water production functions & variable rate irrigation
    Traditional irrigation/agronomic work tries to address the irrigation related
    questions by means of small plot trials over multiple sites and across several
    years. This is probably the best way to collect the necessary data in controlled
    environments following the statistical principles behind design of experiments.
    However, there are some shortcomings. Given the time consuming and labor intensive
    nature of field experiments, this approach becomes unrealistic for the near future
    (Drummond et al., 2003). In addition, this method relies on scaling and transforming
    small plot research findings to operational management of farmers’ fields. In
    reality, each field has its own spatial and temporal heterogeneity of main attributes
    and this complexity requires site-specific irrigation management solutions. An
    alternative option is to simulate the behavior of the fields using mechanistic
    crop growth models. However, the drawback of these models is that they are time-consuming
    and expensive to develop because of the numerous inputs that need to be collected
    to run them (Drummond et al., 2003). Precision agriculture (PA) enables farmers
    to collect numerous site-specific data. Empirical analysis of these data may be
    the key to aid farmers in their occupational practice. PA is successful if accurate
    and detailed information about crop response to specific conditions is provided
    (Drummond et al., 2003). Quantifying crop response to water is the first step
    toward optimizing irrigation, and is therefore a critical issue for farmers, governmental
    agencies and consulting companies. Given the time consuming and expensive nature
    of irrigation studies, developing computer tools and models are very helpful in
    providing a comprehensive understanding of irrigation-yield relationship for different
    crops across different soil types. Robust algorithms are needed for identifying
    site-specific crop yield responses to environmental and management parameters
    and helping to find either optimum practices or alternative scenarios. The increased
    cost and complexity of variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems compared to conventional
    systems are the main obstacles barring widespread adaptation by farmers. VRI related
    research projects have mainly focused on (i) designing sprinklers to spatially
    vary irrigation rates and (ii) developing software/hardware for guiding the VRI
    system (Pan et al., 2013). There thus remains by necessity, novel models and techniques
    that simplify irrigation zone delineation, and provide an estimation of attainable
    production benefits of VRI systems, the main goal of this study. The objectives
    of this study are to: (i) Use multiple data mining techniques to design customized
    site-specific WPFs for cotton. (ii) Determine the best site-specific WPF for cotton.
    (iii) Simulate yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone control VRI
    center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs. (iv) Formulate an optimization
    problem for sector control VRI systems using integer linear programing and water
    production functions to maximize yield. (v) Compare the spatial arrangement of
    the optimum soil-based and WPF-based irrigation management zones for sector control
    VRI center pivot systems. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Field of study A 73-ha
    cotton field that contained two center pivots for irrigation within which the
    resident farmer practiced uniform nitrogen (N) application and variable rate potassium
    and phosphorus application was selected as the study area (Fig. 1). The field
    is located in southwestern Dyer County in west Tennessee within a moderately humid
    region along the Mississippi river. The fields are Mississippi river terrace alluvial
    deposits that have produced Robinsonville loam and fine sandy loam, Commerce silty
    clay loam, and Crevasse sandy loam soils (Fig. 1). The mean monthly growing season
    precipitation and temperature is 97 mm month−1 and 21 °C from May to November,
    respectively. Soil sampling and modeling of the fields different soil constituents,
    particularly soil available water content, showed substantial spatial heterogeneity
    and as much as a four-fold increase in the variability of available soil water
    content within the effective root zone across the field (Haghverdi et al., 2015c).
    Given the spatial variability of these soil properties, this field was an ideal
    site for a study of the spatial optimization of a VRI system. Download : Download

    Dyer County, Tennessee, USA. 2.2. Irrigation experiment A two-year experiment
    (2013–2014) was implemented to study the irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship
    across the different soil types. The field was no-tillage planted to cotton (‘PHY375’
    variety) on the 30th of May, 2013, and to cotton (‘Stoneville 4946’ variety) on
    the 5th of May, 2014. Crop pest management was implemented following state extension
    recommendations. In the first year, the field was harvested on December 2–3, 2013
    and in the 2nd year it was harvested on October 18–20, 2014. There is some overlap
    between the two center pivots that cover the majority of the field (Fig. 2). Irrigation
    scheduling was carried out by the producer since the optimum practical goal was
    to enhance knowledge and expertise of the farmer over the course of the experiment.
    We provided sufficient information for the farmer to irrigate appropriately using
    a wireless network of soil sensors installed throughout the field of study, as
    well as an on-site weather station to estimate ET. Additionally, the Management
    of Irrigation Systems in Tennessee (MOIST) program (http://bioengr.ag.utk.edu/weather/)
    was employed to assist the farmer with irrigation scheduling. MOIST is an irrigation
    decision support tool that delivers irrigation recommendations that consider both
    ET and soil water status. We simulated spatial variability in water application
    across different soil types (Fig. 2) by programing the pivots and partially swapping
    the sprinklers. The pivot’s control panels were Valley Select2 module (Valmont
    Industries, Inc) that were programmable up to 9 sectors, thus allowing one to
    vary the location, frequency, and amount of irrigation across the field by changing
    the travel speed of the irrigation system. Consequently, the sprinklers were swapped
    to apply approximately 50% more/less irrigation water (IW) than the farmer’s decision.
    The IW on sector zones was between 25% and 30% higher/lower than the IW that was
    set by the farmer. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download

    the study area (b). This figure is adapted from Haghverdi et al. (2015c). 2.3.
    Input attributes and data preparation Table 1 summarizes the data used in this
    study to derive the WPFs. The field was sampled on March 21 and 22, 2014 where
    400 undisturbed core soil samples from 100 sampling locations at 4 different depths
    were collected to measure soil texture, soil water content, and bulk density.
    Then, the soil water retention curves were predicted for samples using pseudo-continuous
    pedotransfer functions (Haghverdi et al., 2014a) and interpolated to generate
    high-resolution maps. In addition, soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    was collected using a Veris 3100 (Veris Technologies, Salina, KS) instrument.
    More information on proximal soil data collection/sensing and modeling is provided
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). The cotton lint yield maps were obtained from the
    yield monitors. A quality assessment of the raw cotton lint yield data was conducted
    to remove outliers and bad data. The study field was gridded into 5-m × 5-m cells
    or pixels (25 m2 area per cell) and for each cell, all attributes in Table 1 (inputs
    and outputs) were obtained. Ordinary kriging was used for interpolation. Empirical
    semivariograms were calculated using the Geostatistical Analyst toolbox in ArcGIS
    10.2.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California) considering 12 lags and an omnidirectional
    stable model. A total of 16,000 cells were prepared after removing cells with
    missing/bad data. Since neither pivot was shut off in the overlap zone, the water
    applied in that zone was considered to be the summation of the applied water by
    the both pivots. Table 1. Input/output attributes for deriving site-specific water
    production functions (WPF) for 2 center pivots in a 73 ha field in west Tennessee.

    for four layers (i.e. 0–25 cm, 25–50 cm, 50–75 cm, 75–100 cm) covering crop effective
    root zone. c The farmer practiced variable rate P and K, but nitrogen was applied
    uniformly. In many situations, there are only a few major driving forces that
    govern a system. As the number of input predictors increases, the likelihood of
    redundancy or high correlation between variables increases with more than one
    attribute capable of explaining the behavior of the system. Principal component
    analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that is used to reduce the dimensionality
    or the number of high correlations in a given data set. PCA finds hidden patterns
    within a data set and extracts the important information from the raw data and
    replaces it with a group of new input predictors called principle components.
    Principal components are orthogonal to each other and each of them is a linear
    combination of the original input attributes. (Mathworks, 2014, Abdi and Williams,
    2010). In this study, we used Matlab 2015a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.) to
    perform PCA. The Hotelling’s T2, a statistical measure of the multivariate distance
    of each observation from the center of the data set, was calculated to find the
    most important PCs. Prior to establishing WPFs, the data set was randomly divided
    into 10 almost equal-size subsets. The modeling was repeated 10 times where each
    time one subset was assigned to the test phase and the rest of them were used
    to develop the WPFs. 2.4. Modeling and simulation 2.4.1. Establishing site-specific
    water production functions Multiple linear regression water production function,
    MLR WPF Fig. 3 illustrates the three methods that were developed to establish
    site-specific WPFs. Traditionally linear regression is used to derive WPFs that
    typically result in a curvilinear representation of water-yield relationship.
    We followed the recommendations of Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and used k-means cluster
    analysis to divide the data into 4 homogenous soil property sub-groups. Then,
    for each sub-group, a separate MLR-WPF was developed considering IW, IW2 and IW
    × PCs as input predictors. The ten most important PCs were used as input for clustering.

    Fig. 3. The three workflow processes used in this study to develop customized
    site-specific water production functions (WPF) to predict cotton yields for 2
    center pivots in a 73 ha field in west Tennessee; k-NN: k nearest neighbors, PCA:
    principle component analysis, ANN: artificial neural networks. K nearest neighbors
    water production function, k-NN WPF The k-NN is a non-parametric lazy learning
    algorithm that processes all of the data when prediction of the response(s) for
    a new observation is required. The k-NN was considered to be among the top ten
    techniques used for data mining (Wu et al., 2008), but in general has been applied
    less than other data mining techniques in agricultural studies (Mucherino et al.,
    2009). The k-NN considers a distance function, such as the Euclidean distance,
    to find so-called closer observations with higher similarity. Then, it combines
    the response of the k nearest surrounding observations to predict the response
    for new observations. Fig. 3 provides a visual step-by-step guide to deriving
    the site-specific k-NN WPFs, where first the raw inputs (Table 1) were converted
    to PCs. Then, the first 10 PCs and the IW were converted to input predictors with
    a zero mean and a standard deviation of one, and then the ranges of input predictors
    were tuned following the method recommended by Nemes et al. (2006). In order to
    predict yield for a target cell of the test data set at a specific irrigation
    level (I∗), the following steps were taken. First, distance from the target cell
    to every cell in the development data set was computed as the summation of the
    differences among their input predictors: (1) where di is the distance between
    ith cell in the development data set and the target cell, Δaij is the difference
    between jth attribute of the two cells and N = 11 is the number of the input attributes.
    Second, a reference data set was created consisting of those cells in the development
    data set that had irrigation levels within a 20-mm range from the target irrigation
    level (i.e. I∗). Third, the k nearest cells to the target cell were selected from
    the reference data set. Fourth, a distance-dependent weight was assigned to each
    k nearest cell (Nemes et al., 2006): (2) where k is the number of selected nearest
    cells, p is the design parameter and wi is the weight of ith cell. Finally, the
    cotton yield for the target cell (Yp) was predicted as the weighted average of
    the yield values for the k nearest cells: (3) A cross-validation procedure was
    designed to identify the optimum k and p values. The parameter k was varied from
    1 to 10 and p was changed from 0.5 to 3 with 0.5 increments. For each combination
    of k and p parameters, a bagging technique was implemented to compute the output
    of the k-NN-WPF (Breiman, 1996). In other words, the output was the aggregation
    of the output of multiple WPFs which were established on different realizations
    of the reference dataset using sampling with replacement. Haghverdi et al. (2015a)
    recommended that the number of ensemble values be 40. The modeling was done using
    Matlab R2014a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.). Artificial neural network water
    production function, ANN WPF The past performance of artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) suggests that they have potential to establish reasonable WPFs (Haghverdi
    et al., 2014b). A three-layer perceptron model was selected for this study. SPSS
    Modeler 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) automatically computed the best number of
    neurons to be used in the hidden layer to derive ANN WPFs. The first 10 PCs and
    IW were chosen as input predictors. The bagging technique was implemented to enhance
    model stability. The number of ensembles was chosen to be 40. Thirty percent of
    the training data were assigned to cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. 2.4.2.
    Simulating irrigation and zoning strategies The WPF with highest performance was
    selected to simulate irrigation and zoning strategies. Note that both modeling
    and simulation phases were done separately for 2013 and 2014 data. The seasonal
    irrigation level was changed from 0 to 150 mm with 10-mm increments. The optimum
    cotton lint yield maps were delineated for the three irrigation strategies including
    (i) uniform irrigation, (ii) VRI with limited sector control capability and (iii)
    a hypothetical situation in which each cell (5 × 5 m2) to be irrigated individually
    at optimum level. We adopted and modified the integer linear programing (ILP)
    optimization process developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) to find the optimum
    arrangement of management zones to maximize cotton lint yield for VRI systems
    with limited sector control capability. Each center pivot irrigation system was
    considered to consist of 360 sectors each 1 deg wide. A total of 12,241 possible
    zones were obtained by all combinations of 1 deg sectors into sectors from 1 to
    360 deg long (Table 2). Then, the optimum irrigation level to maximize cotton
    lint yield was predicted for each zone by means of k-NN WPF separately for each
    cropping season. The optimization process was formulated as follows: (4) subject
    to (5) (6) (7) where xi is the decision variable for zone i, y is the optimum
    yield per unit area predicted by k-NN WPF within zone i, n is the total number
    of the zones, l is the length of each zone in degrees, cij is a coefficient equal
    to 1 if angle j is covered by zone i otherwise equal to 0, Pmax is the maximum
    number of desired zones. Table 2. All of the sector zones that could be delineated
    underneath a center pivot systems. This Table is adapted from Haghverdi et al.

    359–1 … 359–359 a X–Y: start angle-end angle. The objective function (4) maximizes
    cotton lint yields across the zones. Restriction (5) guarantees that each degree
    is covered only by one zone and the optimum zoning scheme covers the entire area
    underneath the center pivots. Constraint (6) keeps the total number of the zones
    less than the maximum user-defined number. Constraint (7) ensures that the length
    of the sectors is greater than the minimum user-defined (i.e. 5 degree in this
    study). If a sector was selected, the decision variable of the model, xi, was
    equal to 1 otherwise 0. 2.5. Evaluation procedure The performance of the WPFs
    was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE)
    and the correlation coefficient (r): (8) (9) (10) where Ei, and Mi are the estimated
    and the measured cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively; n is the number of
    actual cells in test/validation set; Em and Mm are the mean of estimated and the
    mean of actual cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively. 3. Results 3.1. Principal
    component analysis PCA was performed to combine and summarize the variability
    in the input attributes in Table 1 (Fig. 4). A cumulative Hotelling’s T2 was plotted
    against the number of PCs where about 96% of the inputs were explained by considering
    10 PCs, but adding more PCs did not improve nor explain most of the variability.
    Our goal was to explain at least 95% of the variability in our data set using
    selected PCs. Consequently, we used only the first 10 PCs in our WPFs. However,
    to provide an overall insight regarding performance of the PCA approach in this
    study, we only discussed the coefficient of the first two PCs in detail. Download

    by soil structure had the highest influence on PC1. On PC2, percent of clay and
    water content at FC and PWP of the shallow soil played the major role. ECa, irrigation
    and fertilizer produced medium coefficients for both PCs. The PC1 map to a great
    extent showed the expected pattern of soil physical and hydraulic properties across
    field (Fig. 4b). The PC1 negative values corresponds to soils with lower water
    holding capacity and available water content which were formed by three regions
    at the mid-east, mid-south and north west of the field. The PC1 is plotted against
    PC2 when ECa data were used to color code the points (Fig. 4, panel d). There
    was a clear distinction between (i) points with lower ECa (corresponding to coarse
    soil with lower available water content) which were skewed and clustered towards
    upper left corner of the figure and (ii) points with higher ECa (corresponding
    to fine-textured soil with higher water holding capacity) which were skewed towards
    upper right corner of the plot. The transition section at the middle of the plot
    represented soil with medium ECa, corresponding to moderate available water content.

    k. The trend was identical for both cropping seasons; the error started to decline
    as number of nearest neighbors increased, reached a minimum at k = 5, and started
    to increase again. There was almost no difference in performance of WPFs with
    different p values and k less than 4, but the WPFs with lower p values exhibited
    a higher increase in RMSE for k greater than 4. In general, the standard deviation
    of RMSE values among 10 subsets consistently decreased with increasing k from
    1 to 10 regardless of p values. The optimum parameters for k and p were equal
    to 4 and 1.5, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download

    cropping seasons using all three WPFs. The k-NN exhibited the highest performance
    and accuracy for both 2013 and 2014 with RMSE equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194
    Mg ha−1, respectively, which was in agreement with well scattered cloud of points
    around 1:1 line (Fig. 6). The ANN (MLR) exhibited 60% (73%) and 52% (65%) increase
    in RMSE compared to the corresponding k-NN WPFs in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons,
    respectively. The ANN WPFs had a better performance (i.e. lower RMSE values and
    higher r) than MLR WPFs for both cropping seasons. The low MBE errors showed there
    was no systematic under/over estimation for any of the WPFs. However, both ANN
    and MLR exhibited partial over-estimation tendency for plots with yield smaller
    than 0.40 Mg ha−1 and 0.60 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively.
    All WPFs showed a slightly better performance in 2014 in comparison with 2013
    considering the correlation coefficient and normal RMSE (i.e. RMSE divided by
    range of yield variation) as the criteria. For instance, ANN WPF had normal RMSE

    7 (panels a and b) shows the cotton lint yield predicted by k-NN WPF for different
    irrigation scenarios (i.e. uniform irrigation and irrigating each cell individually
    at optimum level) over the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons. Yield was lower in
    2013 than in 2014 for all irrigation levels. The predicted yield was slightly
    different between pivots, yet followed the same general trend across irrigation
    levels. We attribute this to differences in soil spatial distribution underneath
    the pivots. Given uniform irrigation scenarios, in 2013 the highest predicted
    yield was (for 110 mm seasonal IW) 1.09 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 and 0.98 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1
    for the east and west pivots, respectively. In 2013 as IW increased, there was
    a small overall increase in yield up to the maximum level (i.e. IW = 110 mm) but
    it declined after that for higher IW amounts. If each cell was irrigated at optimum
    level, yield was improved to 1.19 ± 0.05 Mg ha−1 and 1.11 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 underneath
    east and west pivots, respectively. In 2014, there were two peaks at 20 and 120
    mm IWs. There was a sharp increase in predicted yield for small irrigation amount
    compared to rainfed situation in 2014, then it decreased and leveled off for most
    of the intermediate irrigation levels and increased again at IW = 120 mm yet continuously
    decreased after that. The highest predicted yields (IW = 20 mm) were 1.52 ± 0.12
    Mg ha−1 and 1.62 ± 0.12 Mg ha−1, underneath the east and west pivots, respectively.
    When yield in each cell was optimized with a distinct level of IW, the predicted
    yield increased to 1.71 ± 0.10 Mg ha−1 and 1.80 ± 0.09 Mg ha−1 underneath the
    east and west pivots, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (422KB)

    variable rate irrigation (VRI) scenarios for 2 center pivots in a 73 ha field
    in west Tennessee. Panels a and b: the dash lines with circles and triangles represent
    predicted yield under uniform irrigation for the east and west pivots, respectively.
    Individual circles and triangles above the line represent estimated yield for

    represent predicted yield for sector control VRI for the east and west pivots,
    respectively. Bars are associated with right-side y axis and represent average
    irrigation applied by each pivot. Fig. 7 (panels c and d) depicts the average
    irrigation and yield for optimum arrangement of the sectors. Yield was always
    higher in 2014 than in 2013. In both years there was a constant increase in yield
    by adding to the number of sectors, yet the highest boost occurred when pivot
    area was divided into two sectors. The yield was higher under the east pivot than
    under west pivot in 2013, but the opposite was true in 2014. In 2013, as number
    of zones increased, there was a slight reduction in optimum level of IW underneath
    the west pivot, but it remained almost constant across a different number of zones
    for the east pivot. In 2014, as the number of zones increased, higher IW was predicted
    to get the optimum yield underneath west pivot and same was true under the east
    pivot but less pronounced. Compared to rainfed agriculture, for the east pivot,
    the best uniform supplemental irrigation strategy was predicted to boost the yield
    up to 41% and 47% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. Sector control
    VRI added about 4% to the expected yield in both years. For the west pivot, compared
    to rainfed, the best uniform supplemental irrigation scenario improved the yield
    as much as 25% and 40% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. The sector
    control VRI added 4% in 2013 and 7% in 2014 to the expected yield boost. Fig.
    8 illustrates the thematic yield maps predicted by k-NN WPFs for the rainfed condition
    along with multiple irrigation strategies (i.e. best uniform irrigation, cutting
    4 sectors, and irrigating each cell individually at optimum level) for the both
    pivots and cropping seasons. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) suggested four sectors as
    optimum to minimize soil spatial variation underneath the pivots. To compare the
    zoning results across the studies, we selected 4 sectors here too. By visual assessment
    of the yield maps, the biggest change occurred from rainfed to uniform irrigation
    followed by the change from sector control VRI to irrigating each cell individually.
    In 2014, the spatial yield pattern for the rainfed scenario is similar to soil
    texture maps and high resolution soil available water maps for the field of study
    illustrated and modeled by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). They showed that coarse-textured
    regions with low available water content were located in the middle, eastern and
    southwestern parts of the eastern pivot as well as in northern and northwestern
    of the western pivot. In 2013, however, it is hard to match the yield pattern
    for the rainfed scenario against soil spatial distribution, yet yield patterns
    under uniform irrigation were somewhat similar to spatial pattern of soil physical
    and hydraulic properties within the effective root zone. For both pivots and cropping
    seasons, yield predicted under sector control VRI scenario exhibited lower minimum
    but higher maximum than that for the corresponding uniform irrigation maps. Moving
    from sector control VRI into the hypothetical scenario of irrigating each 25 m2
    cell individually, yield improvement mostly occurred for cells with low expected
    yield. In other words, the maximum predicted yield remained almost unchanged but
    minimum predicted yield was substantially improved. Download : Download high-res

    13-W-R for example is 13 for the 2013 cropping season, W for the west center pivot,
    and R for rainfed fields. The columns are ordered by irrigation status for each
    pivot as uniform irrigation (U), sector control pie shape VRI (P), and individual
    cell (M). Fig. 9 shows the spatial arrangement of the optimum sectors from this
    study and the previous study by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). In this study, k-NN
    WPF along with ILP optimization were used to find optimum zones when the objective
    was to maximize cotton lint yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) found the best spatial
    arrangement of sector zones using ILP optimization and soil related attributes
    without considering the irrigation-yield relationships. They used soil available
    water content, soil ECa, yield data and Landsat 8 panchromatic satellite data
    when the objective was to minimize soil spatial variation within each zone. The
    spatial arrangement of optimum pie shape sectors to maximize lint yield changed
    from 2013 to 2014 for the both pivots. The 2013 zones for the east pivot were
    somewhat similar to zones by AWC and ECa data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study.
    In 2014 for the east pivot, three sectors were located on the coarse-textured
    region with low soil available water content, while a big sector covered rest
    of the pivot. There were some similarities between 2014 zones for the west pivot
    and zoning by ECa and AWC data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. In 2013, sectors
    in northern part of the west pivot were somewhat similar to sectors from AWC data
    from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. The spatial arrangement of optimum zones
    using yield data (by Haghverdi et al., 2015b) was different than the configuration
    of zones in our study. Download : Download high-res image (613KB) Download : Download

    production functions The k-NN performed better than MLR and ANN in predicting
    cotton yield. It seems even dividing the field into more homogenous regions did
    not reduce the complexity enough to get the same level of accuracy by MLR WPFs
    as achieved by k-NN WPF. The ANN WPF showed a better performance than MLR, although
    we used the entire data set to train the ANN models. This is in line with the
    results reported by Haghverdi et al., 2014b, Drummond et al., 2003 who found ANN
    a better option than MLR models to predict yield. However, ANN in our study was
    not able to provide the same level of performance as k-NN WPF, meaning ANN could
    not entirely handle the huge amount of data and complex relationships between
    input and outputs. The efficiency of k-NN in our study is in line with the promising
    results reported in the literature: to model soil hydraulic properties (e.g. Nemes
    et al., 2006, Haghverdi et al., 2015a), to estimate cultivar coefficient of crop
    models (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2009) and for prediction of daily weather data
    (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2008). In general, linear techniques are not suitable
    to model the spatial variability of crop yields (Sudduth et al., 1996), yet the
    k-NN WPF designed in our study performed satisfactory because it acts as a smart
    search engine to selects only a few similar data points for prediction. This approach
    helps k-NN WPF to take advantage of numerous data points (cells) provided by the
    yield monitoring systems without necessarily having a good approximation of the
    non-linear relationships between inputs and yield for all cells across the field
    of study. The k-NN WPF makes use of similarities to distinguish patterns instead
    of fitting coefficients and this approach could be favorable whenever the form
    of relationships between input and output of a system is not known in advance
    (Nemes et al., 2006). One should note that, k-NN WPF introduced in this study
    only provides a pseudo-continuous prediction of yield over a range of applied
    irrigation. In other words, it gives trustable results only in the neighborhood
    of measured IWs. Hence, its application for continuous prediction of yield-water
    relationship is only suggested if IW is applied at multiple levels such that the
    available data sufficiently cover the desired prediction range. We had substantial
    spatial variation of soil properties in the study field. Long-term analysis of
    yield maps for different crops revealed that the spatial variability of soil attributes
    can seriously impact crop yields (Haghverdi, 2015). Guo et al. (2012) tried to
    mathematically explain the spatial and temporal variation of cotton yield on the
    Southern High Plains of Texas by means of ECa, soil brightness, and topography
    data. They observed that these attributes together could explain up to 70.1% of
    the variability in cotton yield. Guo et al. (2012) mentioned soil texture as one
    of the greatest factor affecting cotton yield. They found a relatively stable
    spatial pattern of yield over time although yield and soil properties had stronger
    relationship in dry years than wet seasons. The results of this study showed a
    considerable impact of the spatial and temporal pattern of rainfall pattern on
    the spatial distribution of cotton yield. We realized that rainfall pattern can
    mask/change the effect of supplemental irrigation practices on yield. Receiving
    high amounts of rainfall with random temporal patterns over growing seasons is
    expected in western TN. There were 712 mm and 633 mm of rainfall over the 2013
    and 2014 growing seasons, respectively. The total seasonally applied irrigation
    water by the farmer for the east and west pivots was 133-mm and 93 mm in 2013
    and 65 mm and 50 mm in 2014, respectively. This meant that irrigation was less
    than 20% of precipitation in 2013 and less than 10% of precipitation in 2014.
    Wong and Asseng (2006) introduced interactions of seasonal rainfall, plant available
    soil water storage capacity, and N fertilizer applications as dominant factors
    causing spatiotemporal wheat yield variation. In 2013, wet soil and colder temperatures
    forced the farmer to postpone planting cotton. Furthermore, heavy rainfall throughout
    the growing season caused excessive vegetative growth and larger number of bolls
    on soils with higher available water content. We believe that planting delay caused
    an inability in cotton to accumulate adequate heat-units and delayed its maturity
    leading to a reduction in yield, especially over soils with higher water holding
    capacity, where there was not enough time for all of the bolls to open by harvesting
    time. This trend affected the yield response to irrigation which in turn caused
    slightly higher error in corresponding WPFs. Bajwa and Vories (2007) demonstrated
    that excessive irrigation in wet weather conditions decreased cotton lint yield
    in Arkansas. That is why the quantity of optimum ET required to maximize cotton
    lint yield is directly proportional to length of cropping seasons; in longer seasons,
    higher irrigation is expected to produce the highest cotton lint yield (Orgaz
    et al., 1992). The performance of site-specific WPFs may differ under different
    conditions, hence they should be tested for different crops, climatic conditions
    and the spatial variation of soils. All attributes affecting crop available water
    need to be considered for deriving site-specific WPFs. For instance, there are
    some studies reporting the positive correlation of yield with topographic attributes
    (e.g. Andales et al., 2007, Green et al., 2007). The field of study was fairly
    flat, thus we assume that coarse resolution topography and slope have negligible
    influence on cotton lint yield. However, if topography and slope impact the spatial
    distribution of water within a field they should be considered in the development
    of site-specific WPFs. 4.2. Zoning and irrigation strategies The majority of the
    farmers in west Tennessee practice uniform irrigation despite spatial variability
    in soil properties that exists in their fields. Site-specific WPFs can help them
    to move towards optimum uniform irrigation strategies for different crops and
    climatic condition. Rainfall was abundant over the course of this experiment,
    but some dry periods did occur and supplemental irrigation was crucial to fulfilling
    ET demand, especially for coarse soils with lower AWC. Thus, there was a positive
    cotton lint yield response to irrigation predicted by the use of k-NN WPFs under
    both center pivots when compared to rainfed yields. In 2013, delayed planting
    affected heat unit accumulation/distribution and maturity which in turn suppressed
    the yield across the field, while yield reduction in soils with higher available
    water was more pronounced. This was shown in WPFs prediction as a general slight
    increase in yield as IW increased. Adding more water reduced the drought stress
    for soils with lower AWC but increased overall yield until a peak point. Analysis
    of yield data showed that even for coarse-textured soils with low WHC, cotton
    yield reduction occurred due to over irrigation. That is why, a yield reduction
    was predicted by k-NN-WPF for IWs of more than 120 mm. In 2014, the overall yield-irrigation
    relationship across the field was somewhat different than that for 2013, yet closer
    to what we expected to see in most of the years. As in 2013, there was a peak
    at a high irrigation level (IW = 110 mm) which is attributed to the optimum level
    of IW for soil with lower AWC. Unlike 2013, however, in 2014 there was also a
    second peak for lower IWs which turned out to be the best uniform cotton irrigation
    strategy according to k-NN WPF predictions. This was recognized as the point of
    optimum IW level for soils with higher AWC suggesting that in a more typical year
    like 2014 (a year without delayed planting), lower irrigation for fine-textured
    soils produced higher yields that compensated for the yield reduction over water-stressed
    coarse-textured soils in different regions of the field. More years of data are
    needed to confirm this as a long-term trend. Given the spatial variability of
    soil attributes in the field, west Tennessee farmers are likely to depart from
    uniform irrigation scenarios to some type of VRI. Sector control VRI is an easier
    and less expensive irrigation strategy for those who possess center pivot irrigation
    systems. As previously stated, zone delineation for irrigation management is complex.
    Site-specific WPFs could be beneficial to support such conversion from uniform
    to sector control VRI systems, because they are useful for delineating crop-specific
    irrigation zones and for identifying the optimum irrigation strategy for each
    sector. A field is likely to have sectors with variation in soil attributes where
    real time irrigation scheduling becomes challenging. The site-specific WPFs would
    provide insights into the right soil to follow within each section to maximize
    yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) focused on soil properties to delineate irrigation
    management zones. We added crop yields to the optimization process by using site-specific
    WPFs. While there were some similarities between zones in this study and zones
    developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b), the differences were more substantial both
    between years and methods. To a great extent, this difference reflected the inherent
    spatiotemporal variation associated with crop growth and yield which in turn governed
    the spatial configuration of optimum crop-based zones. According to Basso et al.
    (2009), bias in the evaluation of homogenous management zones may occur due to
    the impact of weather patterns on both crop growth and the interactions with soil
    types. We showed that the year-to-year temporal variation in rainfall patterns
    influences cotton yield-irrigation-soil relationships in west Tennessee. Farmer
    irrigation management techniques also influence the crop-based zoning result,
    because for each cropping season, the k-NN WPF only combines the available observations
    to make a new predication in that year. Therefore, it is important to look at
    the zoning system in this study as an iterative process which helps farmers to
    improve their irrigation decisions. The more a farmer improves their irrigation
    management, the better k-NN WPF predictions reflect a field’s yield potential.
    Consequently, longer experimentation is needed to see how our crop-based zoning
    strategy works across years and how different it would be from the soil-based
    zoning strategies introduced by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). Based on the k-NN WPF
    predictions, irrigating each cell individually at optimum levels would have caused
    a moderate increase in yield in 2014 and a slight increase in 2013 compared to
    the best uniform irrigation strategy. In reality, this provided a cap for the
    potential yield boost expected from a site-specific VRI. Even in 2014, the expected
    boost in yield may not be high enough to compensate for the infrastructure and
    management expenses needed to convert to a VRI system. Obviously, the benefits
    of sector control and zone control VRIs is both site and crop specific and depends
    on a variety of factors including the magnitude of soil spatial heterogeneity
    throughout the field, weather conditions, and the efficiency of real time irrigation
    scheduling (Daccache et al., 2015). 5. Conclusion Design-based statistics were
    dominant for much of the last century when contemporary constraints on data collection
    and processing prevented on-farm experimentation (Pringle et al., 2010). Nowadays,
    however, most of the farmers in US are collecting numerous site-specific data
    useful for on-site experimentation. However, the available data often have different
    spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, the observations may be spatially
    and temporally autocorrelated while also carrying inherent error and uncertainties.
    Therefore, in order to convert these data to useful information, robust algorithms
    and models are needed. We designed and evaluated site-specific WPFs. The results
    confirmed that site-specific WPFs may be powerful after-the-fact tools that are
    used by farmers to enhance future site-specific irrigation management. We used
    site-specific WPFs to evaluate different irrigation and zoning strategies. Currently,
    implementation and management of VRI systems demands high capital costs (Evans
    et al., 2013), hence it is crucial to assess the potential yield gain of zone
    control VRI over uniform and sector control VRI scenarios for each crop and a
    specific site. Our results showed that crop-based zoning using WPFs produces different
    zones based on the annual climatic conditions and farmer management practices.
    We believe a long-term data record is required that will capture different climatic
    and irrigation management scenarios that lead to stable zones. A practical option
    is to start with soil-based zoning for sector control VRI systems as proposed
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and then use site-specific k-NN-WPF to improve both
    zoning and within zone irrigation decisions in an iterative process. For the study
    site and over the course of the experiment, the expected yield improvement by
    a zone control VRI system was not substantially higher than that of sector control
    VRI. Note that results will probably differ under drier conditions when greater
    yields are likely to occur under a zone control VRI compared to a sector control
    VRI. Consider that there are fundamental differences in characteristics and applications
    of the traditional CWPF/WPF and proposed site-specific WPFs in this study. Classical
    PFs are mostly derived from multiyear experiments that use research plots at different
    locations. The main goal of classical PFs is to eventually apply the established
    functions for similar places and/or for the same place in the future. Contrary
    to these studies, the site-specific WPFs that we propose are not designed to be
    used in other fields or even on the same field in different years. These WPFs
    may provide insight, but are not ready for real-time VRI scheduling and addressing
    related concerns such as runoff and deep percolation issues. The site-specific
    WPFs developed here are after-the-fact tools to simulate different irrigation
    scenarios for a given-field over a specific cropping season. They are tools to
    help farmers to monitor their irrigation management and provide a unique opportunity
    that has only become possible due to recent advances and the spread of precision
    farming equipment such as yield monitors and VRI systems. Acknowledgments This

    • Deep learning to distinguish between synthetic debris and marine life • Original
    database of underwater imagery • Convolutional neural network binary classification
    Abstract With the global issue of marine debris ever expanding, it is imperative
    that the technology industry steps in. The aim is to find if deep learning can
    successfully distinguish between marine life and synthetic debris underwater.
    This study assesses whether we could safely clean up our oceans with Artificial
    Intelligence without disrupting the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems. Our
    research compares a simple convolutional neural network with a VGG-16 model using
    an original database of 1644 underwater images and a binary classification to
    sort synthetic material from aquatic life. Our results show first insights to
    safely distinguishing between debris and life. Previous article in issue Next

    pollutionMarine debris 1. Introduction 1.1. Background Marine debris has a devastating
    effect on marine life. Mammals, sea birds and larger fish are frequently found
    to have ingested litter or have become entangled within nets and other materials,
    such as plastics (D’Aurelio, 2019, McAdam, 2017, Day, 1980, Bjornadal et al.,
    1994). This results in lethal consequences as plastic fragments absorb toxic materials
    and are highly contaminated with biphenyl polychlorinated (PCB), heavy metals
    and other noxious substances. Often leached out of common plastics are organophosphate
    esters (OPEs), particularly organophosphate flame retardants (OFPRs), though the
    effects are still not fully understood, this group of additives has been associated
    with a toxic effect on animals and humans, corresponding with different carcinogenic
    properties, diabetes and reproductive issues (Sala et al., 2021). OPEs have been
    detected within marine vertebrates; such as in studies with loggerhead turtles
    (Caretta caretta) and the first evidence of OFPRs has been detected within fin
    whales (Balaenoptera physalus) as well as their main diet source, krill (Meganyctiphanes
    norvegica)(Garcia-Garin et al., 2020a). Once ingested, plastic consumption will
    likely cause other repercussions including reproductive disorders, hormone changes,
    higher disease risk or most commonly; obstructing the gastrointestinal tract;
    resulting in starvation and fatality (D’Aurelio, 2019, Mato et al., 2001, de Stephanis
    et al., 2013). Additionally, entanglement causes a serious threat to marine ecosystems
    (Stelfox et al., 2016, Tekman et al., 2022). As well as an “inestimable number
    of birds, turtles, fish and other species” (WAP, 2018, WAP, 2014). At least 136,000
    pinnipeds and whales; are killed every year by discarded fishing equipment (France-Presse,
    2011). The consequence of high whale fatalities is that they are key contributors
    to the ecosystem of phytoplankton. This is crucial, as phytoplankton “contribute
    at least 50 percent of all oxygen to our atmosphere” and capture “an estimated
    40 percent of all [Carbon Monoxide] CO produced.” Acting as the equivalent of
    1.7 trillion trees or four Amazon rain forests; our environment depends on phytoplankton
    populations (Chami et al., 2019). This global dilemma not only impacts marine
    life and the environment but human health also, as micro plastics are now being
    discovered within all water systems (McAdam, 2017, Viehman et al., 2011) and ultimately,
    human consumption (Luo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Sharma and Chatterjee,
    1987). The level of health risks are rising in correlation with fish consumption,
    as a study by Garcia-Garin et al. (2020b) concludes that by consuming contaminated,
    edible fish such as the bogue species (Boop boops), OFPRs are ingested, with their
    potential toxic effects and a recent discovery has even now detected nano plastics
    in our blood (Vethaak and J, 2021). Even though this is an accelerating issue,
    a solution has not yet come to fruition. Therefore, it is critical we begin to
    use technology to address the above challenges. Although our piece of research
    is a very small aspect of the bigger picture, it has the potential to be a vital
    part of the first application of deep learning to clean up our oceans and water
    systems. By successfully distinguishing between waste and fauna, an artificial
    intelligence framework could eventually be applied to automation, protecting our
    rapidly declining marine life and improving the negative impacts on human health.
    The application of machine learning to detect and classify litter, is still very
    minimal but far outweighs the efficiency of current methods which are hugely time
    consuming and extremely limited. They also require manual labour and are susceptible
    to human error. Being “one of the most pervasive and solvable pollution problems
    plaguing the world''s oceans and waterways” (Sheavly and Register, 2007), it is
    critical we invest more research into deep learning as a progressive solution.
    The aim is to successfully use deep learning methods to distinguish between synthetic
    debris and aquatic life by using the following objectives: • Collect a coloured
    (RGB) image database, that includes underwater debris and marine life in a variety
    of settings. • Compare the train and test results of two CNN frameworks against
    this new database, to categorise synthetic waste and marine fauna successfully.
    2. Gaps in the current literature Most studies on the application of Artificial
    Intelligence [AI] have neglected to consider the appropriate safety measures involved
    with clearing the ecosystem without causing further harm. Interestingly, popular
    categories studied in the oceans are plastic bottles, bags and food packaging,
    however, disregarded fishing nets cause a high fatality and are responsible for
    the greatest percentage of plastic in the ocean and one of the categories responsible
    for the highest fatalities (Lebreton et al., 2018, WAP, 2018). Furthermore, many
    studies including (Garcia-Garin et al., 2021) only considered floating plastics,
    which contributes to a very minimal percentage of marine litter. Although the
    problematic debris is found near the surface where creatures mistake it for food
    or something to play with, therefore ingesting it (D’Aurelio, 2019, McAdam, 2017),
    most of the ocean''s plastic is in micro form and found in the deepest parts (Peng
    et al., 2018). Moreover, only 1 % of marine litter floats (Ferries, 2021). Most
    algorithms in current research are only looking at three or four separate categories.
    These categories (usually including plastic bags, bottles and straws) represent
    only a tiny portion of the vast quantity of synthetic debris currently polluting
    our oceans (Jambeck et al., 2015) that is continuing to rapidly expand (Lebreton
    et al., 2018). Additionally, the image databases used to identify and categorise
    these specific objects do not account for varying degrees of degradation and subsequent
    distortion to captured imagery from wear, being underwater and sea conditions
    (light, density, turbulence). There are also a plethora of conditions that such
    an algorithm would have to work under, with visibility being the most important
    factor. The authors in some of the papers are in fact currently testing this problem
    in real life ocean scenarios; however, current prototypes will still need further
    development, particularly in rivers which have completely different conditions
    and are responsible for approximately 1.15–2.41 million tonnes of plastic entering
    our oceans (Lebreton et al., 2017). Recent work on the Great Garbage Patch by
    de Vries et al. (2021) has proven to successfully use AI to track parts of the
    patch by collecting photographic data with a GPS enabled GoPro from above the
    waterline. Using a convolutional neural network [CNN] to detect debris, they were
    able to survey the litter and map out the garbage patch in better detail. 3. Related
    work The paper on using deep learning to detect floating debris by Kylili et al.
    (2018) used VGG-16 pretrained on ImageNet to successfully train their own data
    set (after having applied transfer learning), to classify their research with
    a success rate of 86 %. Their paper focused on floating debris and to collect
    their data, they had to use a large amount of augmentation to create a dataset
    consisting of 12,000 images, which were classified into three different categories:
    bottles, buckets and straws at a testing accuracy of 99 %. Fulton et al. (2019)
    compared training four object detection methods (including R-CNN, YOLOv2, Tiny-YOLO
    & SSD) and concluded that Faster R-CNN had the highest accuracy, at the compromise
    of speed. YOLOv2 had an accuracy that was close to the R-CNN results, but it performed
    faster. They discovered that marine debris can be detected in real time using
    deep learning visual object detection methods - although this was from the surface
    and the authors do express their belief that it could be used underwater if the
    data limitations are overcome. de Vries et al. (2021) recently studied whether
    they could trace macro debris location and transportation. They used a two-fold
    approach, testing both the Faster RCNN and YOLOv5 architectures. The authors found
    that YOLOv5 outperformed FRCNN with the quantity of objects detected and with
    the smallest object size, however, they report this could be due to the hyper-parameter
    settings they applied. They go on to explain that YOLOv5 only needed minimal changes
    for better performance and that both network architectures could have been further
    improved with more optimization. They successfully produced, what they describe
    as “the first real-world demonstration of a large-scale automated camera transect
    survey of floating marine litter”; however due to limitations (such as that they
    are currently unable to detect anything smaller than macro debris), they believe
    their work is a strong framework for a method ology, rather than an example of
    findings. An alternative experiment aiming to track and identify floating marine
    debris compared the use of CNN with a ‘bag of features’ method (Sreelakshmi et
    al., 2019). The CNN used convolutional and bottleneck layers achieving 77.5 %
    accuracy when classifying. However, the bag of features method only achieved a
    62.5 % accuracy (using MatLab & SURF features). Comparing the two results clearly
    indicates that CNN was more accurate with an added benefit of speed - it took
    half the computational time that the Bag of Features needed. Another application
    of AI to detect marine debris was explored by Wang et al. (2019) using Long Short
    Term Memory Network (LSTM) with Cross Correlations and Association rules (Apriori)
    to identify characteristics of water pollutants. They discovered that the water
    quality correlation maps they produced were in fact able to accurately identify
    fluctuations effectively. Whilst this is useful to detect where large quantities
    of litter are within the ocean, this would work better as a technology used in
    addition to a Deep Learning algorithm, to encourage accurately pinpointing our
    largest problematic areas (Wang et al., 2019). Particularly as they have claimed
    that their AI scheme could potentially work within aquatic systems. The paper
    by Chazhoor et al. (2021) bench marked the three widely implemented architectures
    on the WaDaBa data set to find out the best model with the support of transfer
    learning. To ease the recycling process worldwide, seven different types of plastic
    have been categorised based on their chemical composition. These are Polyethylene
    Terephthalate (PET or PETE), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyvinyl Chloride
    (PVC or Vinyl), Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene
    (PS or Styrofoam). PET, HDPE PP and PS dominate the household waste and segregating
    them into their respective types will allow the reuse of certain types and recycling
    of other types of plastics. The paper is the first benchmark paper aimed towards
    classifying different types of plastics from the images using deep learning models,
    and this has stimulated the research in this area and serve as a baseline for
    future research work. To conclude, the current algorithms available are successful
    and effective; however, comparing the studies, the results clearly indicate that
    CNN was the most accurate and fastest approach. Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNN) can train themselves on debris and continue to learn using transfer learning,
    concluding in highly accurate and efficient results (Kylili et al., 2018). Within
    this research, we have collated an extensive and original database of not only
    litter but also aquatic life with an emphasis on submerged imagery that covers
    a diverse and comprehensive range of data. Incorporating different sea conditions,
    light levels and depths, as well as all varieties of synthesised materials and
    in various stages of degradation (or other distortions). This is important to
    ensure that the CNN does not just learn what is correct but also what is incorrect.
    Our paper is especially unique in its binary classification - we split all the
    data into two simple categories of what is ‘living’ and what is not - putting
    the protection of the ecosystem and of life as the priority and trained the system
    how to differentiate between the two with a current accuracy of 89 %. Therefore,
    picking up most synthesised matter and avoiding (protecting) aquatic life. It
    also covers a broader spectrum of items rather than focusing on specific categories
    at a specific depth. Therefore, training it to recognize properties of either
    debris or life, rather than single items. We have used data augmentation to diversify
    the different aspects of images as well as increasing the number of images to
    deal with class imbalance issues. 4. Materials and methods 4.1. Database collection
    A diverse range of organisations and dive centres collaborated with us by providing
    their images. We clearly outlined a list of requirements including: • In colour
    and as high quality as possible. • Dimensions for objects photographed would need
    to be larger than microplastics and smaller than roughly 16″2. • Preferably, they
    would also have some general labels We also specified including any of the following
    within their imagery: • Underwater Litter • Underwater Nets • Underwater Animals
    (this can include fish, crustaceans, cnidaria etc) • Underwater Plants • Anything
    else miscellaneous that is ecological and shot underwater The main database acquired
    was obtained from Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).
    JAMSTEC has a huge database of sub marine images and footage of deep-sea debris
    in Japan called J-EDI. Their imagery was suitable for different depths, density
    and light but also for the variety of objects within the photos, with different
    levels of degradation. The dataset we obtained included a vast array of marine
    fauna as shown in Fig. 1 including but not limited to (fish, jellyfish, shells,
    starfish, anemone) as well as an even wider selection of synthetic debris as shown
    in Fig. 2 (nets, masks, cardboard, plastic bags, plastic sheets, cloth). As we
    wanted diversity in our database, it was particularly useful to receive this wide
    selection of objects. Download : Download high-res image (138KB) Download : Download

    augmentation process On our data set, only a small amount of data augmentation
    was used by manually cropping and rotating any images that were particularly rich
    in information; mostly in instances where both categories (such as a fish and
    a plastic bottle) were in one image; that image would then be split into two separate
    images, individually cropping the items. We started with 1318 photos, after augmentation
    was applied, our training set consisted of 1644 images and 100 images for the
    testing set. 4.3. Sorting data Our first task was to ensure a high-quality collection
    (Fig. 3). Poor quality images were therefore removed to benefit the system. (This
    process was subjective. In future research, we could use benchmarks based on a
    set of predefined parameters.) Download : Download high-res image (225KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Examples of database images. Photo Credit:
    Maria Shokouros-Oskarsson. Furthermore, imagery containing subject matter deemed
    irrelevant were also manually removed, to determine clear parameters and prevent
    confusion within the algorithm. In the case of our dataset, it was mostly the
    JAMSTEC sub marine machinery parts that were in the way, which was resolved by
    manually cropping the images. The biggest issue that arose was the strange (yet
    incredible) phenomenon of how much aquatic life had chosen to inhabit pollutants.
    An ethical dilemma therefore arises, as to not disturb the sensitive and delicate
    balance of the ecosystem, by removing these items (Fulton et al., 2019). We chose
    to remove any such images to prevent confusion when training the network architectures.
    From sorting the dataset, it was often questioned whether the Convolutional Neural
    Networks would be able to safely distinguish between very commonly confused items.
    For example, a jellyfish and a plastic bag closely resemble each other. There
    were also cases of starfish that we ourselves found difficult to distinguish whether
    they were real or plastic. Therefore, there is a very real danger that a neural
    network could make the same mistake. 4.4. Training a model for a binary classification
    task In this study, classes are defined as follows: an image which has man-made
    debris in it (‘Litter’ or ‘1’), or it has natural aquatic life in it (‘Animals’
    or ‘0’), this class can include plants or any variety of marine biology. For now,
    we chose not to use subclasses, in order to test this version first and see if
    it is successful. In further tests, a training set of multiple categories would
    be valuable to improve the detail and accuracy of the system. 4.5. Network architecture
    We chose convolutional neural networks as they can handle a large quantity of
    data and have a high-performance rate in the ever-developing machine learning
    industry. CNN algorithms are the strongest neural network for image recognition.
    The system learns to strategically, on different layers, detect the lines and
    edges in the input image. It is then able to distinguish between them, identifying
    segments of an image resulting in feature extraction. A major disadvantage to
    deep learning algorithms having many parameters, and the use of max pooling, is
    the higher risk of overfitting (Guo et al., 2016). As one of our models is an
    entirely new architecture with a brand new, untrained data set, it required a
    large amount of trial and error of adjusting the different parameters to avoid
    overfitting. To closely monitor the progress of the architecture, TensorBoard
    was used, so that we could frequently compare graphs on where overfitting was
    occurring and make appropriate adjustments. All images were resized, to a width
    and height of 140px, using Python to maintain a uniform size throughout all images
    and ensure that parts would not be cropped out. Additionally, 140px when tested,
    showed enough detail to recognize the shapes and patterns within the image but
    was not too high to slow down the run time. In the case of using such a vast variety
    of underwater debris and aquatic life, it was felt that the most information necessary
    should be used, even if it compromises speed; so, three channel values RGB were
    used, instead of one. To eliminate the issue of class imbalance, the data set
    has been split to have exactly 50 % of each category. Therefore, out of the 1644
    training images, 822 were in each category. An additional precaution taken, was
    to randomly shuffle the data, as the system would otherwise learn that the data
    is in order and again, guess accordingly. This system was created on a Dell Inspiron
    i7-7700HQ CPU 2.8GHz, 16GB RAM, 64-Bit with a Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics card,
    using Windows 10. The algorithm was programmed using Python in PyCharm and the
    specs of the system used were: Tensorflow, Keras and ReLU. Using cv2, we imported
    the collected and built a data set, created 2 × 2 windows, extracted the max pooling
    value and used the Adam optimization. This resulted in the architecture having
    the following parameters: Three convolutional layers with 32 nodes and no dense
    layers, the second kernel size was reduced to a (2,2) window, the validation split
    had to be reduced to 0.1 and it ran 95 epochs. As shown in Fig. 4. We used the
    Rectified Linear activation Unit (ReLU) as the activation function and the last
    layer used the logistic sigmoid function to enable binary classification. The
    validation split is usually optimised at 20 % (0.2) of the set, however, this
    architecture would favour one of the classifications, if at this setting. Download

    diagram of simple CNN classifier. When the final architecture was confirmed, we
    ran it 10 times to take an average of the Training Loss and Training Accuracy
    shown in Table 1, intermittently between rerunning the architecture, we continued
    to run Tests against Training Images and Test Images, periodically testing for
    correct classification. To train the VGG-16 model, we imported the VGG model using
    Keras and then applied transfer learning from the ImageNet weights. We used softmax
    activation and only 2 dense layers to keep our model close to the framework that
    (Kylili et al., 2018) had promising results with. To train the model on our data
    set, we then ran 50 epochs on a model checkpoint function, so that the highest
    accuracy model would be saved. Table 1. Training result comparisons. CNN VGG-16

    and evaluation The original aim of this research was to test if we could successfully
    train a CNN framework to distinguish between underwater debris and aquatic life,
    safely and to an accuracy of at least 85 %, as we collected a new database. The
    test results have shown that from a set of 100 tested images, 89 % were 13 correctly
    classified. When we ran evaluation metrics on this test (Fig. 5), we calculated
    a set of strong results such as 0.9 F1 score for ‘Animal’ detection and 0.88 F1
    score for ‘Litter’, as shown in Table 2. When running a 95 % confidence interval
    on our results, we found that the classification error of the model is 86 % ±
    0.061. Given these results, the true classification error of the model is between
    80 % and 92 %. Download : Download high-res image (34KB) Download : Download full-size

    0.89 0.89 100 The obtained result shows promising signs of being able to adapt
    to a much larger scale database, with more detail and a stronger CNN architecture.
    Furthermore, we compared our simple CNN model with the VGG-16 architecture by
    training our dataset onto the framework and using transfer learning and the final
    output layer of softmax (as suggested by Kylili et al., 2018) (Fig. 6). Our train
    had a loss of 0.0093 and accuracy of 1.0000, with test results achieving a 95
    % accuracy in predictions. Also shown in Table 3 the VGG-16 model achieved an
    F1 score of 0.95 for both categories, additionally the classification error is
    95 % ± 0.043. Therefore, the true classification of the model is between 91 %
    and 99 %. This shows promising signs that CNN models can be used to successfully
    classify all types of debris without disturbing marine life, particularly when
    using transfer learning on VGG-16. Overall, we conclude that transfer learning
    with a VGG-16 framework is more accurate and though these are our initial findings;
    with a larger data set and finer tuned parameters, we could have very positive
    results. Download : Download high-res image (34KB) Download : Download full-size

    underwater images of debris proved particularly difficult, and the images that
    were donated to us were not already labelled, so we had to complete this manually,
    which was time consuming. We also found similar challenges with de Vries et al.
    (2021), that many images were not of a high enough quality, consequently reducing
    our database to a size that was not suitable for CNN training. However, after
    the use of data augmentation, we were successfully able to create a new database
    that had a high accuracy level. From here we believe this research is therefore,
    a strong preliminary methodology for future research in this field with a larger
    database and a more powerful solution that can allow further depth and contain
    more classification groups. As mentioned previously, other papers have strived
    to identify marine debris using neural networks and have encountered relevant
    challenges. Similarly to our paper, Fulton et al. (2019)''s study produced their
    own dataset, which heavily drew from JAMSTEC''s imagery and far outweighed our
    own as it consisted of 5720 images. They had a trinary classification of plastics,
    man-made debris and other bio matter, their separation of classifications is close
    to our binary system and can be quite fairly compared. Much like ours, their dataset
    was designed to challenge the deep learning algorithm to maintain an accurate
    representation of a real-life scenario. We followed in similar footsteps by trying
    to vary our data as greatly as we could. Though this reduces the performance as
    Fulton et al. (2019) mentioned; it is “a better evaluation of what the detector''s
    performance would be in the field”, to which the authors of this study concur
    with. Their study produced promising results by comparing four different models;
    though they looked into object detection, whereas our paper compares image recognition
    models. With object detection; (including transfer learning on YOLOv2); their
    strongest results were using Faster-RCNN which detected plastics at an average
    precision rate of 83.3 %. de Vries et al. (2021) were able to capture their own
    dataset of over 18,000 images of floating debris and chose to compare object detection
    results of YOLOv2 with Faster-RCNN; yet they concluded that YOLOv2 obtained stronger
    results. However, their study only focused on surface level debris, so their database
    would have been far less complex for the neural network to predict. Other studies
    looked into using image recognition on surface level marine debris such as Kylili
    et al. (2018), who also produced their own dataset (12,000 images) and used VGG-16
    transfer learning which concluded in strong test results of 99 % and a validation
    accuracy of 86 %. It is interesting to note that their paper focuses on three
    specific categories of litter, whereas our study consists of much broader and
    less focused classifications; including data affected by degradation, wear and
    visibility, therefore as expected, our study should be producing less accurate
    results. When comparing with relevant neural network studies, the authors of this
    paper strongly believe that, when introduced to a larger dataset, the use of image
    recognition methods such as VGG-16, underwater to detect marine debris will perform
    very positively. This research is unique in its type; that it is one of the first
    papers that not only is looking for a feasible solution for our polluted water
    crisis but also has an emphasis on the perspective of animal welfare and ecological
    conservation. Additionally, our paper has reported some insight into progressive
    steps that using CNNs could successfully distinguish between any debris and any
    marine fauna. The paper has therefore, collated a large quantity of thoroughly
    thought-out scenarios and information that future papers will hopefully prioritise
    their studies and development with. 6. Conclusions and recommendations This research
    sets out to answer the question: can deep learning successfully distinguish between
    marine life and man-made debris underwater? From the research we conducted, the
    authors believe that with a larger data set, the possibility of using image recognition
    to safely remove debris underwater without disrupting aquatic ecosystems is strong.
    Fulton et al. (2019) quite rightly expressed concern about using image recognition
    underwater with the vast variety of debris available, however we have proven that
    subclasses are possible to use as a base to start with, and with future development
    on this research, we believe this could develop into a working large-scale prototype.
    While this research scratches the surface of potentially using artificial intelligence
    to distinguish successfully and safely between life and man-made debris; there
    are plenty of other factors that should be considered and researched moving forward.
    Our paper has been unique by comparing the effects of trained CNNs on a wide variety
    of categories, as opposed to three or four groups of objects. In particular, we
    have taken our study below the surface to detect debris and marine fauna underwater,
    as well as training the models to distinguish between the two. Although part of
    the novelty of this research was the diversity of data in its nature of depth,
    geographic location, and sea conditions, it did not cover a wide enough variety
    and would need to comprise of a database that includes these variables or considers
    fresh waterways and the aquatic life that lives there. Additionally, these algorithms
    were only trained on matter that exceeded the size of micro plastics (micro plastics
    are <5 mm). Therefore, it remains untested on any debris or living creatures under
    that size. Future research should be tested for image segmentation (or retest
    object detection) to ensure that biological entities (such as plants or animals)
    attached onto debris, are not categorised as litter. Other variables would be
    to diversify the nature of species of all underwater creatures, such as how would
    this algorithm specifically respond to stingrays embedded within the sand or coral
    with plastic wrapped on it. Additionally, an entire classification could be dedicated
    to entangled sea creatures and plants, which if applied to automation could be
    used to alert users to the finding of an endangered life. Further considerations
    include asking if it would be able to handle more complex situations? Such as
    accurately pinpointing floating plastic in a sea of jellyfish. Although de Vries
    et al. (2021) at Ocean Cleanup are doing a fantastic job of mapping patches of
    debris within the gyre, could we test our method on retrieving large quantities
    of underwater debris without picking up small life within something as vast and
    compact as the Great Garbage Reef? It would also be valuable for the algorithms
    to be combined with unsupervised learning using positive and negative reinforcement,
    so that they constantly train themselves and continue to improve their accuracy.

    Metrics Abstract: Due to the growing demand for spectral resources with the emergence
    of IoT networks and applications, cooperative cognitive radio IoT networks (CCR-IoTN)
    are expected to play an essential role in the world of smart technology. In this
    paradigm, the benefits of cooperative communication and cognitive radio networks
    (CRN) are merged to meet IoT networks'' needs. In this work, we employ the hybrid
    overlay-underlay CRN to guarantee both the secondary user (SU) stability and provide
    acceptable total throughput. In our CCR-IoTN, SUs may act as a relay to help the
    primary transmission. If the primary user (PU) is active, the secondary non-relay
    nodes transmit concurrently with the PU in underlay mode. In return for their
    cooperation, SUs are allowed to access the spectrum to transmit their data in
    overlay mode. In this context, we propose several fair resource allocation frameworks
    and compare well-known problems such as spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency
    as an objective function for CCR-IoTN. This kind of problem is inherently nonconvex.
    To solve the problems, therefore, we reformulate them as a convex problem using
    quadratic transform. Finally, we use simulation to evaluate the performance of
    the proposed hybrid resource allocation method. The resource allocation framework
    based on proportional fairness policy is shown to have acceptable performance
    in terms of throughput, fairness, and energy efficiency. In our cooperative cognitive
    radio IoT networks, SUs act as relay to help the primary transmission. When PU
    sends their data, the secondary non-relay nodes transmit concu...View more Published

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction It is predicted that by 2030, there will be near
    50 billion smart devices connected to IoT. These smart devices play a crucial
    role in our everyday life, including health care, home automation, and thus are
    expected to have a lifetime between a few days to several years depending on the
    type of device and its application [1]. The proliferation of smartphones and tablets
    has also caused a significant and sustained increase in mobile data traffic. 5G
    systems are to be employed to meet these challenging requirements of such a large
    number of wirelessly connected devices [2]. Due to IoT applications’ emerging
    applications and services, demand for the spectral resources has grown significantly.
    New concepts such as cognitive radio have been proposed to utilize the scarce
    spectral resources more efficiently to satisfy this growing demand. In cognitive
    radio techniques, SUs access the licensed bands of PUs. There are usually two
    types of dynamic spectrum access scenarios in the literature [3]. In the first
    type, called common model [3], the primary user is not aware of the secondary
    users’ presence. In this model, SUs perform spectrum sensing to opportunistically
    access the spectrum [4]–[8]. In the second type, called property right models
    [3], PU is aware of the presence of SUs, and is willing to lease its radio spectrum
    for a fraction of time in return to monetary [9] or functional benefits [3], [10],
    [11] or both [12]. There are three paradigms for SU to access the licensed spectrum
    of PU: interweave, underlay and overlay. In the interweave paradigm, SU performs
    spectrum sensing to find the spectrum holes. If SU finds that PU is not active,
    it can access the spectrum. In the underlay paradigm, SU can concurrently transmit
    with PU provided that the interference made by SU is below a prespecified threshold
    so that it does not lead to performance degradation for PU’s transmission. In
    the third paradigm known as overlay, SU cooperates with PU and in exchange, PU
    allows SU to utilize the channel [13], [14]. In the literature, hybrid access
    schemes are also suggested to achieve a higher spectrum efficiency level [15]–[17].
    In [18], an energy-efficient overlay and underlay scheme is presented for heterogeneous
    cellular networks. In [15], a hybrid overlay-underlay spectrum access scheme is
    proposed in a cognitive radio network with mobile energy harvesting secondary
    transmitters. CRNs are also categorized based on the type of cooperation between
    PUs and SUs. In one type, SUs cooperate by acting as a relay for PU. We consider
    this type of cooperation in this paper. Another type of cooperation is also reported
    in the literature where the cooperation happens between the SUs themselves to
    improve spectrum sensing and data rates [19]. CRNs are one of the most promising
    technologies to respond to the growing demand for spectrum in IoT devices. Therefore
    there has been a great interest in CR-based IoT in recent years [20]–[22]. In
    such networks, unprecedented levels of spectrum and energy efficiency is needed
    to enable many practical applications of IoT networks, because both the lifetime
    of the IoT device as well as the spectrum efficiency are essential to support
    the big data generated by a vast number of IoT devices [23], [24]. Throughput
    fairness among secondary IoT devices is also crucial since, unlike the wireless
    sensor networks, the IoT devices are supposed to send a great deal of non-redundant
    data. Many research efforts are conducted to address the cognitive radio-based
    IoT, and different optimization criteria are considered in the literature. Optimizing
    energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency has been the key design objective for
    many wireless communication networks. A great deal of works has been devoted to
    improving energy-efficiency. An energy-efficient resource allocation framework
    is presented in [17], which investigates the joint design of cooperative spectrum
    sensing time and the power control optimization problem for the secondary user
    systems. A tradeoff between energy and spectrum efficiency is presented in [25].
    In [26], a power control scheme is presented for cognitive M2M communications
    underlaying cellular with consideration of fairness concerns while satisfying
    an interference temperature constraint at the BS side. Proportional fairness and
    max-min fairness schemes are implemented and compared in terms of total utility,
    average SINR, and fairness index. A trading-based spectrum optimization strategy
    is introduced in [27], in which IoT users try to optimize their access to the
    spectrum by ensuring that then spectrum price will not exceed the access benefits.
    A multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented in [28] for spectrum allocation
    cognitive radio-based IoT, aiming to maximize both end-to-end throughput and spectrum
    utilization. The problem is NP-hard and genetic algorithm is used to solve this
    problem. In [29], QoE-oriented rate control and resource allocation scheme are
    proposed for cognitive M2M communication. Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to formulate
    the problem. The simulation results indicate improved perceived quality. This
    paper proposes a new model for a CCR-IoTN that utilizes a hybrid overlay-underlay
    spectrum access to guarantee spectrum efficiency for the growing number of connected
    devices. To achieve throughput fairness among SUs, we present several resource
    allocation frameworks in the form of fractional programming (FP) optimization
    problems. We then use the quadratic transform technique presented in [30], [31]
    to convert our nonconvex FP optimization problems into a sequence of convex problems,
    which are solved iteratively to obtain the optimal resource allocation. Using
    simulation, we compare our results with some traditional approaches such as maximum
    sum rate, energy efficiency, and underlay mode only. The main contributions of
    this paper are summarized as follows: We have adopted two fairness based resource
    allocation frameworks in a CCR-IoTN, i.e., max-min fairness and proportional fairness
    while satisfying the constraint of having equal or higher rate in cooperative
    mode. By max-min fairness, we can guarantee that the available resources are allocated
    to the disadvantaged users to the maximum extent. However, proportional fairness
    is realized by maximizing the overall utilization of all users. In almost all
    papers, the power is allocated to SUs by setting the maximum interference level.
    In such cases, the PU is still affected by slight interference. However, in our
    work, power is allocated optimally through the optimization problem. In our optimization
    framework, the relay nodes are dynamically selected in terms of numbers and participants
    in each frame. We have reformulated the inherently nonconvex optimization problems
    as convex problems by separating the integer programming part and have applied
    a new method presented in [30], [31] to solve the multiple-ratio fractional problems
    quickly (with less computational complexity) and reliably (reach close to the
    optimal value). In our resource allocation frameworks, it is assumed that all
    secondary nodes can access the spectrum in the reward subframe to send their data
    exclusively. We have shown the impact of different resource allocation frameworks
    on the performance of a CCR-IoT network through extensive simulations that can
    help design such systems. The organization of this paper is as follows: The system
    model is represented in section II. Section III describes the problem formulation.
    The resource allocation frameworks are presented in section IV. Section V is devoted
    to simulation results. Section VI concludes this paper. SECTION II. System Model
    We consider a CCR-IoTN composed of a primary source (PS), a primary destination
    (PD), one access point (AP) for SUs, and a set of SUs represented by N . As shown
    in Fig. 1, we consider a primary network in which PS sends data to PD and a secondary
    network in which SUs send data to AP. To send data from PD to PS, the same method
    can be used. For ease of IoT devices, they have only one antenna. In this paper,
    we consider AP and PU also have only one antenna. However, multi-antenna increases
    system performance [32] that can be consider in future works. In our proposed
    system model, we assume PS can directly send data to PD, but it can cooperate
    with SUs. This cooperation can be coordinated between PU and AP as the head of
    SUs. To coordinate, AP schedules all transmissions of SUs and selects the set
    of relays for each time frame T . The SUs which are not selected as relays can
    access the spectrum in the underlay mode. In exchange for this cooperation, each
    SU gets a chance to access the spectrum in the overlay mode to send its data.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Consider a transmission time frame of length
    T . Each transmission frame is divided into three subframes, as shown in Fig.
    2. In the first subframe, PS broadcasts its data to the SUs selected as relays.
    In the second subframe, the relays forward the message to PD using decode-and-forward
    (DF) protocol. In our proposed model, SUs not selected as relays can access the
    primary spectrum in both the first and second subframes in the underlay mode.
    The first and second subframes are divided between non-relay SUs (with not necessarily
    equal slot length) so that SUs do not interfere with each other. In the third
    subframe, SUs can access the primary spectrum in the overlay mode to reward their
    service. In the rewarded subframe, the SUs transmit to the AP using time-division
    multiple access (TDMA). To this end, the third subframe is divided into N time
    slots of not necessarily equal length, each dedicated to a SU to access the spectrum
    exclusively with no interference. Because of channel condition, if no relay can
    improve the primary transmission rate, SUs send their data in the underlay mode
    only. In this mode, we determine the transmission power of SUs such that their
    interference to PU transmission is neglectable compared to noise. FIGURE 2. Time
    frame structure. Show All The channel gains are assumed to have quasi-static Rayleigh
    fading, where they remain unchanged in one transmission frame T and may change
    in the next. A path loss model of d −α with path loss exponent 2<α<6 is considered
    to account for the signal power attenuation with d , which is the distance between
    the transmitter and the receiver. We also assume perfect knowledge of channel
    state information (CSI). In time division multiplexing systems such as our system,
    this information can be obtained from the uplink (SUs to AP and PU) direction
    based on the reciprocity of the wireless channel, provided that the channel fading
    is sufficiently slow, since the same carrier frequency is used for transmission
    and reception [33]. It can start by transmitting SUs preamble, in an initial phase,
    to obtain all SUs’ initial channel state information. In the subsequent transmission
    frames, the instantaneous channel estimations are updated based on SUs transmissions
    [34]. Then PU and AP to schedule transmitting time according to the optimization
    problem. SECTION III. Problem Formulation As mentioned earlier, PS utilizes SUs
    as relays to improve QoS and increase its data rates. In return, it dedicates
    its spectrum in the third subframe to SUs for exclusive transmission as a reward.
    We use S i , i=1,2,3 , to denote the set of SUs that transmit their data in the
    i th subframe, and S r to denote the set of relays. Accordingly, the secondary
    network transmission rate is: R iA = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪
    ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ log 2 (1+ | h iA | 2 P i N 0 +| h sA | 2 P s ), log 2 ⎛ ⎝
    ⎜ ⎜ 1+ | h iA | 2 P i N 0 + ∑ r∈ S r | h rA | 2 P i r ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ , log 2 (1+ | h
    iA | 2 P max r N 0 ), i∈ S 1 , i∈ S 2 , i∈ S 3 , (1) View Source where P i is
    the power of non-relay SU and N 0 is the white Gaussian noise power. P i r denotes
    the power of relay nodes once they relay primary data to the PD while the secondary
    non-relay node i is transmitting in the second subframe in the underlay mode and
    P max r is the maximum power of SUs that is used to transmit their own data to
    the AP in the third subframe. | h iA | 2 , | h sA | 2 , | h rA | 2 are the channel
    gains between the secondary non-relay node and AP, the PS and AP, and relay node
    and AP, respectively. Since the third subframe is totally devoted to the SUs and
    they transmit in TDMA manner, there is no interference in this subframe. The allocated
    timeslots to the secondary nodes in each subframe might be equal or different.
    The channel between PS and a relay r is denoted by h sr , and the channel between
    relay r and the PD is denoted by h rd . In the first subframe, PS broadcasts the
    message to the relay nodes. The transmission rate of PU in each timeslot i of
    the first subframe is: R SR (i)= log 2 (1+ min r∈ S r { | h sr | 2 P s N 0 +|
    h ir | 2 P i }),i∈ S 1 , (2) View Source where h ir is the interference channel
    between the secondary node i and relay node r . As shown in Eq. (2), the primary
    network transmission rate in each timeslot of the first subframe is determined
    by the worst channel in each timeslot. In the second subframe, where the relay
    nodes transmit the primary data to PD, a secondary non-relay node transmission
    interferes with the primary transmission in each timeslot. In this subframe, due
    to simultaneous transmission of all relay nodes, the transmission rate is determined
    by their resultant signal to noise ratio at the PD in each timeslot j : R RD (j)=
    log 2 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ 1+ ∑ r∈ S r | h rd | 2 P j r N 0 +| h jd | 2 P j ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ,j∈ S 2
    . (3) View Source Since the decode and forward relaying is deployed at relay nodes,
    the cooperative rate is as follows: R coop =min{ ∑ i∈ S 1 τ i T R SR (i) , ∑ j∈
    S 2 τ j T R RD (j)}, (4) View Source where τ k s are the timeslots within the
    first and second subframes allocated to the k th SU to send their data to AP in
    the underlay mode. SUs transmit their data in all three subframes, so the total
    transmission rate in these three subframes can be considered as the benefit of
    the secondary network. The utility function of the secondary network is denoted
    by U s and is defined in the next section based on different priorities of CCR-IoTN.
    Generally, the resource allocation optimization problem has the following form.
    Without loss of generality, the length of the transmission frame is set to one,
    i.e., T=1 . max { P i },{ P j },{ P j r },{ τ i },{ τ j },{ τ k }, S 1 , S 2 ,
    S 3 , S r U s   Subjectto C 1 : 0≤ P i , P j , P j r ≤ P max r , i∈ S 1 ,j∈ S
    2 ,r∈ S r , C 2 :  τ i , τ j , τ k ≥0,i∈ S 1 ,j∈ S 2 ,k∈ S 3 , C 3 :  ∑ i∈ S 1
    τ i + ∑ j∈ S 2 τ j + ∑ k∈ S 3 τ k =1, C 4 :  R coop ≥γ R SD , C 5 :  S i ⊆N,i∈{1,2,3,r},
    C 6 :  S i ∩ S r =∅,i∈{1,2}. (5) View Source The transmission power range of SUs
    in the first and second subframes must satisfy C 1 . The sum of all allocated
    timeslots to SUs transmitting to AP must be equal to the length of the transmission
    block, C 3 . Here, τ k s are the timeslots within the third subframe allocated
    to the SUs to send their data to the AP in the overlay mode. Finally, the transmission
    rate of the primary network in cooperative mode should always be greater than
    or equal to the rate of the direct non-cooperative network, denoted bt R SD .
    This statement is expressed using C 4 , in which R SD is defined as follows: R
    SD = log 2 (1+ | h sd | 2 P s N 0 ). (6) View Source The factor γ≥1 introduced
    in C 4 represents the case, where PU requests a multiple of its non-cooperative
    rate from SUs in order to permit them to access the spectrum. This constraint
    could later be extended to two separate constraints as follows for the ease of
    use: C 4−1 : ∑ i∈ S 1 τ i R SR (i)≥ C 4−2 : ∑ j∈ S 2 τ j R RD (j)≥ γ R SD , γ
    R SD . (7) (8) View Source As denoted in C 5 , the sets S 1 , S 2 , S 3 and S
    r are all a subset of the set of SUs, N . Note that, the set of SUs transmitting
    in the underlay mode in either T 1 or T 2 and the set of relay nodes are disjoint.
    In other words, we have: S 1 ⊆N− S r , S 2 ⊆N− S r and S 3 ⊆N . A. Equivalent
    Problem The optimization problem (5) is not convex because of 1) the fractional
    nature of rates of PU and SUs, which are revealed in both the objective function
    and constraints (e.g., in C4); 2) the appearance of product terms of optimization
    variables (e.g., in C4); and 3) the selection of the relay set, which is an integer
    programming problem. In order to tackle our multiple-ratio FP problem, we use
    the quadratic transform technique presented in [30], which converts the original
    nonconvex fractional problem into a sequence of convex non-fractional problems,
    utilizing proper auxiliary variables. This technique outperforms the classic techniques,
    the best of which is Dinkelbach’s transform [35], because it easily handles multiple-ratio
    FP. For both techniques, the original FP and the transformed problems have the
    same optimal point. However, unlike Dinkelbach’s transform, the original FP and
    the quadratic-transformed problem have the same value. In terms of convergence
    rate, the quadratic transform technique is slower than Dinkelbach’s transform.
    The quadratic transform technique is applied to general multiple-ratio problem
    [30]. With quadratic transform, the reformulated optimization problem will be
    convex in term of x , as explained in the following. Assume a fractional statement
    A m (x) B m (x) in the objective function or in the constraints, where A m (x)
    is concave, and B m (x) is convex and the feasible set is convex. Further, for
    the case of functions-of-ratio, assume that the functions f m (⋅) are nondecreasing
    concave functions. Each A m (x) B m (x) is replaced with 2 y m A m (x) − − − −
    − √ − y 2 m B m (x), (9) View Source where y m is a new real auxiliary optimization
    parameter, which is jointly optimized with x iteratively. In each step of the
    new optimization problem, y m is updated as: y m = A m (x) − − − − − √ B m (x)
    ,∀m, (10) View Source while x is updated arbitrarily. Since product terms of optimization
    variables still exist in both objective function and constraints, the power optimization
    variables are changed to energy optimization variables as follows: E i = E j r
    = E j = τ i . P i ,i∈ S 1 , τ j . P j r ,r∈ S r ,j∈ S 2 , τ j . P j ,j∈ S 2 ,
    (11) View Source so each term can be shown as the perspective of a convex function,
    which is convex itself [36]. B. Set Selection In this section, we select the set
    S r by separating the integer programming part of the optimization problem. This
    naturally imposes suboptimality. We consider two different modes for selecting
    the relay set: fixed-size and optimal size. In the fixed-size mode, a fixed number
    of relays is selected, while in the optimal-size mode, any number of relay nodes
    can be selected. In both modes, the relay set is selected to maximize the cooperative
    rate of PU, without considering the interference caused by SUs transmitting in
    the underlay mode. If this cooperative rate is more than the direct non-cooperative
    rate of PU, SUs can be scheduled to transmit in this frame in both the underlay
    and the overlay mode. It means PU can transmit its data in less than a frame time
    and in the residual time of the frame, i.e., the third frame, SUs can transmit
    exclusively. In addition, SUs can transmit in the underlay mode. In both relay
    selection modes, the set S r can be obtained by solving the following optimization
    problem. max S r , T 1 , T 2   min{ T 1 R SR ,  T 2 R RD } subject tomin{ T 1
    R SR ,  T 2 R RD }≥γ R SD , T 1 + T 2 =1. (12) View Source To solve (12) First,
    T 1  R SR must be equal to T 2  R RD . T 1  R SR and T 2  R RD represent the transferring
    data size in each frame T, from PS to the relays and from the relays to PD, respectively.
    Both must be equal to the transferring data size of PU in the frame. If one of
    them is greater than the other one, we have two asymmetric links that are useless.
    If one of them is greater than the other one, we have two asymmetric links that
    is useless. So, T 1 R SR = T 2 R RD =(1− T 1 ) R RD . Hence, T 1 = R RD /( R RD
    + R SR ) and T 2 = R SR /( R RD + R SR ) and the cooperation rate, min{ T 1  R
    SR , T 2  R RD } , will be ( R RD R SR )/( R RD + R SR ) . By defining G(Sr) as
    reverse of cooperation rate, we have G( S r )=1/ R RD +1/ R SR and relay selection
    problem (12) changes to: min S r G( S r ), subject toG( S r )≤ 1 γ R SD , (13)
    View Source where G( S r )= 1 log 2 (1+ min r∈ S r | h sr | 2 P s N 0 ) + 1 log
    2 (1+ ∑ r∈ S r | h rd | 2 P max r N 0 ) . (14) View Source Here, R SR and R RD
    are calculated without considering the interference of underlaying mode. Problem
    (13) can be solved by searching with linear time complexity as follows. Assume
    SU i with channel gain h si is in the optimal relay set, then every other SU j
    with channel gain h sj = h si must be in the optimal relay set, too. It is because,
    in (14) with the optimal variables, the SU with the smallest channel gain (let’s
    call it SU*) determines the first term of the summation. Therefore, the second
    term of the summation in (14) is minimized if we select more and more SUs. So,
    all the SUs whose channel gain h si is not smaller than that of SU* are in the
    optimal relay set. Notice that this selection does not affect the first term of
    summation, but minimizes the second term. To summarize, let h 1 <= h 2 <= h 3
    <=…<= h n be the channel gains between PS and SUs. Define H i as the set of all
    SUs whose channel gain (between PS and the SU) is at least equal to h i . Then
    the optimal relay set is one of the sets H 1 , H 2 , H 3 ,…, H n . Using the same
    method, we can find an optimal relay set for the number of relays set to K. Then
    we fix this relay set in the resource optimization problems, which is now convex,
    to determine the energy and timeslot duration of non-relay SUs in the first and
    second subframe as well as the energy and timeslot duration of all SUs in the
    third subframe. In each subframe, the secondary nodes for which both τ and E are
    greater than zero are considered as a member of the corresponding set, thus obtaining
    the sets S 1 , S 2 and S 3 . Otherwise, if S r is empty, no relay set can be used
    and the mere underlay access mode would be employed. SECTION IV. Resource Allocation
    Frameworks for CCR-IoTN In this section, we formulate different optimization problems
    in response to different priorities of a CCR-IoTN, such as throughput, energy
    efficiency, and fairness. We compare the performance of these frameworks in section
    V. A. Proportional Fairness A fair allocation of transmission rates among IoT
    devices is needed when each IoT device has unique data that must be delivered.
    One possible fair allocation policy is proportional fairness (PF), which maximizes
    the sum of logarithmic rates of all IoT users as the objective function in (5),
    that is, it sets U s = ∑ i∈N ln( R i ), (15) View Source where R i = τ i,1 R iA,1
    + τ i,2 R iA,2 + τ i,3 R iA,3 , (16) View Source Show All and τ i,1 , τ i,2 ,
    τ i,3 denote the time slot allocated to the secondary user i in T 1 , T 2 and
    T 3 , respectively. Similarly, R iA,1 , R iA,2 , R iA,3 denote the rate of secondary
    user i during the time slot allocated to them in T 1 , T 2 , T 3 to communicate
    with the AP. R iA,m has the following relationship with R iA in (1): R iA,m ={
    R iA , 0, i∈ S m , i∉ S m . (19) View Source As stated earlier, this problem is
    nonconvex. Therefore, as explained in Section III, we first tackle the fractional
    terms using the quadratic transform (9). Then, we change the power variables to
    energy variables (11) and find the optimal relay set S r by solving (13). Finally,
    we can reformulate problem (5) as an energy and time allocation problem as in
    problem (17), as shown at the bottom of the page. R i , in the objective function
    of (17), as shown at the bottom of the page, is reformulated in (18). To solve
    (17), x i ,y_{i} and z_{i} are updated in each step as follows:\begin{align*}
    x_{i}=&\frac {\sqrt {\tau _{i,2}|h_{iA}|^{2} E_{i,2}}}{{\tau _{i,2} N_{0} + \sum
    \limits _{r \in S_{r}}{|h_{rA}|^{2} E_{r}^{i}}}}, \tag{20}\\ y_{i}=&\frac {\sqrt
    {\sum \limits _{r \in S_{r}} {\tau _{i,2} |h_{rd}|^{2} E_{r}^{i}}}}{\tau _{i,2}
    N_{0} + {|h_{id}|^{2} E_{i,2}}}, \tag{21}\\ z_{i}=&\frac {\tau _{i,1} \sqrt {|h_{sr}|^{2}
    P_{s}}}{\tau _{i,1} N_{0} + {|h_{ir}|^{2} E_{i,1}}}. \tag{22}\end{align*} View
    Source Then, we assume x_{i} ,y_{i} , and z_{i} are constant in (17) and update
    energy and time variables in a convex optimization problem in an arbitrary manner.
    B. MaxMin Fairness Another fairness policy is the Max-Min(MM) fairness policy
    [37], which maximizes the minimum rate of SUs by setting U_{s} in the optimization
    problem (5) to:\begin{equation*} U_{s} = \underset{i \in \mathcal {N}}{\min} \quad
    (\mathcal {R}_{i}),\tag{23}\end{equation*} View Source where \mathcal {R}_{i}
    is defined in (16). This problem is equivalent to the following optimization problem:\begin{align*}&\underset
    {\substack {\{E_{i,1}\},\{E_{i,2}\}, \{E_{r}^{i}\},\\ \{\tau _{i,1}\}, \{\tau
    _{i,2}\}, \{\tau _{i,3}\},\\ \{x_{i}\},\{y_{i}\},\{z_{i}\}, q}}{\text {max}} \quad
    q \\&\qquad \text {subject to} \quad \mathcal {R}_{i} \geq q,\quad i\in \mathcal
    {N}, \\&\hphantom {\qquad \text {subject to} \quad }~(17{\mathrm {b}}), (17{\mathrm
    {c}}), (17{\mathrm {d}}), (17{\mathrm {e}}), \\&\hphantom {\qquad \text {subject
    to} \quad }~(17{\mathrm {f}}), (17{\mathrm {g}}), (17{\mathrm {h}}),\tag{24}\end{align*}
    View Source where \mathcal {R}_{i} is reformulated as (18) and x_{i} , y_{i} ,
    and z_{i} are updated based on Eqs. (20)–(22). Note that this resource allocation
    problem tries to achieve a nearly equal data rate for all SUs. C. Spectrum Efficiency
    A common objective in a CCR-IoTN is to maximize throughput or spectral efficiency
    (SE) of SUs. That is to maximize:\begin{equation*} U_{s} = \sum _{i \in S_{1}}
    \tau _{i} R_{iA} + \sum _{j \in S_{2}} \tau _{j} R_{jA} + \sum _{k \in S_{3}}\tau
    _{k} R_{kA}.\tag{25}\end{equation*} View Source Show All Here, we can write the
    KKT optimality conditions [36] for original problem (5) with utility function
    (25) with respect to \tau _{k} as follows:\begin{align*} -\log _{2}\left({1+\frac
    {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right)+\mu - \lambda _{\tau _{k}}=&0, \\ \lambda
    _{\tau _{k}}\tau _{k}=&0, \\ \lambda _{\tau _{k}}\geq&0,\tag{27}\end{align*} View
    Source where \lambda _{\tau _{k}} and \mu are the lagrangian variables associated
    with constraints C_{2} and C_{3} , respectively. Accordingly, if \tau _{k} > 0
    , we have \lambda _{\tau _{k}}=0 , and \mu =\log _{2}\left({1+\frac {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right)
    and if \tau _{k} = 0 , we have \lambda _{\tau _{k}} \geq 0 and \mu =\log _{2}\left({1+\frac
    {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right)+\lambda _{\tau _{k}} . Therefore, \tau
    _{k^{*}} > 0 for k^{*}=\mathop{\mathrm {argmax}}\limits_{k} \log _{2}\left({1+\frac
    {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right) and \tau _{k} = 0 for k \neq k^{*} .
    This shows that, to maximize the spectral efficiency function (25), the rewarding
    period T_{3} must be solely dedicated to one SU with the highest rate of data
    transmission to AP. Clearly, this is not a fair allocation policy. D. Energy Efficiency
    Energy efficiency (EE) is another considerable objective for resource allocation
    in CCR-IoTNs. To achieve energy efficiency, the utility function U_{s} is:\begin{equation*}
    U_{s} = \frac {\sum _{i \in S_{1}} \tau _{i} R_{iA} + \sum _{j \in S_{2}} \tau
    _{j} R_{jA} + \sum _{k \in S_{3}}\tau _{k} R_{kA}}{E_{T}},\tag{28}\end{equation*}
    View Source where \begin{equation*} E_{T} = \sum _{i \in S_{1}} E_{i}+\sum _{j
    \in S_{2}} E_{j}+P_{r}^{max} \sum _{k \in S_{3}} \tau _{k}+\sum _{j \in S_{2}}
    \sum _{r \in S_{r}} E_{r}^{j}.\tag{29}\end{equation*} View Source Similar to previous
    sections, we can reformulate the optimization problem to get the following equivalent
    problem:\begin{align*}&\underset {\substack {\{E_{i}\}, \{E_{j}\}, \{E_{r}^{j}\},\\
    \{\tau _{i}\}, \{\tau _{j}\}, \{\tau _{k}\},\\ \{x_{j}\},\{y_{j}\},\{z_{i}\},w}}{\text
    {max}} 2w\sqrt {A}-w^{2}E_{T} \\&\quad ~~\text {subject to} \quad ~(17{\mathrm
    {b}}), (17{\mathrm {c}}), (17{\mathrm {d}}), (17{\mathrm {e}}), \\&\hphantom {\quad
    ~~}~(17{\mathrm {f}}), (17{\mathrm {g}}), (17{\mathrm {h}}),\tag{30}\end{align*}
    View Source where A is the numerator of the utility function (28) and reformulated
    in (26), as shown at the bottom of the page. Parameters x_{j} , y_{j} , and z_{i}
    are updated in each step of optimization as before in (20)–(22). In addition,
    w is updated as:\begin{equation*} w=\frac {\sqrt {A}}{E_{T}}.\tag{31}\end{equation*}
    View Source Since relays consume a large amount of energy, the resource allocation
    policy optimized for EE does not tend to employ relays. Accordingly, the preferred
    transmission mode for this policy is the underlay mode. Therefore, this resource
    allocation policy does not achieve high data rates for SUs. Algorithm 1 summarizes
    the general solution to the aforementioned optimization problems. It is important
    to note that the final reformulated problems are all convex optimization problems.

    performance of our proposed hybrid resource allocation schemes in terms of throughput,
    fairness, and energy efficiency for a CRRN-based IoT network. In addition, we
    compare our proposed suboptimal algorithm with the optimal solution in the proportional
    fairness (PF) scheme. To find the optimal solution, we do an exhaustive full search.
    The simulation scenario is shown in Fig. 3. The reference distance between PS
    and PD is d=200m . The channel gains are modeled as h_{ij}=Kd_{ij}^{-\alpha }
    , where K is randomly generated according to Rayleigh distribution, d_{ij} is
    the distance between the transmitter node i and the receiver node j and \alpha
    , the path loss exponent, is set to 4 [39]. The number of SUs is considered to
    be 10. The total input noise power, including input thermal noise and input-referred
    noise of Wi-Fi 6 with noise figure of 10 dB and 200 MHz bandwidth, is set to N_{0}=10^{-11}
    W. In order to compare the performance of our hybrid scheme with the standalone
    underlay scheme, the maximum interference allowed by SUs on the primary transmission
    is set to 0.001N_{0} . FIGURE 3. Simulation scenario. Show All The SUs are uniformly
    distributed within a circle with a radius of 20m. The x coordinate of the circle’s
    center is at distance d_{s} from PS and its y coordinate is 10 m above the line
    segment between PS and PD. The access point, AP, is located 10m above the circle’s
    center, as illustrated in Fig. 3. To generate uniformly distributed random points
    within the circle, we generated polar coordinates as:\begin{equation*} r=R\sqrt
    {u}, \quad \theta =2 \pi u,\tag{32}\end{equation*} View Source where u\sim \mathrm
    {U}(0,1) , and R=20m is the circle’s radius. This is stated in cartesian coordinates
    as x=r\cos (\theta) and y=r\sin (\theta) . The simulation results are averaged
    over 1000 iterations of random channel conditions and SU distributions. For various
    conditions on the relay set, Fig. 4 shows the relay utilization rate, defined
    as the percentage of the simulation runs in which R_{coop}>\gamma R_{SD} . In
    our simulations, \gamma is set to one. For \gamma >1 , we get a lower utilization
    rate, and shorter time duration of T_{3} , hence a lower throughput. Note that
    when the relay set is empty, the hybrid underlay overlay scheme is reduced to
    the mere underlay scheme, which yields lower throughput. As it can be observed
    from Fig. 4, allowing the optimal set of relays increases the relay utilization
    rate compared to the cases where only 1, 3, or 5 relays are allowed. In addition,
    it can be observed that when SUs are close to PD, a smaller number of relays yield
    a higher utilization factor, while it is the opposite when SUs are close to PS.
    FIGURE 4. Relay utilization for various |S_{r}| . Show All Fig. 5 shows the average
    size of S_{1} , S_{2} and S_{r} versus d_{s}/d for various resource allocation
    policies, when the optimal number of relays is employed. Here, the number of relays
    is variable and is obtained through the optimization problem (13). Therefore,
    unlike |S_{1}| and |S_{2}| , |S_{r}| does not depend on the resource allocation
    policy. As expected, the size of S_{r} is reduced as SUs become closer to PD.
    The size of S_{1} and S_{2} in the first three resource allocation policies, i.e.,
    SE, EE, and PF, is considerably small. Moreover, there is no significant change
    in their behavior when SUs move from near PS to near PD. However, the size of
    S_{1} and S_{2} are relatively higher in MM especially when d_{s}/d is large.
    In MM, the size of S_{1} is relatively larger than the size of S_{2} . This is
    because the interference at AP is due to the PS’s transmission to relay nodes
    in the first subframe, while it is due to the relay nodes located in the vicinity
    of AP in the second subframe. FIGURE 5. The average size of S_{1} , S_{2} and
    S_{r} for various resource allocation problems when an optimal number of relays
    is used. Show All Fig. 6 illustrates the average size of S_{1} and S_{2} versus
    d_{s}/d for various resource allocation frameworks when an arbitrary number of
    relays is used. It is observed that the average size of S_{1} and S_{2} in all
    resource allocation frameworks is decreased as the size of S_{r} is increased.
    The highest number of SUs transmitting in underlay mode belongs to the MM framework
    in Subframe T_{1} . FIGURE 6. The Average size of S_{1} and S_{2} for various
    resource allocation problems when an arbitrary number of relay is used. Show All
    The throughput of SUs for various resource allocation problems is shown in Fig.
    7. For each resource allocation problem, the throughput of SUs is computed for
    the optimal number of relays. For comparison, Fig. 7 shows the throughput of standalone
    underlay mode as well. In all cases, the hybrid overlay-underlay scheme outperforms
    the standalone underlay scheme for secondary spectrum access in terms of the achieved
    throughput. As one might expect, the resource allocation problem with spectrum
    efficiency as its objective function achieves the highest throughput for various
    values of d_{s}/d , while the energy efficiency-based resource allocation achieves
    a very low transmission rate. The optimal solution of the PF scenario is obtained
    by exhaustive search is also depicted in Fig. 7. Our suboptimal solution in the
    PF scenario is very close to the optimal. The simulation results are averaged
    over the cases where there is a non-empty relay set as well as those with an empty
    relay set in which SUs transmit only in the underlay mode. FIGURE 7. Throughput
    of SUs for various resource allocation problems. Show All The energy efficiencies
    of various resource allocation policies are compared in Fig. 8. When the optimal
    number of relays are used, the highest energy efficiency belongs to the EE framework.
    The SE, PF, and MM are ranked next. The underlay spectrum access schemes (not
    shown in Fig. 8) have a significantly low energy consumption in all cases, hence
    a high energy efficiency. The performance of the optimal solution of the PF scheme
    is close to the proposed PF algorithm. In general, as SUs get closer to PD, the
    energy efficiency increases because the number of relay nodes decreases, and then
    SUs consume lower energy to relay data to PD. FIGURE 8. Energy efficiency for
    various resource allocation problems. Show All In order to compare the fairness
    among SUs, we use Jain’s fairness index [38] as follows:\begin{equation*} \text
    {Fairness Index} = \frac {\left({\sum _{i=0}^{n}{R_{i}}}\right)^{2}}{n\sum _{i=0}^{n}{R_{i}}^{2}}.\tag{33}\end{equation*}
    View Source The result ranges from the worst case of 1/n (which corresponds to
    the case where only one user transmits) to 1 (which corresponds to the case where
    all users receive the same rate). Fig. 9 illustrates the throughput fairness index
    for various resource allocation frameworks. The highest fairness index for all
    values of d_{s}/d belongs to MM. The performance of PF is similar to that of MM
    for small values of d_{s}/d but becomes worse as d_{s}/d increases. The fairness
    indexes of both SE and EE are near minimum. FIGURE 9. Fairness index for various
    resource allocation problems. Show All In Fig. 10, three evaluation criteria including
    throughput, fairness and energy efficiency are shown for two different strategies
    applied to the third subframe T_{3} , namely free T_{3} and equal T_{3} . In the
    first strategy, the time slot allocated to each SU is determined by the resource
    allocation problem. The second strategy, however, always assigns equal time slots
    to all SUs. As shown in Fig. 10a, the free T_{3} strategy outperforms the equal
    T_{3} strategy with respect to spectrum deficiency (SE). This is justifiable since
    the aim of the SE problem is to maximize the sum rate of throughput and there
    is a higher degree of freedom when the allocated time to each SU in the third
    subframe is obtained through the optimization problem rather than being constant.
    Earlier, we showed using KKT that only one SU transmits during T_{3} , when employing
    the free T_{3} strategy. This does not hold for the other problems. There is no
    significant difference between the two strategies for EE, PF, and MM problems.
    In Fig. 10b, we can see that the equal T_{3} strategy achieves a higher fairness
    index compared to free T_{3} for SE and EE frameworks. This is expected since
    dividing the subframe T_{3} equally introduces a level of fairness to these resource
    allocation frameworks. However, the fairness index is similar in PF and MM schemes
    for both strategies, since the fairness consideration is already taken into account
    in these frameworks. In Fig. 10c, both strategies have a similar impact on the
    performance of EE, PF, and MM. For SE, the equal T_{3} strategy yields a higher
    energy efficiency than the free T_{3} strategy. FIGURE 10. Comparison of equal
    and free T_{3} strategies in various resource allocation problems with optimal
    \{S_{r}\} . Show All Fig. 11 illustrates the allocated time to subframes T_{1},
    T_{2} , and T_{3} in various optimizations, all employing the optimal number of
    relays. As shown, the allocated time to T_{1} increases as SUs get closer to PD.
    This happens because when SUs get farther from PS, the path loss increase, hence
    they need more time in the first subframe to preserve the rate. The time allocated
    to the second subframe, T_{2} , in the EE resource allocation problem is higher
    than its counterparts for all values of d_{s}/d . Therefore the allocated time
    to the third subframe is very short in this problem compared to the other problems.
    FIGURE 11. Allocated subframes in various optimization problems employing the
    optimal number of relays. Show All Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 respectively show the throughput
    and the time slots allocated to SUs for the sample case of d_{s}/d=0.7 . It can
    be seen that in SE based resource allocation, there is a significant difference
    in the way the rate is allocated to each SU in the Equal and Free T_{3} strategies.
    In Equal T_{3} , the third subframe is equally divided to all SUs; hence all SUs
    experience an almost equal rate based on their channel condition. In Free T_{3}
    , however, the whole subframe is totally devoted to one SU that has the best channel
    condition to transmit to AP. FIGURE 12. Throughput of SUs in a sample simulation.
    Show All FIGURE 13. Allocated subframe to each SU in a sample simulation. Show
    All To analyze the complexity of our proposed algorithm, we divide the algorithm
    into two parts; One part for finding the optimal relay set and the other part
    for solving the convex optimization problem (17) for PF or (24) for MM. The complexity
    of finding the optimal relay set by binary search is \mathcal {O}(\log {\mathcal
    {N}}) . In the second part, we use direct fractional programming approach, which
    converges in a few iterations. For example, Fig. 14 shows the number of algorithm
    iterations for PF scheme for d_{s}/d=0.1 . On each box, the central mark indicates
    the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th
    percentiles, respectively. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data points
    not considered outliers, and the outliers are plotted individually using the ''+''
    symbol. Besides, direct fractional programming method [30] needs to solve an interior-point
    problem in each iteration, which its complexity for self-concordance functions
    is \mathcal {O}(\sqrt {m}) where m is the number of inequality constraints [36].
    The maximum number of inequality constraints in our problem is \mathcal {O}(\mathcal
    {N}^{2}) . So, the complexity of the interior-point problem is \mathcal {O}(\mathcal
    {N}) . We run some simulation on an Intel Ⓡ Core (TM) i7- 4790k CPU @4.00GHz 32.0GB
    RAM to compute the run-time of fractional programming part for various number
    of SUs as shown in Fig. 15. Then the complexity of our algorithm is estimated
    to be at most \mathcal {O}(\mathcal {N}^{2}) . FIGURE 14. Number of resource allocation
    algorithm iterations for PF scheme and d_{s}/d = 0.1 . Show All FIGURE 15. Run-time
    of resource allocation algorithm for PF scheme. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper has proposed two fair resource allocation frameworks for CCR based
    IoT networks to address the ever-increasing demand for radio spectrum in IoT devices.
    The hybrid overlay-underlay scheme is employed to provide a stable transmission
    of SUs with an acceptable throughput. We have reformulated the inherently nonconvex
    optimization problems as convex problems by separating the integer programming
    phase of relay set selection and using quadratic transform to convert the multiple-ratio
    fractional problems. The proposed suboptimal solution of the PF scheme is very
    close to the optimal solution, as shown by the simulations. Simulation results
    present a comparison between the proposed frameworks in terms of throughput, energy
    efficiency, and fairness with common frameworks such as spectrum efficiency, energy
    efficiency, mere underlay, and equal division of the reward subframe. It is shown
    that the proportional fairness framework offers an almost identical throughput
    to all SU users and maintaining total throughput and energy efficiency. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    and content Abstract Better methods are needed to accurately measure and record
    soil water content in real-time and at specified depths on a field scale. Recent
    developments of such a system using multisensor capacitance probes offers great
    potential for rigorous investigation of soil water dynamics over large areas.
    The purpose of this report is to show some of the kinds of information that can
    be obtained using this system to study the real-time soil water content dynamics
    at short time intervals (10 min), typically at four depth positions, under long-term,
    field-scale conditions, with our probes located as far as 125 m form the data
    logger. The systems have been used in the field for three years of continuous
    study (at 10 min increments), to study changes in soil water content, at four
    soil depths (commonly at 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm) as part of a research project
    to quantify temporal and spatial variation in soil properties under plow-tillage
    (PT) and no-tillage (NT) maize (Zea mays, L.). The multisensor capacitance probes
    and monitoring system have proven to be highly sensitive and robust for field
    scale soil water research. Viewing the soil water dynamics in real-time provides
    opportunity for precise control over the timing and amount of water that needs
    to be applied for optimal crop production yet avoiding excess deep percolation
    losses of water and agrochemicals to groundwater. Previous article in issue Next

    1. Introduction Greater understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of
    water under different soil conditions and cultural practices is required for the
    best use of available water resources while minimizing environmental pollution.
    Also, there is a continuous need for better methods to perform accurate, real-time,
    nearly continuous, soil water measurements at specific soil depth intervals and
    minimal soil disturbance, and covering large areas. New developments in precision
    agriculture, remote sensing, surface and subsurface preferential water flow patterns,
    simulation models for soil–water–plant–atmosphere interrelationships over large
    areas and permanent watch of leakage from the waste material depositing sites,
    will depend upon accurate `ground truth'' data provided by independent real-time
    soil water content monitoring systems covering micro to large scale hydrobasins.
    A survey of soil water measurement methods in current use showed gravimetric analysis
    as the most common method, followed by neutron thermalization and, far behind,
    by time domain reflectometry (TDR) and gamma attenuation (Green and Topp, 1992).
    More than 60 years of international work has been conducted on the correlation
    between the apparent dielectric constant of the soil–air–water–chemicals mixture
    (Ka) and the volumetric soil water content (θv) at different electromagnetic field
    frequencies. In the last 20 years two methods, TDR and capacitance, have proven
    to be accurate and useful for real-time monitoring studies (Paltineanu and Starr,
    1997). Abundant experimental data show that the TDR technique is useful in studies
    of real-time soil water content dynamics, with average resolution commonly ranging
    from 0.02–0.005 cm3 cm−3 water (Topp et al., 1980, Topp et al., 1982a, Topp et
    al., 1982b; Topp and Davis, 1985; van Wesenbeeck and Kachanoski, 1988; Zegelin
    et al., 1989, Zegelin et al., 1992; Baker and Allmaras, 1990; Heimovaara and Bouten,
    1990; Herkelrath et al., 1991). However, TDR systems are typically limited to
    small plots of land due to the requirements for short cable length (<25 m) between
    TDR rods and data loggers (Heimovaara, 1993). Another limitation of the TDR is
    the difficulty of monitoring discrete soil depths without having to install rods
    horizontally from a soil pit. These limitations have been overcome with new multisensor
    capacitance probe and soil water monitoring system with probes that can be located
    500 m from a central data logger. Detailed description of the system, along with
    comparisons to other measuring devices was given by Paltineanu and Starr (1997).
    We also tested the sensors in the laboratory on a carefully compacted silt loam
    soil and obtained a highly significant (r2=0.992 for n=15, and RMSE=0.009 cm3
    cm−3 water), nonlinear (θv=0.490 SF2.1674) relationship between the soil volumetric
    water content (θv, cm3 cm−3) and the scaled frequency (SF=(Fa−Fs)(Fa−Fw)−1]. The
    SF represents the ratio of individual sensor''s frequency (inside a PVC pipe,
    5 cm O.D.) in soil (Fs), in nonsaline water (Fw), and in air (Fa). The zone of
    major influence of the sensors represents a cylinder of soil, approximately 10
    cm along the axis of the probe, with a 10 cm ring around its PVC access pipe (Paltineanu
    and Starr, 1997). Thus, the water content at each sensor may be expressed as either
    a volumetric percent or as a depth of water (mm/10 cm). Sensors are placed in
    the probes at user selected depths (10 cm increments) and reading intervals (1
    and 9999 min). These multisensor capacitance probes and monitoring systems have
    been extensively used as an irrigation management tool in Australia since 1991
    (Buss, 1993). We have been using the system as a research tool in several field
    experiments since 1995. The purpose of this report is to show some of the kinds
    of information that can be obtained using this system to study the real-time soil
    water content dynamics at short time intervals (10 min), typically at four depth
    positions (i.e., 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm depths), year around and multiyear, at
    field-scale conditions (0.5 ha), with our probes located as far as 125 m from
    the data logger. 2. Materials and methods This field study was conducted on a
    Mattapex silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludults) soil at the Beltsville
    Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD. The Ap horizon had about 35% sand,
    56% silt, 9% clay, and 0.8% organic-C. This research was part of a broader field
    study in which the field site, under continuous maize production, was incrementally
    changed from moldboard plow tillage (PT) to no tillage (NT) over a four-year period
    (Starr and Paltineanu, 1998). The experimental site had 26 paired-plots (4.6 by
    25 m) separated by a central alley, placed on a quasi uniform 4% slope, with the
    plots laid out on the contour (Fig. 1). Each 4.6 m wide plot was separated by
    a 3.0 m wide berm and drainage ditch to prevent surface runoff from one plot to
    the next. Prior to initiating tillage treatments in 1994, all plots were plowed
    with a moldboard plow to a depth of 20–25 cm, disked, and planted to maize for
    two consecutive years. In 1995, the plots were in their fourth year of maize,
    and one-fourth of the plots in their second year of NT. Both tillage treatments
    were planted with a 6-row no-till planter in 76.2 cm rows at a plant population
    of about 59000 plants ha−1, with wheel-compaction between rows 2 and 3 and between
    rows 4 and 5. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Schematic layout of

    continued growth of maize (Fig. 2), and did not represent a scheduling plan by
    either ET considerations or capacitance probe data. The amounts of irrigation
    water applied were measured by a tipping bucket rain gage located between the
    pair of PT–NT plot 4 and 6, and by collection jars placed on wooden boards in
    the ditch areas adjacent to the capacitance probe locations. Download : Download

    capacitance probes and soil water monitoring system Two EnviroSCAN® (Sentek PTY,
    Ltd., Kent Town, South Australia) soil water monitoring systems with a total of
    16 multisensor capacitance probes (with four sensor depths at each probe) were
    installed at this field site on June 21, 1995. The first set of eight probes were
    placed in four pairs of the PT–NT plots at the non-traffic interrow position (between
    rows 3 and 4), with initial results reported by Starr and Paltineanu (1998). A
    second set of eight probes were placed in plots 4 and 6. Four probes were placed
    at different in-row and interrow positions, resulting in a total of ten probes
    installed in the two intensive study plots. Each of our EnviroSCAN® systems had
    three main parts: (1) eight semi-permanently installed probes with four capacitance
    sensors each, centered at depths of 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm depths; (2) a data logging
    station with two 5-wire cables (<500 m) connected to probes; and (3) an internal
    power supply charged by a solar panel (or by external battery power during extended
    periods of little to no direct sunlight as occurs in the winter months). After
    completing probe installation and hook-up to the data logging station, the system
    was set to record soil water readings at each of the 32 sensors on a 10 min interval.
    The capacitance data may be downloaded to a portable computer, and viewed directly
    in the field, either by depth or cumulatively with depth at each probe, with software
    provided by the EnviroSCAN®. The data may also be dumped to an ASCII computer
    file for additional detailed numerical and graphical analysis. Software provided
    by R. Soppe (USDA, ARS, Water Management Research Lab., Fresno, CA) was used to
    convert the ASCII data to column/row format. An additional program was written
    to reduce the size of the data files to intervals of 20 min to up to 2 h, whenever
    the change from one 10 min interval to the next gave volumetric water contents
    of less than 0.05% at any of the sensors. 3. Results and discussion Two real-time
    soil water dynamics monitoring systems (16 probes with four capacitance sensors
    each), were installed on June 21, 1995 in the PT–NT experiments (Fig. 1), and
    have been working the year around. The exceptions have been for a few days in
    the spring of 1996 and 1997 when the probes were removed for plowing, disking,
    and planting maize. The largest distance from the probes to the data logger was
    about 125 m. The systems have been robust with few maintenance problems during
    the 30 months of functioning in a large experimental site (∼0.5 ha). 3.1. Sensor
    response to cable length The effect of varying cable length was checked by inserting
    four different cable lengths (25, 100, 400, and 500 m) between a multilevel capacitance
    sensor probe, with two sensors, placed in the field and connected to the data
    logger. An average difference in frequency between the readings with the four
    cable lengths at each sensor was 1 in 12786 (<0.008%), giving a coefficient of
    variation, associated with the SF for the four distances of 0.0186 and 0.0183%.
    This CV was about the same as the CV associated with the SF at constant cable
    length (∼3 m) observed when calibrating the sensors in the laboratory (Paltineanu
    and Starr, 1997). These data confirm the manufacturer''s statement that the capacitance
    sensor readings are not affected by cable lengths up to 500 m, which can cover
    field areas up to 80 ha. 3.2. Real-time soil water dynamics across a growing season
    Characteristic soil water dynamics measured with the multisensor capacitance probes,
    across the growing season, are illustrated for one PT–NT pair of multisensor capacitance
    probes (maize row N0 3 in plots 4 and 6, Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 3. These data
    represent the cumulative water content in the 5–55 cm soil depth interval (summation
    of the four sensor depths, plus interpolated values at the 40 cm depth). Each
    rapid rise in soil water content corresponded to a rainfall or irrigation event
    (Fig. 2). The small changes in water content was not `noisy data'', but reflects
    diurnal changes in soil water content – largely due to ET demand, as shown later.
    Differences in soil water content have been maintained in favor of NT treatment
    throughout the growing season. The general pattern of greater water content under
    NT vs. PT is consistent with these two tillage treatments, with the tillage effects
    largely due to different bulk density distributions and to different surface soil
    conditions that affect infiltration and runoff (Starr and Paltineanu, 1998). Download

    3 of plots 4 and 6. 3.3. Field determination of the in situ apparent water holding
    capacity (aWHC) As shown in Fig. 3, several rainfall events between DOY 175 and
    192, before high ET demand, caused only temporary rises in the soil water content
    as the macro pores filled and drained. The repeating pattern of nearly constant
    maximal water contents following these early-season rainfall events, when the
    maize plants were very small (6–7 leaves, Fig. 2) indicates an in situ aWHC at
    each probe. Thus the aWHC for the NT profile (5–55 cm) was about 172 mm, and about
    160 mm under PT. The aWHC for each sensor depth interval can also be determined
    from the water content data at each sensor depth (Fig. 4). For example, the aWHC
    at the 10 cm sensor of NT (covering a sensing depth interval of 5–15 cm) was about
    27 mm under NT (Fig. 4(a)). The aWHC is very important for establishing irrigation
    and drainage strategies and for minimizing leaching of agrochemicals to deeper
    soil layers. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Water content distribution

    water holding capacity and breaking points. 3.4. Establishing `breaking points''
    between periods of high and low rates of water loss After the early season rainfall
    events, no additional important rain fell for 24 days (DOY 189-213), when maize
    plants were growing rapidly from 7 to 11 leaves, resulting in rapid drying of
    the soil profile under both tillages (Fig. 3). All extended drying cycles that
    occurred in the presence of high ET demand resulted in an initial multidaily high
    rate of water loss followed by a distinctly slower multidaily rates of water loss.
    `Breaking points'' were observed at the intersection of the slopes of the two
    quasi steady rate of water loss, both by separate (Fig. 4) and cumulative soil
    depths (Fig. 5). Thus the breaking point for NT at the 5–15 cm and 15–25 cm depths
    occurred at DOY 197 a transition period of about four days between the high- and
    low-loss rates is evident at the 5–15 cm depth under NT (Fig. 4(a)). The small
    rainfall events from DOY 203–205 resulted in a temporary cessation of water removal
    at the 15–25 cm depth under NT. A small delay in the rate of water loss also occurred
    at the 25–35 cm depth of NT, but the overall rate of water loss remained nearly
    constant across the entire drying period. A slow but steady rate of water loss
    developed at the 45–55 cm depth interval soon after the breaking point occurred
    in the top two layers, indicating some root activity at this deepest depth. A
    similar pattern was observed for PT but the breaking points occurred sequentially
    in time (DOY 197, 201, and 204) at the top three sensor depths. Also, unlike that
    observed for NT, a breaking point was evident at the 25–35 cm depth of PT, which
    means that the maize roots were searching for water at that depth. `Breaking points''
    become important in predicting irrigation applications. For example, if our first
    priority in this research was to maximize crop yields then we would have applied
    our first irrigation about two weeks earlier than we did. We have observed that
    the critical soil water content that results in these breaking points remain quite
    constant. Thus viewing the data in real-time allows the user to anticipate when
    the breaking points will occur and to provide irrigation at the right time. The
    amount of water to apply can then be easily determined as the difference between
    the aWHC and the breaking point for each probe location. Download : Download full-size

    high Et and full canopy for four PT plots. The vertical arrows approximate the
    breaking points between high and low rates of water loss, and the dashed lines
    represent the mean rates of water losses. 3.5. Real-time dynamics of cumulative
    soil water contents at four plot replicates Real-time changes in cumulative soil
    water content (5–55 cm) at four plot replicates under PT during a drying cycle
    of the four non-traffic interrow positions across the entire experimental site
    (Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 5. The highly variable initial water contents across
    the four replicates at DOY 220 are partially due to different amounts of sprinkler
    irrigation that were applied four days earlier, i.e., plots 3, 6, 21, and 24 received
    36, 30, 0 and 0 mm or water, respectively. The breaking points here, under full
    maize canopy, occurred approximately at the same time across the experimental
    site – even with the large variation in initial water contents in the four plots.
    The variation in these high rates of water loss (from 5.6–3.9 mm/d) for the four
    plots were directly related to the initial water contents, thus the different
    plots arrived at a critical low-water content at about the same time. As a result,
    the final slow-rates of water loss were about the same for the four PT positions,
    even though the total soil water content varied greatly across the experimental
    site. Clearly, local soil properties and associated rooting patterns affect the
    ability of the maize plants to extract water. Inspection of the diurnal variation
    in water loss indicates both internal drainage and ET losses of water. Night-time
    losses in soil water content are the clearest indication of internal drainage
    losses, and were most evident here in the wettest plots at the start of the drying
    cycle (plots 3 and 6 from DOY 220 to 222). As internal drainage decreased (night-time
    losses approached zero), the daytime losses are clearly due to ET demand alone
    (maize at ear formation stage) resulting in the diurnal changes in soil water
    content becoming increasingly `stair step'' like in appearance. 3.6. Small spatial-scale
    effects of cultural practices on water infiltration Placement of the multisensor
    capacitance probes at the row and interrow positions in plots 4 and 6 provided
    special insight into small-scale effects of cultural practices on the fate of
    water. One of our observations was the fate of small rainfall events. For example,
    in Fig. 3, the 2.3 mm rainfall on DOY 208 was not detected under PT, but resulted
    in an 8.6 mm increase in water content at this in-row position under NT. The stemflow
    water penetration under NT was mostly within the top sensor region (Fig. 4), but
    there was also an associated decrease in the rate of water loss at the next sensor
    depth. The funneling effect by the maize plants, and the greater macroporosity
    of the in-row position of NT are clearly evident from this data (Paltineanu et
    al., 1995). As shown in Fig. 3, by the end of the first major drying cycle the
    soil profile (5–55 cm) was quite dry when 17.5 mm of sprinkler irrigation water
    was applied on DOY 213. More of this water was detected under NT than PT, with
    56.8 mm increase under NT and 23.3 mm increase under PT. In addition to the obvious
    stemflow effects for both tillages, some of the difference in water infiltration
    was likely due to some of that water being absorbed by the dryer PT 0–5 cm surface
    soil (visual observation). The depth and magnitude of water infiltration with
    the first irrigation event in detailed is Fig. 6, where the data are plotted by
    sensor depth across expanded time scales. The irrigation water penetrated to the
    third sensor depth under NT (Fig. 6(a)), reaching a maximum water content of 35–40
    mm for each 10 cm depth interval (i.e., 35%–40% cm3 cm−3). After the initial rapid
    drainage of macropores, the water drainage occurred during the first night followed
    by a combined drainage and plant-water uptake during the first day after irrigation.
    Very little additional drainage was evident the second night followed by a lower
    rate of loss the next day, probably due to ET alone. A similar general pattern
    occurred under PT (Fig. 6(b)), only with less water penetration. The delayed slower
    rise in water content at the 25–35 cm depth from under PT DOY 213.5–214 shows
    internal drainage from above. Further detail of the water penetration under NT
    is given in Fig. 6(c). Note first the changing time increment of the data plotted,
    from 1 h down to 20 min intervals and then up to 2 h intervals. This is due to
    the data compression program, not to varying intervals of the sensor readings.
    Secondly, note the sequence and speed of water penetration from the first sensor
    depth to the third depth, with the peak in water contents moving from one sensor
    depth to the next in about 1 h. This rate of movement suggests substantial filling
    of meso- and macropores, and their associated higher hydraulic conductivities
    than might be expected from the soil matrix of silt-loam soil. Download : Download

    3 (plots 4 and 6). 4. Conclusions The multisensor capacitance probes and monitoring
    system was found to be highly sensitive and robust for field scale soil water
    research. Real-time soil water dynamics by depths, at both small- and large-areas,
    can provide crucial information for understanding the impact of cultural and cropping
    practices on the fate of water in soils. Accurate `ground truth'' data is needed
    for new developments in precision agriculture, remote sensing, soil–water–plant–atmosphere
    interrelationship models, and for improved water management under irrigated agriculture.
    The method provides, among others, the capability for field determination of (1)
    the `apparent water holding capacity'', (2) the `breaking points'' between periods
    of high and low rates of water loss, (3) the small spatial-scale effects of cultural
    practices on water infiltration, (4) real-time viewing of soil water dynamics
    over large areas, and (5) irrigation scheduling strategies. Such capabilities
    are needed for a better and understanding of the fate of water and agrochemicals
    in soils and the effects of soil and crop management practices on the environment.

    content at depths 10, 30 and 50 cm; Fig. 5). This shows that determining the management
    line according to the rate of apparent water uptake is a practical and effective
    tool to define irrigation scheduling, as it has been reported for other species
    (Abrisqueta et al., 2012; Starr and Paltineanu, 1998a, 1998b; Thompson et al.,
    2007a). With respect to the yield components, it was observed that no treatment
    affected crop load, which is why the differences in yield, in both seasons, were
    due to effects in fruit size (Table 1). Show abstract Field assessment of interreplicate

    By depending on the ability of EM sensors mainly to describe θv trends and to
    quantify Δθv within each drying sequence (Starr and Paltineanu, 1998; Singh et
    al., 2018), such an approach might be more accommodating of shortcomings in calibration
    and/or interreplicate variability. Future field studies that implement and evaluate
    this type of approach as well as complex ensemble approaches combining soil moisture
    sensing, soil water balance modeling, and thermal sensing/energy balance modeling
    (Barker et al., 2018) would be greatly welcomed to overcome the challenge of relying
    solely on soil moisture sensor data. Show abstract Deficit irrigation management

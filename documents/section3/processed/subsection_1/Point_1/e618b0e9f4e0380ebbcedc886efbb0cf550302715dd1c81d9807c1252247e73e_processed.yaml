    devices, machinery, sensors, and objects communicate seamlessly without requiring
    human intervention. Within this framework, WSNs are crucial, extending their influence
    across many real-time agricultural applications. These IoT and WSNs are structured
    with multiple layers in the SA application, illuminated comprehensively in the
    subsequent subsections. The overview of IoT and WSN architectures is shown in
    Figure 2 and 3. FIGURE 2. Architecture of IoT for SA application systems. Show
    All FIGURE 3. WSNs architecture for SA application. Show All A. IoT Architectures
    The emergence of IoT is an essential feature in contemporary agriculture systems,
    driven by the rapid progression of agricultural technology [39], [40]. IoT encompasses
    several critical segments, including sensors and devices, connectivity, action
    and automation, and user interface and interaction [1], [41]. These elements gather
    data from agricultural yields, allowing farmers to make informed decisions. Additionally,
    these elements are connected within various layers of IoT architectures for SA
    applications. However, determining an architecture for -based SA poses challenges
    due to the extensive potential scale and specific requirements, such as soil conditions,
    weather dynamics, and geographical variations [13], [42], [43]. Moreover, integrating
    IoT devices and systems into agricultural practices necessitates diligent efforts
    [44]. These efforts encompass acquiring IoT devices and utilizing various protocols
    and standards to ensure seamless compatibility and integration. In agricultural
    IoT configurations, sensors and devices generate substantial data, heightening
    the complexity of real-time data management, processing, and analysis. The designated
    framework for this purpose should efficiently facilitate structured data storage,
    efficient processing, and robust analytical capabilities [45]. The agricultural
    sector emphasizes precise and timely data, highlighting the necessity of ensuring
    the selected architectural structure is trustworthy and robust. It must have the
    capacity to maintain continuous collection and processing of data, even under
    adverse environmental circumstances or in the presence of challenges with network
    connectivity [46], [47]. On the other hand, ensuring a balanced integration of
    envisioned architectural features, functionalities, and the designated budget
    is essential. This is especially critical for small-scale farmers or financially
    constrained organizations. At the beginning of rapid advancements in IoT technologies,
    it is significant to underscore the importance of selecting an adaptable architectural
    framework [48], [49]. This architecture should incorporate emerging technologies
    and standards, ensuring the enduring relevance and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    SA system without interruption. Emphasizing the need for this strategic preference
    ensures the system’s sustained applicability and efficiency. The architecture
    of IoT technologies is employed based on various methodologies, varying from application
    to application [50], [51], [52]. This results in diverse design and deployment
    patterns. Instead, it must be customized based on specific needs. Typically, architecture
    is structured in a framework comprising three, four, and five layers for SA applications
    [26], [49], [50], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Originating from a hierarchical
    framework of three to five layers, the IoT architecture is conventionally described,
    featuring primary and most common layers, including the perception layer, connectivity
    layer, and application layer for the SA application [20], [33], [50], [57]. These
    layers are also mentioned as the lower layer in the IoT architecture [21]. Furthermore,
    the other layers are the middleware and processing layer [44], [58], [59]. In
    the below subsection, we described the primary and main layer of IoT architecture
    for the SA system. 1) Perception Layer The perception layer, also known as the
    physical layer, is a crucial component in the IoT framework [13], [60]. It operates
    as a robust interface, enabling appropriate interaction between the physical and
    digital domains [33]. This layer is essential for immediately collecting diverse
    data from sensors and devices [44]. It encompasses critical environmental parameters
    such as weather conditions, wind flow, humidity, etc. For example, Zeng et al
    deployed an ultrasonic water level gauge for measuring the water level of a smart
    irrigation system [57]. The perception layer within the SA application presents
    typical challenges due to complex requirements during crop and environmental monitoring,
    especially in unfavorable conditions [60]. Enhancing the energy and communication
    infrastructure in agricultural fields is crucial, and using wired power and communication
    channels to connect IoT nodes is not practical or cost-effective. Data collection
    processes have progressed, integrating various tools. For example, sensors and
    cameras use Bluetooth, wireless networks, and short-distance wireless and wired
    transmission methods to transmit data to the central gateway [1], [61]. The sensing
    layer employs relevant devices to convert biological data into web-accessible
    information, constituting a foundational step in network control. 2) Connectivity
    Layer The communication layer, recognized as the network and transport layer,
    facilitates uninterrupted communication and data transfer across diverse devices,
    constituting the fundamental framework of IoT architectures [62], [63], [64],
    [65]. A profound understanding of the sophistication of the communication layer
    is critical to optimizing IoT networks, fostering scalability, resilience, and
    secure data exchange, thus propelling the potential and applications of IoT technologies
    across various domains. As the key element of the entire system, this layer delivers
    data transmission from the perception layer to the application layers [66]. The
    data transmission channels, encompassing wired or wireless, short or long-distance
    mechanisms, serve as foundational components. These channels effectively utilize
    both network infrastructure and wireless sensors. Attaining consistent and reliable
    performance in data transmission is paramount, especially in light of the substantial
    interference prevalent in the complex agricultural production environment and
    frequent climate changes that continually challenge this technology [67], [68].
    3) Application Layer IoT has revolutionized the SA system, fundamentally transforming
    agriculture and agribusiness approaches. The IoT application layer, central to
    this transformation, drives the functionality and intelligence of IoT applications,
    particularly in intelligent agriculture [69], [70]. This layer integrates data
    from diverse sensors and devices in agricultural settings, enabling insightful
    analysis and informed actions [48], [66]. Advanced technologies within this layer,
    such as ML algorithms and predictive analytics, drive precision farming, optimizing
    resource allocation crop management, and fostering sustainable agricultural practices
    [71]. The application layer processes information and makes critical decisions
    [72]. It closely integrates IoT technology with agricultural production, utilizing
    data analysis from the connectivity layer [73]. It also possesses related equipment
    to achieve SA management [9]. Given the complexity of crop data and climate change,
    technology proves pivotal in identifying agricultural production process issues
    aligning with user needs. B. WSN Architectures WSNs are essential in IoT technology
    because they collect and transmit data from various physical phenomena and environments.
    They operate as the information-gathering infrastructure of IoT by capturing real-time
    data through diverse sensors placed across different locations [74]. This collected
    data is relayed to centralized systems for analysis, interpretation, and informed
    decision-making. Especially within the SA system, WSNs manifest as a connected
    network of sensor nodes utilizing wireless connections. These nodes possess diverse
    functionalities, encompassing processing, transmission, and sensing capabilities,
    empowering them for self-organization, self-configuration, and self-diagnosis
    [75]. The categorization of WSNs is contingent upon their deployment contexts,
    with notable classifications being terrestrial WSNs (TWSNs), wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater WSNs (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks
    (WMSNs), and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [76], [77], [78]. TWSNs and
    UWSNs are commonly utilized in SA applications [23], [79]. In contrast, WUSNs
    are positioned underground, requiring a higher node density due to the restricted
    communication range caused by soil attenuation of higher frequencies [77], [80].
    Scholarly literature extensively explores the various applications of WSNs in
    agriculture, encompassing activities such as managing irrigation, assessing water
    quality, and monitoring the environment. Exploring these applications underscores
    the pivotal role of WSNs in propelling advancements in agricultural practices.
    A WSN typically comprises five foundational layers within its architecture: the
    physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers [81], [82]. The
    details of these layers are given below. 1) Physical Layer The physical layer
    is the foundation of a WSN, encompassing crucial hardware components and communication
    interfaces. In the SA domain, this layer holds various sensors meticulously designed
    to measure essential environmental parameters such as temperature, soil moisture,
    and sunlight exposure [64], [83]. These sensors play a pivotal role by converting
    these physical parameters into electrical signals, forming the bedrock for comprehensive
    data collection within the agricultural environment. For WSNs, the most relevant
    and widely recognized set of standards is the IEEE 802.15 family [84]. Specifically,
    the IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines the physical and Medium access control layer
    (MAC) specifications for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) extensively
    utilized in WSNs [85], [86]. This standard is crafted to deliver low-cost, low-power,
    and low-data rate communication, catering to diverse applications, including WSNs.
    On the other hand, in the data flow, sensor nodes actively collect data and transmit
    it to a centralized node, ensuring processing aligns with user requirements. The
    physical layer is entrusted with transmitting bitstreams, carefully selecting
    frequencies, generating carrier frequencies, modulating data, encrypting data,
    and detecting signals [87]. This layer encompasses the definition of transmission
    medium specifications and intricately involves establishing the network topology,
    incorporating the crucial functions of encoding and decoding signals. 2) Data
    Link Layer The layer above the physical layer is the data link layer, which establishes
    reliable and secure connections between adjacent nodes in the network [81]. In
    the context of SA, this layer ensures error-free communication among sensors,
    the central base station, and sensor nodes, allowing for precise monitoring of
    field conditions and crop health [88], [89]. It handles multiple functions, including
    multiplexing data streams, frame detection, MAC, and error control implementation
    [90]. Additionally, the data link layer ensures the dependability of both point-to-point
    and multi-point channel access strategies through efficient scheduling and proficient
    buffer management [91]. 3) Network Layer The network layer is positioned higher
    within the WSN architecture and is crucial in overseeing routing and data packet
    progression among diverse sensor nodes [92]. It optimizes data flow significantly
    from sensors scattered across extensive farmlands to the central server or gateway,
    making efficient routing a vital aspect for well-informed decisions in SA, particularly
    in irrigation, pest control, and resource management. The network layer’s primary
    function lies in routing, establishing a pathway through intermediary nodes from
    the source to the destination node [93]. Research in this layer primarily focuses
    on developing highly efficient routing protocols that meet various constraints,
    encompassing energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS), and robustness. Moreover,
    the network layer integrates the communication network protocol selected from
    the existing network protocols for WSN, encompassing features relevant to precision
    agriculture applications. 4) Transport Layer The transport layer assumes a critical
    role, ensuring reliability and effectively managing congestion to prevent or mitigate
    it. Specific protocols are in place within this layer to serve these essential
    functions, employing either upstream or downstream techniques [94]. These protocols
    can be categorized as packet-driven and event-driven [95]. The collaborative capabilities
    demonstrated by sensor nodes are the fundamental basis for the operations of this
    vital layer. In addition, the transport layer is crucial in maintaining end-to-end
    communication and data integrity [96]. In the context of advanced agricultural
    applications, this layer can ensure the consistent and reliable transmission of
    data packets from sensors to the application layer. It efficiently manages data
    flow, meticulously maintains packet sequencing, and applies necessary error correction
    measures to ensure that crucial agricultural data reaches the applications with
    the highest accuracy and precision. 5) Application Layer In the domain of SA,
    the application layer holds great significance. It supports various applications
    crucial for optimizing agricultural practices, enhancing yields, and promoting
    sustainable farming methods [97]. Farmers and analysts can easily visualize field
    data on their mobile devices and computers through this layer, aiding in informed
    decision-making. This layer also plays a pivotal role in analyzing field data,
    providing valuable insights [83]. Moreover, the application layer controls essential
    management functionalities within the WSN. It efficiently manages traffic, offers
    software for diverse applications, and converts data into understandable formats.
    These functions encompass network management, query processing, communication,
    time synchronization, and localization [98]. SECTION IV. Wireless Communication
    Protocols for IoT-WSNs in SA WSN developed various wireless sensing devices placed
    over a broad location. These appliances include distributed communication network
    protocols that gather data from the agricultural yield and centralize adequately
    to commission the collected data. The state-of-the-art WSN comprises several affordable
    sensing devices utilizing low-power communications network protocols, such as
    ZigBee, SigFox, WiFi, and LoRaWAN. WSNs are distinguished functionally from the
    usual sensing device collection by their network capabilities, which allow performance
    between sensing assets. The network protocol is also classified into long-range
    and short-range protocols depending on their area coverage and properties. For
    this purpose, long-range network protocols can convey data over a long distance;
    in contrast, short ranges can transmit within a short distance [33], [99]. The
    essential features and attributes of these four protocols are shown in Table 1.
    The short-range and long-range protocols are given below. A. Short-Range Protocols
    1) ZigBee The Alliance has introduced ZigBee technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4
    standard, employing a wireless communication approach that conserves power and
    integrates a high-speed, energy-efficient standard protocol [84], [100]. ZigBee
    operates within multiple radio frequency bands, including 2.4 GHz, 915 MHz, and
    868 MHz, achieving an impressive transmission speed of 250 kbps. Notably, ZigBee
    can function in a low-power sleep mode using batteries for extended periods [23].
    It supports various network techniques, encompassing star, tree, and mesh topology,
    resulting in three primary Zigbee network types: star, tree, and wireless mesh
    network topology [101]. Zigbee wireless networks facilitate autonomous wireless
    data transmission in the agricultural IoT-WSNs domain. It ensures convenient and
    stable remote data transmission through successive integration with wired data
    transmission. Continuous advancements in IoT-WSNs microprocessor research and
    development are evident, especially in integrating wireless sensing, control,
    communication, and data processing functions within the microprocessor [27]. Concerning
    real-time monitoring in agricultural production, utilize intelligence systems
    for precise functional and monitoring tasks in field cultivation, irrigation and
    fertilizer, and well-established production processes. Agricultural IoT supports
    enriched planting experiences and precise crop management. Remarkable strides
    have been taken in the development of high-precision information monitoring and
    diagnostic equipment, significantly advancing the application of IoT in agriculture.
    Currently, equipment for acquiring crop and plant information, monitoring environmental
    information, and tracking animal behavior plays a pivotal role in the SA system.
    The vital data required for crop monitoring is gathered using various Zigbee sensors
    in battery self-powered mode, forming a wireless sensor network [102], [103],
    [104]. Given the substantial number of Zigbee nodes required in production, establishing
    a robust network topology is essential to facilitate fast communication between
    network nodes [105]. 2) WiFi Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), officially introduced by
    the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) in the late 1990s [106], [107],
    represented a significant advancement in wireless technology. Functioning as a
    wireless local area network (WLAN) technology, it effectively replaced Ethernet,
    granting devices the ability to connect to the internet without being tethered
    by wires or cables. Operating in compliance with the IEEE 802 communication standard,
    devices equipped with WiFi communicate via radio signals across the airwaves with
    an access point (AP), an essential piece of networking hardware connected to a
    wired or cellular network [108]. This technology covers a range of radio frequencies,
    spanning from 2.4 to 60 GHz, and precisely defines the structure of data packets
    [23], [33]. WiFi is widely adopted across a spectrum of devices, primarily due
    to its coverage range, typically 3–7 km, with a large transmitting antenna and
    its potential to achieve information transfer speeds of up to 700 Mbps [109],
    [110]. In the IoT applied in SA, integrating computing and WiFi-based long-distance
    networks facilitates connectivity within agricultural and farming processes, particularly
    in rural areas. It is used to transmit information within the system due to its
    high throughput and ease of integration with web-based services. WiFi integration
    is essential while measuring critical field parameters such as water quantity,
    soil humidity, and temperature [111]. It is ideal for establishing communication
    between the sink nodes and gateways or connecting to the cloud via the internet.
    WiFi finds specific applications in agricultural IoT, encompassing crop disease
    detection, precision greenhouse farming, and remote diagnosis [112], [113]. B.
    Long-Range Protocols 1) SigFox SigFox is a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
    technology designed to transmit minimal data volumes, typically ranging from a
    few bytes to hundreds of kilobytes [114]. The core modulation technique employed
    is Differential Binary Phase-Shift Keying (D-BPSK), operating within a fixed bandwidth
    of 100Hz and achieving efficient spectrum utilization [25], [33]. The transmission
    speed varies, offering rates of 100bps in Europe and a higher 600bps in the U.S.A.
    region. Operating within the unlicensed frequency spectrum below 1GHz, SigFox
    utilizes 868MHz in Europe and 915MHz in the U.S. [115]. This Ultra-Narrow Band
    modulation, known for its minimal power consumption, is ideal for establishing
    robust connections between nodes and the base station, especially when combined
    with the Chirp Spreading Spectrum. The D-BPSK modulation is relatively straightforward
    to implement [116], [117]. Moreover, SigFox handles small data packets, typically
    composed of 12 bytes, and operates within a bandwidth of 100 Hz [118]. A key strength
    of SigFox lies in its outstanding power efficiency, capable of sustaining operations
    for up to an impressive 15 years on a single battery charge [119]. This network
    technology operates in a frequency band between 860 and 920 MHz [120]. The coverage
    range spans 10 to 40 km, and the information transfer speed can reach 600 bits
    per second [121]. Owing to Sigfox’s advanced network protocol features, it finds
    extensive applications within -WSN-based SA systems [7]. It is notably used to
    implement cloud-based WSNs for irrigation systems, real-time agricultural data
    collection, and energy harvesting [118]. Moreover, SigFox has been utilized to
    develop solar-powered autonomous sensor nodes, effectively collecting meteorological
    parameters and demonstrating successful assessment, particularly in vineyard environments
    [118]. 2) LoRaWAN LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol developed
    to enable communication among low-energy devices in various IoT applications [101].
    It operates over unlicensed radio frequencies, allowing for long-distance communication
    with minimal power consumption [122]. The technology uses chirp spread spectrum
    modulation, making it ideal for connecting devices over several kilometers in
    urban or rural environments [123]. This wireless communication technology consumes
    energy infrequently and operates in an unlicensed band [124]. Its coverage range
    is about 20 km, and the information transfer speed can reach 100 kbps [125], [126].
    Additionally, LoRaWAN utilizes various spreading factors (SF) from SF7 to SF12,
    strategically managing the trade-off between transmission range and data rate
    [127]. Among them, SF12 achieves an extensive communication range at the cost
    of a lower data rate [128]. LoRa is the fundamental physical technique integrated
    with the LoRaWAN MAC layer, serving as a foundation for various applications [129].
    The architectural design of LoRaWAN nodes is structured into three distinct classes:
    A, B, and C [130]. Class A nodes exhibit minimal power consumption, efficiently
    transmitting a limited number of data packets to the gateway and spending most
    of their time idle [131]. In contrast, Class B nodes, in addition to the reception
    windows resembling Class A, open specific reception windows during scheduled time
    slots [130]. Meanwhile, Class C nodes maintain a perpetually open window for reception,
    except during data transmission, resulting in higher energy consumption than their
    counterparts in the other two classes [132]. SECTION V. IoT-WSNs in SA Application
    Agriculture is essential for any nation and a pillar of the economy. SA is a significant
    aspect and rising contemporary topic for all nations. The world’s inhabitants
    are rapidly increasing, and the demand for food boosts as the population extends.
    The production of food and recovering the individual’s fundamental needs can only
    be possible by concentrating on the agriculture sectors. Thus, automation should
    be incorporated into agriculture and reformed from traditional to SA. For this
    purpose, IoT-WSN is frequently utilized in SA applications. Several agricultural
    applications are discussed In the following subsections. WSN-integrated IoT-based
    SA applications utilizing wireless network protocols are summarised in Table 3.
    TABLE 2 Overview and Characteristics of ZigBee, WiFi, SigFox, and LoRaWAN TABLE
    3 IoT-WSNs-Based Applications With Wireless Network Protocols TABLE 4 A Summary
    of Issues and Challenges of IoT-WSNs Based SA Domain TABLE 5 A Summary of Future
    Perspective and Recommendation for IoT-WSNs-Based SA System A. Irrigation System
    The smart irrigation system (SIS) is a scientific domain that uses data-intensive
    approaches to improve agricultural productivity while decreasing environmental
    impact. Advanced agricultural processes generate data from different sensors,
    leading to a better understanding of the operational circumstances and process
    activities. It allows extra accurate and efficient decision-making. The SIS improves
    performance and is an emerging approach that automates irrigation systems and
    conserves water usage. This process modifies irrigation based on actual soil and
    weather conditions, allowing farmers to fulfill their needs with a recently adopted
    method that preserves the water for the irrigation process. Hence, WSN and wireless
    network protocols are utilized in the irrigation system to achieve this facility
    [133]. Routis et al. have presented an innovative IoT-based prototype system for
    precise crop irrigation. This system utilizes microprocessors and a Single-Board
    Computer (SBC) to collect sensor data, monitoring essential soil parameters, including
    soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) light. A significant
    feature is Raspberry devices, which incorporate powerful 4-core CPUs operating
    at 1.5GHz, underscoring their computational efficiency compared to the Arduino
    UNO’s operation at 16MHz. The system integrates various sensors, including Capacitive
    Soil Moisture sensors, the DHT22 sensor for measuring air humidity and temperature,
    and the VEML6070 UV sensor, which is essential for monitoring UV radiation and
    its influence on crop growth. This study substantially contributes to agricultural
    technology and IoT applications for crop management [201]. Vandome et al. proposed
    low energy consumption and cost-effectiveness wireless soil moisture sensors,
    making them accessible both from a technical and economic perspective. This innovative
    sensor employs a precise calibration method based on a single parameter, enabling
    real-time monitoring of irrigation water requirements. Importantly, it was intentionally
    designed to meet the specific needs of water users and was successfully implemented
    within a Tunisian irrigation scheme, effectively addressing significant water
    use efficiency challenges. They evaluated the sensor by testing the WSN on pilot
    plots throughout a growing season and comparing its performance to commercial
    sensors. Notably, Wi-Fi technology was skillfully employed for communication within
    the network. Furthermore, the authors provided valuable insights by advocating
    for using these cost-effective sensors for real-time irrigation monitoring and
    as a pivotal tool for improving water resource management [283]. Fernández et
    al. proposed an economical cloud-based irrigation system that relies on WSN-based
    micro-controller ESP32-Lora and internet connectivity via the SigFox network.
    The results obtained validate the system’s stability and robustness. This system
    had various sensors to measure different irrigation parameters, encompassing hydraulic
    network and environmental variables, including air temperature, humidity, irradiance,
    wind speed, precipitation, and soil variables such as humidity, temperature, pH,
    and matric potential. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    solution for irrigation control and management, offering scalability suitable
    for diverse agricultural contexts. The deployment of cost-effective SigFox technology
    addresses the connectivity and energy availability challenges of SA systems in
    rural areas [291]. Mathew et al. developed an IoT-based system to enable farmers
    to estimate irrigation water requirements. This innovative system employs sensors
    to detect soil moisture and temperature, with the collected data transmitted to
    the LoRaWAAN system for comprehensive analysis, including evapotranspiration calculation.
    The determination of global evapotranspiration is facilitated through Cropwat
    software, while the sensor data undergoes examination, enabling precise estimations
    tailored to microclimate conditions. The chosen Rx-MCU is the ESP32 MCU, equipped
    with integrated Wi-Fi connectivity to ensure uninterrupted internet gateway connection,
    facilitating seamless data streaming into application layer services. This approach
    is firmly grounded in WSNs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of both data
    collection and transmission [284]. B. Soil Moisture Monitoring System Soil moisture
    plays an important role in an agricultural field that massively contributes to
    crop growth [493], [494]. It is recognized as one of the major drivers for plant
    ecosystems and a significant state variable for the irrigation system of the agriculture
    field [495]. Soil moisture is strongly variable and depends on various soil properties
    and terrain attributes [496]. Therefore, a modern, sustainable, automatic, low-cost,
    and power-efficient soil moisture monitoring process is required. Soil moisture
    monitoring systems can be performed with various procedures. In these terms, WSN
    is one of the most utilized approaches to monitoring soil condition and moisture
    [84], [497]. Based on this, several works have been done to monitor the soil nutrient,
    PH, and moisture monitoring by using WSN. Mohammed et al. introduced a real-time,
    fully automated WSN prototype for irrigation systems. This innovative system relies
    on automated WSN technology to respond to soil conditions, particularly soil moisture,
    for informed irrigation decisions. It utilizes the ZigBee protocol integrated
    into the XBee module and incorporates a cost-effective capacitive soil moisture
    sensor to measure soil moisture levels at each ZigBee node. Integrated with the
    low-cost soil moisture sensor, this system demonstrated promise in enhancing agricultural
    practices and conserving water resources [203]. Patrizi et al. submitted WSN architecture
    that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technology to develop a virtual soil
    moisture sensor. This virtual sensor utilizes data collected by other transducers
    on the same node. They utilized the ESP32 system-on-a-chip microcontroller to
    efficiently process and transmit data to a centralized gateway through the WiFi
    protocol. The WSN consists of ten independent sensor nodes, each equipped with
    an array of environmental sensors for air temperature, humidity, soil temperature,
    soil moisture, and radiation. An essential challenge addressed in this work was
    measuring soil humidity. In response, the study introduced a sophisticated soft
    sensing algorithm based on the DL algorithm, resulting in a virtual soil moisture
    sensor capable of overcoming the limitations of physical sensors and enhancing
    precision in soil moisture measurements [379]. Wu et al. presented a soil quality
    monitoring system to enhance agricultural practices. This system designated users
    to conduct real-time monitoring of their farmland via a mobile application, providing
    a convenient means to establish and customize soil parameter thresholds. Their
    research offered a novel approach to integrating IoT technology into agricultural
    soil measurements, incorporating multiple sensors for temperature and moisture,
    a microprocessor, a microcomputer, a cloud platform, and a dedicated mobile application.
    The wireless sensors efficiently collect and transmit real-time soil information,
    with the mobile app serving as a central monitoring hub through the cloud platform.
    Data transmission facilitated by the LoRa module ensures precise measurements
    that closely align with those obtained through calibration equipment. Field experiments
    have showcased the system’s ability to predict soil moisture and temperature with
    enhanced accuracy, drawing upon data from various soil layers. This system equipped
    users with the necessary tools to promptly assess soil conditions, enabling routine
    checks for changes in soil quality [406]. C. Fertiliser Optimization and Control
    The world faces a food supply crisis, with less food production than population
    growth [498]. Besides, there needs to be more integration and utilization of state-of-the-art
    technology in agricultural applications [499]. The annual food production is also
    damaged due to a lack of soil fertility, moisture, and fundamental nutrients of
    NPK [500]. On the other hand, conventional methods are even applied to measure
    the soil nutrients and apply a fertilizer that is also harmful to crops and soil.
    The excessive volume of fertilizer can damage the standard scale of PH and the
    soil nutrition of agricultural land [501]. To address this challenge, it becomes
    essential to form a precision agriculture exercise through IoT with the involvement
    of IoT and WSN. Soil nutrient and fertilizer investigation using WSN allows different
    applications, including remote soil fertility monitoring. Contreras et al. introduced
    SAgric-IoT, an SA system integrating IoT and DL technologies. This sophisticated
    system aims to monitor environmental conditions, swiftly detect diseases, and
    automate irrigation and fertilization processes within greenhouses. It comprises
    four key components: WSN for environmental monitoring, cameras for visual data,
    a gateway for centralized control, and a processing and storage unit. The gateway
    operates using three distinct communication protocols–ZigBee for sensor connectivity,
    Wi-Fi for cameras, and a cellular interface for transmitting data to the central
    unit. Notably, SAgric-IoT demonstrates remarkable efficiency in minimizing packet
    loss, thereby significantly conserving energy [105]. Senapaty et al. introduced
    the IoTSNA-CR model, utilizing IoT technology to analyze soil nutrients and suggest
    optimal crops, aiming to enhance productivity while reducing fertilizer usage.
    The model begins with IoT sensors collecting data in cultivation areas, followed
    by real-time storage in cloud services, accessible via an Android app, and undergoing
    subsequent data processing and analysis. A cost-effective WSN sensory system integrated
    various sensors to monitor soil attributes—temperature, moisture, pH, GPS, and
    color—efficiently gathering diverse data, including NPK values, timestamps, and
    geolocation specifics. Research advised using Agrinex NPK soil testing tablets
    and an LDR color sensor for soil sample analysis, with results stored in Firebase
    cloud storage. Interconnected through the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and Arduino microcontroller,
    sensor nodes formed a low-power, efficient wireless network. The pivotal FC28
    soil moisture sensor significantly enhanced the IoTSNA-CR model’s effectiveness
    by evaluating soil water content [112]. Doan et al. proposed a WSN framework employing
    LoRa technology for remote monitoring within agricultural settings. This network
    consisted of three strategically placed LoRa sensor nodes within separate rice
    fields, tailored to different crops and utilizing various tillage and fertilization
    methods. These nodes gathered essential environmental indicators for effective
    monitoring, encompassing temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, water pH, CH4,
    and NH3 levels. Research findings underscored the system’s effectiveness in monitoring
    the rice cultivation environment, ensuring robust and comprehensive data transmission,
    network security, and impressive long-range signal transmission of up to 3.5 km
    at a reasonable cost. The framework demonstrated proficiency in long-distance
    data transmission, maintaining secure data transfer from source nodes to the central
    gateway, ensuring high reliability, and facilitating seamless deployment for extensive
    agricultural monitoring [347]. D. Early Stage Control of Pest and Crop Diseases
    Damaging crop production due to various factors, pests, and crop diseases is one
    significant issue, as a large quantity of crop is wasted every production cycle
    by affecting pests and diseases [84], [502]. Thus, an early-stage sustainable
    decision support system is mandatory to enable the farmer to carry out proper
    actions in profitable harvesting [503]. A smart monitoring system should employ
    state-of-the-art sensor technology to solve plant diseases and pest-related concerns.
    WSN systems can collect data and store them in a cloud platform with the help
    of network protocols and process them, which helps to make early decisions to
    prevent pest and crop diseases [36], [47]. Additionally, Crop disease detection
    is a massive challenge in precision agriculture applications since crop diseases
    cannot be accurately predicted by analyzing individual disease causes. Azfar et
    al. introduced an IoT sensor system explicitly designed for pest detection and
    control, real-time detection of Cotton Flying Moths. This system experienced rigorous
    testing in controlled and uncontrolled environments to evaluate its accuracy and
    efficiency. The innovative prototype integrated a series of precise infrared sensors,
    a communication module based on Zigbee technology, an Arduino 2560 Mega board,
    a lithium polymer battery to power the sensor, a gateway device, and a UAV configured
    to act as a pesticide sprayer upon detecting pests. The pest detection algorithm,
    embedded within the system, monitors changes in reflected light to identify the
    presence of flying insects. Upon detection, the system sends an alert to the gateway
    device, which transmits the detection coordinates to the drone/UAV. Subsequently,
    the drone responds by spraying pesticide in the identified pest-infested area
    [440]. Strawberry cultivation is a significant agricultural venture, offering
    considerable advantages over various vegetable crops [504], [505]. Despite its
    prominence, the sensitivity of strawberries renders them highly susceptible to
    diverse pests and diseases. Resorting to chemicals and pesticides for protection
    significantly hampers production efficiency due to this sensitivity. To address
    this challenge, integrating deep computer vision architectures has been pivotal.

    in IoT-based agriculture leverages advanced data analysis methodologies to extract
    valuable insights from the extensive data generated by IoT devices within agricultural
    settings [14], [74], [624]. These IoT devices, furnished with various sensors,
    actively gather diverse data concerning soil health, prevailing weather conditions,
    crop growth patterns, equipment performance, and more. The process of big data
    analytics involves discerning patterns, trends, and correlations within this data,
    all of which are critical for informed, data-driven decision-making aimed at enhancing
    agricultural practices. This analytical approach anticipates future trends and
    conditions by analyzing historical and real-time data, empowering proactive decision-making.
    It optimizes the usage of vital resources, such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    by precisely tailoring their application to the specific requirements of the crops.
    The role of big data analytics in assisting farmers in making informed choices
    regarding the cultivation of diverse crops, considering seasonal variations such
    as winter and summer, cannot be overstated [23], [625], [626]. This analytical
    approach has demonstrated high cost-effectiveness, especially for small-scale
    farmers, and exhibits potential for indoor application within households. F. 5G
    and 6G for SA The advancement of 5G and the promising revolution of 6G within
    IoT-WSNs bear substantial implications for the agricultural sector. 5G, constituting
    the fifth generation of wireless technology, represents a remarkable leap forward,
    offering significant enhancements such as accelerated data speeds, diminished
    latency, and improved connectivity. These enhancements translate to heightened
    real-time monitoring and faster transmission of sensor data, ultimately refining
    coordination among devices in agricultural applications [538], [627]. Looking
    ahead, 6G technology, still in its developmental phase, holds the potential to
    revolutionize data collection and analysis, potentially achieving speeds in the
    range of terabits per second, thereby ensuring exceptionally timely and precise
    insights for farmers [628], [631]. Incorporating 5G and the envisioned capabilities
    of 6G within IoT-WSNs for agriculture holds immense promise. This combination
    facilitates real-time monitoring of critical factors such as soil conditions,
    crop health, weather patterns, and equipment performance, empowering optimized
    decision-making. The present generation of intelligent agricultural applications,
    relying on a relatively restrained number of wireless sensors, necessitates improved
    accuracy and effectiveness. However, the ongoing development of 6G- communication
    technologies sets the groundwork for the future of intelligent and sustainable
    agriculture [629]. 6G- technology pledges to enable the interconnection of various
    extensive sensors, granting farmers the capacity to gather intricate, plant-specific
    information. This transformative potential fueled by 6G- technology is poised
    to revolutionize SA, ensuring precise data collection, advanced robotics, and
    precision agriculture in remote locations, rendering agriculture significantly
    more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective. G. Block Chain Systems Blockchain
    technology, a decentralized and highly secure digital ledger, plays a crucial
    role in documenting transactions across a network. When integrated with IoT-WSNs,
    it ensures secure and transparent record-keeping within the domain of SA, particularly
    benefiting supply chains, traceability, and transactions. This integration significantly
    strengthens trust and operational efficiency throughout the agricultural ecosystem
    by assuring data integrity and fortifying defense against potential threats. One
    notable application involves countering data manipulation attacks, where crucial
    information about crops with minimal pesticide usage is securely stored within
    the blockchain’s immutable ledger [627], [634], [635]. This advancement ensures
    the integrity and reliability of essential agricultural data, ultimately contributing
    to enhanced decision-making processes. H. Renewable Energy Integration Incorporating
    renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power into IoT-WSNs for agriculture
    is crucial, aiming to establish sustainable and environmentally friendly energy
    solutions for powering devices and systems in remote agricultural regions [63].
    Integrating renewable energy contributes to energy efficiency and environmental
    sustainability within the agricultural landscape. By incorporating energy from
    renewable sources into the IoT-based SA observation systems, sustainability and
    cost-effectiveness are markedly enhanced [637]. Using solar or wind power to energize
    the system diminishes reliance on conventional power sources, consequently reducing
    energy expenses and decreasing carbon emissions. Additionally, the scalability
    of this integrated system makes it viable for adoption by small-scale farmers
    who may lack access to conventional power sources. I. IoT-WSNs and Their Protocols
    in Future SA Applications Areas In recent years, the integration of the IoT has
    led to significant advancements in agriculture, as shown in Table 3. Notably,
    there has been a 2.4% increase in IoT’s growth, currently rising by 1.5%, as shown
    in Figure 4, which has captured substantial attention within the agricultural
    community. Farmers have extensively adopted IoT frameworks throughout the agricultural
    process, particularly in irrigation systems. They are renowned for their precision,
    efficiency, remote monitoring, and data-driven decision-making, as shown in Figure
    5. FIGURE 4. Progression of IoT-WSNs and network protocols in SA systems. Show
    All FIGURE 5. Yearly evolution of research contributions in IoT-WSN within SA
    applications. Show All IoT has notably enhanced agricultural efficiency by linking
    devices, instruments, and stakeholders, reducing labor costs and increasing overall
    productivity. Farmers seek reliable, cost-effective, and power-efficient IoT devices
    seamlessly integrating with WSNs. The landscape of wireless network protocols
    is evolving, witnessing a significant shift towards low-power alternatives such
    as LoRaWAN, outperforming Wi-Fi due to its efficiency, network coverage, and minimal
    power requirements in SA, as shown in Figure 6. FIGURE 6. Research contribution
    distribution in IoT-WSN with their network protocols in SA applications. Show
    All Moreover, SigFox, operating on narrowband technology and offering extensive
    coverage with fewer base stations, remains an area of interest for IoT research
    in agricultural systems. Although its usage has maintained a 1% rate since 2019,
    as shown in Figure 6, SigFox and LoRaWAN, both with low power consumption, differ
    in flexibility. LoRaWAN, due to its greater flexibility, is better suited for
    specific agricultural setups requiring increased control or distinct coverage
    patterns. A detailed analysis of research contributions emphasizes a significant
    focus on irrigation systems, soil monitoring, and energy optimization. Soil monitoring
    saw a slight decrease post-2021, while by the end of 2022, as shown in Figure
    7, there was an increase in fertilizer optimization through IoT, along with applications
    for energy savings and plant pest and disease control in SA. Regarding network
    protocols, the rise of LoRaWAN significantly impacted the dominance of ZigBee
    and Wi-Fi from 2020 to 2022, securing a 35% share over the past five years, as
    shown in Figure 8. This positions LoRaWAN as a promising protocol for efficient
    resource utilization in SA. Simultaneously, Wi-Fi retains its popularity due to
    widespread availability and short-range capabilities. FIGURE 7. Annual research
    contribution rates in SA application areas. Show All FIGURE 8. Annual wireless
    network protocol rates in IoT-WSN research within SA Applications. Show All SECTION
    VIII. Conclusion Integrating IoT with WSNs in SA aims to maximize yield and optimize
    agricultural processes. This comprehensive IoT with WSNs architecture facilitates
    effective monitoring and control of agricultural fields, enabling valuable data
    collection to address current challenges. Wireless communication protocols are
    essential in efficiently transmitting the collected data to the system. Integrating
    WSNs with IoT and wireless network protocols has proven cost-effective and efficient
    in SA applications, minimizing agricultural expenses. Notably, these integrated
    systems exhibit low cost, low power consumption, and enhanced efficiency. This
    survey presents a detailed review of the state-of-the-art IoT technology and the
    deployment of WSNs with wireless network protocols for SA applications since 2019.
    The study extensively explores the architecture of IoT-WSN integration with network
    protocols in the SA domain, shedding light on prominent network protocols such
    as ZigBee, WiFi, SigFox, and LoRaWAN. These protocols have found significant utility
    in IoT-WSNs SA applications, including irrigation systems, soil moisture monitoring,
    fertilizer optimization and control, early-stage pest and crop disease management,
    and energy-saving measures. The study deliberates on current challenges and issues
    in this domain, aiming to provide insights and potential solutions for further
    advancements in integrating IoT-WSNs for the future of SA systems. Authors Figures

    data traffic has increased considerably during the last few years. Assessment
    of recent statistics collected by International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
    indicate that global mobile data traffic is expected to grow to 607 Exabytes (EBs)
    per month by 2025 and 5016 EB by 2030 [1]. The amount of data traffic per subscriber
    is expected to be around 39 EBs by 2025 and about 257 EBs by 2030. Furthermore,
    almost 70% of the population is expected to subscribe to mobile services by 2025.
    Besides this, 60% out of this 70% are estimated to use mobile Internet. The huge
    data traffic demands have been accompanied by increasing requirements for heterogeneous
    services, full coverage, ultra high-speed wireless communications with ultra high
    reliability and ultra low-latency. The main drivers of the dramatic growth in
    data traffic are personal computers (PCs), laptops, tablets, smartphones, sensors
    and Internet of Everything (IoE) devices/applications. These devices are typically
    consuming data capacity (mainly video) rather than voice traffic. In addition
    to this, the number of Internet users, mobile subscribers, machine-to-machine
    (M2M) connections and connected devices worldwide are also expected to considerably
    increase in the next few years. Fig. 1 illustrates the number of Internet connectivity
    in billions, which compares the total number for four different trends namely:,
    Internet users, mobile subscribers, M2M connections, and connected devices between
    2018 and 2023 [2]. As shown in Fig. 1, the number of Internet users is expected
    to be 5.3 billion by 2023. Besides this, the growth in the number of M2M and the
    number of connected devices is expected to be almost doubled by 2023. Fig. 2 compares
    the total number of connected devices in billions, which are given in total in
    Fig. 1, for six different regions between 2018 and 2023 [2]. Notably, the growth
    in the number of connected devices in Asia Pacific countries (APAC) is expected
    to reach 13.5 billion devices. Besides these statistics that show tremendous growth
    in Internet connections, wireless broadband connectivity becomes crucial for transportation
    services, healthcare, infrastructure, and, home and military applications. Therefore,
    the current generation of wireless communication is unlikely to sustain this ongoing
    traffic explosion and the emerging applications. In order to support such massive
    Internet connections with a diverse set of requirements in terms of data rates,
    reliability, latency, intelligence, security and energy efficiency, the next generation
    of wireless communication systems, i.e. sixth-generation (6G) networks, is being
    introduced. However, 6G wireless communications networks will require advanced
    physical layer solutions, new advanced modulation schemes, advanced multi access
    techniques, energy harvesting, edge computing, new spectral bands, integration
    of terrestrial and non-terrestrial communications, cell-free massive MIMO, blockchain
    and quantum technologies and adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning
    techniques. FIGURE 1. Total number of Internet users, mobile subscribers, M2M
    connections and connected devices. Show All FIGURE 2. Number of connected devices
    in billions over six different regions. Show All A. Evolution of Cellular Networks
    from 1G to 6G In order to provide a clear vision of what 6G networks could offer,
    it is essential to give a brief background of the evolution of mobile communications
    networks from the first generation (1G) to the fifth-generation (5G). To date,
    there are five different generations of mobile communications systems, which belong
    to different standards and have different techniques and capabilities (see Table
    1). The period of each mobile generation in Table 1 is predicted based on references
    [3], [4]. Notably, each generation of mobile communications networks has been
    developed roughly every ten years. The evolution from 1G to 6G mobile wireless
    communications networks is shown in Fig. 3. TABLE 1 Key Evolution Indication of
    1G to 5G Mobile Wireless Communications FIGURE 3. The evolution of mobile generation
    from 1G to 6G. Show All 1G was introduced in the 1980s to provide voice services.
    1G networks provided a data rate of 2.4 kbps. However, 1G was developed based
    on analog transmission, and was faced challenges such as low capacity, inconsistent
    delivery and lack of security [5]. To address the issues of 1G, second-generation
    (2G) mobile communications networks based on digital modulation technologies were
    developed in the 1990s. 2G has been used to provide encrypted data services such
    as short message services (SMS) in addition to traditional voice communications
    [6]. The second-generation network was based on the global systems for mobile
    communications (GSM) and provided a data rate of 64 kbps. The 1G and 2G mobile
    communications systems are based on public switched telephone network (PSTN),
    which is considered as a combination of several telephone networks, including
    telephone lines, switching centers, fiber optic networks, cellular networks and
    satellites networks. Around the year 2000, the third generation (3G) of mobile
    communications networks was introduced to support the increasing demands for different
    multi-data services such as video calls and internet surfing. Therefore, various
    technologies such as wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA), CDMA2000,
    unpaired spectrum based on time-division synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA) with time
    division duplex (TDD) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX)
    have been used in 3G networks [7]. 3G networks provided a data rate up to 2 Mb/s
    [8], which is achieved using high-speed packet access (HSPA) technology. In 2009,
    the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communication, which represents the long-term
    evolution (LTE) network, was launched. LTE networks support both paired and unpaired
    spectra, i.e., operate in both the time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division
    duplex (FDD) modes. Different technologies such as orthogonal frequency division
    multiplexing (OFDM), coordinated multiple transmission/reception (CoMP), and multiple-input
    and multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been used in LTE networks. These technologies
    have been developed to enable a wider transmission bandwidth, to achieve a high
    data rate, and to allow wider mobile broadband connections. LTE mobile communication
    system was extended to LTE-Advanced network in 2011, which allows the operation
    in unlicensed spectrum. 4G LTE network with a 2×2 MIMO provides a maximum data
    rate up to 150 Mb/s while LTE-Advanced networks are able to achieve a maximum
    data rate of up to 1 Gb/s using a 4×4 MIMO system over a 100 MHz aggregated bandwidth
    [9]. Currently, 5G network is becoming a commercial reality. 5G network can support
    wide area network (WAN) bands in addition to radios for wireless local area network
    (LAN) and personal area network (PAN). 5G network has the potential to aggregate
    spectral, support high-definition (HD) video streaming and several data-hungry
    applications. Also, 5G network has the ability to achieve faster throughput than
    the LTE-A system with a maximum data rate of about 20 Gb/s. Furthermore, an advanced
    multiple access technology termed as beam division multiple access (BDMA) can
    be exploited in 5G network to increase the system capacity. In this multiplexing
    technique, an orthogonal beam can be allocated to the users according to their
    locations [10]. Recent advancements in smart devices and applications have promoted
    the proliferation of IoE networks. IoE networks involve autonomous and flying
    vehicles, healthcare applications, intelligent services, and other delay-sensitive
    applications. Such IoE networks would require ubiquitous sensing and computing
    capabilities that may exceed the capability of 5G networks. Furthermore, the data
    rate that can be supported by 5G networks is unlikely to sustain the enormous
    ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to
    advance the existing wireless systems in order to meet the emerging IoE applications
    and services. Therefore, the research now shifted to 6G wireless communications
    networks. Unlike previous networks, future 6G wireless communications systems
    are expected to support IoE applications and services. 6G supports the integration
    between different networks, e.g., terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. For
    example, 6G supports satellite communication to increase connectivity and provide
    full coverage. To enable efficient integration between different networks, 6G
    will make use of network slicing and multi-access edge computing with software
    defined networks. In comparison with previous networks, 6G is expected to fully
    utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). 6G networks are
    expected to utilize ultra-high frequencies such as the use of millimeter wave
    (mmWave) and THz frequencies. The autonomous vehicle is expected to be fully supported
    by 6G. An extreme densification of the network infrastructure is expected to be
    deployed by the 6G networks. While the main focus on 5G was given to the massive
    MIMO technology, the reconfigurable intelligent reflecting surfaces will be the
    main core transmission technique for 6G networks. Unlike previous networks, 6G
    aims to fully support the Tactile Internet communication, which needs less than
    1 ms delay for being able to perform light surgeries. To sum up, the future vision
    of 6G wireless communications networks lies in: (a) achieving high data rate/spectral
    efficiency particularly by moving to higher frequency bands; (b) providing an
    energy efficiency of 10x higher than 5G networks for green communication; (c)
    increasing the connectivity and providing full coverage; (d) maintaining security,
    secrecy and privacy; (e) achieving an ultra-high-reliable and low-latency communication;
    (f) supporting an externally high mobility of up to 1000 km per hour; and finally
    (g) realizing intelligence. Further details about the 6G vision are provided in
    the following subsection. B. 6G Vision 6G networks are visioned to further enhance
    the conventional wireless communications systems, improve the quality of services,
    and support the huge data traffic demands. 6G networks aim to maximize the data
    rates, reduce energy consumption, enhance broadband connectivity and coverage,
    improve communication security and trustworthiness, increase link reliability,
    reduce latency, and achieve intelligent communication. An extremely high data
    rate of above 100 Gbps with an end to end delay of less than 1ms may be supported
    by 6G. 6G is also expected to meet the extremely high levels of communication
    reliability. Furthermore, we expect to move to an ultra era with future 6G networks.
    6G networks are expected to support wireless communications with ultra-low latency
    and ultra-high reliability. Future 6G networks also aim to support ultra-fast
    mobility. In order to support an ultra-high-speed wireless data transmission,
    ultra large scale MIMO systems and ultra-high frequencies are expected to be used
    by 6G networks. Besides this, 6G networks aim to provide an ultra-high broadband
    connectivity and support an ultra high definition video streaming. Fig. 4 shows
    a schematic diagram of moving toward an ultra era in the future 6G networks. FIGURE
    4. A diagram shows the ultra era in 6G networks. Show All The 6G requirements
    can be achieved through the use of new advance and intelligent communications
    techniques. For example, the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, extra-large
    MIMO, new spectrum, holographic radio communications, full-duplex wireless communications,
    multiple access and modulation, are all essential techniques required for maximizing
    the data rates. In addition, energy harvesting and backscatter communication techniques
    are both useful and required to improve energy efficiency. Cell-free massive MIMO
    systems and the integration between terrestrial and non-terrestrial communications
    are effective techniques to increase connectivity and provide full coverage. Quantum
    communication and blockchain are effective techniques to increase communication
    security, secrecy and privacy. Holographic teleportation (telepresence) and edge
    computing are useful techniques for achieving an ultra-reliable and low-latency
    communication. Finally, artificial intelligence and machine learning are essential
    techniques for realizing intelligence. 6G aims to provide seamless integration
    of different wireless networks. This includes the integration of terrestrial and
    other non-terrestrial wireless networks that are airborne, underwater, and that
    employ satellite communications systems. Having such seamless networks integration
    allows a useful communication platform and provides high broadband connectivity
    with full coverage. Unlike previous networks, 6G wireless communications networks
    are expected to support many delay-sensitive applications such as Tactile Internet,
    holographic teleportation (telepresence), Internet of Smart Things (IoST) and

    reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR). IoST applications can be divided into
    smart city, smart radio environments, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation,
    smart factories, smart farming and, smart home. All these smart applications are
    expected to be fully supported by 6G wireless communications networks. C. Related

    Data Rate/Spectral Efficiency Maximizing the data rate is considered the most
    important performance indicator for any cellular technology. The following subsections
    discuss the key fundamental technologies to improve the data rate for future 6G
    networks. A. Multiple Antenna Technology Multiple antenna technology which benefits
    from beamforming, diversity, and spatial multiplexing gains, has attracted significant
    research interest due to its powerful capability to increase the data rate and
    communication reliability [43]. The research studies on multiple antenna technologies
    initially focused on point-to-point (single-user) MIMO communications where the
    transceiver has multiple antennas to communicate with each other. Later, the focus
    shifted to multiuser MIMO systems, which quickly made their way in many communications
    standards such as IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), LTE and, LTE-A [44].
    Unlike point-to-point MIMO, in multiuser MIMO systems, the spatial multiplexing
    of different data streams intended for different users can be achieved in the
    spatial domain through a transmission technique known as spatial division multiple
    access (SDMA) [45]. Recently a scaled-up version of the SDMA systems, i.e., large-scale
    multiuser MIMO, was proposed in [46], wherein each transmit base station (BS)
    is equipped with a relatively large number of transmit antenna elements N , which
    serve a much smaller number of K single-antenna non-cooperative users. Table 3
    summarizes the key differences between the point-to-point MIMO and massive MIMO
    communications systems. TABLE 3 Comparison Between Conventional MIMO and Massive
    MIMO Systems 1) Key Points of Using Large Number of Antenna Elements When a large
    number of antenna elements are deployed by the transmit BS, the array gain and
    the degrees of freedom that the propagation channel offers can be significantly
    increased. The favorable propagation condition can also be achieved in massive
    MIMO systems with rich scattering environment, wherein the channel vectors for
    users become asymptotically orthogonal as the number of BS antennas N grows large
    while the number of users remains limited. The consequence is that the effect
    of uncorrelated noise, fast fading, and jamming signals can be asymptotically
    mitigated [46]. In addition, massive MIMO allows the use of low-complexity signal
    processing techniques in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions [47]. For
    example, in the DL, linear precoding schemes can be used to focus the transmitted
    signal onto the desired users, whereas in the UL, linear combining techniques
    can be exploited to combine the signals transmitted from different users. In massive
    MIMO systems, the energy transmitted from the BS can be focused into spatial directions
    where the users are located. Hence, the radiated power from each element can be
    reduced, thereby making the massive MIMO systems more energy-efficient [48]. These
    key advantages promote massive MIMO to be the core technology for the future generation
    of wireless communications systems [49], [50]. Furthermore, a massive MIMO system
    is not only the core technology in mobile broadband services but also can be efficiently
    exploited in other communication and non-communication applications. For example,
    massive MIMO can be used in radio detection, ranging (radar), sensors and massive
    machine-type communications systems, which require low-energy consumption [50].
    Among these essential applications, the joint use of radar and MIMO communication
    has received significant research attention during recent years [50], [51]. Joint
    radar and MIMO communication has several advantages such as (a) enhancing spectrum
    sharing; (b) allowing the use of low-cost hardware components; (c) improving the
    number of targets that can be uniquely detected; (d) achieving high spatial signal
    resolution; (e) reducing the power consumption; and (f) improving interference
    rejection capabilities to allow superior performance [50], [52]–[56]. Several
    research contributions in massive MIMO have been made during the past few years.
    These include providing achievable sum rate analysis [48], [57], [58], addressing
    pilot contamination issue [59]–[64], investigating the role of correlation in
    the massive MIMO systems [65], investigating the energy efficiency and power optimization
    [66]–[68], enabling FDD operation in massive MIMO systems with two-stage precoding
    [69], [70], and in signal-stage precoding [71]–[74]. An extra large scale massive
    MIMO system (XL-massive MIMO), also known as ultra-massive MIMO, was recently
    proposed in [75], [76] to extend the benefit of massive MIMO to high-frequency
    bands and in order to make wireless connectivity with ultra-high data rates available
    anytime and anywhere. The XL-massive MIMO aims to considerably increase the signal
    strength by steering and focusing the transmitted beams in space and frequency
    domains, where an array size of 1024×1024 is expected to be implemented with plasmonic
    nano-antennas [77]. XL-massive MIMO can be deployed in a distributed areas in
    order to serve a large number of users and to increase communication coverage.
    These areas include the walls of buildings, airports, the structure of stadiums,
    and shopping malls [78], [79]. 2) Related Challenges and Future Research Directions
    From the point of view of information theory, which is considered as the abstract
    mathematical theory that guides the design and implementation of communication
    systems, the performance of multiple antennas systems depends strongly on the
    accuracy of channel state information (CSI) estimation. While CSI estimation may
    not be problematic in TDD mode, which relies on UL/DL channel reciprocity, it
    is of critical importance to most of current mobile networks providers that operate
    in the FDD mode. In addition to this, 6G networks are expected to operate in high
    mobility environments and high carrier frequencies, and thus, the channel would
    exhibit a shorter coherence time. Therefore, finding a feasible design that copes
    with the high-speeds and high frequencies environments is crucial. Furthermore,
    an opportunistic and low-complexity scheduling procedure with multiple antennas
    systems is required to alleviate the need for computationally expensive exhaustive
    users search whose complexity grows exponentially with the user group size [43].
    Furthermore, research investigation to address the technical challenges related
    to the optimum beam selection and reducing the CSI feedback overhead is also required.
    To achieve this purpose, different CSI feedback compression schemes can be exploited
    to reduce the CSI overhead, examples of which are discussed in references [80]–[85].
    Another challenge related to the use of large antenna arrays is the non-wide sense
    stationary properties that may appear along with the array. This implies that
    different parts of the arrays may have different propagation environments, or
    they exhibit the same channel paths with different power levels [86]. As such,
    new channel models that capture these propagation effects are required. In addition
    to this, using large antenna arrays might practically increase the computational
    complexity, cost of hardware design and power consumption [87], [88]. Hence, finding
    a feasible solution that considers the aforementioned issue remains a challenge.
    The application of large scale MIMO with a radar system could also bring new technical
    challenges. Besides this, advanced signal processing algorithms for detection
    and estimation are needed. In such a large scale MIMO system, the overhead would
    be scaled linearly with the number of BS antennas. Therefore, finding a feasible
    and robust design that takes into account the antenna array configurations and
    system overhead with limited coherence time is required [50]. Finally, in 6G networks,
    we expect to see many different applications that drive the demands for utilizing
    more compact antennas, more frequency bands and more bandwidth. For example, in
    addition to the information theory, circuit, wave and electromagnetic theories
    will also be involved in the design of future communications systems. B. Reconfigurable
    Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Moving to higher frequency bands in 6G comes with
    new challenges such as reducing the coverage area due to the shorter range communications,
    lessening the number of degrees of freedom offered by the physical channel due
    to reducing the number of scattering objects, and increasing the signal attenuation
    that effects the communication reliability between transmitter and receiver. In
    addition, due to the massive connectivity of IoT devices and sensors, wireless
    networks are moving to software implementations, an example of which is software
    defined networks (SDNs). Hence, wireless networks can be controlled remotely through
    the use of programmable software. Furthermore, there is an essential requirement
    to find flexible, feasible and cost-effective solutions for increasing the coverage
    area, improving the communication reliability and maximizing spectral and energy
    efficiencies of future 6G networks. To this end, a smart reconfigurable transmission
    mechanism known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) [89], also termed
    as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) [90], [91] or large intelligent surfaces
    (LISs) [92], has appeared as one of the most promising technologies to achieve
    the aforementioned goals. Such intelligent surfaces are designed based on software-controlled
    metasurfaces [93], [94]. The reflective metasurface is a low thickness two-dimensional
    planar surface, which has the potential to control the characteristic of electromagnetic
    propagation waves in order to shape waveforms, create a passive beam towards the
    desired terminal and achieve an enhanced received signal [89], [90], [94]–[97].
    The configurable electromagnetic material contains integrated electronic circuits
    on a planar surface and programmable software, which controls the propagation
    environment. Each surface contains a massive number of low-cost scattering passive
    elements that have the potential to independently reflect the incident signals
    toward the desired users by digitally controlling their adjustable amplitude and
    phase shifts [89], [95], [98]. It should be pointed out that the amplitude and
    phase shifts can be optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency or minimize
    power consumption [99]. 1) Key Points of the IRSs IRSs can be more energy efficient
    in comparison to conventional wireless transmission technologies. This is because
    IRSs do not require power amplifiers, radio-frequency (RF) chains, sophisticated
    signal processing, and interference management schemes. IRSs can be practically
    fabricated with low-cost [100]. IRSs can be densely deployed indoors, on walls/ceilings,
    in exhibition halls, and outdoors on arbitrarily shaped surfaces, buildings, roads,
    walls, shopping malls, airports, etc. [89], [101]. This wide area deployment increases
    the network’s coverage especially in places where multipath propagation is insufficient
    [97]. IRSs can be useful to communications systems with high frequencies bands
    such as mmWaves and THz. This is because high frequencies bands are considered
    to be highly sensitive to different propagation conditions. IRSs have the ability
    to provide further improvement in the degrees of freedom of the wireless communications
    channels, especially when the line-of-sight (LoS) path is not available. IRSs
    can also be efficiently powered by renewable energy sources, which are energy
    efficient, and can also be used with wireless power transfer and mobile edge computing
    to support dense IoT devices, multicell networks, and in cognitive radio communications
    [94], [97]. Several studies have investigated the performance of IRSs aided smart
    radio communications. For example, the works in [102], [103] consider the use
    of IRSs to enhance the propagating signal attenuation in the simultaneous wireless
    information and power transfer (SWIPT) based systems, thereby allowing the receivers
    to harvest enough energy. The work in [104] suggests the application of IRSs in
    mobile edge computing to improve communication reliability and increase the offloading
    time. It is worth noting that mobile edge computing is considered a newly emerged
    edge computing paradigm to support computationally intensive IoT applications
    on mobile devices [105]. Subsection VI-E provides further discussion about the
    mobile edge computing technique. The work in [106] discusses the application of
    IRSs in cell-edge of multicell networks to enhance the desired signal transmitted
    from the serving BS and mitigate the interference signals coming from other BSs.
    Besides the aforementioned research studies, another line of research study has
    focused on using IRSs with cognitive radio networks. For example, the work in
    [107] investigates the application of IRSs to improve the propagation channel
    condition, and thus, enhance the signal power between transmitter and receiver
    of the secondary users, which reuse the spectrum of the primary users. The work
    in [108] presents a scenario where the IRSs are used in the physical layer security
    to enhance the system security. IRSs have been explored to mitigate the information
    leakage to the eavesdroppers while enhancing the received signal power at the
    legitimate users. Several studies have considered the application of IRSs with
    non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology to address the challenges of
    random fluctuation in propagation environments and blocking, see e.g., [109]–[112]
    and references therein. The works in [113]–[115] investigate the application of
    IRSs in UAVs networks to enhance the communication coverage and improve the quality
    of service. 2) Related Challenges and Future Research Directions The performance
    of IRSs depends on the availability of accurate CSI, which is required to enable
    efficient precoding design. Also, the availability of accurate CSI would allow
    the IRSs to increase their beam focusing capabilities and to adapt transmissions
    to current channel conditions, and thus, the received SINR can be maximized. However,
    CSI estimation in RISs is considered to be challenging in comparison to conventional
    wireless communication systems. This is attributed to the large channel dimension
    and the large number of reflecting elements. Therefore, there is an essential
    need to develop suitable channel estimation algorithms to support efficient IRSs
    transmission. In addition, obtaining the CSI with FDD is more challenging than
    TDD systems since the former is subject to high feedback overhead. Hence, finding
    a feasible solution for CSI estimation and feedback with FDD protocol is needed
    [116]. Besides this, a smart remote controlling mechanism to manipulate the amplitude
    and phase of the signals in the IRSs might be challenging. As such, in order to
    achieve the full potential gain of the IRSs, an efficient controlling scheme is
    required. Since the interest has been growing in exploiting high-frequency bands,
    particularly mmWave and THz bands, the application of IRSs in such frequency bands
    is worthy of investigation. Studying the role of IRSs in mitigating the electromagnetic
    interference waves in sensitive propagation applications such as medical imaging
    and radar technology is also of interest [94]. Furthermore, since IRSs can be
    useful to support cellular networks, it is of particular interest to investigate
    the performance of IRSs in high mobility environments. C. Holographic Radio Communications
    Holographic radio communication, also known as holographic MIMO surfaces or holographic
    beamforming, is a special form of IRSs communication, discussed in the previous
    subsection, which can be used to shape/steer electromagnetic waves dynamically
    according to the desired directions [117]. This dynamic beamforming can be achieved
    using low-cost software-defined electromagnetic wave modulators and with circuit
    power consumption [100]. IRSs can be seen as passive surfaces, which can only
    reflect impinging radio-frequency signals generated from ambient transmitters,
    while holographic MIMO can be exploited for large active surfaces [92], [118].
    It is worth noting that the holographic MIMO is different from standard holographic
    teleportation, which will be discussed later in subsection VI-A. Holographic MIMO
    combines both communication theory and electromagnetic theory [117]. Holographic
    MIMO represents an array with a massive (uncountable) number of antennas that
    compact into a limited space/surface to allow an approximately spatially-continuous
    electromagnetic transceiver aperture [50]. The surface either actively conveys
    beamformed radio-frequency signals or manages its reflections of radio-frequency
    signals generated at other locations [50]. 1) Key Points of Holographic Communications
    Holographic MIMO has the capability to control the entire physical space [36].
    Owing to the approximately continuous electromagnetic aperture, holographic MIMO
    can achieve ultra-high density and ultra-high spatial resolution in wireless communications
    systems [50]. It would also allow electromagnetic waves with arbitrary spatial
    frequency components to be produced and detected without side-lobes [50]. Owing
    to the extreme spatial resolution, holographic MIMO aims at achieving a remarkable
    reduction in power consumption and a significant improvement in spatial multiplexing
    [92], [117]. Holographic MIMO can form super-narrow beams, which can be used to
    overcome the severe propagation loss for the mmWave and THz bands and reduce interference
    [119]. Holographic MIMO combines imaging and wireless communication system and
    has the potential to improve spectrum efficiency and network capacity. 2) Related
    Challenges and Future Research Directions To achieve the full potential of the
    holographic MIMO system, further research is needed. For example, developing accurate
    channel modeling and channel estimation techniques that explore the spatial correlation
    structure are required. Further, finding feasible pilot designs with short coherence
    time using fully digital or hybrid analog and digital beamforming architectures
    for holographic MIMO systems are essential [117]. Besides, new signal processing
    algorithms and networking techniques for realizing holographic MIMO system are
    crucial. Developing feasible protocols and algorithms for fast reconfiguration
    of the reflection electromagnetic signals are also needed [50]. Finally, optimal
    resource allocation mechanisms and low-complexly users scheduling schemes for
    holographic MIMO system are worth investigating in the future. D. New Spectrum
    Usage and Radio Design Paradigms The number of connected devices to the Internet
    has rapidly increased during the past few years, which results in significant
    growth in data traffic. In addition, there is an ever-increasing demand for higher
    data rates to support bandwidth-hungry applications driven by the IoT. Thus, there
    could be a significant network capacity shortfall in the near future. This has
    motivated the researchers to efficiently exploit the currently available spectrum,
    i.e., below 10 GHz, and move to higher operational frequency bands, i.e., mmWave
    and THz. Furthermore, to support a diverse set of IoT requirements, the coexistence
    of different frequency bands within the same system would be inevitably required.
    This will not only achieve spectrum relief to the currently crowded radio-frequency
    network but will also make wireless communication more energy efficient and less
    sensitive to interference. Also, utilizing higher frequency bands is extremely
    useful for future 6G networks and presents an opportunity to achieve high-speed
    peak data rates, communication reliability, and ultra-low latency. Besides, 6G
    networks are expected to achieve a joint wireless communication interface by making
    use of the existing sub-10 GHz bands technologies with higher bands and guarantee
    seamless handover between these different frequency bands [97]. However, moving
    from sub-10 GHz band to higher bands with fully digital precoding will introduce
    several challenges in terms of hardware design and implementation, and hence might
    require significant changes in the physical layer design [120]. 1) Millimeter-Wave
    (mmWave) Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications are useful for future 6G networks
    to meet the ever-growing demands for extremely high-speed data rate wireless access
    [121]. This is due to the huge available bandwidth in mmWave bands that can potentially
    be exploited in mobile broadband applications to achieve peak data rates of multiple
    gigabit-per-second (Gbit/s) for indoor and fixed outdoor wireless systems [121]–[125].
    A large spectrum is included in mmWave frequencies. This spectrum ranges from
    30 to 300 GHz, which corresponds to wavelength from 10 mm to 1 mm [126]. Hence,
    multiple gigahertz frequencies can be fully supported to offer an order of magnitude
    capacity improvement for future 6G networks. In addition, owing to larger bandwidth,
    mmWave communications can be useful for delay-sensitive applications [123]. MmWave
    communications have already been considered in IEEE standard (IEEE 802.11ad [127])
    for short-range stationary scenarios and deployed for indoor applications such
    as small-cell backhaul [128]. a: Key Points of mmWave Communications MmWave communications
    are essential for cellular heterogeneous networks [129], [130] to increase the
    data rate. Besides, mmWave can be efficiently used to support automated vehicular
    communication, which would allow the vehicles with high speed to exchange information
    seamlessly [131], [132]. MmWave communication also has the potential to support
    self wireless backhaul in cellular networks [133]. Experimental results in [134]
    demonstrate that mmWave has the potential to support both outdoor and indoor communications.
    The results show that a data rate of about 500 Mb/s can be achieved in non-line-of-sight
    (NLoS) environments and with a mobility of 8 km/h. MmWave can be used with the
    existing microwave frequencies in cellular communications. In this context, the
    work in [135] proposes a way of using microwave frequencies to send control information
    and mmWave frequencies to convey payload data transmission. mmWave communication
    has the potential to support high-speed data rate for different wireless devices
    such as smartphones, smartwatches and augmented & virtual realities [136], [137].
    However, communication at mmWave frequencies suffers from specific propagation
    behaviors such as high signal attenuation and absorption as well as high penetration
    loss. MmWave signals are subject to orders-of-magnitude increase in path loss
    in comparison to the microwave signals, which are currently used in most cellular
    systems [138]. However, the short-wavelength range in mmWave communications allows
    the deployment of small-sized arrays with a large number of antenna elements that
    can be contained in a small physical dimension. Therefore, using a large number
    of antenna arrays can achieve a sufficient beamforming gain that is required to
    overcome the path loss and allow spatial multiplexing of several data streams
    to further improve the spectral efficiency [138]. Besides that, large beamforming
    gain provided by mmWave communications has the potential to improve the link quality,
    extend coverage and reduce interference [139]. The work in [134] demonstrates
    that using large antenna arrays with mmWave is useful to overcome the high path
    loss in cellular systems. However, there are fundamental differences between using
    large antenna arrays in the conventional microwave frequency and mmWave frequency
    in terms of the propagation channels, hardware design and signal processing algorithms
    [140]. For example, the existing hardware architecture supports full digital base
    band beamforming at microwave frequency, which directly controls the phase and
    amplitude of signals and allows flexible transmission [140]. However, the joint
    use of analog and digital beamforming is preferable at mmWave frequency to overcome
    the radio-frequency hardware limitations [138], [141]. It is worth noting that
    analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in mmWave systems could be expensive and energy
    inefficient in comparison to microwave systems [129]. Typically, large base station
    antenna elements can be easily implemented using fully digital arrays, but the
    implementation complexity may grow larger with mmWave frequency [140]. Besides,
    a separate radio-frequency chain for each antenna may be required with mmWave
    system [129]. In addition, jointly using both analog and digital beamforming in
    mmWave communication would reduce the multiplexing capability of serving multiple
    users simultaneously over the same time and frequency, and hence, reduce the spectral
    efficiency in comparison to full digital beamforming [140]. Therefore, whether
    mmWave with large antenna arrays will be implemented with full digital or hybrid
    beamforming remains an open research question [140]. NOMA technique can be combined
    with mmWave frequencies to improve the data rates, achieve simultaneous multi-user
    communications and reduce interference [121], [142]–[146]. Furthermore, UAVs communication
    can benefit significantly from mmWave frequency to provide high data rates for
    6G networks [147], [148]. MmWave can be used for radar applications to perform
    joint radar communications, which make use of high signal range resolution achieved
    by large bandwidths and radar functionalities [56]. b: Related Challenges and
    Future Research Directions Despite the promising results of mmWave communication
    system when it comes to providing multiple Gbps rates and allowing significant
    spectrum relief, several technical challenges still exist, which need to be addressed
    in order to make mmWave communication feasible for future networks [121]. Besides,
    finding viable approaches for applying mmWave in high mobility environments, improving
    the communication coverage and mitigating hardware impairments are valid research
    challenges worth investigating. Further research to overcome the sensitivity of
    mmWave communication to blockages and atmospheric loss is also needed. From a
    signal processing point of view, the performance of mmWave communication system
    depends strongly on radio frequency hardware [126]. Therefore, to achieve the
    full potential gain of mmWave communication, several research challenges relating
    to signal processing need to be addressed. Besides, further investigation is required
    to find robust designs for higher layers, i.e., transport, routing and medium
    access control (MAC) [149]. In addition, due to the specific propagation behaviors
    of mmWave system and hardware characteristics, new design aspects related to network
    coordination, resource allocation, user scheduling and network planning are required.
    Furthermore, there are some technical challenges related to the implementation
    of mmWave in vehicular communication systems. For example, finding feasible channel
    models and viable approaches for beam training, tracking and alignment for mmWave
    vehicular communication systems are needed [131], [149]–[152]. Further investigation
    regarding the coexistence between mmWave and the state-of-the-art microwave technologies
    in heterogeneous cellular networks is also of interest. The application of artificial
    intelligence and machine learning approaches in mmWave systems is an interesting
    research topic that should be investigated. The application of IRS technology
    using mmWave frequency could be a promising solution to the blockage issue and
    to improve the coverage of mmWave signals [153]. Further investigation in this
    context is also required. To overcome the limitation of short communication distance
    in mmWave systems, cellular networks operating at mmWave frequencies will likely
    require to be considerably denser than the currently deployed microwave networks.
    Hence, mmWave cellular networks will likely experience undesired interference
    due to the dense deployment of a large number of access points. Therefore, finding
    feasible interference management approaches in the mmWave communication systems
    are needed [154]. 2) Terahertz (THz) Communications THz communication is envisioned
    as a key enabler for 6G networks due to its capability to achieve ultra-high-speed
    data rates (up to 1 Terabit-per-second (Tbps)) and support bandwidth-intensive
    applications [155]–[159]. THz communication has the potential to alleviate the
    spectrum scarcity of current wireless communications systems [160], [161]. THz
    communication explores the frequency spectrum bands between (0.1-10 THz) and the
    corresponding wavelengths range between (0.03 mm-3 mm) [162]–[164]. THz frequency
    band is located between mmWave and infrared (IR) bands [165]. a: Key Points of
    THz Communications THz communication has the potential to offer more bandwidth
    than the mmWave frequency and provide an enhanced propagation condition in comparison
    to the IR band. Operating at higher frequency ranges, which are provided by the
    THz communications, can be efficiently exploited to support various remote sensing
    applications for 6G network [166]. In addition, THz communications can effectively
    support traditional macro-scale and future emerging micro-scale applications,
    which include the Internet of NanoThings (IoNT) and the Internet of BioNanoThings
    (IoBT) [155]. Recently, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has considered
    the spectrum frequencies between 95 GHz to 3 THz to be used for future 6G research
    [4]. THz frequency has been considered in IEEE standards (IEEE 802.15 IG- THz
    and IEEE 802.15.3d-2017) for short-range communications. THz can be used to enable
    holographic teleportation, which requires data rates of approximately 5 Tbps and
    microsecond-range latency of less than 1ms [155], [167]. Communication at THz
    frequencies would necessitate the use of tiny cells where the radius of such cells
    could be a few tens of meters [36]. In addition, due to the higher carrier frequency
    and shorter wavelength, THz communication might make use of ultra massive antenna
    arrays to allow efficient beamforming [168], [169]. Therefore, hundreds of narrow
    beams can be generated by ultra massive antenna arrays, which are efficient in
    increasing the signal strength, improving the data rates and reducing the interference
    [155]. Although fully digital beamforming is still perdurable and optimum choice,
    hybrid or analog beamforming could be used with THz and ultra massive antenna
    arrays communication in 6G networks [97], [170]. THz can also be integrated with
    other wireless communications systems to form flexible hybrid networks [163].
    For example, a hybrid between THz and a free-space-optical system and a hybrid
    between THz and VLC system can be used in future 6G networks to achieve robust
    communication solutions. Furthermore, THz can be used with IRSs to provide NLOS
    propagation and improve communication coverage [116], [171], [172]. THz frequencies
    can also be explored in healthcare applications such as terahertz pulse imaging
    in dermatology, pharmaceutical industry [173] and other new cognition and sensing
    IoT communications, which could be exploited by automated machinery and autonomous
    vehicles [158]. The spatial modulation technique can be used with THz communication
    to achieve sufficient spatial degrees of freedom for spatial multiplexing [169].
    THz communications can be used in D2D, drone, and vehicular communications and
    also as an alternative to wired-backbone-connectivity in data centers [174]. b:
    Related Challenges and Future Research Directions Although THz communication provides
    abundant bandwidth and presents a special opportunity for supporting multi-gigabit-per-second
    towards Terabit-per-second links, it suffers from unique challenges. These challenges
    are related to strong atmospheric attenuation, propagation path loss, blockage
    effects and molecular absorption [116], [162], [175]. Therefore, these technical
    challenges need to be addressed to release efficient THz wireless communications
    in practice. Further, Increasing the communication range of THz and finding feasible
    beams steering and tracking algorithms are necessary to establish successive THz
    communications systems [156], [162], [176]. Since the cell sizes of THz communications
    are expected to be tiny, new architectural designs for such denser deployment
    cells and efficient backhaul connectivity are required. Also, further research
    related to channel modeling, channel coding, modulation techniques, channel estimation,
    signal processing algorithms, transceiver designs, propagation measurements, networking,
    resource allocation for THz band communications are required. Investigating the
    coexistence of the THz band with other frequency bands such as mmWave and microwave
    is an interesting research topic that should be investigated in the future. Some
    related research work in this context can be found in [163]. The Doppler effect
    is another technical challenge that may face THz broadband communications. Hence,
    new mobility management approaches for THz band communications are needed. Furthermore,
    there are also some technical challenges with THz frequencies deployment. These
    challenges are related to hardware constraints and the speed of data converters.
    Besides, developing new transceiver designs that are adequate to THz frequencies
    operation are required [36], [157]. Finally, finding power-efficient solutions
    and reducing the computational complexity of THz communication are still open
    research directions that should be investigated in the future [158]. 3) Optical
    Wireless Communication Beyond the THz communication, optical wireless communication
    (OWC) systems, which include infrared (IR), visible and ultraviolet frequency
    bands [177], are considered as an efficient way to explore the available electromagnetic
    spectrum to provide more broadband connectivity and coverage for 6G networks [178].
    Due to the availability of extremely wide ranges of the unlicensed and safe spectrum,
    OWC has the potential to overcome the spectrum shortage challenges in RF-based
    wireless communications [179]. The exploration of such huge bandwidth in OWC would
    support a wide range of IoT connectivity and applications. These applications
    include hospitals, large shopping malls, stadiums, homes and offices, public transportation
    stations, e.g., railway stations and airports, industries, underwater communications
    and space communications [178]. Using OWC in telecommunication can be useful since
    it provides high-speed data rates, cost efferent infrastructure, secure communications
    and supper low latency, hence, acting as a complementary efficient technique for
    existing RF-based wireless communications to fulfill the potential requirements
    of 6G networks [180]. The performance of OWC systems can be affected by ambient
    light noise [181]–[184], atmospheric turbulence & path loss in outdoor scenarios
    [185]–[189] and pointing errors [190]–[193]. Several technologies are involved
    in OWC systems include visible light communication (VLC), light fidelity (LiFi),
    free-space optical (FSO) communication, LiDAR and optical camera communication
    (OCC). Each one of these communication technologies has its unique operation principle
    (such as transmission, receiving, modulation), advantages and challenges. Fig.
    9 provides OWC types. In what follows, we provide a description of OWC communication
    technologies. FIGURE 9. Optical wireless communication types. Show All a: Visible
    Light Communication Visible light communication (VLC) is a special form of OWC
    that uses the visible part of the spectrum for wireless transmission of information
    [97], [194]. VLC has been introduced as a key promising technology for 6G networks
    due to its capability to combine lighting and high-speed wireless communication
    in a single source, i.e., power-efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and to
    complement the existing RF networks [194], [195]. In VLC systems, LEDs are used
    at the transmitter to transfer high-speed data rates, where the data is wirelessly
    transmitted using intensity modulation (IM) technique [119], [195], [196]. VLC
    uses photodiode (PD) or laser diodes (LDs) and direct detection (DD) technique,
    which has the potential to convert the received light intensity to a useful signal
    at the receiver [195], [196]. Spatial modulation [197] and wavelength division
    multiplexing (WDM) [198]–[200] techniques can be useful to enhance the preference
    of VLC communication. VLC is included in IEEE 802.15.7 standard [201]. Key points
    of VLC VLC has the potential to provide a fast data rate while maintaining energy
    consumption. Since VLC uses LED lights, it is considered to be a low-complexity
    and cost-efficient communication technique in comparison to radio-frequency communication.
    In addition, VLC is able to achieve a higher speed data rate with lower latency
    in comparison with the conventional radio-frequency networks. Owing to the directional
    property of visible light, VLC communication has the potential to provide relative
    positioning with sub-meter accuracy. Due to the short-range communication, the
    VLC technique is considered to be more secure in comparison to conventional radio-frequency
    communication. VLC provides high immunity against unauthorized eavesdropping or
    attack signals that are transmitted or received from out of coverage sight. Besides,
    VLC is considered a promising technology to complement classical encryption techniques
    [4], which could be applied to address the key security challenges in 6G networks.
    VLC offers high degrees of immunity against electromagnetic radiation interference
    [194], [202], [203]. VLC technology has the potential to support diverse IoT applications
    for the future 6G networks, which include smart buildings, smart homes, smart
    grids, smart cities, smart factories and smart transportation. Integrating VLC
    and IoT would release a new concept called the Internet of Light Things (IoLT)
    [204]. In IoLT, VLC can be considered as one of the key sources to supply and
    convey wireless communication and also to enable energy harvesting. VLC technology
    can be applied in the smart indoor network including home/office environments.
    Hence, VLC would bring both lighting and wireless communication for home and office
    environments, which would provide relief to the RF spectrum bands. VLC can also
    be used to transmit useful data in large shopping malls and supermarkets. VLC
    can be applied with an RF system to form a hybrid RF/VLC wireless communication,
    which would allow highly energy-efficient communication and enhance the user experience.
    Specifically, VLC can be flexibly integrated with the current RF networks to support
    high connectivity and coverage. For example, VLC could extend the RF signals coverage
    in order to cover blind spots, such as in tunnels and subways [24], [25], [205].
    A possible application of VLC outdoors could be in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and
    vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, which could be used in traffic
    offloading, providing useful information about road works and accidents. VLC has
    the potential to allow underwater communication at a longer distance in comparison
    to the RF electromagnetic waves, which are considered to be highly absorbed in
    the water. Related challenges and future research directions Further investigation
    about VLC is still needed. For example, developing an accurate channel modeling
    for VLC is an interesting research topic that can be investigated in the future.
    In addition, developing fast switching mechanisms between optical and radio-frequency
    systems is required. Since VLC relies on intensity modulation and direct detection,
    which satisfies positive-valued amplitude signals, new theoretical bounds for
    channel capacity are needed. Besides, conventional algorithms that have been used
    in radio-frequency communications might not directly apply to VLC. Thus, further
    investigation to find suitable algorithms for the VLC system is needed. Physical
    layer security and coding in VLC are open research directions that worth investigating.
    In VLC, the light intensity is rapidly decreased with distance, which is considered
    as a major technical issue that needs to be addressed in the future. Artificial
    noise and natural light are also considered as sources of interference that affect
    VLC performance considerably [203]. Therefore, finding a viable solution to mitigate
    such undesired interference is required. In addition, VLC faces a challenge in
    separating multiple optical signals from different sources. As such, developing
    an advance technique for efficient signals separation is needed. Besides, using
    an advanced modulation scheme such as spatial modulation may improve the performance
    of VLC systems. Also, using a large scale MIMO system and NOMA communications
    systems with VLC can also be useful to enhance the VLC network performance. Therefore,
    further investigations regarding the use of spatial modulation, large scale MIMO
    and NOMA with VLC are needed. Furthermore, the application of VLC in a high mobility
    scenario is needed. Overcoming the technical challenges related to VLC may allow
    such a communication technique to be practically applicable and efficiently integrated
    with conventional wireless standards. b: Light-Fidelity (LiFi) Light-Fidelity
    (LiFi) was introduced as a key promising technology to complement the currently
    deployed wireless fidelity (WiFi) network [179], [206]–[209]. LiFi is considered
    an effective extension of VLC technology with an aim to provide a more secure,
    bi-directional, higher data rate and realize fully connected wireless networks
    [207], [209]. LiFi is a part of optical wireless communication that explores the
    infrared and visible light spectrum. This allows the available unlicensed spectrum
    to be fully exploited and provides wireless data communication together with illumination.
    This is because full utilization of the combination of infrared and visible light
    communication can offer around 2600 times larger resources spectrum than the size
    of the current RF spectrum. LiFi technology makes use of the light-emitting diodes
    (LEDs) to transmit data symbols in the downlink while photodetectors (PDs) are
    used at the receiver to receive these data symbols. The experiment results in
    [210] show that LiFi is able to provide up to 3Gb/s data rate from a single spot
    LED micro-light through the use of direct current optical orthogonal frequency
    division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) modulation. Key points of LiFi technology LiFi
    technology has the potential to support bi-directional multiuser communication,
    which includes the transmission from point to multipoint and also multipoint to
    single point [207]. LiFi can also be efficiently integrated with the currently
    deployed RF wireless networks to achieve heterogeneous wireless networks from
    both optical and RF domains [207]. LiFi has the ability to support user mobility
    and handover [207]. Using LiFi technology in a wireless network is known as an
    optical attocell network [211], [212], which can be a promising topology to overcome
    the looming spectrum crisis in the current RF wireless networks. Recently, experimental
    results, which are carried out in [213], showed that the LiFi concept can be effectively
    used with a WiFi network. The results demonstrated that using software-defined
    networking with LiFi technology allows the performance of the WiFi network to
    be considerably enhanced, which is used for traffic offloading and load balancing.
    The results also showed that over three orders of magnitude improvement in data
    density can be achieved by using LiFi technology. From the economic perspective,
    LiFi can be considered as a cost-effective solution since it can be easily integrated
    with the current RF network and makes use of the same existing lighting infrastructure
    [213], [214]. In LiFi based network, it is possible to combine an optical diffuser
    with LDs source to achieve broad illumination and wireless communication transmission
    simultaneously [215]. Since LiFi technology depends on LEDs lighting, it is considered
    to be a more secure source of communication, which can be safely unitized in aircraft
    cabins, nuclear & chemical plants, petrol stations, hospitals and also in the
    outdoor environment, i.e. street lamps, vehicle headlamps and traffic signals
    [216]. These key features and advantages promote LiFi technology to be one of
    the core technologies for the future 6G networks [25], [213]. LiFi has also been
    included in IEEE 802.15.7 standard [201] and it is expected to be integrated with
    currently existing wireless standards. The first design of transceivers application-specific
    integrated circuits components (ASICs) is presented in [207]. This transceivers
    architecture can be effectively used with current smart mobile and wearable devices
    to support fully connected IoT in 6G networks. Related challenges and future research
    directions There are some practical technical challenges related to the deployment
    of LiFi that need to be addressed to achieve its full potential. These challenges
    include short-range communication, interference caused by different artificial
    and natural light sources, LiFi signal modulation, and detection. Besides, developing
    an accurate channel model for LiFi communication systems is essential. Furthermore,
    finding feasible interference mitigation techniques, which are required to achieve
    fairness and high system capacity [207], is an interesting research topic that
    should be investigated. In addition, investigation of the effectiveness of using
    LiFi technology in load balancing is also worth investigating. Also, further research
    studies are needed to investigate the application of LiFi technology in outdoor
    scenarios. c: Free-Space Optical Communication Free space optical (FSO) communication
    is a special form of OWC system that takes place in the near-infrared frequency
    range [178], [217]. FSO is considered as a promising technology for providing
    wireless backhaul broadband connectivity to enable long-range communications [177],
    i.e, several kilometers, to meet the huge traffic demands in 6G networks [173],
    [218]. FSO communication explores laser technology to produce a focused light
    or narrow beam towards the desired user [219]. The optical light beam in FSO system
    is used to convey a high-speed data rate for long-distances wirelessly. Typically,
    FSO system uses laser diodes at the transmitter side and a photodiode (PD) at
    the receiver side, which involves optical filters with lens, to detect the desired
    laser beam [177]. It is worth noting that at the receiver, the light signal is
    converted to a voltage. Using FSO, it is possible to transmit up to 10 Gbps data
    rate for long-distance as discussed in [220]. Key points related to the FSO transmission
    technique FSO system has the capability of providing up to 40-Gbps data rate over
    a relatively short distance, e.g., 20m [221]. Providing such a huge data rate
    allows the FSC system to be a comparable technology to the fiber optics communication
    networks. FSO system has several advantages such as (a) allowing the use of high-frequency
    reuse factor; (b) achieving a secure communication; (c) providing immunity against
    electromagnetic interference; and (d) reducing the power consumption [222], [223].
    Several research works have investigated the application of FSO with radio-frequency
    systems in order to perform a hybrid radio-frequency with FSO transmission, see,
    e.g., [224]–[228]. The combination of radio-frequency and FSO communications can
    be used to enhance the capacity and coverage of conventional radio-frequency communication.
    Therefore, this combination could be useful for future 6G networks. FSO communication
    can be used in civilian (commercial) and military applications. FSO communication
    can be utilized with various networks both in space optical and terrestrial communications
    [220]. For example, FSO can be exploited in ground-to-satellite, satellite-to-ground,
    satellite-to-airplane, airplane-to-airplane, satellite-to-satellite, satellite-to-UAVs,
    satellite-to-balloons and satellite-to-ship communications [229]–[231]. FSO systems
    can also be used in remote sensing applications, remote healthcare systems to
    transmit efficient and secure medical images and videos, cellular networks to
    provide backhaul connectivity and underwater communications. Related challenges
    and future research directions Despite the several advantages of the FSO communication
    system, it is considered to be highly sensitive to blockage and atmospheric turbulence,
    which induces fading and sensitivity to weather conditions [219], [223]. Besides,
    FSO could face several unpredictable attenuation and propagation factors such
    as rain attenuation, fog, clouds, snow, haze, which could affect the performance
    of FSO communication systems [220]. Therefore, further research works are required
    to investigate the application of FSO with other technologies, which are currently
    used with conventional radio-frequency communication systems. For example, advanced
    physical layer techniques such as MIMO system [232], [233], adaptive modulation
    and channel coding schemes [234] and cooperative diversity [235] can be used to
    improve the performance of FSO communication. FSO communication could be more
    suitable for fixed wireless systems. Besides, the application of FSC communication
    systems with high mobility scenarios is essential, which can be more challenging
    than fixed wireless communication. Therefore, the application of FSC in high mobility
    scenarios requires further investigations in future. The combination between radio-frequency
    and FSO may be subject to several restrictions such as mismatch between radio-frequency
    and optical domains, circuitry design, and atmospheric attenuation. Therefore,
    further research investigations are required to overcome these limitations. d:
    Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) LiDAR technology is considered as a part of
    OWC operating in infrared frequency band rang. LiDAR denotes an image light wireless
    communication technology that can be used to provide a dynamic digital representation
    of different objects surroundings [165]. The narrow beam produced by LiDAR can
    be efficiently used to map different physical objects with relatively high resolution.
    This could significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of automated driving
    [131]. LiDAR uses different components such as optical light, position & navigation
    systems, photodetector and scanner [178]. Combining LiDAR sensing with radio-frequency
    communication or radar systems can be useful for future 6G networks especially
    for autonomous driving systems [236]. LiDAR sensing can be used with robotics
    to gather sufficient information about the dynamic digital representation of the
    surrounding objects with a high degree of accuracy [178]. Key points related to
    the LiDAR LiDAR is a key sensing technology that can be used in advanced driver
    assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems [237]. LiDAR sensing
    can be efficiently exploited with UAVs to provide high resolution, accurate data
    transmission and sensing information [238], [239]. Due to its high reliability
    and accuracy, LiDAR is considered as the most appropriate remote sensing technique
    to measure range, identify different objects, shapes, headings and positions [165],
    [240]. Hence, LiDAR could be a promising technology for future 6G networks. Related
    challenges and future research directions The LiDAR system is sensitive to weather
    conditions (e.g., rain, snow, and fog) and ambient light. In addition, implementing
    such technology in cars could be cost-inefficient [240]. Besides, the LiDAR system
    needs to meet the automotive ultra-Reliable Low-Latency communications [241] in
    order to grantee a safely automatic deriving. As such, further experimental platforms
    are required to investigate the performance of the LiDAR system and its application
    in practice. Furthermore, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning
    algorithms in LiDAR is possible for enhancing the system performance. This could
    be a possible research direction that is worth investigating in the future. e:
    Optical Camera Communication (OCC) Optical camera communication (OCC), which uses
    image sensors or cameras for communication, positioning, and navigation, is introduced
    as a promising technology for wireless communication in the future networks [159],
    [242]. OCC is considered as a part of OWC that explores the available spectrum
    regions related to the infrared and ultraviolet frequency bands to provide wireless
    data communication [243], [244]. Hence, much wider spectrum regions can be occupied
    by OCC in comparison with the spectrum regions of VLC, hence alleviating some
    of the currently congested communication traffic [242]. However, since the bit
    decoding method used for the camera is different from the photodiode method used
    in VLC, some adjustments are still required with OCC transmission systems. This
    is attributed to the fact that the output of cameras in OCC are images and not
    voltages as in most of the VLC systems [242]. OCC has been included in IEEE 802.15.7r1
    standard [201], [243]. OCC uses commercial LED lighting sources at the transmitter
    and image sensors or cameras to decode LED modulated data at the receiver. The
    transmitted signal in the OCC system is modulated using on−off keying (OOK) [242],
    [245]. When OCC uses visible light spectrum only as a communication medium, it
    acts as a VLC system [178]. Key points related to the OCC transmission technique
    OCC can be straightforwardly integrated on or implemented with current smart infrastructure,
    e.g., smartphone and laptop cameras, to achieve ubiquitous coverage in both indoors
    and outdoors scenarios. This straightforward implementation of OCC enables the
    portable devices to provide various services [246]–[248]. OCC has the potential
    to mitigate the interference denoted by the light coming from different sources
    and directions. This is because advanced lenses are used in mobile cameras to
    project lights from different sources and to separate different signals and sample
    them using different pixels [178]. Thus, the undesired signals can be straightforwardly
    discarded. OCC can be used indoor for localization in shopping malls and large
    supermarkets. In addition, OCC can also possibly be applied outdoor in V2V and
    V2I communications. Further, OCC can be applied with virtual reality and augmented
    reality [178], and it might be useful to implement with UAV communication systems.
    Related challenges and future research directions Due to the limited camera’s
    frame LED pulse rates, the OCC telecommunication system faces a challenge related
    to synchronization, which happens due to the camera frame. LED flickering, which
    is known as an undesired light illumination, is considered to be one of the challenges
    in the OCC system. LED flickering is happened due to the limited camera frame
    rate. Therefore, further research investigation is required in order to find a
    feasible way to address the synchronization and light flickering problems in OCC
    systems. In this context, advanced modulation sachems might be essential to overcome
    these issues [242]. Furthermore, due to the LoS nature in OCC systems, i.e., no
    multipath diversity is available, the signals could be subject to block by objects,
    which prevents light penetration, and thus, could result in losing the connection
    [242]. Therefore, further investigation is needed to address this technical issue
    in the OCC system. E. Full-Duplex Radio Transmission While the current wireless
    communications systems make use of either TDD or FDD duplex operation modes, in-band
    full-duplex (IBFD) is introduced as a promising operation mode to improve the
    data rate for future 6G wireless networks. IBFD could allow efficient usage of
    radio resources, reducing the delay between UL and DL [249], and increasing the
    spectral efficiency in comparison to the conventional duplex operation modes [250].
    In IBFD, the transmission and reception are carried out simultaneously at the
    same time over the same frequency band [251]. Thus, the number of information
    bits that are reliably transmitted per second per Hz can be doubly increased [252].
    IBFD radio transmission can also be beneficial for the access layer, where a node
    is capable to reliably transmit the outgoing frame while simultaneously receiving
    the ongoing one [253]. 1) Key Points of Full-Duplex Radio Communication IBFD technique
    can support a diverse set of IoT applications. These applications include cognitive
    radio, small-scale heterogeneous networks, bidirectional communication, cooperative
    transmission, and relaying networks [97]. Among these applications, IBFD relaying
    is considered to be the most promising one to achieve the full potential gain
    of IBFD, which is predicted to double the spectral efficiency [254]. This is attributed
    to the traffic symmetric pattern of relaying systems, wherein a relatively same
    amount of data can be transmitted and received over the same frequency band in
    the full-duplex mode [255]. Therefore, the frequency reuse with relaying systems
    can be efficiently maximized. In addition, the transmission power of relay systems
    is relatively small, which makes it more feasible for a full-duplex communication
    system to mitigate the self-interference [256]. Note that relay networks play
    an essential role in extending the radio coverage, especially in a strongly shadowed
    urban environment [257], [258]. Besides, the self-interference can be stronger
    than the desired signal, thus making it impossible for the receiver to decode
    the signal of interest. This can severely deteriorate the performance of IBFD
    systems. Typically, self-interference cannot be perfectly mitigated in practice.
    As such, effective self-interference mitigation techniques are the key to create
    a pathway for realizing IBFD in practice. Specifically, advanced signal processing
    techniques could play an essential role in reducing self-interference. Self-interference
    cancellation is to date considered as an open research problem in IBFD systems,
    albeit several cancellation techniques have been proposed (see e.g. [253] and
    the references therein). These proposed techniques include the use of orthogonal
    polarizations, digital and analog cancellation based approaches, passive suppression,
    and antenna placement [258]–[260]. 2) Related Challenges and Future Research Directions
    Although the use of large-scale antenna arrays at the relay could help in mitigating
    the interference, it might come at the cost of the energy efficiency of the relay
    system, whose transmit power is relatively low. In particular, the energy consumed
    by analog to digital converters (ADCs) at a fully digital relay receiver is scaled
    linearly with the number of antenna arrays [261], [262]. Thus, using large-scale
    antenna arrays systems with the IBFD technique is still an open research topic
    [97]. As such, further investigation in this regards is needed. It is worth noting
    that the intelligent reflecting surface can be used to improve the performance
    of full-duplex systems [263]. Therefore, further investigation about the application
    of Intelligent reflecting surfaces with full-duplex systems is required. Although
    the effect of imperfect CSI estimation on half-duplex communication systems has
    been extensively investigated and becomes a rather mature subject, the full-duplex
    counterpart has yet received limited attention. Therefore, CSI estimation based
    on feasible training sequence design in full-duplex systems should be investigated.
    F. Multiple Access and Modulation Techniques Efficient multiple access and modulation
    techniques could play an essential role in improving the data rate and reducing
    energy consumption of future 6G networks. 1) Orthogonal Multiple Access Several
    orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technologies have been used in many practical
    systems, including frequency division multiple access (FDMA), which has been used
    in 1G, time division multiple access (TDMA), which has been adopted in 2G, code
    division multiple access (CDMA), which has been utilized in 3G, and orthogonal
    frequency division multiple access (OFDM), which is currently used in the DL of
    4G and 5G NR networks [264], [265]. Among the above techniques, OFDM has been
    the dominant modulation technique for multicarrier communications and received
    significant research attention. This is due to its capability to provide immunity
    against frequency selective fading, co-channel interference, and impulse noise
    [264]. OFDM modulation transmission has several advantages such as (a) allowing
    the use of adaptive modulation schemes to increase the data rate; (b) enhancing
    spectrum efficiency, i.e., efficient utilization of the available bandwidth, i.e.,
    dividing the available spectrum between users efficiently; (c) providing immunity
    against intersymbol interference (ISI); and (d) supporting multipath delay spread
    [266]. These key advantages allow OFDM to be utilized in several wire-line and
    wireless communications standards and also to be used in 5G NR networks, though
    several developments and standardization works are yet in progress. It is worth
    noting that the 5G NR networks support multicarrier OFDM in the DL and single-carrier
    DFT-spread-OFDM in UL transmission. a: The Challenges Related to the OFDM Transmission
    Technique Despite the attractiveness of OFDM transmission technique in increasing
    the data rate, it is to date suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
    [264], [267]. This results in an unwanted in-band distortion and unwanted out-of-band
    (OOB) radiation due to the non-linearity of the power amplifier (PA). Hence, in
    order to guarantee linear amplification of the input signal, the PA needs to operate
    at the back off from its saturation point, and thus, it becomes less efficient
    as the back-off increases. This may have a direct impact on mobiles battery life
    and energy-sensitive applications. Therefore, advanced multiple access techniques
    are required. Several alternative multicarrier transmission techniques, which
    address some of the shortcomings of OFDM, have been proposed as new candidates
    for the next generation of mobile communications. For example, filter bank multicarrier
    (FBMC) with an offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) has been proposed
    in [268] to provide a higher data rate and reduce the unwanted OOB radiation that
    faces the OFDM technique. In FBMC transmission, the nonadjacent subcarriers are
    well separated through the use of a bank of well-designed filters. The FBMC can
    be well designed to reduce the narrow-band interference and unwanted sidelobes.
    However, the length of the filter impulse response in FBMC needs to be increased
    by at least four times the transmit symbols. This design constrain may make the
    FBMC technique infeasible to be applied to the delay sensitize applications, wherein
    high spectral efficiency requires to be achieved with short burst transmissions.
    Therefore, the focus has shifted to the universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC)
    [269], wherein a group of several subcarriers is filtered together instead of
    per subcarrier filtering with a larger length using in FBMC. Therefore, by applying
    the filtering operation to a group of consecutive subcarriers in the UFMC technique,
    the length of the filter impulse response could be reduced while reducing the
    unwanted out-of-band radiation. However, the UFMC technique comprises the need
    for cyclic prefix (CP) insertion, which is typically required in most of the multicarrier
    waveforms, thus making the UFMC technique more vulnerable to time misalignment
    in comparison to most CP-based techniques. Also, UFMC is subject to ISI with moderately
    large delay spreads. Filtered-OFDM (f-OFDM) has been also introduced as a new
    waveform for future wireless systems [270] to overcome the limitation of the UFMC
    technique. In contrast to the UFMC, the filtered-OFDM technique allows the filter
    length to be varied and even exceed the CP length in conventional CP-based techniques
    to obtain better balancing between the time and frequency localization. However,
    increasing the CP length is not necessarily a feasible solution for low-latency
    applications in the future communications networks. A more flexible modulation
    technique, termed generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) has been
    proposed in [271], [272] as a candidate waveform for future wireless communications.
    GFDM technique takes the advantages of both OFDM and single carrier frequency.
    In GFDM technique, the subcarriers are filtered and combined into blocks and each
    block is modulated independently. However, such filtering and combining approach
    could result in non-orthogonal subcarriers, which might lead to increase the inter-carrier
    interference and ISI. Therefore, efficient receiving techniques are required with
    GFDM based techniques in order to mitigate the ISI and ICI. Although using such
    interference cancellation techniques could be useful to obtain a reasonable performance,
    this comes at the expense of increasing the computational complexity. It is worth
    noting that FBMC and GFDM are considered as pulse shaping modulation techniques
    while UFMC and f-OFDM are considered to be subband filtering schemes [273]. Recently,
    a two-dimensional modulation scheme, which is a generalization of both CDMA and
    OFDM, termed as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) has been proposed in [274]
    to support high-speeds, high frequencies, and large antenna arrays transmissions.
    OTFS modulation has the ability to covert the time-varying multipath wireless
    channel into a time-independent channel, which allows each transmitted symbol
    to be experienced a near-constant channel gain. The results show that OTFS modulation
    can provide higher diversity gains over time and frequency in comparison to the
    conventional OFDM modulation scheme. Such constant channel gain overall symbols
    would allow the system overhead and complexity to be reduced. Analog types of
    modulations may also be possible for future 6G networks. It is worth noting that
    the typical key performance indicators that have been used in the performance
    evaluation of the aforementioned transmission techniques are PARP, design complexity,
    filter length, power-spectral density (PSD), bit-error-rate (BER), spectral efficiency
    (SE), and latency. b: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions Although
    the aforementioned techniques have been proposed to efficiently partition system
    bandwidth and increase the data rate, which might be useful for 6G networks, their
    performance should be further investigated and compared to meet the use case requirements
    and applications of 6G networks. Also, it would be worth investigating the key
    potential problems of the currently existing techniques and see their feasibility
    with the requirements of the 6G networks. For example, the compatibility of the
    aforementioned waveforms with high frequencies needs to be investigated. Besides,
    single-carrier DFT-spread-OFDM, which reduces the PAPR in comparison to the OFDM
    transmission technique, can be used with high carrier frequencies in 6G networks.
    The work in [120] showed that single-carrier frequency division multiple access
    provides more immunity and robustness against the phase noise and can achieve
    a larger power amplifier efficiency in comparison to cyclic-prefix OFDM in sub-THz
    bands. In addition, using high-order modulations with high carrier frequencies
    might increase the peak data rate considerably but it might also come at the cost
    of increasing the BER and implementation complexity. Hence, the tradeoff between
    the reliability, measured in BER, the data rates, and the computational complexity
    should be investigated. Intelligence OFDM transmission techniques as well as subcarrier
    index modulation (IM) schemes [23], [275], [276] may be considered for spatial
    multiplexing in future 6G networks. The compatibility of OMA techniques with large-scale
    MIMO systems should be investigated. In addition, many IoT delays and battery
    life sensitize devices and applications are expected to be considered in 6G networks.
    Therefore, efficient carrier techniques are required. Specifically, it is expected
    to extend the OMA techniques capabilities to support an extremely high data rate
    and low latency. The tradeoff amongst the range of potentially conflicting 6G
    requirements, such as the complexity, cost, energy-efficient, delay, while maintaining
    the system performance, is one of the key concerns that worth investigating. 2)
    Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) With OMA techniques, the available resource
    blocks within each cell are divided orthogonally and allocated either in the time,
    frequency, or code domains, thus reducing the interference among adjacent blocks
    and allowing simple signal detection. However, OMA techniques serve a single user
    in each orthogonal radio resource block. Therefore, the number of served users
    is limited by the number of available radio resource blocks, and thus, the available
    spectrum might not be efficiently exploited. In addition, the orthogonality transmission
    could be broken down due to the channel impairments and the random nature of the
    wireless propagation channels, which will affect the communication reliability
    and spectral efficiency. Furthermore, motivated by the diverse requirements of
    massive access IoT networks, advanced multiple access techniques to efficiently
    exploit the available spectrum are required for future 6G networks [277], [278].
    NOMA is introduced as a key enabling technique for supporting multiple non-orthogonal
    radio resource blokes among the users either by sharing the same time-frequency
    recourse block in the power domain [279]–[282] or by spreading code in the code
    domain [273], [283]. a: Key Points Related to the NOMA Transmission Technique
    NOMA has the potential capability to efficiently exploit the available radio resources
    and serve multiple users simultaneously in the same resource bloke with different
    QoS requirements, i.e., achieving more fairness between multiple users [284],
    [285]. In the power-domain NOMA, the transmit signals at the BS are superposed
    and transmitted to multiple users using different power levels. Thus, the users
    with relatively high received SNR levels would decode interfering signals before
    decoding their own signal by using successive interference cancellation (SIC),
    while the users with lower SNR levels would consider the interference as noise.
    In contrast, in code-domain NOMA, which uses spreading codes, the users are provided
    with relatively high SNR levels but at the cost of increasing the interference.
    Although the spectral efficiency and fairness can be improved with NOMA transmission
    technique, this comes at the cost of increasing the receiver complexity in comparison
    to the traditional OMA techniques [121]. Besides, the NOMA technique can be used
    to provide massive connectivity and satisfactory wireless communications for IoT
    applications [286], [287]. It is worth noting that SDMA, mentioned in subsection
    II-A, can be considered as a non-orthogonal spatial multiplexing technique because
    it spatially multiplexes the transmitted data in the spatial domain, i.e., power
    domain. SDMA uses linear precoding to spatially separate users in the power domain
    [288]. Massive MIMO system is considered as an extended version of SDMA, as discussed
    in subsection II-A. Massive MIMO system can be utilized to mitigate the interference.
    However, the interference management using massive MIMO technology might be insufficient
    due to the extremely limited spatial resolution of the large antenna arrays, which
    could occur when the transmit array is far away from the users [97]. Therefore,
    NOMA could be seen as an efficient candidate to mitigate the residual multi-user
    interference at the protocol layer. NOMA has been considered by 3GPP LTE Release-12
    [289] for interference cancellation and later by 3GPP LTE-A Release-13 [290],
    which is termed as multiuser superposition transmission (MUST). Some other popular
    forms of NOMA and multiple access techniques have also been proposed recently.
    These techniques include sparse code multiple access (SCMA) [291], [292] and low
    density spreading (LDS) [293]–[295], successive interference cancellation amenable
    multiple access (SAMA) [296], and multi-user shared access (MUSA) [297], which
    are considered as a code-domain NOMA [285], and other multiple access techniques
    in multiple domains such as pattern division multiple access (PDMA) [296], [298],
    [299], lattice partition multiple access (LPMA) [300] and bit division multiplexing
    (BDM) [301]. Delta orthogonal multiple access (D-OMA) has been recently proposed
    in [11] as a candidate multiple access technique for future 6G networks. D-OMA
    transmission relies on the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) concept and makes use
    of partially overlapping NOMA subbands spectrum. However, several system parameters
    are required to be optimized in D-OMA transmission including, the size of the
    NOMA cluster, the amount of spectrum overlap between NOMA clusters, the number
    of collaborating CoMP, and power-allocation. This could be challenging in the
    ultra-dense networks due to the nonlinearity of the objective function introduced
    by the dynamic propagation environments. In addition, an efficient SIC algorithm
    is still essential to mitigate the interference. b: Key Points Related to the
    Rate Splitting Multiple Access Transmission Technique Rate splitting multiple
    access (RSMA), which is non-orthogonal multiple access, has been recently proposed
    in [288] as another promising technology for future 6G networks. RSMA is considered
    a bridging technology between the SDMA and NOMA transmission techniques. However,
    RSMA differs from the SDMA and NOMA approaches in the mechanism of decoding the
    signals and canceling the interference. Similar to the SDMA technique, RSMA treats
    part of the residual interference as noise, while it decodes part of the interference
    in a way similar to the NOMA based technique [288]. RSMA uses precoding at the
    transmitter and SIC at the receivers. This partial interference management allows
    RSMA to be a more flexible transmission technique in comparison to SDMA and NOMA
    techniques. c: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions Despite the advantages
    of the above multiple-access techniques, there are several technical challenges
    related to their use in practice. These challenges need to be addressed. For example,
    robust interference management to enable successful signal decoding is required.
    However, this might come at the expense of implementation complexity and increasing
    power consumption at the receivers. Therefore, tradeoffs between performance,
    complexity, and energy efficiency need to be considered. In addition, all the
    above multiple-access techniques are sensitive to the imperfect CSI estimation,
    which could be one of the key obstacles that prevent such techniques from achieving
    their full potential gain in practice. Therefore, finding feasible pilot design
    schemes and advanced channel estimation algorithms is required to achieve accurate
    CSI estimation. Using adaptive modulation/coding techniques for efficient resource
    allocation may also be a challenging issue, which needs to be considered in future.
    3) Spatial Modulation Using extremely large-scale antenna arrays, which are highly
    required by the 6G networks to increase the data rate, could pose some technical
    challenges related to the implantation complexity, the use of high-cost multiple
    radio-frequency chains, and increase power consumption [302]. With large-scale
    antenna arrays, each antenna element requires a complete radio-frequency chain
    to produce digital modulation. This implies that a large number of full-active
    antennas could have large form factors that require high-cost components to guarantee
    efficient transmission. In addition, it is likely that much of the power consumption
    will come from RF power amplifiers and the associated baseband signal processing
    [303], [304], and thus, this might reduce the energy efficiency of 6G networks.
    Hence, a low-complexity coded modulation mechanism, known as spatial modulation,
    is proposed as an efficient modulation transmission to meet the energy efficiency
    requirements of next-generation wireless communications. Spatial modulation design
    paradigm aims to erode the cost and complexity of the large-scale antenna transmissions
    while maintaining a feasible data rate and end-to-end system performance. The
    basic principle of spatial modulation is to map a block of information bits at
    the transmitter into two units: 1) an information symbol, which is selected from
    a constellation diagram, and 2) information over the channel, which is chosen
    from a set of indices related to unique transmit antennas [197], [305], [306].
    This would allow the spatial position of each signal antenna at the transmitter
    in the antenna array to be exploited as an extra dimension for sending information
    [305]. a: The Key Points Related to the Spatial Modulation Spatial modulation
    transmission presents an opportunity to use a low-cost single-carrier RF structure
    with a low-complexity single-stream detection. This would also allow the transmit
    signals to be more robust against RF hardware impairments, such as phase-noise
    and inter-Channel Interference (ICI), which may occur due to sending superimposing
    of independent information [302], [305]. In addition, spatial modulation benefits
    from the single carrier RF implementation to mitigate the power dissipation of
    power amplifiers. Furthermore, spatial modulation has the potential to reduce
    the RF power consumption owing to the inherent multiplexing gain that can be achieved
    by the spatial constellation diagram. b: The Challenges Related to the Spatial
    Modulation However, spatial modulation, though achieving low-cost and complexity
    implementation, is constrained by spastic coded modulation sets, which could limit
    the data rate required for scalable IoT networks. Therefore, advanced index/coded
    modulation schemes [276], which make use of larger code sets to increase the data
    rate, are required. The high-order modulation with spatial modulation design could
    be considered in the future to improve the data rate. Using the index/coded modulation
    with IRC, which controls the electromagnetic waves in order to increase the signal
    quality, coverage, and/or data rate [307], could be investigated in the future.
    In addition, the optimum number of radio-frequency chains with spatial modulation
    that achieves the best tradeoff between the achievable data rate and energy efficiency
    while maintaining hardware simplicity needs to be investigated. A summary of the
    techniques discussed in this subsection is provided in Fig. 10. FIGURE 10. Schematic
    diagram illustrates multiple access and modulation techniques. Show All SECTION
    III. Enhancing Energy Efficiency for Green Communications The continuous growth
    in wireless data traffic, which comes from connecting billions of devices to the
    Internet, has led to an increase in energy consumption. In addition, network operators
    have recognized that the traditional approaches of deploying more small cells
    might not be sufficient to meet the ongoing huge data traffic demands. Besides,
    one of the significant challenges that face the small cell networks deployment
    is the considerable amount of intercell interference (ICI) from other cells [308].
    Thus, finding feasible energy-efficient designs and operations for future 6G networks
    with an aim to reduce the undesirable carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per mobile
    subscriber becomes essential [309]. In addition, finding suitable designs for
    realizing economically sustainable future wireless communications systems that
    achieve both spectral and energy efficiencies with low hardware cost are crucial
    [88], [310]. Therefore, green radio access network concept has been introduced
    to optimize the spectrum resources and minimize energy consumption. The radio
    resources in the wireless communications systems can be efficiently allocated
    to maximize energy efficiency [311]. The metric for calculating the energy efficiency
    of a communication link is obtained by dividing the number of information bits
    (over the total consumed energy) by the entire network measured in [bit/Joule]
    [312]. Energy management is essential for the sustainability of future 6G wireless
    communications networks [313]. Recently, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) concept
    [314] is introduced as a promising network infrastructure to overcome the increasing
    mobile traffic demands in cellular systems [315], [316]. In C-RAN, most of the
    intensive computational tasks, such as precoding matrix calculation, baseband
    signal processing, and channel estimation are moved to the cloud [316]. In this
    regard, C-RAN has the potential to reduce energy consumption in order to achieve
    green wireless communications systems [317]. However, finding feasible front-haul
    solutions to centralization the C-RAN network is essential [317]. In addition,
    the C-RAN network requires a virtualization implementation to realize resource
    cloudification [317]. Furthermore, energy consumption can be reduced using an
    efficient network planning scheme [318]. Also, suitable switch-on/switch-off algorithms
    may be required to control the traffic conditions and reduce the energy consumption
    [319], [320]. Besides, finding feasible hardware designs that account for energy
    consumption is essential for energy-efficient wireless communications systems
    [321]. This includes the design of an efficient radio-frequency chain and the
    use of simplified transmitter/receiver structures, e.g., one-bit signal quantization
    and the utilization of hybrid analog/digital beamforming [318]. Mobile cloud computing
    such as fog and edge computing is another impressive technique for achieving energy
    efficiency in wireless communications systems [316], [322], [323]. Mobile cloud
    computing allows users with huge computing demands to offload their intensive
    tasks to the edge cloud in order to save energy. Further discussion about edge
    computing is provided in subsection VI-E. Combining mobile cloud computing and
    C-RAN might lead to a significant energy saving for future communications networks
    [324], [325]. Recently, several studies have investigated the energy efficiency
    maximizing with large number antennas arrays, see e.g., [67], [326]–[329]. These
    investigations have focused on exploiting an optimum power allocation, scheduling
    algorithms, and network topology to reduce energy consumption. It is worth noting
    that using an externally large number of base station antenna arrays might not
    achieve the energy efficiency requirements of future 6G networks. This is because
    energy consumption can be increased with the number of radio-frequency chains.
    A. Energy Harvesting Energy harvesting is considered one of the most promising
    techniques to increase energy efficiency in 6G networks. Energy harvesting enables
    wireless devices to harvest energy from radio-frequency signals using rectenna
    circuits, which can be used to charge the devices’ batteries wirelessly to support
    their operations [330]. For example, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely
    used for healthcare monitoring. As such, the total power consumption in such networks,
    which require long-term connectivity and long battery life, is considered a major
    issue. Therefore, energy harvesting can be efficiently exploited to support WSNs
    [331]. 1) Key Points of Energy Harvesting The energy harvesting technique has
    the potential to reduce the carbon footprint [332]. The energy harvesting technique
    allows an efficient battery-powered operation for wireless networks. This makes
    wireless networks to be deployed in remote rural areas and in the human body [332].
    Energy harvesting can be used in many medical and safety applications and in remote
    monitoring with extended battery life and longer communications ranges [332].
    Furthermore, the energy harvesting technique allows wireless communications networks
    to be powered by clean sources of energy [318]. Typically, energy harvesting technique
    includes wireless power transfer (WPT), wireless powered communication network
    (WPCN) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [330],
    [333], [334]. Therefore, a special design at the receiver side is required to
    retrieve the information and energy. In the WPT approach, the power transmitter
    transfers the energy to user devices without information. The transferred energy
    is then utilized to charge the devices’ batteries. The WPT-based approach has
    the potential to be used with implant devices for medical purposes, electric cars
    and wireless grids [335]. In WPCN based approach, the energy is firstly harvested
    in the user devices and then used to transmit data. Hence, the communication efficiency
    of wireless devices can be significantly improved [336]. In SWIPT based approach,
    the power transmitter can simultaneously transfer energy and information to the
    user devices. Then, the users would either harvest energy or decode the information
    sent by the power transmitter. As such, an efficient energy-information transmission
    can be achieved [337]. SWIPT technique has the potential to achieve the best use
    of the radio-frequency spectrum/radiation [338]. SWIPT technique allows a massive
    number of IoT devices to be powered and connected anywhere and anytime [338].
    Several studies have investigated the energy harvesting technique for green communications.
    For example, the trade-off between the energy harvesting and the information rate
    in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels has been investigated in [339].
    This study assumed a realistic receiver, which harvests the energy and decodes
    the information from the same signal. A more practical scenario with power-splitting
    (PS) and time-switching (TS) based approaches has been considered in [340]. In
    PS based technique, the receiver can split the received signal into two diffident
    parts, one to decode the useful information and one to harvest the energy. In
    TS, however, the receiver can instantaneously switch between the decoding information
    and the energy harvesting. The antenna switching (AS) technique, which uses switches
    to switch between antenna elements to achieve decoding or rectifying, can also
    be used for SWIPT [340]. A new approach that exploits spatial switching (SS) of
    the information and energy was proposed in [341]. In SS based approach, the MIMO
    channel can be efficiently decomposed into parallel channels using singular value
    decomposition (SVD). In this case, the MIMO wireless channels can carry either
    information or energy, thereby neither TS nor PS is necessary. A new approach
    that exploits the generalized triangular decomposition (GTD) structure was proposed
    in [342]. The proposed GTD approach allows the MIMO channel to be decomposed and
    jointly used for energy harvesting and information exchange. The energy harvesting
    and information can be effectively separated at the receiver. 2) Related Challenges
    and Future Research Directions Finding accurate models for energy harvesting systems
    is considered as one of the major challenges [338]. Another challenge that faces
    energy harvesting systems is the randomness nature of the energy available at
    any given time [318]. In addition, new advancements in network design and signal
    processing are required. Resource allocation and scheduling are also considered
    as major issues in energy harvesting systems [343], [344]. More practical experiments
    are required in order to investigate the efficiency of energy transfer and harvesting.
    Furthermore, in order to enable efficient energy harvesting design the complexity
    and cost of the devices’ circuits might be increased. This is also considered
    as one of the technical challenges that need to be addressed to achieve the full
    potential gain of energy harvesting systems. Also, an ambient backscatter communication
    system might be used to address this issue. B. Backscatter Communication As stated
    earlier, reducing energy consumption is the most essential part of 6G networks.
    Besides, there are a massive number of IoT devices in 6G networks, which are powered
    by batteries that have limited capabilities [345]. Therefore, a symbiotic radio
    is introduced as a promising technology to reduce energy consumption towards achieving
    green communication. The symbiotic radio technology has the ability to integrate
    passive backscatter devices with active transmission systems [346]. Ambient backscatter
    communication [333], [347] is considered as an example of symbiotic radio technology.
    In this case, the network devices make use of ambient radio frequency signals
    such as TV, cellular base stations, and WiFi as signal sources to transmit data
    without the need for an active radio frequency transmission [348], [349]. Thus,
    a significant battery power saving can be achieved. The user data can be encoded
    in the reflected and re-emitted signal by modulating the antenna impedance [349].
    1) Key Points Related to the Backscatter Communication Backscatter communication
    system consumes an order of 10 μW less energy in comparison to the conventional
    transmission systems [350]. This makes a backscatter communication systems more
    feasible for future IoT applications [333], sensors and can also be facilitating
    in-body wireless implantation [345]. Backscatter communication can be applied
    in radio frequency identification (RFID) for a passive RFID tag, which harvests
    energy from an incident single-tone wave [345]. Furthermore, ambient backscatter
    communication system does not need a dedicated frequency spectrum [333]. Backscatter
    communication enables the IoT devices to transmit information by reflecting and
    modulating an incident radio frequency wave without the requirement for significant
    energy consumption [351]. Recently, full-duplex radio transmission is introduced
    as an enabling technique with backscatter communication in order to support simultaneous
    wireless communication between multiple ambient backscatter nodes [346]. Programmable
    metasurface [93], [352] can also be used with backscatter communication to allow
    more control over the ambient waves [349]. 2) Related Challenges and Future Research
    Directions Backscatter systems may face several technical challenges such as low
    data rate, uni-directional data transmission, and short communication ranges.
    The security and jamming signals attacks are other issues that may face the backscatter
    communication system. This is due to the simplicity of the modulation and coding
    techniques that are used in backscatter communication systems. The implementation
    of conventional security solutions might not be possible due to the limited resources
    in the backscatter communication system [353]. Therefore, developing highly efficient
    security solutions for backscatter systems is required. Quantum communication
    may also be used to improve the performance and security of the backscatter system
    [354]. In addition, self-interference may significantly affect the performance
    of the backscatter communication system. Hence, developing feasible self-interference
    cancellation techniques is crucial. SECTION IV. Increasing Connectivity and Full
    Coverage 6G networks are intended to address the practical challenges that face
    conventional networks. 6G communications systems aim to support the emerging data-hungry
    applications by increasing connectivity and extending network capabilities. This
    can be achieved by improving network coverage, i.e., providing universal coverage
    in distant and isolated areas [4]. These connectivity demands and full-coverage
    requirements should be achieved using feasible and cost-efficient solutions. To
    achieve these aims, 6G networks are intended to be decentralized and designed
    based on integrating different networks such as terrestrial communications, airborne
    (aerial) communications, marine, and underwater communications, and satellite
    systems. This allows the establishment of useful communication access platforms
    and provides high-precision and high-reliability networks that cover the entire
    world [36], [97], [165], [166], [355]. Such integration of heterogeneous networks
    is essential in increasing network capacity and coverage [36]. This integration
    is also expected to become an essential component of future 6G wireless communications
    networks. This combination is intended to provide high-speed Internet access in
    the rural, urban, desert, and sea areas as shown in Fig 11. Such integration could
    play an essential role in enabling the emerging Internet of underwater things
    (IoUT) communications systems [356]. IoUT communication is essential for low-cost
    transportation, positioning and navigation, monitoring and security, and disaster
    prediction and prevention. Therefore, in order to achieve seamless communications
    networks, new networking architectures, infrastructures and cell-less architecture
    with high-quality communication services are required [4]. FIGURE 11. The integration
    of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks to achieve full coverage. Show All
    A. Integration of Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Communications Networks As discussed
    above, 6G future networks are expected to integrate terrestrial platforms, which
    contain conventional base stations, with non-terrestrial (airborne) platforms
    such as UAVs, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs), and satellites communications.
    This integration can be exploited to provide cost-efficient, high-speed data-rate,
    ubiquitous broadband connectivity and full coverage [17], [39], [97], [119]. In
    particular, the integration between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks
    in future 6G communications systems can be used to increase the wireless coverage
    to reach unserved areas or poorly-served areas. For example, non-terrestrial can
    be used in blind spots such as deserts, mountains, and seas. In addition, the
    integration can also be used to enhance the service availability, continuity and
    reliability. For instance, a secondary backup route can be provided by non-terrestrial
    platforms to sustain the communication networks when the primary route is inaccessible.
    Such backup route may happen in remote areas or oceans, or when terrestrial towers
    are out of operation, for example, after natural disasters. Furthermore, the integration
    between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial can support the network flexibility,
    scalability and adaptability. In this regards, non-terrestrial can be used to
    offload the network in heavy-load situations. Furthermore, the non-terrestrial
    networks could support high-speed wireless backhaul and allow seamless service
    continuity and reliability [357]. The recent studies show the possibility to use
    the non-terrestrial networks to relay the transmitted signals between terrestrial
    elements such as base station; see e.g., [358]–[360]. The aforementioned benefits
    of the integration between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial will jointly contribute
    to a better user experience in future 6G networks. In addition, seamless integration
    between terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks will ensure a high-quality broadband
    connectivity. In this context, 6G networks may further expand the unification
    of the terrestrial and non-terrestrial components into a multidimensional and
    multilayered architecture in order to achieve an enhanced capacity, flexibility,
    and resilience. Recent advances in software defined networks, artificial intelligence,
    and network slicing technologies provide enabling tools for seamless integration
    between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. The software defined networks
    can play an essential role in efficiently and dynamically network controlling
    and inter-segment operation. Further, artificial intelligence can be exploited
    in the integration between terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks for automation
    in networks operation and control and for achieving resilience, flexibility and
    scalability in system management. Artificial intelligence can also be exploited
    to make fast, effective and accurate real-time decisions, which will help the
    successfulness of the integration between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial
    networks. Furthermore, network slicing based resource management can be potentially
    exploited to improve the performance of the integrated service provisioning to
    different users with different applications. Besides, mmWave communication can
    be used to enhance the performance of non-terrestrial communication networks.
    In this regards, an efficient beam management and network self-healing mechanisms
    for non-terrestrial communication networks can be used to achieve this goal [361].
    Fig. 12 shows the non-terrestrial wireless communication networks. In what follows,
    the non-terrestrial wireless communication networks are discussed. FIGURE 12.
    The classification of non-terrestrial networks. Show All FIGURE 13. Cell-free
    massive MIMO with a large number of distributed access points (APs). All APs cooperate
    phase-coherently through the use of a backhaul network and serve all mobile users
    simultaneously over the same time-frequency [394]. Show All 1) Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles
    (UAVs) Communications 6G networks are expected to fully support the connection
    of autonomous vehicles and drone-based communications systems. The vehicle and
    drone-based communications systems field of research are known as UAV communications
    systems. UAVs communications are expected to be exploited in 6G networks to enable
    cell-free communications [362]. UAVs are considered as a part of low altitude
    platforms (LAPs), which are ranged between 0 to 4 km [363]. In particular, in
    [357], it has been stated that UAVs have the ability to fly at low altitudes (e.g.,
    a few hundred meters). To this end, Fig. 1 (left) in [357] shows that UAVs can
    be approximately flying with a range of 100 m above the ground. This short altitude
    of UAVs is justified due to the time flight restriction and movement constraint.
    As such, UAVs would need the shortest paths to perform their given missions. Recently,
    there has been a significant interest in integrating UAVs into wireless networks
    in order to improve network connectivity in heavy-load situations [364]. For example,
    UAVs can be considered as flying base stations, access points, or relays with
    cost and energy efficiency to provide radio coverage for users in various geographical
    areas [40]. a: Key Points Related to the UAV Communication UAV-based networks
    can play a fundamental role in supporting high-speed backhaul connectivity for
    wireless networks [365]. UAVs can be efficiently integrated with cell-free massive
    MIMO systems to obtain cell-free networks with relatively small latency [38].
    UAV with an aid of MIMO communications systems can be efficiently explored for
    data collection in an IoT scenario [366]. UAVs can fly at a few hundred meters
    and can be flexibly contorted [357]. In addition, UAVs can be efficiently combined
    with HAPSs and satellites to enable more accurate data processing and support
    continuous information broadcasting in comparison to standalone deployments [357].
    Artificial intelligence and machine learning can be exploited to aid the UAVs’
    communications systems [38]. For example, artificial intelligence and machine
    learning can be used to dynamically optimize the UAVs’ paths and in a reconfiguration
    of network topology. UAVs can assist communications networks and have the capability
    to facilitate on-demand services, avoid coverage holes and allow line-of-sight
    links with high communication reliability. UAVs technology can be designed to
    benefit from wireless power transfer techniques and make use of renewable energy
    (e.g., solar power). The utilization of such techniques allows the UAVs to be
    fully charged for a long time. UAVs can be used to support underwater communications
    systems and also to discover oil spills. Besides, UAVs can be efficiently used
    to accomplish several essential purposes such as emergency services, forecast
    & early warning systems, security monitoring & surveillance, fire detection, natural
    disaster management, package delivery, and pollution monitoring [367]. UAVs can
    be used to assist mobile edge computing networks to increase computing efficiency
    and reduce latency [279], [368]–[370]. These key essential services promote UAVs
    to be one of the most important technologies for future 6G wireless communications
    networks. b: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions Despite the promising
    advantages of UAVs technology, there are several technical challenges that need
    to be addressed. For example, the small sizes of UAVs and the variability of positions
    and speeds make the detection and tracking of UAVs challenging. Therefore, developing
    a robust mechanism for the identification and tracking of UAVs is essential. Large-scale
    MIMO systems can be jointly used with radars to increase the probability of UAVs
    detection [50]. In addition, UAVs are typically consumed high energy to support
    their movement flexibility and maintain long-distance travel [357]. Therefore,
    an advanced power management mechanism is required. UAVs are typically collecting
    huge amounts of data. Such huge data collection can cause storage constraint problems
    to UAVs [371]. Hence, new data compression techniques to come up with storage
    issues are required. In this context, edge computing can be exploited as a viable
    low-cost and energy-efficient solution to increase the computation capability
    of UAVs [372], [373]. UAVs are able to efficiently offload their computational-intensive
    activities to edge computing. Also, advanced signal and image processing techniques
    are required for UAVs. Thus, efficient and low-complex signal and image compression
    schemes can be used, see e.g., [374]–[377]. Furthermore, developing efficient
    and robust protection mechanisms to deal with cyber and physical attacks in UAV
    systems is crucial. Moreover, developing an accurate channel modeling and fast
    channel estimation mechanism for UAVs system is needed. Besides, new communication
    and routing protocols for UAV systems are required. Interference is another crucial
    issue that affects UAVs’ communication reliability. Such interference becomes
    more serious in the dominated line of sight scenarios where the UAVs are hovering
    at high altitudes [378]. Hence, developing an interference avoidance mechanism
    for UAVs is an interesting research topic that needs to be considered in the future.
    2) High Altitude Platform Station (Haps) HAPs such as airships and balloons are
    considered as quasi-stationary networked aerial platforms located in the stratosphere
    region of the atmosphere [379], [380]. In general, HAPs have lower altitudes than
    satellites. The altitude communication distances of HAPs are ranged between 15
    to 25 km above Earth’s surface [381], [382]. Technically, HAPSs are considered
    as repeaters flying to provide broadcast/multicast wireless broadband services
    and extend wireless connectivity and coverage [383], [384]. a: Key Points of HAPSs
    Communications HAPSs communications have several advantages such as: (a) operational
    simplicity; (b) implementation simplicity (i.e., require simple infrastructure);
    (c) low-cost deployment and launch; (d) efficiently utilize the available spectrum;
    and (e) supporting long geographical coverage [383]. In terms of flight time and
    coverage, HAPs achieve better performance in comparison to the UAVs systems [385].
    HAPs can be considered as a valuable low-cost solution, which is effectively used
    to complement satellite communication networks [386]. HAPs have significantly
    lower propagation delay in comparison to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and low
    Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. HAPs can fly on-demand to provide fast wireless
    consecutively for different regions. This feature can be useful to support delay-sensitive
    IoT applications in 6G networks. HAPs can be used as an intermediate communication
    layer between the satellite and the terrestrial receiver to provide communications
    services at a local regional [363], [386]. The HAPs communication layer can be
    exploited to accomplish several signal processing tasks locally, supplement existing
    terrestrial and satellite communications systems, supporting multimedia broadcast
    and multicast services, and improving link budget [363], [387]. HAPs can also
    be exploited to support a large number of terrestrial cells in heavy-load situations
    and to achieve high throughput backhaul links. HAPs can be exploited to serve
    multiple tasks such as surveillance, navigation & position, remote sensing, intelligent
    transportation systems, and emergency communications [387]. HAPSs platforms can
    host mobile edge computing to provide additional computing and storage functionalities,
    and hence, assist terrestrial terminals. HAPSs can exploit renewable energy, e.g.,
    solar panels, which are more energy-efficient sources of power in comparison to
    the traditional power sources. b: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions
    Although HAPs have the potential to support several essential applications, they
    still face some technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to be
    globally adopted [363], [388]. For example, the limited autonomy of HAPs is considered
    one of the key challenges that need to be addressed. In addition, HAPS are more
    sensitive to weather conditions (e.g., high-speed wind, rain attenuation, snow
    attenuation, temperatures, and fog). As such, a robust design that makes HAPS
    stabilize in the air and operate in the desired weather conditions is needed.
    The interference is another issue that faces the HAPs communications and limits
    the link-level performance in such wireless networks. Therefore, an interference
    mitigation scheme for HAPs is required. Besides, HAPs need to be seamlessly integrated
    with the existing networks to provide high-speed backhaul/fronthaul links. Therefore,
    further investigation in this regard is needed. Developing accurate channel models
    for HAPs that aim to predict the received signal power at a given distance from
    the transmitter is of interest [386]. Developing efficient signal processing,
    resource allocation, scheduling, modulation, coding, protocols, and handover mechanisms
    for HAPs systems are also required [384]. Finally, using a large-scale MIMO system
    and mmWave frequencies with HAPs is an interesting research topic that needs to
    be investigated in the future. 3) Satellite Communication Satellite communication
    is introduced to be one of the essential technologies for future 6G networks in
    order to achieve broadband connectivity, high-capacity airborne platforms, accurate
    global coverage, and high-speed data rate backbone links. The main aim of the
    6G networks is to integrate satellite platforms with the terrestrial networks.
    The airborne communication systems and terrestrial base stations may require satellite
    connectivity to provide backhaul support and additional wide area coverage [36].
    a: Key Points of Satellite Communications Satellite communications can be efficiently
    used in navigation, emergency rescue, positioning, tracking, and detection. Satellite
    communications can be exploited to complement terrestrial networks by supporting
    several essential IoT services and other wireless communications services such
    as AR, VR, and multimedia broadcast with 4K, 8K video transmission. Owing to its
    capability, the satellite communication system has received much attention from
    both industry and academia. Typically, satellite stations are divided into three
    platforms based on their orbit characteristics. These categories include Geostationary
    Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites with a height of about 35,800 km, medium Earth orbit
    (MEO) satellites with a height between 2,000 and 35,000 km, and low Earth orbit
    (LEO) satellites with a height between 200 and 2,000 km [357]. The altitudes provided
    in Fig. 12 are predicted based on references [357], [363]. While the GEO satellite
    can cover extremely large geographical areas and is constantly seen from terrestrial
    stations, it suffers from extensive signal transmission delay and attenuation
    due to the long communication links. In contrast, LEO and MEO satellites offer
    an enhanced received signal-to-noise ratio with lower transmission delay due to
    their shorter distance to the earth. For broadband applications, the LEO satellite
    system received considerable attention in recent years. This is due to the fact
    that LEO platforms are located close to the ground in comparison to the MEO and
    GEO satellites. Hence, LEO has the ability to reduce transmission latency, mitigate
    path loss and achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, and hence, provide a high
    data rate [17], [97]. LEO satellite communication is essential for the rural and
    remote areas, which can provide greater coverage and capacity and can be used
    in combination with HAPS and UAVs-based communications systems. Besides, the Intelligent
    between the satellite and UAVs networks can be very effective for future 6G networks
    to enable wide coverage, see, e.g., [389]–[392]. Using a large-scale MIMO system
    with an LEO satellite can achieve high array gains, hence improving the communication
    performance significantly. b: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions
    Satellite communications may face some technical challenges such as doppler variation
    and doppler shift, higher bit error rate, sensitivity to path loss, and transmission
    delay due to the large communication distances [17], [393]. These challenges need
    to be addressed since they may affect communication like synchronization, reliability,
    signal processing & detection, and random access. The integration of terrestrial
    and non-terrestrial networks face challenges related to the physical layer transmission
    and media access control (MAC) protocols, e.g., random access and hybrid automatic
    repeat request (HARQ). In order to cover the earth, several satellite stations
    need to be deployed. This may create synchronization challenges as satellites
    are constantly in motion [17], [97]. Accurate air-to-ground channel modeling,
    trajectory optimization, and efficient resource allocation mechanisms for satellite
    communications are required [39]. Machine learning method can be useful for satellite
    communications systems. For example, machine learning method can be explored in
    satellite operations, weather monitoring, earth observation applications, and
    sensor fusion for navigation [363]. In addition, machine learning can be used
    to address the complexity issue in satellite networks and to improve the efficiency
    of traditional model-based algorithms for signal processing and resource allocation.
    Therefore, further research regarding the application of machine learning in satellite
    communications is required. Intelligent mobility management techniques, which
    take into account handover satellite and earth stations are required [17]. Interference
    between the terrestrial and satellite platforms is another issue that could limit
    the link-level performance in satellite networks. Another challenge is related
    to the effective utilizing of the resources and the efficient use of the available
    spectrum with satellite networks. Furthermore, developing new communication protocols
    is also required in order to achieve seamless transmissions between terrestrial
    and satellite networks [17]. Overall, despite the attractive advantages of realizing
    ubiquitous coverage in 6G networks by integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial
    networks, which may overcome the conventional coverage limitations, several challenges
    still need to be addressed before such global coverage can be effectively exploited
    in the future 6G networks. B. Cell-Free Massive MIMO System Cell-free is considered
    as a key fundamental technique to increase the connectivity and provide full-coverage
    in future 6G networks [394], [395]. In 6G networks, there will be an integration
    of different frequencies and heterogeneous communication technologies. To this
    end, the uses in the networks have to be moved seamlessly from one network to
    another without the requirement for making any manual configurations. In the currently
    deployed networks, the users mobility are subject to many handovers in the networks.
    As a results, there will be many handover delays, handover failures, and information
    losses. Therefore, 6G networks need to break the limitation of the cells concept
    in conventional wireless communications systems to achieve better quality of service.
    The cell-free on-demand coverage is established to overcome the cost-ineffectiveness
    of conventional cellular architecture. Recent results in [389] have found that
    cell-free achieves a promising solution to efficiently support massive access
    for IoE devices in the future 6G networks. It is worth noting that, the infrastructures
    of 6G networks are expected to be densified, which will cooperate to form a cell-free
    network with seamless quality of service. In particular, the network densification
    can be achieved by employing multiple access points that are connected to a central
    processing unit (CPU) [396]. The access points are arbitrarily distributed in
    a geographical area. Each access point is equipped with multiple antennas, which
    can cooperate to form a scalable cell-free network MIMO that serves multiple mobile
    devices over a large geographical area. The basic principle of cell-free massive
    MIMO comes from the conventional distributed MIMO communications [397], [398]
    or what is known as coordinated multipoint (CoMP) communications [50], [399],
    [400]. 1) Key Points of the Cell-Free Communication Cell-free massive MIMO communication
    system has the potential to achieve spatial diversity by allowing a mobile user
    to be jointly served on the same time-frequency resource by more than one base
    station in a coordinated manner. The main difference between cell-free communication
    and conventional MIMO systems is that instead of allocating each mobile user to
    a particular cell with a specific base station, which is equipped with a relatively
    large number of antenna elements, it relaxes the constraint of cell boundaries.
    Thus, the inter-cell interference caused by mobile users located at cell boundaries
    can effectively be mitigated or even eliminated. In addition, the disadvantage
    of poor channel quality that may happen when only one base station is serving
    can be effectively addressed. Furthermore, the main objective of a cell-free massive
    MIMO communication system is to achieve coherent processing over large geographically
    distributed base station antennas. This would allow an enhanced quality of service,
    nearly uniform achievable rates across the coverage area, and seamless handover
    across all mobile users regardless of their position in the networks. In cell-free
    massive MIMO systems, all mobile users have relatively equal distances to the
    allocated access points. Owing to its capability of exploring the spatial diversity
    against the fading, cell-free massive MIMO communication can potentially provide
    a much higher probability of coverage in comparison to the conventional collocated
    MIMO systems. Using a large number of arbitrarily distributed access points in
    a cell-free massive MIMO system would offer high multiplexing gain, more degrees
    of freedom, and high array gain. Cell-free massive MIMO works with any frequency
    bands, including sub-6 GHz, mmWave bands, and THz frequencies [401]. In addition,
    cell-free massive MIMO communication is particularly beneficial for cell-edge
    mobile users that experience severe large-scale fading. Cell-free networks are
    operated in TDD mode, which relies on UL/DL channel reciprocity to obtain the
    CSI for DL precoding. Cell-free massive MIMO can also be integrated with aerial
    systems to efficiently improve energy efficiency and enhance system coverage [402].
    Cell-free massive MIMO system allows low-complexity digital signal processing
    schemes to be implemented in both UL and DL transmissions. Hence, most baseband
    signal processing can be accomplished locally at the access points and under computational
    assistance from the CPU [394]. This UPU can be considered as a cloud-edge processor
    where its design is reminiscent of the framework of C-RAN [118], [403], discussed
    in III. The results in [394], [395], [404] show that cell-free massive MIMO system
    outperforms conventional small-cell and cellular massive MIMO systems. The results
    in [394] demonstrate that cell-free massive MIMO can achieve up to five times
    improvement in terms of 95%-likely per-user data rate in comparison to the conventional
    small-cell system, and, more importantly, is more robust to undesired fading and
    interference. Even an enhanced 95%-likely per-user data rate performance can be
    achieved by cell-free massive MIMO when the access points and users are equipped
    with multiple antennas [405]. Several works have investigated the performance
    of cell-free massive MIMO see, e.g., [395], [404], [406]–[412]. The works in [395],
    [404], [406]–[412] deal with cell-free massive MIMO system under different scenarios;
    namely, the work in [395] investigates precoding and power optimization, [404]
    investigates the MMSE processing, [410], [411] and [412]–[414] consider the spatially
    correlated Rayleigh and Rician fading channels, respectively, the works in [406],
    [408], [415] deal with the performance analysis and power control of cell-free
    massive MIMO system with hardware impairments, [407] investigates channel hardening
    effect and favourable propagation, while [409] considers a user-centric virtual
    cell approach with a reduced backhaul overhead. A common conclusion arises from
    [395], [404], [406]–[412] is that cell-free massive MIMO system has the potential
    to achieve a significant improvement in wireless communications systems under
    different deployment scenarios. 2) Related Challenges and Future Research Directions
    Similar to the conventional MIMO systems, the performance of cell-free massive
    MIMO relies on the accuracy of the CSI estimation, which is obtained using training
    sequence transmission between the access points and users. However, since the
    channels are varied in time and frequency, the pilot resources need to be reused
    between users. Hence, this pilot reused may cause pilot contamination that reduces
    the cell-free massive MIMO performance. In addition, CSI estimation may be problematic
    in FDD operation mode where the channel reciprocity between UL and DL does not
    hold. The backhaul is another practical constraint that faces the cell-free massive
    MIMO system, which needs to be investigated. Besides, the system-level performance
    of cell-free massive MIMO should be thoroughly investigated. For example, developing
    low-complexity scheduling techniques that achieve fairness across the users are
    required, especially when a large number of users need to be served simultaneously
    over the same time and frequency resource block. Finding feasible resource allocation
    algorithms in cell-free massive MIMO networks is also needed. In addition, optimizing
    the access point locations and how to efficiently broadcast system information
    and signals synchronization is also essential. Finding a feasible user-centric
    approach is still challenging. As such, further investigation in this regard is
    required. The application of machine learning and deep learning in cell-free massive
    MIMO systems is also an interesting research topic that needs to be investigated
    in the future. Furthermore, developing a feasible mechanism for random access
    and power control algorithms, which balance delay, fairness, and data rate, in
    cell-free massive MIMO networks is required [396]. NOMA-enabled two-step random
    access channel (RACH) [416] can be used with cell-free massive MIMO networks to
    enhance resource utilization efficiency and reduce delay [401]. This combination
    of NOMA and cell-free massive MIMO systems should be further investigated in the
    future. SECTION V. Maintaining Security, Secrecy and Privacy Security, secrecy,
    and privacy are expected to be essential parts in future 6G communications systems
    [4]. However, the technical challenges related to security, secrecy, and privacy
    should be addressed in the 6G communications systems. For example, cyber-attacks
    and physical layer security need to be addressed in future 6G communications systems.
    Hence, finding feasible techniques for addressing such challenges is crucial.
    Besides, privacy in healthcare systems is essential for patients. Therefore, 6G
    should provide the highest level of privacy and security protection, especially
    in the healthcare systems. On the other hand, the security of implantable devices
    is another important issue that needs to be considered in healthcare systems.
    Conventional solutions may not be sufficient to meet the future 6G security requirements.
    Therefore, new advanced technologies become necessary to fulfill the security,
    secrecy, and privacy requirements. Furthermore, future 6G networks are expected
    to achieve a paradigm shift toward autonomous, dynamic, and intelligence. To this
    end, blockchain, quantum communications, artificial intelligence and machine learning
    are introduced as powerful technologies for addressing the security, secrecy,
    and privacy challenges of the future 6G networks. A. Blockchain Technology Blockchain
    technology is expected to play an essential role in the security and authenticating
    of future 6G communications systems. For example, blockchain is expected to overcome
    the security issue of information communication [173], [417]–[419]. Also, blockchain
    allows simultaneous resource allocation and authentication. 1) Key Points Related
    to the Blockchain Blockchain has the potential to enhance network collaboration
    efficiency. Blockchain has several advantages such as (a) allowing reliable communication
    to be achieved; (b) achieving interoperability through devices; and (c) providing
    decentralization and transparency communications [21], [173]. Blockchain has the
    ability to exchange data between different sources reliably without going through
    a transportation center. Blockchain can be useful for mobile edge computing. Blockchain
    can also be beneficial to industrial environments since it allows straightforward
    remote access. It also controls a massive number of industrial equipment connections.
    Furthermore, blockchain can enhance the performance of healthcare systems. 2)
    Related Challenges and Future Research Directions Applying blockchain technology
    may introduce some delays in processing, which might affect the wireless communication
    performance especially in latency-sensitive applications. The scalability coming
    from the use of massively connected devices is to date considered as a potential
    issue for blockchain. In addition, blockchain requires to be customized to make
    it feasible for IoT devices with limited computation and storage resources. Therefore,
    intensive research works are required in order to find a feasible solution to
    improve the performance of blockchain and make it feasible for future 6G networks.
    B. Quantum Communication Quantum communication is a new promising technology for
    future 6G networks. Quantum communication allows strong communication systems
    security for 6G wireless networks. This is achieved by applying a quantum key
    technique, which is accomplished based on the principle of uncertainty and the
    quantum no-cloning theorem. Quantum communication has the potential to improve
    the efficiency of detecting unwanted eavesdropping behavior [420]. In addition,
    quantum communication has the potential to provide an extremely high data rate
    and strong protection against different cyber attacks [12]. Quantum communication
    is also feasible for long-distance wireless communication [38], [421]. 1) Key
    Points Related to the Quantum Communication Quantum communication has the potential
    to solve complex optimization problems with multiple objectives functions [155],
    [422]. Quantum-based techniques have the ability to execute the algorithms much
    faster and beyond the capability of the classical systems. Quantum communication
    can be combined with an artificial intelligence technique to further enhance the
    security of 6G wireless networks [119]. Quantum communication can considerably
    enhance the efficiency and speed of artificial intelligence algorithms that require
    big data and massive training. Quantum communication can be useful for the future
    6G communication networks. For example, it can enhance the channel capacity, has
    the ability to transmit an unknown quantum state, i.e, quantum teleportation,
    and to achieve a secure information, i.e., quantum cryptography by exploiting
    a number of advanced communication protocols [12]. Such advanced communication
    protocols are not possible with the classical techniques. 2) Related Challenges
    and Future Research Directions Quantum error correction is considered as a major
    technical challenge that needs to addressed. As such, developing quantum error
    correction coding scheme is of significant importance. In addition, the construction
    of network entities with quantum Internet is consider as another technical challenge
    that may face the quantum communication, which requires quantum switches/routers
    and repeaters. Another challenge is related to the capacity measures of quantum
    communication channels. This is attributed to the fact that the quantum channels
    can have different possibilities in terms of delivering information including
    quantum information, entanglement assisted classical information [12]. Therefore,
    intensive research works are required to make quantum communication practically
    feasible in future 6G communications systems. SECTION VI. Achieving Ultra-Reliable
    and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) While 5G networks support machine-type
    communication (MTC) and URLLC scenarios, 6G is expected to support massive MTC
    (mMTC) and massive URLLC (mURLLC) applications. This allows 6G networks to deliver
    any required performance within the rate-reliability-latency space. The URLLC
    in 5G networks was specified to limited reliability and latency applications.
    However, 6G networks with mMTC and mURLLC departs form the limited reliability
    and latency requirements toward archiving the scalability requirements. Also,
    6G aims to achieve the best trade-off between these requirements. These massive
    services classes of 6G networks will lead to ubiquitous mobile ultrabroadband
    (uMUB), ultrahigh- speed-with-low-latency communications (uHSLLC), and ultrahigh
    data density (uHDD) [236]. Emerging uMUB, uHSLLC, and uHDD services will require
    a new codesign of communication, control, sensing, and computing features that
    are mostly absent in the 5G networks. As such, 6G aims to fully support these
    future requirements. 6G networks are expected to evolve toward allowing massive
    ubiquitous connectivity, integration of different technologies and applications,
    enabling intelligence, and achieve massive decentralized computation operations
    [117]. 6G networks also aim to enable machine-to-machine and human-to-machine
    with real-time interactive applications such as holographic teleportation communications
    and tactile Internet and haptic, multi-sensory extended reality (XR), which includes
    augmented reality (AR) mixed reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR), as well as
    support Internet of smart things (IoST) applications [423]. The aforementioned
    Internet of Everything (IoE) applications create an ultra-high data density (uHDD)
    and some of them create core requirements for ultra-high-speed connectivity with
    ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) services. Hence, future
    6G networks need to support these applications with extremely high data rates
    and diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The ultra-low transmission
    latency requirements could be ranging from one to a few milliseconds end-to-end
    latency while the ultra-reliability communication could be higher than 99.9999%.
    Age of Information (AoI) is a new concept related to URLLC, which is introduced
    recently in order to characterize the status update quality of channel information
    and measure latency as observed by the control layer. AoI can be considered as
    an efficient indication tool for measuring the delay in real-time applications.
    However, to meet all these demands and a diverse set of requirements, 6G wireless
    networks will need to exploit an edge computing technique. This would allow some
    of the service-specific processing and data storage to be moved from the central
    cloud to edge network nodes. These edge network nodes will be located closer to
    the data providers and end-users. In addition, artificial intelligence and machine
    learning (e.g. deep neural networks) techniques are expected to be the key enabling
    factor for future 6G networks to achieve a URLLC and meet the diverse set of requirements
    and services. A. Holographic Teleportation (Telepresence) 6G networks are expected
    to support a new form of human remote interaction, which makes use of all human
    senses including hearing, vision, taste, smelling, and touch in order to provide
    real-time remote physical communication [6], [25], [393]. Holographic teleportation
    is considered as virtual teleportation in real-time, which can be conducted based
    on a three-dimensional video with mixed-reality technology. 1) Key Points for
    Holographic Teleportation Holographic teleportation exploits many multiple-view
    cameras and multiple sensors to enable real-time remote interaction and create
    a reconstruction of in-person hologram [25]. This can be seen as a paradigm shift
    from traditional video conferencing to a virtual real-time in-person meeting,
    thus improving the communicating experience, allowing virtual concerts, enabling
    virtual sports, and more indicative remote/distance education. Holographic teleportation
    is considered one of the applications that require massive URLLC service. However,
    such connectivity and powered interaction and communications will require a huge
    amount of information in terms of image and video, In addition, it requires a
    data rate with an order of terabits per second (Tb/s) [25], [167]. To this end,
    the work in [424] demonstrates that to display three-dimensional holographic teleportation
    with a raw hologram, 4.32 Tb/s data rate is required. 2) Related Challenges and
    Future Research Directions Holographic teleportation requires an end-to-end latency
    in an order of sub-millisecond [39]. Therefore, to enable holographic teleportation,
    new semantic inference algorithms are required [25]. Such algorithms would allow
    the incorporation of knowledge representation in communications [25]. In addition,
    ultra-reliable communication with extremely large bandwidth is required for conveying
    holographic information. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and machine learning
    techniques maybe the key enabler for future holographic communications. Hence,
    further investigation of applying artificial intelligence and machine learning
    techniques for holographic communications is required. B. Tactile Internet The
    Tactile Internet is described by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
    as an Internet network that incorporates ultra-low latency with extremely high
    reliability. Thus, Tactile Internet requires a URLLC communication service [249].
    Tactile Internet allows real-time interaction between human-to-machine and machine-to-machine
    over a wireless network [425]. The Tactile Internet has been defined by the IEEE
    P1918.1 standard in [426] as a real-time virtual object network or a mechanism
    for remote controlling access perception. There are various applications for Tactile
    Internet such as education, business, healthcare (telesurgery), industrial (telemaintenance),
    smart grid and societal [427]. The Tactile Internet service is the next evolution
    that will allow the IoE applications to be controlled in real-time. 1) Key Points
    of Tactile Internet Tactile Internet has the ability to enhance the interaction
    of all human senses with machines. Tactile Internet is the key to enable haptic
    interaction, which is mainly related to sense/perception of touch in humans and
    is known as kinesthetic perception communication [428], [429]. Tactile Internet
    has the potential to provide an ultra-reliable/ultra-responsive communication
    network to the haptic [430]. Tactile Internet can be used in intelligent transportation
    to avoid collision owing to its low end-to-end latency and high reliability [431].
    Tactile Internet has the potential to revolutionize the current online/distance
    learning and online works. Tactile Internet can be supported by the edge and fog
    computing technologies, which enable fast response communication, high reliability
    and availability [432]. 2) Related Challenges and Future Research Directions To
    enable efficient Tactile Internet service, a new artificial intelligence algorithm
    for edge and fog cloud architectures is necessary. In addition, efficient cross-layer
    architecture is required to meet the stringent requirements of Tactile Internet
    service. Also, new advanced physical layer techniques are needed. For example,
    new designs for channel coding, advanced waveform multiplexing, and multiple-access
    techniques for Tactile Internet service are required [249]. Furthermore, 6G networks
    will require seamless integration of various technologies, ultra-high-speed connectivity,
    high-speed backhaul, new air interface, new mechanisms for protocols, a new queuing
    scheme, new scheduling mechanism, and efficient coding techniques. C. Multi-Sensory
    Extended Reality (XR) Applications Augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR),
    and virtual reality (VR) are considered as use cases of URLLC services [249] and
    part of IoE applications [35]. Existing AR/MR/VR applications, which are recently
    included under a new umbrella term as XR [362], greatly benefit from the Tactile
    Internet technology [249], discussed in subsection VI-B. Exceptionally high data
    rate and extremely low latency are required to achieve a fully AR/MR/VR immersive
    communication experience [39]. Tactile Internet can be anticipated to enable an
    extremely low-latency requirement and allow shared virtual environments with real-time
    interaction. Tactile Internet allows the static contents in XR to be transferred
    to a dynamic [433]. 1) Key Points Related to the XR Communication XR has the potential
    to combine real and virtual environments. Such applications would use a computer-simulated
    platform with reality experience and create a virtual world that looks exactly
    like the real world. In addition, the audios, videos, global positioning system
    (GPS) would be exploited to create an interactive environment for XR technologies.
    XR is considered as one of the key applications of future 6G networks [434]. XR
    enables users to virtually interacting and engaging with playing games, painting,
    educating, experiencing sports, and attending concerts [36], [435]. XR can also
    allow interactive extension of the field of view of a user so that it is possible
    to prevent harmful incidents [433]. VR and AR applications have already been considered
    by the IEEE working group (IEEE P2048), where 12 IEEE standards have been developed
    in this version [436]. VR and AR applications can play an essential role in telemedicine.
    For example, such applications can be used in renal intervention to allow precise
    planning and achieve three-dimensional orientation [437]. 2) Related Challenges
    and Future Research Directions The application of XR technology in 6G networks
    would increase the amount of data traffic. Therefore, advanced techniques to offload
    such huge data traffic in future heterogeneous networks are required. In addition,
    efficient utilization of spectrum resources is needed in order to meet the low
    transmission latency requirements of XR technology. Furthermore, developing new
    data compression schemes, data streaming management, and synchronization for efficient
    XR applications are of interest. Besides, developing an accurate estimation of
    the distance of the object in a virtual environment, e.g., depth perception, is
    crucial. D. Internet of Smart Things Applications Internet of things (IoT) is
    defined as interconnected machines and objects that contain various computing
    capabilities [438]. In IoT networks, several different sensors and chips are embedded
    in physical devices or objects, which make them wirelessly connected [418]. These
    physical sensors and objects have the ability to exchange a huge amount of data
    between each other and with other digital components without any human intervention.
    The IoT connections and applications are expected to be significantly increased
    in the future 6G communications systems. 6G networks are expected to support massive
    Internet of smart things connections, which include smart cities, smart radio
    environments, smart healthcare systems, smart grids, smart transportation, smart
    factories, smart farming, and smart home. Fig. 14 summarizes the key smart applications,
    which will be discussed in the next subsections. Generally speaking, the vast
    majority of these smart applications are delay-sensitive, energy-demanding, small
    in size, and required computational demanding signal processing capabilities [439]–[442].
    FIGURE 14. The key essential applications on the Internet of Smart Things (IoST).
    Show All FIGURE 15. Network platforms with MEC. Show All 1) Smart City A smart
    city aims to exploit a massive amount of sensors, which can be deployed in buildings,
    vehicles, roads, factories, and houses to support an extremely large variety of
    services for the city’s administration, companies and individuals [443]. One of
    the smart city goals is to improve the quality of service offered by citizens,
    make better use of public resources, and reduce the operational costs [443]. a:
    Key Points for Smart City The implementation of a smart city would bring a significant
    advantage in terms of controlling the traditional services. This includes public
    transportation networks, surveillance for security, garbage collection/waste management,
    and maintaining public areas. Smart cities would improve the awareness of citizens
    about the city status. Several essential things, sensors, and services can be
    enabled by the smart city. For example, enabling smart buildings, deployment sensors
    to monitor air quality, which may help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, monitor
    the traffic congestion and traffic management, allowing an automatic water system
    for gardens, monitor energy consumption, enabling smart utilities of electricity
    and water, and enabling the use of smart parking and smart lighting. Hence, a
    unified network architecture might be deployed in 6G networks. A smart city ecosystem
    is expected to be further explored in 6G networks. Hence, edge computing, software-defined
    networks, and artificial intelligence algorithms are expected to be used in smart
    cities to achieve a secure transmission, automatic maintenance, intelligent real-time
    monitoring system, and seamless networking. b: Related Challenges and Future Research
    Directions Further investigation about the application of artificial intelligence
    in a smart city is required. Besides, maintaining connectivity in smart cities
    may raise several challenges. For example, providing a reliable connectivity to
    massively deployed devices with high mobility is required [444]. In addition,
    an advance technique to allow a connectivity transition from device to network
    level and vice versa is essential. Also, big data analytics is to date considered
    as a one of the major research challenges in the IoT-based smart cities applications
    [445]. Finding a feasible solutions for low power consumption to maintain battery
    life at very low cost in smart city applications are required. Further research
    investigations to address the aforementioned challenges are needed. 2) Smart Radio
    Environments 6G networks are envisioned to realize distributed intelligent wireless
    communications. 6G networks also aim to make the wireless environment, denoted
    by the radio waves, controllable and more energy-efficient [101]. This motivates
    the development of smart radio environment, where the physical objects are coated
    with large reconfigurable material, which is termed as large reconfigurable intelligent
    surfaces [101]. Further discussion about reconfigurable intelligent surfaces is
    provided in subsection II-B. Smart radio environments have the capability to provide
    future 6G networks with more wireless connectivity and coverage [101]. In addition,
    smart radio environments have the potential to transmit information without generating
    new radio signals [101]. The propagation of radio waves will be shaped and customized
    using large reconfigurable meta-material surfaces. Thus, smart radio environments
    will reduce energy consumption, improve connectivity and increase communication
    reliabilit [446]–[448]. Smart radio environments extend the network softwarization
    concept from the logical domain into the physical domain. Therefore, radio environments
    can be remotely controlled, configured, programmed, and optimized. a: Related
    Challenges and Future Research Directions There are still many practical issues
    related to the radio environments that need to be investigated and addressed in
    the future. For example, experimental validation, measurements, hardware implementation,
    and accurate channel modeling that reflects the realistic characteristics of using
    smart radio environment require thorough investigation [89], [449]. 3) Smart Healthcare
    According to the world health organization, almost 524 million people were aged
    more than 65 years and it is expected to grow to 1.5 billion by 2050 [450]. Such
    aging of the population worldwide makes traditional healthcare systems unsustainable
    in the future. Hence, developing smart remote healthcare systems or making telemedicine
    systems to be smarter through IoT becomes crucial [451]. At the same time, recent
    years have witnessed significant advancements in sensing and communication technologies.
    This has opened up new possibilities for efficient and real-time remote patients’
    health monitoring and intelligent medical systems. Besides, recent years have
    witnessed a huge growth in the number of IoT wearable/implantable devices and
    sensors that can perform different functionalities. The devices and sensors can
    be placed close to (off-body), attached on (on-body), or implanted inside the
    human body (in-body) [452]. Connected these devices and sensors wirelessly lead
    to what known as a wireless body area network (WBAN) [453], which has the potential
    to monitor humans and provide real-time information about their health. In addition,
    patients’ symptoms can be extracted from the data provided by these IoT devices
    and sensors. Therefore, patients can be remotely treated, which will result in
    more efficient and smarter remote healthcare systems. a: Key Points Related to
    the Smart Healthcare Smart healthcare systems allow doctors to remotely monitor
    the patients. Further, the progression of patients’ disease can also be monitored
    [451]. Smart healthcare systems help in disease detection, diagnosis, recognition,
    prediction, prevention, and treatments. The heterogeneous data collection from
    different devices and sensors can be stored and analyzed so that the doctors can
    easily access the patients’ records. However, such large amounts of real-time
    data may lead to what known as a big data challenge [451]. Therefore, new feasible
    solutions and algorithms are required to deal with such a vast amount of heterogeneous
    real-time data. In addition, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
    can be exploited to analyze data, increase reliability and accuracy, allow real-time
    fast processing and make smart decisions [454]. The work in [455] proposes a smart
    e-health gateway based on IoT, which can be used to address some of the communication
    challenges related to healthcare systems such as interoperability, reliability,
    security, and scalability. Therefore, future 6G networks aim to exploit a smart
    healthcare system to allow easy remote diagnostics where the patients can be diagnosed
    and treated even though they are physically located far away from hospitals and
    clinics, i.e., at their homes. Another potential of 6G networks is to allow remote
    surgery. Future 6G networks are expected to adopt advanced technologies to assist
    medical care and in-home remote monitoring. Future 6G networks are visioned to
    advance the current healthcare systems to allow further decentralization, and
    improve security and privacy performances. Future 6G networks aim to achieve more
    harmonious human-machine interaction and a more efficient medical process. However,
    healthcare applications are delay-sensitive and require extremely ultra-reliable
    communications. Recently, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has been introduced
    as a new concept related to IoT devices and sensors that deal with medical applications.
    IoMT deals with medical data collection (obtained from different patients), and
    medical software applications. IoMT has the potential to make fast decisions,
    predict risks and take suitable actions automatically. Security and privacy issues
    are essential for IoMT, which is needed to protect the patient’s data. However,
    the use of the IoMT system for diagnosis may raise several challenges related
    to the accuracy of clinical guidelines, as well as medico-legal and ethical concerns
    [454]. Fog/edge computing networks are promising techniques that can be used to
    address some of the challenges in healthcare systems [456]. The Internet of Nano
    things (IoNT) concept has been introduced in [457], which has the potential to
    drive innovation in smart healthcare applications [456]. This is attributed to
    the limited size of devices and sensors, i.e., microscales and nanoscales, which
    can be easily distributed, implanted, attached on or close to a human body [438].
    These IoNT devices and sensors can be cooperated and connected together through
    a unified network and performed different signal processing tasks. Motivated by
    the advancement in the field of nanotechnology and synthetic biology, the Internet
    of Bio-Nano thing (IoBNT) concept has been recently introduced as a viable solution
    for smart healthcare systems [438]. Therefore, molecular communication has been
    proposed as a key enabling technique for IoBNT, whereby biochemical molecules
    can be exploited to encode, transfer and receive information among nanodevices
    [458], [459]. b: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions The security
    and privacy issues are considered as major challenges that face the healthcare
    system. Typically, the patient’s health information should be carefully stored
    and considered sensitive. Failing to do so may lead to humiliation and wrong treatments.
    Hence, reliable and advanced commutation and networking techniques are essential.
    Besides, further research studies in investigating the use of molecular communication
    in smart healthcare systems are required in the future. In addition, further investigation
    related to the practical implementation of molecular communication with IoBNT
    is needed. 4) Smart Grid 6G networks aim to improve electricity production and
    transit the traditional centralized energy grid towards a distributed generation
    system, which can heavily depend on renewable energy as an essential source of
    power and smartly control the energy usage. Hence, such energy grid system should
    be smartly connected and controlled using advanced communication technologies.
    Therefore, efficient smart grid systems can be exploited. Smarts grid is defined
    as an intelligent electricity network that is integrated with communication technologies
    to achieve economic and social benefits [460]. a: Key Points Related to the Smart
    Grid Smart grid is a promising power infrastructure that can intelligently control
    electricity usage and achieve bidirectional communication between electricity
    suppliers and consumers. In smart grid, several advanced smart meters, smart devices,
    renewable energy resources, sensing and control technologies can be used. The
    data collected from these sources can also be monitored and analyzed in real-time
    to provide predictive information and useful recommendations to all stakeholders,
    e.g., electricity suppliers, grid operators and consumers [460]. Deploying smart
    grid system would have the advantages of improving substantially and managing
    electricity usage [461]. Hence, all stakeholders (e.g., electricity suppliers
    grid operators and consumers) can benefit from this smart implementation. b: Related
    Challenges and Future Research Directions Maintaining the system security in the
    smart grid distributed network is considered as a major challenge [460]–[462].
    Therefore, further research to address the security challenges in smart grid networks
    is required. Besides, increasing interconnection and integration of smart grid
    networks may introduce several challenges. As such, further research works to
    overcome these technical challenges are needed. 5) Smart Transportation Smart
    transportation (also known as intelligent transportation) is a promising technology
    for future 6G networks, which allows autonomous vehicles to communicate with each
    other, exchange information with other end devices and public networks [463].
    Smart transportation is considered as a special case of smart cities [444]. a:
    Key Points Related to the Smart Transportation Smart transportation helps in reducing
    the number of vehicle accidents significantly [464]. Smart transportation-based
    vehicular communication networks can facilitate several mobile data services,
    allow self-driving assistance and enable traffic management [465], [466]. Typically,
    the vehicles can be equipped with several sensors to make them more smarter and
    automated [466]. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is one of the autonomous vehicular
    networks application that has already been considered by IEEE standard (IEEE 802.11)
    [464]. To date, various information exchange methods and protocols among vehicles
    and infrastructure have been introduced [464]. Recently, the Internet of Vehicles
    (IoV) concept is introduced as an extension to the conventional V2X communication
    in order to allow ubiquitous automotive networks with an extremely large number
    of applications and functions [464]. Vehicle’s communications systems require
    URLLC and high level of security. To achieve this requirement, edge computing
    has recently been introduced by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
    (ETSI) [467] as a promising solution to satisfy the URLLC transmission requirements
    of autonomous vehicles communications [468]. Further details regarding edge computing
    systems are provided in the next subsection. Artificial intelligence techniques
    may also play an essential role in enabling and supporting efficient vehicle communications
    systems for future 6G networks. However, combining various conventional and emerging
    wireless technologies are required in order to fully deploy connected vehicle
    networks. Furthermore, future vehicular communications systems require special
    design network architecture to support high-speed vehicles and massive connectivity
    [468]. Network slicing can be considered as a feasible solution to support vehicular
    communication, whereby the physical networks can be sliced into multiple virtual
    networks. b: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions Enabling network
    slicing in future 6G networks is still an open research topic that worth investigating.
    In addition, advanced networking techniques to support high-speed vehicles and
    massive connectivity in vehicular communications systems are required. 6) Smart
    Factories The last decade has witnessed a huge growth in industrialization and
    informatization methods. This has motivated the progress in developing the next
    generation of smart manufacturing and factories technologies [469]. The fourth
    industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0 [470], is the latest trend in the manufacturing
    sector, which is characterized by a high degree of automation, productivity, operational
    efficiency and industrial integration [471]–[473]. Automatic control systems and
    communication technologies can be integrated and effectively used in Industry
    4.0 in order to reduce the requirement for human intervention in the industrial
    process. Such a combination between automatic control systems and communication
    technologies leads to the implementation of industrial control network (ICN) [474],
    [475]. ICN has been introduced recently by 5G NR standard as a specific URLLC
    application [475]. Wireless isochronous real-time (WIRT) system has been introduced
    in [475] to further improve the performance of ICN in Industry 4.0. 6G networks
    aim to revolutionize the manufacturing industry by achieving fully digitize manufacturing,
    making use of robotics and automation systems, remote maintenance, customization
    of products, and achieve higher flexibility in product development, and guarantee
    full connection with the entire production cycle. a: Key Points Related to the
    Smart Factory Smart factory tends to keep a reasonable balance between supply
    and demand, make advanced product planning and developing, achieve best practice
    selling and shipping products and automatic monitoring. This can be achieved through
    the use of unified networks. In addition, future 6G networks tend to manage the
    resources in terms of power, water, and the flow of environmental waste. Besides,
    future 6G networks aim to move toward the circular economy with reuse, remote
    repair, re-manufacture, recycle, and refurbish [401]. Furthermore, there is a
    need for a fluent ecosystem collaboration. Thus, more seamless and collaboration
    between humans, robots, and machines are crucial for 6G networks [476]. For example,
    devices, machines, and humans will be connected together and exchange information
    inside factories [401]. These functionalities will indeed require real-time data
    processing as well as low latency and high-reliability communications. Also, these
    functionalities need the convergence of multiple technologies. Edge computing
    and artificial intelligence can be used to support the smart factory requirements
    [477], [478]. MmWave (particularly 60 GHz band) is identified as a possible solution
    towards achieving the URLLC in smart factory [475]. b: Related Challenges and
    Future Research Directions Smart factory requires massive connectivity of industrial
    manufacturing equipment. Therefore, decentralized network architectures become
    necessary. Besides, independent and intelligent decision-making methods are needed
    to achieve full autonomous factories. Further research investigations regarding
    the role of edge computing, artificial intelligence, and mmWave frequency in enabling
    smart factories are required. The latency and scalability issues are to date considered
    as major challenges in smart factories. Further investigations to address the
    latency and scalability challenges in a smart factory are required. 7) Smart Farming
    Smart farming is a concept that makes use of communication technology in farming
    [479]. The application of wireless communication technologies in smart farming
    allows a large variety of services to be achieved. For example, it enables the
    farmers to save time and effort, achieve better productivity and profit [480].
    a: Key Points Related to the Smart Farming Smart farming enables an intelligent
    water system and achieves the best irrigation, automation and precision, plant
    monitoring, crop and livestock, weather forecasting and monitoring and plant diseases
    detection [481]–[485]. Smart farming can also be exploited to ensure proper plant
    lighting and moisture for optimum growth, improving greenhouse plant production
    and disease prediction [486], [487]. This would allow an increase in food production
    and food security, which is considered as a major concern for most countries [488].
    New enabling technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence
    are expected to be used in this development. Machine learning algorithms can be
    used for disease recognition from the plant/leaves images. Besides, advanced data
    analytics schemes can be utilized to enhance the operational efficiency and productivity
    in the smart farming sector [488]. UAV technology can also play an essential role
    in a smart farming system. For example, UAVs can be feasibly used by farmers to
    monitor the farm condition at the beginning of any crop year [489]. In addition,
    UAVs can also be exploited in soil monitoring, field analysis, irrigation, and
    in managing the nitrogen level to achieve better crop growth [489], [490]. Hence,
    smart farming can get special benefit from the integration between airborne, terrestrial,
    and satellite communications networks. b: Related Challenges and Future Research
    Directions However, the scalability issue in smart farming, which may result from
    using billions of IoT devices and sensors as well as UAVs, is considered a major
    technical challenge that needs to be addressed in smart farming. Hence, further
    research to overcome the scalability issue in smart farming is required. 8) Smart
    Home Smart home is one of IoT applications, which is defined as a network of pervasive
    physical devices that provide context-aware services [491]. a: Key Points Related
    to the Smart Home Smart home has the ability to monitor home environment, facilitate
    remote residents’ interactions and provide remote meter reading of different utilities
    such as electricity, gas and water [492], [493]. Smart home can also be used for
    different purposes, including healthcare monitoring, managing energy consumption
    and home automation. Smart home system has the potential to improve the safety
    in home, which can be achieved by using multiple sensors for intelligent monitoring
    and deploying smart video surveillance. Smart home system can assure more economic
    and comfortable home operation. It can also provide a high degree of intelligent
    functionality and flexibility [491]. Furthermore, smart home has the potential
    to provide useful information and assistive services anytime and anywhere [494].
    b: Related Challenges and Future Research Directions The security and scalability
    are two major challenges in smart home system. Therefore, data encryption and
    cryptography algorithms and data compression methods are required to address these
    challenges [495], [496]. Further investigation to address these challenges in
    smart home is needed. E. Edge Computing Driven by the IoST requirements, discussed
    in the previous section, recent years have witnessed a new paradigm shift towards
    enabling softwarization and virtualization of networks, i.e., achieve programmable
    decentralized networks by allowing the use of edge computing [497]. This can be
    achieved by dividing the network into different communication layers or Tiers
    from end-user devices to edge computing platform to core and cloud (data center)
    platform. These layers can be used to overcome the long propagation distance from
    the end-user to the cloud center, and thus, can address the delay sensitivity
    of the IoT applications [497]. 1) Key Points Related to the Edge Computing Mobile
    edge computing (MEC) is considered as an important type of edge computing platform
    that located on the edge of a cellular network and can rapidly process large amounts
    of data upon receipt [498], [499]. The key concept of MEC is to move part of the
    service-specific processing, computing, and data storage from the centralized
    cloud core network to edge network nodes, which can be located near data providers
    and end-users [476], [500]. Several intensive computation services can be offloaded
    to MEC, which consists from network of servers [497]. Thus, MEC is considered
    as a key enabling technology to achieve URLLC, traffic optimization, enhancing
    the performance of 6G networks [476]. Using MEC in 6G yields a significant improvement
    in network capacity completes critical delay-sensitive tasks and accomplishes
    network-intensive computations. MEC can be used as an effective solution to extend
    the battery life in mobile devices and reduce the network energy consumption since
    huge mobile applications with highly demanding signal processing can be offloaded
    to MEC [105]. MEC is responsible for enhancing the network capabilities and management,
    improving services, achieving energy and resource management, and reducing the
    load on the backhaul [499]. Cisco has recently introduced the idea of fog computing,
    which is similar to MEC. In a fog computing network, the definition of edge devices
    becomes wider [500], [501]. All these essential tasked with MEC can be accomplished
    based on a virtualized software-based platform that makes use of network functions
    virtualization (NFV) [502] and software-defined networks (SDN) [503]. NFV allows
    a single edge computing server to provide several mobile devices with computing
    services. This is achieved by creating multiple virtual machines that able to
    conduct several tasks simultaneously or operate various network functions [504].
    In addition, NFV has the potential to manage computing services and enhance the
    reliability, scalability, and flexibility of the network services [502]. On the
    other hand, SDN allows the MEC network to dynamically managing different services.
    It also has the potential to decouple control and data plane [503], [505]–[507].
    SDN can provide a logically centralized control platform to the edge computing
    network [508]. Using such centralized control platform would allow easier management
    of data traffic within the network, achieve optimal resource allocation, address
    the scalability issue in the network, reduce overhead, improve the reliability
    of the network, and most importantly reduced the latency. Several different IoT
    applications can benefit from edge computing including a smart home for monitoring
    and metering, healthcare for monitoring and data generated, video surveillance
    for security, a smart grid for energy management, smart cities for controlling
    cities light, smart transportation, and monitoring environment. Edge computing
    enables real-time interactive applications such as holographic teleportation,
    Tactile Internet and XR [401], [432], [499]. Combining edge computing with artificial
    intelligence techniques leads to a new communication paradigm shift known as edge
    intelligence, which can play an essential role in 6G networks [476], [509]. 6G
    networks will adopt distributed artificial intelligence, which moves the intelligence
    from the central cloud to edge computing. Edge intelligence capability will support
    the development of new Internet of intelligent things (IoIT) services and functions
    of 6G networks. Edge intelligence has the potential to perform data analysis and
    develop solutions near data providers and end-users. In addition, edge intelligence
    can improve data security and preserve privacy, reduce cost, allow adaptive traffic
    control, reduce latency and reduce network traffic congestion. Edge intelligence
    can also be exploited to achieve more reliable and safer autonomous driving in-vehicle
    networks [510]. Recently, the work in [511] proposes a dynamic resource allocation
    scheme for edge intelligence, which is located at the edge server. Besides, deep
    reinforcement learning can be explored to reduce the latency, facilitate the automated
    execution of IoT applications and improve the network capacity. From a communication
    perspective, IRS technique has been recently proposed as a solution to enhance
    the performance of the MEC system [104]. The results showed that IRS is able to
    improve the performance of the MEC system. NOMA technique has also been recently
    combined with MEC system to improve offloading performance, maximize the system
    capacity and achieve an energy saving [287], [512]. 2) Related Challenges and
    Future Research Directions Resource management, mobility management, and network
    security are the main challenges that face edge computing deployment. Data offloading
    with vehicle communication is to date considered as a challenging issue due to
    the high-speed movement of vehicles. Besides, there is an essential requirement
    to cope with traffic congestion in high mobility environments and make an intelligent
    decision for data offloading. Furthermore, developing efficient learning algorithms
    for realizing edge intelligence and network optimization is required. Also, new
    network architectures for supporting distributed edge learning are needed. Developing
    efficient algorithms for analyzing big data that gathering from different IoT
    devices is essential. Besides, developing an efficient data compression scheme
    that copes with such big data is necessary. In addition, there is an essential
    requirement to design a dynamic and flexible network configuration for mobile
    edge computing with heterogeneous environments. Therefore, developing new communication
    protocols for edge computing with a heterogeneous environment is of interest.
    SECTION VII. Realizing Intelligence There is no doubt that future 6G wireless
    communications networks will encounter many technical challenges. A large amount
    of data will be periodically collected in real-time from various smart, sensing,
    and wearable devices. This huge data collection results in what known as a big
    data challenge. To cope with these requirements and challenges, future 6G networks
    need to be super intelligent and automated both at the edge and the core of networks.
    Also, future 6G networks require performing self-learning, carry out self-configuration,
    allocate resources dynamically, and make a suitable decision. Future 6G networks
    are expected to realize intelligence and make use of several control functions
    and predictive data analytics [513]. Such intelligence in networking the future
    6G systems will reduce the complexity of traditional model-based algorithms and
    make them efficiently managed and optimized. Besides, artificial intelligence
    and machine learning are considered as key enablers to make 6G networks more intelligent
    and achieve a high level of dynamic network management and optimization. Artificial
    intelligence and machine learning techniques have the potential to help network
    operators to carry out intelligent operations and enrich decision making in wireless
    communications systems [514]. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
    are essential for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in 6G networks
    [30], [515]. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
    are expected to play an essential role in the security of future 6G networks.
    Compared to the other related survey papers on artificial intelligence, we provide
    an in-depth discussion of the role of artificial intelligence, machine learning,
    and deep learning techniques in future 6G networks. In particular, this paper
    explains in details the effectiveness of exploiting the artificial intelligence
    and machine learning techniques in enabling the key future technologies of 6G
    networks. The main focuses in this paper is on wireless communications systems.
    Furthermore, this paper identifies the challenges related to the application of
    artificial intelligence and machine learning in future 6G networks. This paper
    also opens up new opportunity for future research directions. Further details
    about artificial intelligence and machine learning are discussed in the following
    section. A. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Artificial intelligence
    and machine learning is expected to play an essential role in the future 6G networks.
    In general, artificial intelligence makes the machines behave like humans. It
    also allows the machines to make suitable decisions and achieve specific goals.
    Machine learning, in particular, is considered as a part of artificial intelligence,
    which allows the computer agents to precept, gain knowledge, thinking, and make
    intelligent decisions based on the data collected. Typically, machine learning
    learns the essential information either from data-sets or by interactions with
    existing environments [516]. 1) Key Points of Using Artificial Intelligence and
    Machine Learning Techniques in the Wireless Systems Artificial intelligence and
    machine learning techniques are expected to be integrated into the optimization,
    planning, and design of the future 6G wireless communications networks. This includes
    supporting massive essential services such as healthcare, industrial manufacturing,
    online education, online shopping, online gaming, and customer services [476].
    Furthermore, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques will be the
    core technique for future 6G wireless communications systems, which have the ability
    to achieve intelligence resource management, intelligence decision-making, smart
    estimation and detection, smart routing, automated maintenance, automated network
    operations, and managements [35], [517]. Artificial intelligence and machine learning
    can also be used to enhance the communication system performance, process massive
    amounts of data, reduce energy consumption, and reduce end-to-end network latency.
    Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have the potential to
    address the challenges related to the network complexity and maintaining the quality
    of service [517]. Artificial intelligence and machine learning can be utilized
    in the design of future autonomous wireless systems [518]. Artificial intelligence
    and machine learning algorithms can also be useful for satellite communications
    systems. Also, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are essential
    for interference mitigation, weather monitoring, managing the spectrum and power
    resources, sensor fusion for navigation, managing the large constellations, and
    optimizing the operation of satellite networks [363]. Artificial intelligence
    and machine learning have the opportunity to address various wireless communications
    problems such as classification, network optimization, signal detection, protocol
    designs, analysis, and sparse signal recovery [12], [519]. Deep learning techniques
    are classified into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning [516],
    [519]–[522], as shown in Fig. 16. Each one of these techniques has its unique
    features. For example, in supervised learning, the labeled training data sets,
    which should be known beforehand, are required. Typically, supervised learning
    needs a large number of data sets (pairs of input and desired output) to be trained.
    In contrast, in unsupervised learning, the labeled data sets are not needed, which
    aims to infer features in the data sets. Finally, data sets that are obtained
    from implementation rather than historical data sets are needed in reinforcement
    learning, which allows the learning agents to learn from experience. In reinforcement
    learning, at every step, the learning agents observe the state of the environment,
    perform an action or make a satiable decision and then move to the next stage.
    Reinforcement learning is considered to be more feasible for dynamic wireless
    communications systems [523], [524]. Machine learning technology can be effectively
    used in telemedicine systems [525]. In addition, machine learning techniques can
    be exploited with intelligent programmable metasurfaces to achieve high energy
    efficiency, reduce the system overhead, and allow high-accuracy object recognition
    [526]–[528]. Furthermore, machine learning techniques can be effectively utilized
    in interference management for UAV communications systems [524]. FIGURE 16. Artificial
    intelligence and machine learning techniques along with their classifications.
    Show All 2) Key Points Related to the Deep Learning Technique Deep learning is
    considered as a special method of machine learning, which makes use of large multi-layers
    artificial neural networks (ANNs). Deep learning is a powerful technique that
    can be useful for speech recognition, wireless optimization and image processing
    [529]. Deep learning can also be efficiently used in numeral recognition, features
    extraction, and in many signal processing applications [530]–[532]. Furthermore,
    deep learning can be utilized in joint radar communications systems. It can effectively
    be used to allocate the required resources dynamically with a reduced overhead
    [56]. Deep learning has the potential to address the challenges related to the
    channel estimation in high frequency and high mobility scenarios. Besides, deep
    learning can be exploited for data compression, dimensionality reduction regression,
    clustering, classification, density estimation, and data recovery. For example,
    deep learning can be used in data compression by extracting the most significant
    features from a specific data. Hence, such efficient features extraction using
    deep learning method can be utilized to identify the compressed data with high
    accuracy. As such, the data size and end-to-end latency can be significantly reduced.
    In addition. deep learning is considered an essential tool for addressing many
    technical challenges related to UAVs-based communications systems. Deep learning
    is also a promising method for addressing many technical challenges related to
    wireless AR, MR, and VR. Deep learning technique is expected to play an essential
    role in the design of mobile edge caching and computing approaches. Deep learning
    has the potential to encode the data automatically by jointly learning transmitter
    and receiver implementations [533]. These tasks can be accomplished without any
    prior knowledge. Deep learning can guarantee performance improvements in complex
    communications scenarios, which are challenging to be described with tractable
    mathematical models. For example, deep learning has been considered in [534] for
    blind detection in MIMO communications systems with low-resolution quantization.
    In [535], a deep learning method has been used for solving resource management
    problems in wireless communication systems. Recently, deep learning has been investigated
    for signal compression [536], channel decoding [537], channel coding [538], improve
    the estimation quality of a massive MIMO system in single carrier modulation [539]
    and in multicarrier modulation [540] and modulation recognition networks [541].
    Furthermore, in [542]–[544], hybrid precoding for mmWave massive MIMO communications
    systems has been investigated using a deep learning approach. The results showed
    that the deep learning approach improves the communication system performance
    and allows less computation time in comparison with conventional techniques. In
    addition, deep learning technique can be exploited to accomplish different tasks
    for compressing sensing [545], [546]. Deep learning technique can also be jointly
    combined with the traditional optimization theory to speed up the computation
    of the optimal resources in wireless communications networks. Deep learning technology
    has the potential to support adaptive and real-time massive MIMO beamforming so
    that to properly track the structural information of the radio channels, efficiently
    allocate the required power, and capture mobility patterns. 3) Related Challenges
    and Future Research Directions The adaptation of artificial intelligence and machine
    learning algorithms in future 6G networks is essentially required to discover
    their full potential gain in wireless communications systems. In particular, to
    guarantee the quality of service requirements, which are standard in the design
    of the wireless communications systems, a detailed understanding of the fundamental
    performance limits with artificial intelligence and machine learning applications
    is needed. Conventional artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms
    might not be readily implemented in mobile or wearable devices due to their high
    complexity and energy consumption. Hence, developing efficient algorithms, which
    are suitable for implementation in small devices, are required. In addition, the
    tradeoff between prediction accuracy of artificial intelligence and machine learning
    algorithms and the training complexity needs to be considered. Besides, there
    are some technical challenges related to the long convergence times of machine-learning
    algorithms. Therefore, further investigation to find efficient machine-learning
    algorithms with fast convergence times is required. Furthermore, wireless networks
    are subject to highly dynamic mobility and traffic conditions. As such, feasible
    algorithms that cope with these realistic conditions are crucial. Federated learning
    is considered a promising technique that can be applied to enhance learning efficiency
    [509], [547]. However, the application of federated learning in future 6G networks
    needs to be further investigated. Further research is needed to investigate the
    use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for channel estimation
    with high mobility environments and with mmWave channels. SECTION VIII. Conclusion

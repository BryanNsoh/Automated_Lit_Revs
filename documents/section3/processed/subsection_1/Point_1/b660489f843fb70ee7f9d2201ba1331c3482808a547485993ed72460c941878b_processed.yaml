  analysis: 'The paper presents a novel approach to estimating soil moisture content
    using optical satellite data, referred to as the Optical Trapezoid Model (OPTRAM).
    OPTRAM is formulated based on a linear physical relationship between soil moisture
    and Shortwave Infrared Transformed Reflectance (STR). The applicability of OPTRAM
    is demonstrated using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for an agricultural field in
    Hungary. The results show that the model can effectively capture soil moisture
    variability within the field, and mapping its distribution.


    The paper contributes to the outline point by providing insights into the use
    of specific data types for irrigation management. It focuses on the application
    of optical remote sensing data for estimating soil moisture content, which is
    a key parameter in irrigation scheduling. The paper describes the theoretical
    basis of the OPTRAM model, its parameterization for a specific location, and its
    application for mapping soil moisture within an agricultural field.


    Overall, the paper offers valuable information on the types of data most applicable
    to irrigation management and their typical sources. It demonstrates the use of
    optical satellite data, particularly Sentinel-2 imagery, for estimating soil moisture
    and highlights the potential benefits of remote sensing technologies in supporting
    irrigation management practices.'

    \ water stress monitoring represents a fundamental step in agricultural production.\
    \ In order to increase \nwater savings and enhance agricultural sustainability,\
    \ implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling \nmethods is essential, and\
    \ requires early detection of water stress in crops, before it causes irreversible\
    \ \ndamage and yield loss. There are different methods to measure water stress,\
    \ some of them are based on soil \nmoisture measurements while others are based\
    \ on calculations of vegetation indices, evapotranspiration or \nsoil water balance.\
    \ Currently, the use of remote sensing technologies for the analysis of plant\
    \ water status \ncomprises a wide range of available methods such as infrared\
    \ thermometry for canopy temperature measures, \nmicrowave radiation for soil\
    \ water content assessment, and spectral vegetation indices for the study of the\
    \ \nreflectance responses of canopies to different environmental conditions. The\
    \ aim of the presented work is to \ninvestigate the applicability of the optical\
    \ trapezoid model (OPtical TRApezoid Model) in mapping the \nmoisture content\
    \ within agricultural field. The model ability to provide vegetation characteristics,\
    \ and crop \nwater status at the canopy scale can improve the site-specific decision-making\
    \ process in a precision \nagriculture. \n \n \n1. Introduction \nGrowth and reproduction\
    \ of crops strongly depends \non \ntheir \nenvironment, \nand \nany \nchange \n\
    in \nenvironmental conditions that determines a shift \nfrom the crop’s optimal\
    \ state can be considered as \nstressful. Water is a very important factor in\
    \ \nagriculture and plays an essential role in crop \nproduction throughout the\
    \ growing season. Water is \nrequired for the germination of seeds and as soon\
    \ as \ngrowth starts water serves as a carrier in the \ndistribution of mineral\
    \ nutrients. Biomass production \nis inseparably connected with water demand.\
    \ Many \nof the biochemical reactions that are part of growth \noccur in water\
    \ or water itself participates in the \nreactions, e.g: respiration, photosynthesis.\
    \ Plant \navailable water is absorbed from the root zone in \nsupport to the transpiration\
    \ process, and it also \nfacilitates the absorption of nutrients through their\
    \ \nroots. Transpiration controls also the plant’s canopy \ntemperature as it\
    \ does not heat or cool too quickly, \nand cools plants by evaporating from the\
    \ leaf \nsurface. Transpiration leads to water loss, and when \nthe soil water\
    \ reserve is not enough to satisfy the \nplant’s transpiration needs, the photosynthesis\
    \ and \ngrowth of plants will stop in response to the water \nstress. This results\
    \ in a reduction in plant yield. The \ntranspiration rate is influenced by the\
    \ relative \nhumidity of the surrounding air, air temperature and \nwind speed.\
    \ During the vegetation-free period the \nsoil is also exposed to water loss.\
    \ The evaporation \nfrom soil is largely determined by the amount of \nsolar radiation\
    \ reaching the soil surface. A number of \nstudies (Wang et al., 2015 and Ghulam\
    \ et al., 2007) \nindicate that water stressed crops have reduced \nevapotranspiration,\
    \ and manifest other symptoms \nsuch as leaf wilting, stunted growth, and leaf\
    \ area \nreduction. Also, water stress adversely affects the \nphysiological and\
    \ nutritional development of crops, \nleading to reduced biomass, yield, and quality\
    \ of \ncrops. \nWater is a vital component in the functioning of \nplants and\
    \ soil moisture is the dominant factor \ncontrolling its supply (Ghulam et al.,\
    \ 2007). So that \ninformation on water stress conditions and their \nanalysis\
    \ is necessary to achieve optimal outputs. \nCrop \nwater \nstress \nmonitoring\
    \ \nrepresents \na \nfundamental \nstep \nin \nagricultural \nproduction, \nmeasures\
    \ of plant water status are required to better \nunderstand the mechanisms of\
    \ plant response and \nadaptation to water stress, and for the optimisation of\
    \ \ncrop production (Osakabe et al., 2014) through \nprecision irrigation. In\
    \ order to increase water \nsavings and enhance agricultural sustainability, \n\
    implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling \nmethods is essential (Osakabe\
    \ et al., 2015), and \nrequires early detection of water stress in crops, \nbefore\
    \ it causes irreversible damage and yield loss. \nP a g e  | 12 \nInternational\

    \ © Geoinformatics International \nThere are different methods to measure water\
    \ \nstress, some of them are based on soil moisture \nmeasurements while others\
    \ are based on calculations \nof vegetation indices, evapotranspiration or soil\
    \ \nwater balance. Conventional methods for monitoring \ncrop water stress rely\
    \ on in situ soil moisture \nmeasurements and meteorological variables to \nestimate\
    \ the amount of water lost from the plant-soil \nsystem during a given period\
    \ (González-Dugo et al., \n2006). Other methods of detecting plant water status\
    \ \ninvolve soil water balance calculations, direct and \nindirect measurement\
    \ of plant water status, via \nstomatal conductance and leaf water potential.\
    \ The \ndisadvantage of measurements based on soil \nsampling is that these methods\
    \ are time consuming \nand produce point information. These approaches are \n\
    time consuming, labour intensive and unsuitable for \nautomation, due to heterogeneity\
    \ of soil and crop \ncanopy. Those methods usually provide point \ninformation\
    \ that give poor indications of the overall \nstatus of the field and are difficult\
    \ to up-scale to the \nplant, field or regional level (Jones, 2012, Ihuoma \n\
    and Madramootoo, 2017). Even though many of the \navailable ground-based techniques\
    \ used for the \nnecessary investigation of plant functioning are \nreliable and\
    \ precise, they often present downsides \nlimiting their actual applicability.\
    \ Crop water stress \nmonitoring can be performed not only looking at the \nsource\
    \ of the problem (i.e. soil moisture conditions) \nbut also at its effects (i.e.\
    \ canopy temperature, leaf \nwater content, etc.). \nCurrently, the use of remote\
    \ sensing (RS) \ntechnologies for the analysis of plant water status \ncomprises\
    \ a wide range of available methods such as \ninfrared thermometry for canopy\
    \ temperature \nmeasures, microwave radiation for soil water content \nassessment,\
    \ and spectral vegetation indices for the \nstudy of the reflectance responses\
    \ of canopies to \ndifferent environmental conditions. Soil optical \nreflection\
    \ (Whiting et al., 2004 and  Zhang et al., \n2017), thermal emission (Verstraeten\
    \ et al., 2006 and \nHassan-Esfahani et al., 2015) and microwave \nbackscatter\
    \ (Das et al., 2008 and Mladenova et al., \n2014) are highly correlated with soil\
    \ moisture \ncontent, numerous methods for optical, thermal and \nmicrowave RS\
    \ of soil moisture have been developed. \nNumerous studies are based on the calculation\
    \ and \nanalysis of spectral indices and have shown that \nthere is relationship\
    \ between reflectance values and \ncanopy changes due to water stress. Measures\
    \ \nreflectance indices within the visible (VIS) and the \nnear-infrared (NIR)\
    \ spectral range (e.g. NDVI: \nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI: \n\
    Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, OSAVI: \nOptimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index) to \nindicate canopy changes due to water stress. Some \nindices (e.g.\
    \ PRI: Photochemical Reflectance Index) \nare sensitive to the photosynthetic\
    \ pigment changes \ndue to water stress and others are used to measure \nthe reflectance\
    \ trough in the NIR and SWIR \n(shortwave infrared) region (e.g. SRWI: Simple\
    \ \nRatio Water Index and \nNDWI: Normalized \nDifference Water Index) to represent\
    \ canopy \nmoisture content. The so-called “trapezoid” or \n“triangle” model is\
    \ one of the most widely applied \napproaches to RS of soil moisture utilizing\
    \ both \noptical and thermal data. The model, hereinafter \ntermed \nThermal-Optical\
    \ \nTRAapezoid \nModel \n(TOTRAM), is based on the interpretation of the \npixel\
    \ \ndistribution \nwithin \nthe \nland \nsurface \ntemperature-vegetation index\
    \ space (Nemani et al., \n1993, Carlson et al., 1994). This method and several\
    \ \nmodified versions have been used successfully for \nestimating \nsurface \n\
    soil \nmoisture. \nWith \nthe \ndevelopment of sensors operating in the optical\
    \ \nspectrum range, more and better data are being \ngenerated. Optical bands\
    \ have also been incorporated \ninto the models mentioned above. Several indices\
    \ \nderived from the Rred − RNIR triangular space as the \nPerpendicular Drought\
    \ Index, PDI (Ghulam et al., \n2007), the Distance Drought Index, DDI (Qin et\
    \ al., \n2021) and the Triangle Soil Moisture Index have \nbeen proposed. Others\
    \ are parameterized based on \nthe shortwave infrared and near infrared trapezoidal\
    \ \nspace like as Perpendicular Drought Index, SPDI \n(Ghulam et al., 2007a) and\
    \ the Modified Shortwave \nInfrared Perpendicular Drought Index, MSPDI (Feng \n\
    et al., 2013). \nSadeghi et al., (2015) proposed a novel \nphysically-based trapezoid\
    \ model, so called OPtical \nTRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on a \n\
    relationship between soil moisture and shortwave \ninfrared transformed reflectance.\

    \ \n2. Materials and Methods  \nThe model ability to provide crop water status\
    \ at the \nfield level was tested on a relatively small \nagricultural area (Figure\
    \ 1), that is located in \nHungary. The total area of the field is 30 hectares\
    \ \nand it is characterized by chernozem soil type. From \na pedological point\
    \ of view, the study area has \naverage properties. Its organic matter content\
    \ does \nnot exceed 1-2%. The annual precipitation amount is \n550-650 mm. According\
    \ to the topographic map, the \naltitude is 302 meters above sea level at the\
    \ highest \npoint of the field and 288 meters at the lowest point \nthat means\
    \ there is a difference in height of 14 \nmeters between the bottom and upper\
    \ edge of the \nland. The area has varied topographic features, the \nwest part\
    \ is heavily eroded. During the study period \n(2017-2018) the area was covered\
    \ by winter wheat.  \n \n2.1 Satellite Images and Data Analysis \nMultispectral\
    \ ESA Sentinel-2 satellite images \nacquired from the ESA Sentinel Scientific\
    \ Data Hub \nwere used in this study. A total of 17 cloud-free \nimages were available,\
    \ but after preliminary \ninterpretation, 7 of them were selected for further\
    \ \nprocessing. Sentinel-2 is a high spatial (10 to 60-m) \nresolution multispectral\
    \ satellite having 13 spectral \nbands covering the visible, NIR and SWIR \nelectromagnetic\
    \ frequency domains and temporal \nresolution of ~5-day. The characteristics of\
    \ the data \nused in the research include the Table 1. Workflow \nillustrating\
    \ the main steps of data analyses for \nmapping surface soil moisture with OPTRAM\
    \ is \ndepicted in Figure 2. The data extraction includes the \nfollowing steps:\
    \ data pre-processing, multi-level \nimage segmentation, delimitation of indices\
    \ and the \napplication of the optical trapezoid model OPTRAM. \nIt is important\
    \ to note that the Sentinel-2 Level-1C \nprocessing includes radiometric and geometric\
    \ \ncorrections including ortho-rectification and spatial \nregistration on a\
    \ global reference system with sub-\npixel accuracy. Calculation of the TOA (the\
    \ top-of-\natmosphere) reflectances also occurs in this process. \nHierarchical\
    \ framework was used to identify the \nboundary of study area at super-object\
    \ level and \ndetermine the unit of investigation (20 m) at the \nsecond level\
    \ for mapping surface moisture. After \npre-processing vegetation index (NDVI)\
    \ and (STR) \nwere determined. Reflectance at the red band (B4: \n665 nm) and\
    \ the near infrared (B8: 842 nm) were \nused to calculate the NDVI. Reflectance\
    \ at the SWIR \nband (B12: 2190 nm) was used for calculation of the \nSTR following\
    \ the Sadeghi et al., (2015). \n \n \nFigure 1: Location map of study area. Study\

    \ \nBy measuring the reflectance of the plants or soil at \nvarious wavelengths,\
    \ it is possible to collect a lot of \ninformation about the status of the plants\
    \ and soil \nproperties. The reflectance of light spectra depends \non the land\
    \ cover type (plant, soil types), water \ncontent within tissues, and other intrinsic\
    \ factors. \nThe reflectance of vegetation is low in the blue and \nred regions\
    \ of the visible spectrum, due to absorption \nby chlorophyll for photosynthesis.\
    \ It has a peak at \nthe green region which gives rise to the green colour \n\
    of vegetation. In the near infrared (NIR) region, the \nreflectance is much higher\
    \ than that in the visible \nband due to the cellular structure in the leaves.\
    \ In the \nmid infrared (SWIR) there are more water absorption \nregions. Those\
    \ regions are used to examine \ncorrelation between root zone soil moisture and\
    \ the \nvegetation status. Based on RED, NIR and SWIR \nbands different indices\
    \ are calculated to quantify \nplant vigour and relate it to root zone soil moisture.\
    \ \nThe soil moisture status influences the vegetation \nwater status and thereby\
    \ changes the spectral \ncharacteristics of the vegetation (Figure 3). \nThe most\
    \ common vegetation index used in the \nwater \nstress \nmodels \n(e.g.TOTRAM)\
    \ \nis \nthe \nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). \nThe water-absorption\
    \ bands in the 1300–2500 nm \nregion show the highest sensitivity to leaf water\
    \ \nconcentration in most crops. Short infrared is very \nsensitive to the water\
    \ contained in the object whether \nit is soil or vegetation. NDWI (Normalized\
    \ \nDifference Water Index) is one of the popular \nindicators of this kind of\
    \ investigations. The \ntraditional trapezoid model, TOTRAM, is based on \nthe\
    \ pixel distribution within the Land Surface \nTemperature-Vegetation Index space\
    \ (LST-VI). An \ninverse linear relationship between surface soil \nmoisture and\
    \ LST is then assumed (Figure 4). \n \n2.2 The Optical Trapezoid Model (OPTRAM)\
    \ \nThe OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) was \ndeveloped for Soil Water Content\
    \ (SWC) estimation \nmaking use of optical satellite data, and is based on \n\
    the linear physical relationship between soil moisture \nand Shortwave Infrared\
    \ Transformed Reflectance \n(STR) (Sadeghi, 2015). OPTRAM requires a \nparametrization\
    \ at a given location based on the pixel \ndistribution within STR-NDVI space\
    \ (Figure 4), \nwhere STR is defined as follow: \n \nSTR = (1 - RSWIR)2 / (2 RSWIR\
    \ )  \nEquation 1 \n \nThe model parameters can be obtained for a specific \n\
    location from the dry and wet edges of the optical \ntrapezoid depicted in (Figure\
    \ 3). \n \nSTRd = id +sdNDVI \nEquation 2 \n \nSTRw = iw +swNDVI \nEquation 3\
    \ \n \nwhere STRd and STRw are the STR at θd (the local \nminimum dry soil moisture\
    \ content) and θw (the local \nmaximum wet soil moisture content).  \n \nThe soil\
    \ moisture for each pixel can be estimated as \na function of STR and NDVI: \n\
    \ \n  \nEquation 4 \n \nwhere id , sd, and iw, sw are dry and wet edges \nparameters.\
    \ \n \n3. Results and Discussion \nThe \nOPTRAM \nmodel \nEquation \n(4) \nwas\
    \ \nparameterized based on the pixel distribution within \nthe STR-NDVI space.\
    \ The model was run separately \nfor each available images, also one integrated\
    \ \ntrapezoid incorporating pixel distributions from all \nselected images was\
    \ used to try universally \nparameterized. During the work dry (id and sd) and\

  analysis: 'The paper describes an approach for combining remotely sensed data and

    The paper first introduces the importance of ET estimation for irrigation management
    and the limitations of remote sensing data for frequent ET estimation. It then

    of evapotranspiration (ET) is important for monitoring crop water stress and for
    developing decision support systems for irrigation scheduling. Techniques to estimate
    ET have been available for many years, while more recently remote sensing data
    have extended ET into a spatially distributed context. However, remote sensing
    data cannot be easily used in decision systems if they are not available frequently.
    For many crops ET estimates are needed at intervals of a week or less, but unfortunately
    due to cost, weather, and sensor availability constraints, high resolution ( <
    100 m ) remote sensing data are usually available no more frequently than 2 weeks.
    Since resolution of this problem is unlikely to occur soon, a modeling approach
    has been developed to extrapolate remotely sensed inputs needed to estimate ET.
    The approach accomplishes this by combining time-series observations from ground-based
    radiometers and meteorological instruments with episodic visible, near infrared,
    and thermal infrared remote sensing image data. The key components of the model
    are a vegetation density predictor and a diurnal land surface temperature disaggregator,
    both of which supply needed inputs to a surface energy balance model. To illustrate
    model implementation, remote sensing and ground-based experimental data were collected
    for cotton grown in 2003 at Maricopa, Ariz. Spatially distributed cotton canopy
    densities were forecasted for a 22-day interval using vegetation indices from
    remote sensing and fractional cover from ground-level photography. Spatially distributed
    canopy and soil surface temperatures were predicted at 15-min time steps for the
    same interval by scaling diurnal canopy temperatures according to time of day
    and vegetative cover. Considering that the predictions span a rapid growth phase
    of the cotton crop, comparison of spatially projected canopy cover with observed
    cover were reasonably good, with R 2 = 0.65 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE)
    of 0.13. Comparison of predicted temperatures also showed fair agreement with
    RMSE = 2.1 ° C . These results show that combining episodic remotely sensed data
    with continuous ground-based radiometric data are a technically feasible way to
    forecast spatially distributed input data needed for ET modeling over crops. Introduction
    Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is important for many applications
    where water supplies are scarce. For irrigated agriculture in particular, knowledge
    of ET is especially important for effective water scheduling and management (Howell
    1996; Jensen et al. 1990). Several well-established ET estimation approaches that
    exist are consistent and can perform well for homogeneous crop cover and optimum
    agronomic management. Among these, the most commonly used for irrigation scheduling
    purposes is the crop coefficient ( K c ) /reference ET method (Jensen and Allen
    2000), such as those in Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
    [Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]-24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977) and FAO-56
    (Allen et al. 1998). However, ET predictions for K c -based approaches are subject
    to considerable inaccuracies where vegetation is spatially variable or where—despite
    its apparent uniformity—vegetation is stressed from salinity or water deficit
    (Martin and Gilley 1993; Allen et al. 2005; Hunsaker et al. 2005). The only practical
    way to consider effects of spatial variability upon ET is to use remotely sensed
    images, which can potentially observe changes in land cover at submeter scales.
    Many contributions, particularly those employing thermal infrared observations,
    have shown how remote sensing techniques could be used operationally (Bartholic
    et al. 1970; Brown and Rosenberg 1973; Jackson et al. 1977; Soer 1980; Seguin
    and Itier 1983; Hatfield et al. 1984; Mecikalski et al. 1999). Although sensors
    such as Landsat and ASTER provide the necessary resolution (15–90 m) to distinguish
    between land cover types, the temporal repetition rate is rarely better than 16
    days. For crop applications at farm scales, where critical irrigation decision
    intervals are short, it is likely that such infrequent image data would have limited
    value. Clearly, more frequent repeat periods for higher resolution satellite sensors
    are needed. Such platforms do exist, examples of which are Rapid Eye (www.rapideye.de);
    QuickBird (www.digitalglobe.com); and SPOT (www.spot.com), but in these instances
    thermal infrared data are not available (Anderson and Kustas 2008). Furthermore,
    agricultural users are constrained by image acquisition costs, cloudy skies, and
    limited spatial coverage. Future platforms are being proposed that would have
    repeat intervals as short as 1 week, for example, a high-resolution instrument
    with a multispectral thermal infrared capability (hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov). Recognizing
    that for the foreseeable future, remote sensing data of the type, quality, cost,
    and frequency needed for crop water management will likely not be available, a
    remote sensing estimation approach is proposed that uses a combination of remote
    sensing images and ground-based, fixed-location radiometers. In the approach,
    spatially distributed information is provided from image data, while time-series
    information is provided from ground-based radiometers. In this proposed scheme,
    time-series maps of vegetation cover and surface temperatures can be generated
    for frequent time intervals (e.g., 1/4 hour) and ultimately can be used as inputs
    to a surface energy balance model. FISE03 Experiment To demonstrate the proposed
    model (elaborated in the next section), experimental data were used from an intensive
    cotton field experiment known as FAO Irrigation Scheduling Experiment 2003 (FISE03,
    Hunsaker et al. 2005). FISE03 included a ground field site with associated meteorological,
    soil, agronomic, and hydrologic instruments, plus 10 remote sensing overflights
    using a helicopter-based platform. The site (Fig. 1) is a 1.3 ha field at the
    University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC) approximately 50 km south
    of Phoenix, Ariz. ( 33.067 ° N , 111.967 ° W , 361 m above sea level). For the
    2003 experiment, cotton was planted in a 4 by 8 matrix of 32 randomized 11.2 m
    × 21 m plots. Plots were identified by three digit numbers, ranging between 101
    and 408, and also by three-letter codes. The numbering scheme denotes row and
    column positions for each plot, while the letter codes denote experimental treatments.
    These codes identify the irrigation scheduling scheme [“F” and “N”: FAO versus
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) approaches]; the planting density
    (“S,” “T,” and “D”: sparse, typical, and dense); and nitrogen levels (“L” and
    “H”: low and high). Additional plots, numbered 901–908 and located within the
    middle of the site, were not a main part of the experimental design but did provide
    important surface temperature data for unvegetated dry and wet soil conditions.
    See Hunsaker et al. (2005) for details. Fig. 1. FISE03 experimental layout for
    cotton grown at Maricopa, Ariz. in 2003 Deltapine 458BR (Gossypium hirsutum L.),
    a mid-to-full maturing transgenic cotton variety grown in the state, was planted
    at the field site on April 7 and 8, 2003. A four-row planter (Model 1700, Deere
    and Co., Moline, Ill.), calibrated at a rate of 10 cotton seeds m − 2 , was used
    to plant single rows of seed in the center of the bed (1.016-m bed spacing) for
    both the T and S density plots (the sparse treatment plots were later hand thinned
    to 5 plants/ m 2 after emergence). Dense plots (20 plants/ m 2 ) were planted
    with a Monosem twin-row precision vacuum planter (Model NG, A.T.I., Inc., Lenexa,
    Kan.) at 0.2-m spacing along the bed. As described in Hunsaker et al. (2005),
    after the cotton was established, irrigation scheduling was predicated on replacing
    1.1 times estimated ET when soil water depletion from the root zone reached a
    level of 45%. The estimated daily ET was calculated for all plots using the FAO-56
    dual crop coefficient procedures (Allen et al. 1998). All FAO plots were irrigated
    according to a single basal crop coefficient ( K cb ) curve, whereas the crop
    coefficients for NDVI plots were generated separately for each plot using ground-based
    NDVI measurements and a previously developed relationship between K cb and NDVI.
    Nitrogen applications for the high N level plots followed locally recommended
    practices for cotton (Doerge et al. 1991), predicated on leaf petiole nitrate
    content levels that were periodically monitored in the plots during the season.
    All high N plots received a total seasonal application of 112 kg N ha − 1 , whereas
    no N was applied to the L plots. Final yields were obtained from seed cotton that
    was hand-picked within a final harvest area measuring approximately 24 m 2 in
    the south half of each plot and then ginned at MAC. A primary objective of FISE03
    was development of remote sensing-based irrigation scheduling techniques, and
    consequently the collected data were valuable for remote sensing forecasting too.
    Specifically, the water budget was monitored in detail, allowing ET estimation
    on a plot by plot basis at daily to weekly time scales. The plots were flood irrigated
    with each surrounded by border dikes, where soil volumetric moisture contents
    were systematically measured immediately prior to, following, and between irrigation
    events from 3 m deep access tubes near the centers of each of the 32 plots. At
    each location, neutron scattering data from a field-calibrated Campbell Pacific
    Nuclear instrument were combined with a time domain reflectometer (Soil-Moisture
    Equip. Corp.) to return soil water content between the surface and 2.8-m depths.
    This range of depths allowed monitoring of shallow soil evaporation, root-zone
    uptake, and soil water loss from infiltration at the plot center. Meteorological
    and land surface temperature data collected at FISE03 included one Eppley 8–48,
    solar radiometer, two R.M. Young photochopper type anemometers at a height of
    2 m, air temperature (dry and wet bulb), aspirated USDA/ARS-designed ceramic wick
    psychrometers, and a Texas Electronics rain gauge. To monitor soil and plant canopy
    temperatures, infrared thermometers were deployed in 11 plot locations at different
    times during the cotton growing season. The thermometers were Everest (Everest
    Interscience, Tucson, Ariz.) Models 3073 and 3500, and Apogee (Apogee Instruments,
    Logan, Utah) IRT model IRT-P5. Of these, nine were pointed toward cotton plants
    at ∼ 30 ° from horizontal, and two were pointed toward bare soil at ∼ 60 ° from
    horizontal. These angles were chosen to maximize the canopy and soil signals while
    reducing effects from instrument mounts. Remote sensing data at FISE03 were collected
    on 10 occasions between May 7, 2003 and October 13, 2003 using a helicopter platform.
    This study used remote sensing data acquired on June 17 and July 9 [i.e., Day
    of Year (DOY) 168 and 190]. Data acquired were of two kinds: surface temperatures
    from a thermal infrared camera and vegetation indices from a visible-near infrared
    camera. The temperature images were acquired by a FLIR Systems SC2000 thermal
    camera (FLIR Systems AB, Danderyd, Sweden), which contained a dynamically calibrated
    microbolometer detector 240 × 320 array with 1.3 × 10 − 3 rad pixel instantaneous
    field of view. Considering the 760-m flight elevation, effective resolution was
    ∼ 1 m . For compatibility with higher resolution visible near infrared (VNIR)
    data, the FLIR data were subsampled to 0.5 m. The specific camera used was band
    pass filtered between 10.0 and 13.0 μ m to reduce errors from highly variable
    emissivities commonly encountered at shorter wavelengths. Calibration tests showed
    accuracies < 1.0 ° C for controlled conditions. The vegetation index image data
    were acquired from a Duncan MS3100, 8-bit, three-band camera (Redlake, Tucson,
    Ariz.), with detectors for a red band at 670 nm, a far-red band at 720 nm, and
    a near infrared band at 790 nm, each at full-wave-half-maximum of 10 nm. NDVI
    was constructed from the red and near infrared reflectances. Prior to this construction,
    reflectance data were created from Duncan imagery by normalization against four
    8 × 8 m field deployed calibration tarps (Group VIII Technologies, Provo, Utah)
    using procedures similar to that described in Moran et al. (2001). These tarps
    had nominal reflectance values of 4, 8, 48, and 64%. Last, to improve estimation
    of fractional cover, weekly nadir-viewing photographs of cotton were collected
    throughout the field. These were obtained with a conventional film camera mounted
    on a hand-carried pole ∼ 2 m long and diagonally positioned 1 m south of midfield
    access boardwalks (Fig. 1). Green:red ratio images were created from the digitized
    images and used to generate sample estimates of fractional cover (French et al.
    2009). Forecasting Remotely Sensed Cover and Land Surface Temperature The remote
    sensing forecasting method consists of three main components: 1. A temperature-based
    remote sensing surface energy balance model that computes net radiation, sensible
    heat flux, soil heat flux, and latent heat flux; 2. A vegetation density submodel
    that can forecast changing crop cover at daily time steps using remotely sensed
    vegetation indices; and 3. A land surface temperature submodel that can forecast
    canopy and soil temperatures at minute to hourly time steps using ground-based
    radiometers. This study considers the latter two components, energy balance model
    input data. When these inputs are combined, it becomes feasible to estimate spatially
    distributed ET at frequent time steps for a few weeks following acquisition of
    remote sensing image data. Energy Balance Model To understand the rationale for
    modeling extrapolated cover and land surface temperatures, a brief description
    of a temperature-based surface energy balance model is needed. Remote sensing
    surface energy balance models estimate ET by modeling the four most important
    energy flux components: net radiation: R n , soil heat: G , sensible heat: H ,
    and latent heat: LE R n − G = H + LE (1) where the left hand side represents available
    energy flux and the right hand side represents turbulent flux. Instantaneous ET
    (in terms of liquid water depth) is obtained by solving Eq. (1) for LE and dividing
    by the product of water density and the latent heat of vaporization. Estimation
    of ET at daily time steps requires additional assumptions or information. One
    common approach assumes constant evaporative fraction for the day (Lhomme and
    Elguero 1999). However for the proposed spatial estimation method, LE estimates
    could be available at frequent time steps (i.e., 15 min in this study) so that
    daily ET is estimated from a summation over a 24-h period. Given frequent input
    values, a variety of energy balance modeling approaches could be used. Examples
    of documented methods include SEBAL/Metric (Bastiaanssen et al. 1998; Allen et
    al. 2007), the surface energy balance system, Su (2002), a water deficit estimator
    (Moran et al. 1994), and the vegetation-temperature triangle approach (Carlson
    et al. 1994, 1995). For this study a form of the two source energy balance (TSEB)
    model (Norman et al. 1995) was chosen because the proposed temperature disaggregation
    approach is well suited to the two source methodology. A distinguishing feature
    of TSEB is its computation of LE in two energy flux streams: one for the vegetation
    canopy and another for the soil surface. Doing so allows for better modeling of
    available radiative energy and parameterization of aerodynamic transport resistances.
    Using the spatial estimation approach to be described, TSEB can be implemented
    as described in Norman et al. (1995), except that canopy temperatures do not need
    the Priestley-Taylor constraint (Priestley and Taylor 1972) since they are directly
    estimated from observations. Vegetation Density Model One of the chief values
    of remote sensing image data are the ability to generate maps of spatial vegetation
    cover density throughout the fields of interest. Knowledge of cover density is
    important for energy balance models such as TSEB since it is used to estimate
    partitioning of net radiation and constrain canopy transpiration. Remote sensing
    of canopy cover can be accomplished with the construction of a vegetation index,
    such as the NDVI (Rouse et al., 1973). Correspondence between cover and NDVI,
    though imprecise, is established empirically, for example, with the squared scaled
    NDVI relationship described by Carlson et al. (1995), or semiempirically through
    a power function relation described by Choudhury (1987) and Choudhury et al. (1994).
    In the current study, the Choudhury approach was implemented using remote sensing
    image data f = 1 − [ NDVI m x − NDVI NDVI m x − NDVI m n ] p (2) where f represents
    fractional vegetation cover; NDVI m x represents full cover; NDVI m n represents
    bare soil; and the exponent p is a function of leaf orientation distributions
    within a canopy. p ranges between 1.25 for planophile canopies to < 0.7 for erectophile
    canopies; for the current study 1.0 was used. Thus Eq. (2) allows transformation
    of remotely sensed NDVI data into spatially distributed estimates of fractional
    cover. To provide the best possible estimates of cover, Eq. (2) was calibrated
    using nadir-view photography previously mentioned in the FISE03 Experiment section.
    In an operational setting such an approach would probably be impractical, and
    in such cases forecast mean cover would have to rely upon generalized calibrations
    of Eq. (2). But at FISE03, use of the technique was a research tool designed to
    seek the best possible fractional cover estimates. Implementation of the method
    was straightforward and empirical: using green and red bands from high-quality
    photographs, histograms of the green:red ratio created from image samples collected
    throughout the field were constructed and a threshold value was chosen to best
    divide the bimodal distributional pattern (Fig. 2). Soil conditions in other settings
    might not allow good separation but at Maricopa the reddish soil contrasted strongly
    against green leaves. The chosen threshold evenly divided the bimodal pattern
    representing soil and vegetation. Fractional cover was then obtained by summing
    all image pixel values greater than the threshold and dividing by the total number
    of sampled pixels. In this instance cover classification uncertainty, corresponding
    to values between the peaks was ∼ 5 % . Fig. 2. Histogram of the green/red ratio
    for a nadir-viewing photograph taken of cotton growing in experimental plot 305
    on June 17, 2003 (DOY 168). The bimodal distribution allows accurate discrimination
    between bare soil (which has a dominant red color) and cotton leaves. The confusion
    interval (ratio 0.98–1.1) was found to include 10.2% of the image pixels. To construct
    maps of predicted spatially distributed cover, the approach assumed that the range
    of cover values could be dynamically modeled with a smooth statistical distribution
    function for locally specified management zones. For each zone, predicted spatial
    patterns were modeled by using estimates of mean cover and observations of spatially
    distributed NDVI from the recently available remote sensing image data. The chosen
    function for this study was the Beta distribution which is a bounded but flexible
    distribution function that can be adapted to a wide range of patterns using only
    two shape parameters ( α and β ). For unimodal distribution patterns both parameters
    will be > 1 , with α < β for sparse cover, and α > β for dense cover. Because
    the bounds for cover are the same for the standard Beta function (i.e., 0 to 1),
    no change of scales was necessary. The Beta shape parameters α and β were computed
    using the method-of-moment estimators α = f ¯ [ f ¯ ( 1 − f ¯ ) f var − 1 ] (3)
    β = ( 1 − f ¯ ) [ f ¯ ( 1 − f ¯ ) f var − 1 ] (4) For existing remote sensing
    image data, estimation of α and β factors follows directly from observed cover
    means and variances. For times beyond the most recent remote sensing data, assumed
    values for f ¯ and f var were needed. For this study, mean cover estimates were
    obtained from previously mentioned nadir-view photographs, while cover variance
    was assumed to be the same as observed within the most recently available remote
    sensing image. As shown in Fig. 3, assuming constant cover variance was reasonable
    for short time intervals, but less so when considering the full growing season.
    At FISE03, variance of cotton cover increased two times: once during the midgrowth
    phase and again during senescence. However, these variance changes were slow at
    fortnightly prediction time scales and thus consequent errors from the constancy
    assumption were small. Fig. 3. Fractional cover for cotton in all FISE03 plots.
    The box symbols display the median and interquartile range of cover, while the
    whiskers display the 95th percentile range. Note that cover variability increases
    twice during a growing season: once during the growth phase ( ∼ DOY 176 or June
    25), and again during senescence ( > DOY 250 or September 7). Once Beta shape
    factors were known for both the remote sensing image data acquisition time and
    for the forecast time, predicted cover was computed by assuming that the quantile
    for each pixel cover value did not change. Hence, even though mean cover values
    did change with time, the cover distribution could be predicted by using the remote
    sensing-based cover quantiles with the forecast shape parameters α and β . To
    illustrate the procedure, mean fractional cover estimates, obtained from nadir-view
    photography over one experimental plot (Plot 305) were retrieved for 2 days with
    remote sensing image data (Fig. 4). The first day, June 17, was used for reference
    cover data while the second day, 9 July, was used to evaluate cover prediction
    accuracy. Using NDVI data collected on June 17, all pixel values were transformed
    to equivalent cover using Eq. (2). Using this estimated cover, the Beta distribution
    parameters α and β were computed via Eqs. (3) - (4). By projecting forward in
    time a new mean canopy cover (0.8), while retaining the previously estimated cover
    variance (0.005), a second set of Beta distribution parameters were then computed.
    Assuming the ranks of cover values did not change over the considered time interval,
    spatially distributed cover values for the new time were predicted. The resulting
    distributions are illustrated for plot 305 in Fig. 5. The solid curves represent
    the β distributions for observations on DOY 168 and DOY 190, while the forecast
    distribution is shown as a dashed curve. The actual underlying cover distributions
    are shown as white and gray histograms for DOY 168 and 190, respectively. Fig.

    interval modeled in this study. Fig. 5. Histogram of fractional cotton cover at

    Model At ground level it is not practical to simultaneously observe canopy and
    soil temperatures throughout a field, but it is possible to realistically and
    dynamically simulate them in a simple way. The premise for croplands is that the
    diurnal course of representative vegetation temperatures can be observed and related
    to temperatures of surfaces consisting of a mix of bare soil and vegetation. By
    using point-based canopy measurements, estimates of fractional vegetative cove,
    and measurements of scaling relationships between canopy and soil temperatures,
    spatially distributed composite surface temperatures can be generated frequently.
    To illustrate how canopy and soil temperatures might be correlated, an extract
    from late-season observations on August 29 (early-season data where both vegetation
    and soil temperatures were observed were unfortunately not collected) are shown
    in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6(a) Thermometers were calibrated using an extended area black
    body in a constant-temperature room to better than 0.1 K. For this day, vegetation
    and soil temperatures varied similarly throughout daytime hours, while at night
    they were nearly equal. Fig. 6(b) verifies this similarity by plotting the ratio
    of soil to vegetation temperatures (denoted as “ k ” below) for all times. Between
    sunrise and sunset the ratio varied sinusoidally with a peak value shortly before
    15:00 MST, while at night the ratio remained closed to 1.0. Assuming that surface
    temperatures for cover densities between bare and full-cover conditions lie between
    the extremes shown, prediction of one component temperature is feasible given
    observations of the other component. In the FISE03 experimental plan, the prime
    temperature observations were of the canopy since these could be used to detect
    crop water stress. Hence in this study soil surface temperatures were the modeled
    component. Once known, soil and vegetation temperatures can be used together to
    estimate temperatures over partially vegetated areas. Thus the temperature procedure
    consists of two steps: estimation of bare soil temperatures from canopy temperatures
    and estimation of composite (i.e., mixed canopy and soil) temperatures according
    to the previously obtained vegetation cover densities. Fig. 6. Diurnal variation
    of soil and vegetation surface temperatures (a), and their corresponding scaling
    relationship for August 29, 2003 (b). Temperature modeling with Eq. (5) divides
    each day into an isothermal, night-time portion, and a day-time sinusoidal portion.
    In this example, the k -scale factor was ∼ 1.8 and the ϕ phase shift term was
    ∼ 2.5 h . In the first step, the soil temperature ( T soil ) is obtained as a
    function of vegetation temperature ( T veg ) and a scaled sinusoidal function
    of time ( t in hours) T soil = T veg [ 1 + ( k − 1 ) ] sin [ π 12 ( t − 6 − ϕ
    ) ] (5) Since the observed temperatures typically peak at times later than noon,
    a phase-shift term ϕ (hours) is included. The scale factor k and the phase ϕ are
    empirically determined by observing T soil and T veg at multiple times. At night
    the surface is nearly isothermal and a k value of 1.0 is used, while at daytimes
    higher k values (contingent upon soil shading and wetness) are needed. Typical
    k values for this study ranged between 1.0 and 2.0. In this scheme k estimates
    can be updated at daily to weekly intervals depending upon availability of simultaneous
    canopy and soil temperatures. The validity of this approach for different sky
    and surface conditions can be demonstrated for a 20-day period in late August
    to mid-September 2003 (Fig. 7). Shown are observed soil temperature/vegetation
    canopy temperatures using the same plots (P305 and P907) illustrated in Fig. 6.
    This time span included clear skies, partly cloudy skies, and one rainy day. All
    temperature ratio observations can be modeled with the sinusoidal function in
    Eq. (5), and with few exceptions can be modeled with small day-to-day changes
    to the k -scale factor and to the ϕ -phase shift term. The outstanding anomaly,
    identified by the lowest early morning ratios, was observed following a 2.5-cm
    rainfall event on September 1. Predominance of such conditions would undoubtedly
    reduce the accuracy of the scaling approach. Fig. 7. Soil/vegetation-temperature
    ratio for a 20-day period between August 29, 2003 and September 18, 2003. For
    this interval, which includes clear, cloudy, and rainy days, the k scale factor
    [Eq. (5)] was mostly between 1.4 to 1.8. The most significant exception followed
    rainfall on September 1. In the second step, the composite radiometric temperature
    ( T composite ) is computed T composite = [ f T veg 4 + ( 1 − f ) T soil 4 ] 1
    / 4 (6) where temperatures are scaled in proportion to their equivalent radiant
    fluxes. Eq. (6) assumes that a remotely sensed temperature observation is a function
    of mixing temperature extremes from a canopy and bare soil elements. Note that
    computation of T composite is valuable for estimating surface temperatures for
    differing cover; however, use of Eq. (6) would not be needed for TSEB since its
    methodology is based on modeling canopy and soil temperatures separately. Results
    Spatially distributed surface temperature and vegetation forecast modeling was
    performed for a 22-day period between June 17 and July 9 to demonstrate the ability
    to combine remote sensing and ground observations. To evaluate the ability to
    predict surface temperatures, modeled composite temperatures at overpass time
    were compared with remotely sensed surface temperatures on July 9 (DOY 190) at
    13:30 MST (Fig. 8). Modeled composite temperatures as a function of vegetation
    cover are indicated by the sloping line. Remotely sensed temperatures for all
    plots are shown by the density shading. Agreement with modeled temperatures had
    an R 2 of 0.6 and an root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 2.1 ° C . Modeled temperature
    bias was low 0.4 ° C although there was a tendency for the model to underestimate
    the composite temperatures at higher canopy densities. Note that low temperature
    bias is consistent with the demonstration in Fig. 7 that temperature scaling for
    most conditions were reasonably modeled with Eq. (5). Fig. 8. Two-dimensional
    histogram plot of land surface temperature versus fractional cotton cover Comparing
    projected cotton canopy cover densities with observed densities on July 9 showed
    good agreement (Fig. 9), demonstrating that the forecasting of mean cover based
    on Beta distributions was a viable approach at fortnightly time scales. Spatially
    distributed cover estimates for all plots forecasted by 22 days from June 17 during
    a rapid growth phase of the cotton crop showed reasonable correspondence: R 2
    = 0.65 with RMSE of 0.65. Fig. 9. Observed versus predicted cotton canopy cover
    on DOY 190 (July 2003). Shading indicates count frequencies where dark tones represent
    the highest counts. The 1:1 line indicates 10% prediction accuracy for cover exceeding
    65%. Results for sparser cover were biased by 20%. Discussion Outcomes from initial
    experimentation with an airborne and ground-based image forecasting system show
    that land surface temperatures and vegetative cover can be forecasted reasonably
    accurate for 2-week time intervals during a rapid growth phase of a cotton crop.
    This time interval corresponds closely to typical repeat periods for sun-synchronous
    satellites, which are likely the only remote sensing platform for routine agricultural
    applications. The prime motivation for this approach was to provide the needed
    inputs for modeling ET when remote sensing image data are unavailable. A result
    of this study was a demonstration of its technical feasibility. Whether or not
    the approach is operationally feasible, however, requires a more comprehensive
    study, including economic analyses. Clearly, no modeling procedure can replace
    actual remote sensing data, nor can the procedures accurately locate crop water
    stress unless specific ground-based observations are available for such conditions.
    Nonetheless, the modeling procedures do provide a mechanism to predict the best
    estimated daily ET when such data are otherwise unavailable. Moreover, the synthetic
    images represent hour-by-hour weather and radiative conditions unlikely to ever
    be available from a remote sensing platform. Hence daily ET estimates can be obtained
    from summing frequent ET estimates instead of extrapolating instantaneous ET estimates
    using constant evaporative fraction assumptions (e.g., Lhomme and Elguero 1999).
    Model limitations were also indicated by this study, wherein predicted temperatures
    and vegetation cover showed discrepancies with actual observations. For the FISE03
    study, land surface temperatures were not always correlative with fractional cover,
    a condition possibly due to crop row structure, wherein subcanopy soil temperatures
    were significantly different from uncovered soil temperatures. This lack of correlation
    could also result from using nonrepresentative remote sensing images. For example,
    image data collected during an irrigation event would bias model estimates for
    other times. Absent additional field information, however, future implementations
    would require statistical constraints to ensure model robustness Conclusions A
    remote sensing modeling approach has been developed to reduce problems estimating
    ET when image data are sparse. The approach forecasts crop cover density and surface
    temperatures after initialization by a remote sensing scene. The forecasting was
    accomplished by combining spatially distributed information from an airborne remote
    sensor with time-series radiometric observations from the ground. In this way
    vegetation cover could be estimated at daily time steps and surface temperatures
    can be estimated at subhourly time steps. The forecast approach was tested for
    a 22-day period using data collected over a cotton crop at an experimental site
    (FISE03) in Maricopa, Ariz. Spatially and temporally distributed (at 1/4 hourly
    intervals) surface temperatures compared acceptably with airborne observations,
    where the RMSE was 2.1 ° C and mean bias 0.4 ° C . Spatially distributed vegetation
    indices observed on June 17, 2003 were converted to fractional cover and modeled
    up to the next available remote sensing observation on July 9. The forecast indices
    agreed reasonably with actual observations where linear regression results showed
    R 2 = 0.65 and an RMSE of 0.65. These results indicate the subsequent modeling
    with synthesized image data could produce accurate daily ET estimates when high-quality
    remote sensing data are unavailable. Unfortunately, equivalent data from space-borne
    platforms are not routinely available, and thus airborne platforms are needed
    for current research. Future investigations will be needed to assess the impact
    of the approach upon ET modeling, its validity for all parts of the growing season,
    and its applicability to other locations and crops. References Allen, R., Clemmens,

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Two critical limitations
    for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack
    of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit
    time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned
    airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental
    requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the
    capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote
    sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fill this gap,
    providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral,
    and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative
    remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive
    thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the
    platform was flown over agricultural fields, obtaining thermal imagery in the
    7.5-13-mum region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the
    400-800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reflectance and temperature
    imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical
    parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference
    vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized
    soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), coupled
    with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index,
    chlorophyll content ( C ab ), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy
    temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates
    that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications
    yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional
    manned airborne sensors. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote

    SECTION I. Introduction Remote sensing for agricultural and crop-management applications
    aims at providing spatially and spectrally derived surface parameters for crop
    classification and mapping [1]–[3], crop forecasting and yield predictions [4]–[7],
    crop status and condition [8]–[11], weed detection [12]–[14], disease detection
    and nutrient deficiency [15]–[17], and photosynthetic pigment content [18]–[20].
    Critical issues such as the optimum spatial and spectral resolutions, the turnaround
    time, and repeat cycle are main factors limiting the usefulness of remote sensing
    products for precision crop management [21]; in addition, data acquisition costs
    must be weighed against anticipated benefits. Current satellite-based products
    have limited application in crop management due to the low spatial and spectral
    resolutions provided and the large revisit periods. Spatial resolution has been
    improved in some new satellite sensors such as Ikonos or Quickbird, however lacking
    the narrow spectral bands required for quantitave parameter retrievals on which
    most of the applications mentioned before are based. Moreover, thermal imaging
    is currently limited to medium-resolution sensors such as TERRA-ASTER [22], providing
    90-m pixel size images which are impractical for site-specific agricultural applications.
    Alternatives based on airborne sensors can deliver higher spatial and spectral
    resolutions and are more flexible in terms of revisit time. Airborne remote sensing
    has demonstrated capabilities for vegetation condition monitoring due to high
    spatial and spectral resolutions used, ranging between 0.5- and 2-m pixel sizes
    with 2–20-nm bandwidths in the 400–2500-nm spectral range. The works conducted
    for crop management and stress-detection applications, such as the estimation
    of chlorophyll content with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager [23]–[26],
    leaf water content from the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer [27]–[31],
    carotenoid estimation [19], [32], dry matter content [33]–[35], and structural
    parameters like ground cover and leaf area index (LAI) minimizing background effects
    on traditional indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [36],
    are examples of the use of airborne sensors. In addition, high-spatial-resolution
    thermal imagery has demonstrated high potential for water stress detection in
    crops because of the increased temperature of stressed vegetation [37], [38],
    enabling the detection of water-stressed trees in orchards for site-specific field
    management [39]–[41]. However, the high operating costs, long turnaround times
    due to high volume of data processing acquired in large airborne campaigns, and
    the lack of private corporations providing cost-effective products have limited
    the use of airborne so far to research activities. Back in 1977, Jackson et al.
    [37] envisioned a fleet of airborne thermal scanners collecting remote sensing
    imagery over irrigated fields to generate maps for irrigation scheduling based
    on an automated decision support system. However, after 30 years, this vision
    still seems futuristic due to the mentioned limitations mostly based on the costs
    required and the operational complexity involved. Another potential application
    of canopy temperature measurements is its capability for genotype screening in
    breeding programs for drought resistance [42], [43]. A new era of remote sensing
    is emerging with the arrival of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications.
    Scientific interest in this type of platforms is growing, and a number of experiences
    have already been reported. Large fixed-wing UAVs, most of them NASA-funded, have
    been tested for agricultural applications, such is the case of the solar-powered
    Pathfinder Plus over coffee orchards in Hawaii [44], [45], the smaller RCATS/APV-3
    tested over California vineyards [46], or the future European Pegasus UAV [47].
    Miniaturization and cost reduction of inertial sensors, GPS devices, and embedded
    computers have enabled the use of a new generation of autopilots for inexpensive
    model aircrafts [48], [49]. At present time, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) autopilots
    are readily available for an easy integration with small model aircrafts. Rotary-wing
    UAVs are also available, but complexity of the flight control system, smaller
    endurance, and the lack of autopilots supporting helicopter platforms have prevented
    a wide use of this platform. However, some successful applications have also been
    developed [50]–[52]. Along with the development of low-cost autopilot systems,
    also imaging sensors have suffered a critical size, weight, and price reduction,
    evolving from large sensors, rack-mounted dataloggers, and control computers to
    palm size imagers that can be easily installed into these microaircrafts [44],
    [48]. An example is the development of uncooled thermal instruments which avoid
    the use of heavy and expensive cooled sensors yet obtaining similar results at
    better spatial resolutions. The main problem concerning this type of microsensors
    is that they require spectral and geometric characterization to retrieve physical
    values such as ground reflectance or surface temperature. This is the reason why
    most of the applications mentioned before focused only on digital values or visual
    qualitative interpretation. This paper describes the integration of COTS optical
    and thermal sensors placed on an unmanned aerial platform, focusing into radiometric
    quality of the acquired imagery. The main objective of this paper was to demonstrate
    that it is possible to combine successfully an unmanned rotary-wing platform and
    digital multispectral and thermal sensors, along with the appropriate calibrating
    methodologies, for agricultural applications. The assessment is conducted on narrowband
    vegetation indices in the 400–1000-nm and thermal spectral regions for quantitative
    parameter retrievals. Narrowband vegetation indices and thermal retrieval from
    crop canopies were then used to generate maps that could assist managers in water
    stress detection and many other site-specific applications in agriculture. In
    particular, this paper deals with the estimation of biophysical parameters such
    as LAI, chlorophyll content, a previsual indicator of stress based on the Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI) [53], and water stress detection using thermal imagery.
    Calibration and atmospheric effects are also considered and assessed for the correct
    retrieval of parameters from the UAV system. SECTION II. Methods The UAV helicopter
    platform was developed to carry a payload with thermal and multispectral imaging
    sensors for remote sensing operation. A total of 288 flights were conducted in
    spring and summer of 2007 for both flight testing and imagery acquisitions over
    crop fields for parameter validation and stress detection using narrow spectral
    bands and thermal imagery. A description of the payload, sensor calibration, physical
    models used for parameter retrievals from multispectral imagery, and thermal corrections
    to account for atmospheric transmission are given hereinafter. A. UAV and Payload
    Description The UAV airframe used in this paper was based on a model helicopter
    (Benzin Acrobatic, Vario, Germany), modified to carry the camera system, autopilot,
    and sensors. Modifications consist mainly in a larger engine (29 cc), oversized
    landing skids, and a container for camera installation. The UAV was controlled
    by an autopilot system (model AP04H, UAV Navigation, Madrid, Spain) which provided
    autonomous navigation based on waypoints programmed during the mission planning.
    The air segment [Fig. 1(a)] consists on a dual CPU logic which controls an integrated
    Attitude Heading Reference System(AHRS) based on an L1 GPS board, three-axis accelerometers,
    yaw rate gyros, and a three-axis magnetometer. The CPUs continuously monitored
    internal sensors for battery status, internal temperature, and barometric pressure,
    including an external revolutions per minute (RPM) sensor. The guidance is based
    on standard servos controlled by pulsewidth modulation outputs from the autopilot.
    A radio link communicates with the ground segment sending telemetry of position,
    attitude, and status at 20-Hz frequency. The ground segment [Fig. 1(b)] consists
    on a control box which contains a CPU that is in charge of processing the safety
    manual control and sends the telemetry to a laptop PC where the user application
    is running. This application monitors the status and position of the UAV and allows
    the user to upload and modify the flight plan. There is an additional GPS antenna
    on the ground control station used for pointing the telemetry antenna toward the
    UAV platform. Fig. 1. Block diagram showing the components for the (a) autopilot
    and (b) ground control station. Show All The flight plans are performed starting
    with the autonomous takeoff, continuing with an autonomous flight over a number
    of way points at a given altitude, and finally landing (Fig. 2). Flight altitude
    was selected depending on the study area to cover, camera field of view (FOV),
    and the desired spatial resolution for remote sensing imagery acquisition. The
    nominal speed in autonomous mode was fixed at 30 km/h. Fig. 2. Sample flight plan
    undertaken over four study sites, showing the path followed by the platform. Each
    numbered triangle symbols represent a waypoint programmed on the autopilot''s
    flight plan. Four consecutive flights are overlapped, showing the precise paths
    followed by the UAV. Show All 1. Multispectral Camera The multispectral sensor
    used in this paper was a six-band multispectral camera (MCA-6, Tetracam, Inc.,
    CA, U.S.). The camera consists of six independent image sensors and optics with
    user configurable filters. The image resolution is 1280 × 1024 pixels with 10-bit
    radiometric resolution and optics focal length of 8.5 mm, yielding an angular
    FOV of 42.8 ∘ × 34.7 ∘ . Table I shows a summary of the multispectral camera sensor
    specifications. Different bandsets were used depending on the objectives sought
    for the remote sensing study, including 25-mm-diameter bandpass filters of 10-nm
    full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) (Andover Corporation, NH, U.S.), with center
    wavelengths at 490, 550, 670, 700, 750, and 800 nm. The raw images were compressed
    on a proprietary format and stored on individual compact flash cards installed
    in the camera. Image triggering was activated from the ground control station
    when the helicopter reached the desired study site. Table I Multispectral MCA-6
    Image Sensor Specifications 2. Thermal Camera The thermal imager used in this
    paper was the Thermovision A40M (FLIR, U.S.) equipped with a 40 ° FOV lens and
    connected via IEEE-1394 protocol. The image sensor is a focal plane array based
    on uncooled microbolometers with a resolution of 320 × 240 pixels and spectral
    response in the range of 7.5–13 μm (Table II). The camera delivers digital raw
    images at 16 bits of at-sensorcalibrated radiance with a dynamic range of 233
    K–393 K. The sensor implements an internal calibration for nonuniformity correctionand
    internal temperature calibration. The camera was controlled by a PC104 embedded
    computer (Cool Little Runner 2, LiPPERT, Germany), storing one raw image on a
    compact flash card every 2 s over the entire flight. A laboratory calibration
    was conducted using a calibration blackbody source (RAYBB400, Raytek, CA, U.S.).
    During the calibration, a need for stabilization after switch on was noticed.
    Temperature changes over the course of 30 min show the convergence to the black
    body temperature (Fig. 3). Absolute temperature shifts observed were caused by
    the internal camera calibration which is automatically activated when the internal
    temperature changes above a configured value. A 1-h camera stabilization procedure
    was conducted before each remote sensing campaign. Table II Thermal FLIR Image
    Sensor Specifications Fig. 3. Changes of the radiometric temperature measured
    by the camera after power-on over the course of 2 h. Show All 3. Camera Geometric
    Calibration Several methodologies are available to conduct an accurate geometric
    calibration over nonmetric commercial cameras [54], [55]. The objective of this
    calibration is to recover the intrinsic camera parameters (focal distance, principal
    point coordinates, and lens radial distortion). In this case, Bouguet''s calibration
    toolbox [56] was used, consisting of placing a calibration checkerboard pattern
    on a fixed location and acquiring several images from different locations and
    orientations. The grid corner coordinates were extracted semiautomatically from
    the images, and the intrinsic parameters and exterior orientation (EO) were calculated.
    In the case of the thermal camera, a calibration pattern was built using resistive
    wires to obtain a bright pattern when electricity circulated through the wires,
    thus increasing their temperature. Bouguet''s model uses a different lens distortion
    model than the one implemented by the software employed for the aerotriangulation
    which is based on the study of Wolf [57]. In the former, radial and tangential
    distortion can be estimated. In this case, tangential distortion was neglected
    and only the radial component was taken into account. The equation for Bouguet''s
    model is shown in (1), whereas Wolf''s model is described in (2). A least squares
    adjustment was conducted to fit (2) to (1) dr= dr= k 1 r 2 + k 2 r 4 + k 5 r 6
    k 0 r+ k 1 r 3 + k 2 r 5 . (1) (2) View Source Table III shows the intrinsic parameters
    estimated for the thermal and multispectral cameras used in this paper. For the
    multispectral camera, in a second stage, one of the cameras was used as reference
    and the relative position of the rest of the cameras was estimated by solving
    the system as different stereo rigs for each reference–camera pair. Table III
    FLIR and MCA Cameras Intrinsic Parameters B. Multispectral Sensor Calibration
    and Vegetation Indices used for Parameter Estimation Multispectral image calibration
    was conducted using the empirical line method [58] by placing two 2- × 2-m leveled
    dark and white targets in a central location within the flight path of the UAV
    platform. Field spectral measurements were taken on the calibration targets with
    an ASD field spectrometer (FieldSpec Handheld Pro, ASD Inc., CO, U.S.) in the
    350–1050-nm spectral range at the time of image acquisition. The ASD field spectrometer
    was first calibrated using a Spectralon (SRT-99-180, LabSphere, NH, U.S.) white
    panel, therefore enabling the calculation of white and dark panel reflectance
    spectra to be used later for the empirical line calibration method. The empirical
    line calibration method derived the coefficients needed to fit uncalibrated airborne
    MCA-6 multispectral imagery to field-measured reflectance spectra. Fig. 4 shows
    sample imagery and reflectance spectra for different field targets acquired with
    the MCA-6 multispectral camera onboard the UAV platform over one of the study
    sites, which included a field planted with garlic, bright soil, dark soil, bare
    soil between wheat rows, and a wheat field. Spectra from the different targets
    clearly show the photosynthetic pigment absorption in the visible spectral region
    (400–700 nm) in green vegetation, with an increased reflectance due to canopy
    scattering in the near-infrared region beyond 700 nm. A field validation assessment
    was conducted to evaluate the calibration method used to calculate surface reflectance
    by measuring reflectance spectra with the ASD field spectrometer over different
    targets found on imagery acquired at different times of day. Fig. 5 shows the
    validation of the calibration method using cotton and corn fields. UAV airborne
    flights were conducted three times over the course of one day in June 2007, acquiring
    field ASD spectra over cotton, corn with different canopy densities, and bare
    soil. The UAV MCA-6 spectral imagery and field spectra were compared and generally
    agreed, yielding an RMSE=1.17%(n=90) after empirical line methods were applied
    at each flight time. Fig. 4. (a) Multispectral imagery collected by the MCA-6
    camera at 0.15-m spatial resolution and six spectral bands with 10-nm FWHM. (b)
    Spectra extracted from different image targets in the 400–800-nm spectral region.
    Show All Fig. 5. Validation of the surface reflectance acquired by the MCA-6 multispectral
    camera as compared with the ASD field spectrometer. The plot shows 90 points from
    3 flights over 5 targets (3 corn crop sites, 1 soil target, and 1 cotton site)
    for 6 spectral bands. Show All Three vegetation indices were calculated from the
    airborne spectra using the six 10-nm FWHM bands of the multispectral camera. The
    NDVI [59] was calculated to assess the estimation of canopy LAI. The transformed
    chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index(TCARI) [60] based on the modified
    chlorophyll absorption in reflectance (MCARI) [61], normalized by the optimized
    soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) [62] to obtain TCARI/OSAVI, is demonstrated
    to successfully minimize soil background and LAI variation in crops, providing
    predictive relationships for chlorophyll concentration estimation with narrowband
    imagery in closed crops [60] and in open tree canopy orchards [25]. Finally, the
    PRI, originally developed for xanthophyll cycle pigment change detection [53],
    a potential indicator for carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio monitoring [32], [63],
    [64], was calculated to assess its potential capability for water stress detection
    from the UAV platform. The PRI index was calculated with the MCA-6 camera using
    additional 10-nm FWHM filters centered at 530- and 570-nm wavelengths. The three
    indices are described in the following equations: NDVI;= R 800 − R 670 R 800 +
    R 670 TCARI;/OSAVI  = 3⋅[( R 700 − R 670 )−0.2⋅( R 700 − R 550 )⋅( R 700 / R 670
    )] (1+0.16)⋅( R 800 − R 670 )/( R 800 + R 670 +0.16) PRI;= R 570 − R 531 R 570
    + R 531 . (3) (4) (5) View Source Field measurements of crown LAI (cLAI) were
    conducted with a plant canopy analyzer (LAI-2000; Li-Cor, NE, U.S.) on an olive
    orchard using the method reported in [65]. A total of six trees were measured
    and identified on the high-spatial-resolution imagery acquired with the UAV platform.
    Field measurements of canopy LAI were also conducted on a variety trial corn field,
    and seven plots planted with different varieties were assessed. The mean spectral
    reflectance was calculated for each tree crown and variety plot, and indices were
    calculated. Relationships between field-measured crown and canopy LAI and the
    NDVI index were also developed. Leaf-level radiative transfer model PROSPECT [66]
    was linked with the canopy-level Forest LIGHT Interaction Model (FLIGHT) [67]
    to obtain predicting algorithms for chlorophyll concentration ( C ab ) from the
    airborne TCARI/OSAVI index. The modeling method consisted on ranging input chlorophyll
    a + b from 15 to 90 μ g/cm 2 and cLAI from 0.5 to 7. The rest of the input parameters
    were fixed for typical and field-measured structural parameters presented in Table
    IV. A total of 36 different input combinations were simulated, and TCARI/OSAVI
    was calculated from the modeled spectra [Fig. 6(a) and (b)]. Ground truth chlorophyll
    content was estimated for a total of 41 olive tree and peach crowns using the
    SPAD meter (SPAD-502DL, Minolta, Japan). A total of 50 leaves were sampled from
    each crown, and mean SPAD measurements were used to estimate the total chlorophyll
    content through SPAD– C ab relationships developed for each crop using destructive
    sampling methods based on spectrophotometer readings in the laboratory. Table

    concentration (cLAI=2, C ab =45 μ g/cm 2 ) . Show All To assess the capability
    of PRI for stress detection from the UAV platform, the PRI was calculated from
    the MCA-6 camera. A variety trial corn field was flown at different times during
    the course of the day, and variety plots that differed in water status were identified
    on the imagery. Assessment of PRI for stress detection was conducted by studying
    the relationships between PRI and plot temperature obtained from the UAV thermal
    and multispectral cameras. To remove the effects of canopy or soil temperature
    variations on the vegetation index, comparisons were made among corn plots with
    the same NDVI range. C. Methods for Surface Temperature Estimation Different methods
    have been proposed recently to retrieve surface temperature from thermal sensors.
    A review of methods can be found in [68]–[70]. The thermal sensor used in this
    paper provided a single band in the range of 7.5–13 μm ; therefore, only techniques
    developed for single-channel atmospheric correction were used. Methods based on
    the radiative transfer equation use (6) to estimate surface temperature. Needed
    parameters are atmospheric transmittance ( τ λ ) , emissivity ( ϵ λ ) , downwelling
    ( L ↓ atm,λ ) , and upwelling thermal radiation ( L ↑ atm,λ ) , which are driven
    mainly by water vapor content, air temperature, and distance to object L sensor,λ
    =⌊ ϵ λ B λ ( T S )+(1− ϵ λ ) L ↓ atm,λ ⌋⋅ τ λ + L ↑ atm,λ . (6) View Source The
    MODTRAN radiative transfer code [71] was used to model τ λ and L ↑ atm,λ , while
    L ↓ atm,λ was measured in the field with a thermal sensor (LaserSight, Optris,
    Germany) pointing toward the zenith upward with an FOV of 15 ° and a spectral
    response of 8–14 μm . Since only vegetation temperature was retrieved as part
    of this paper, a surface emissivity of 0.98 was considered as an accepted value
    for natural vegetation [72]. Local atmospheric conditions such as air temperature,
    relative humidity, and barometric pressure were measured at the time of flight
    with a portable weather station (Model WXT510, Vaisala, Finland) and used as input
    into MODTRAN model. A single-layer atmosphere with uniform conditions was considered
    for the simulations since the variation for the typical UAV flight altitude (150–200
    m) could be neglected. Both path transmittance and thermal radiance were simulated
    at different sensor altitudes and integrated for the spectral response range of
    the thermal camera. Two fourth-grade polynomial relationships were fitted for
    transmittance and thermal radiation as a function of path length. The results
    for different atmospheric conditions are shown in Fig. 7(a), demonstrating that
    flight altitude can influence surface temperatures, if not corrected for atmospheric
    conditions. For instance, a bias of more than 4 K can occur under high relative
    humidity and low temperatures. Fig. 7. (a) Simulated atmospheric transmittance
    and thermal radiation as a function of platform altitude. (b) Effects of flight
    altitude and atmospheric conditions T a ( ∘ C)/%RH on the surface temperature
    estimation for a back body at 300 K. (c) Distribution of the atmospheric correction
    effects as a function of the off-nadir view for a uniform black body at 300 K,
    atmospheric conditions 20 °C/60% RH, flight altitude of 150 m, pitch= 10 ∘ , and
    roll= 6 ∘ . Show All Due to the camera wide FOV (40°) and the helicopter tilt
    angles, the path lengths for each pixel had to be corrected. Assuming an image
    collected at a given time, the principal point of the camera P o is located at
    the coordinates ( X o , Y o , Z o ) with an attitude of (ϕ,ω,κ) which are pitch,
    roll, and yaw, respectively. An approximation of these values was extracted from
    the autopilot telemetry, and the calibration for pixel-to-sensor variations across
    the image was conducted. For a given point P with ground coordinates ( X p , Y
    p , Z p ) , the image coordinates of the corresponding pixel reduced to the principal
    point and with the effects of lens distortion ( x ′ p , y ′ p ) were estimated
    using the collinearity ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ x ′ p y ′ p −c ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ = 1 λ p M ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ X p − X o Y
    p − Y o Z p − Z o ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ (7) View Source where M is the rotation matrix obtained
    from the attitude angles, c is the focal distance, and λ p is the associated scale
    factor. Equation (7) can be reversed, and therefore, the ground coordinates for
    a given pixel can be calculated with (8) and (9) if the center of projection of
    the image ( P o ) and ground elevation are known, and the terrain is considered
    flat X p = Y p = Z p = λ p ⌊ m 11 x ′ p + m 21 y ′ p + m 31 (−c)⌋+ X o λ p ⌊ m
    12 x ′ p + m 22 y ′ p + m 32 (−c)⌋+ Y o λ p ⌊ m 13 x ′ p + m 23 y ′ p + m 33 (−c)⌋+
    Z o (8) View Source where λ p = m 12 x ′ p + m 23 y ′ p − m 33 c Z p − Z o . (9)
    View Source Since Z p − Z o can be estimated as the mean altitude above ground
    level for a flat terrain, X p and Y p can be solved. The distance to the ground
    point can be expressed as D o−p = ( X o − X p ) 2 +( Y o − Y p ) 2 +( Z o − Z
    p ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ . (10) View
    Source We used this methodology to estimate the sensor-to-pixel distance across
    the image, needed to generate a transmittance and thermal radiation map for each
    image. The effect of this correction is shown in Fig. 7(b). A flight campaign
    was conducted by measuring simultaneously the surface temperature with a thermal
    gun (LaserSight, Optris, Germany) over three different surfaces: soil, white,
    and black targets (Fig. 8). The RMSE before calibration was 3.44 K, which was
    reduced to 0.89 K after atmospheric correction. Fig. 8. Comparison between ground
    truth surface temperature (IRT measured) and that obtained from the thermal camera
    at 150-m flight altitude before (×) and after (°) applying the atmospheric correction.
    Show All D. Automatic Mosaicking with Aerotriangulation Methods GPS and INS systems
    used along with photogrammetric methods enable the estimation of direct platform
    orientation without ground control points [73], [74]. Position and attitude were
    extracted directly from the autopilot AHRS with a time resolution of 0.05 s. The
    lack of precise synchronization between the autopilot time (based on GPS time)
    and image triggering prevented the estimation of the direct platform orientation.
    In the case of the thermal camera, time and mission time were reset before each
    flight campaign, acquiring one image every 2 s. This method enabled the estimation
    of an approximate EO for the projection center of each image. Calibrated images
    were imported into Leica Photogrammetric Suite (Leica Geosystems, Switzerland)
    together with the EO file in plain text format. Images taken during UAV turns
    and outside the study sites were removed. The low platform speed (30 km/h) and
    low altitude (200 m) of the UAV generated a high degree of overlapping among images
    along the flight direction (80%–90% overlap). The high overlapping obtained was
    very important to ensure that only the most nadir part of each image was considered
    to avoid viewing directional effects on both multispectral and thermal imagery.
    Fig. 9 shows a study area with red rectangles representing the image footprint
    over the orange tree study site, with the yellow rectangle indicating the overlapping
    area of a stereo pair. Once the model was created and configured, tie points were
    generated automatically, and a minimum number of ground control and check points
    were manually measured on the corresponding images. Aerotriangulation was calculated,
    and the results were revised until the rms error of the ground control points
    was below the estimated pixel resolution. Finally, an orthomosaic could be generated
    using an existing DTM or a uniform terrain height (Fig. 10). Fig. 9. Footprints

    Show All E. Study Sites During the validation stage of the remote sensing UAV
    system, a total of three study sites were selected to conduct airborne campaigns
    with onboard remote sensing instruments to validate the ability for biophysical
    parameter retrieval. The detection of water stress in different crops was conducted
    on study sites with plant water status differences. A commercial peach orchard
    near Cordoba (Spain) was studied to assess if water stress levels could be detected
    with high-resolution thermal imagery acquired from the UAV platform. The field
    studied had part under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) [75], while the other
    part had ample water supply. Another study was carried out over a corn variety
    test field to show the performance of the multispectral camera over herbaceous
    crops and the use of narrowband vegetation indices to detect crop water status.
    The field was divided into 72 individual plots 2.4 × 10 m in size, comprising
    24 varieties replicated three times. The field was last irrigated in mid-June
    and was under water stress in July at the time of flight acquisitions. The study
    included measurements of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential in six
    different cultivars, taken four times during the day and coincident with the four
    flights that were undertaken on the 6th of July. Finally, an olive variety test
    orchard was flown to assess the capability of the multispectral imagery to retrieve
    biophysical parameters such as chlorophyll a + b content and LAI over discontinuous
    crops at the tree level. The orchard was very heterogeneous as compared to a commercial
    olive orchard because of the large number of varieties that had been planted.
    SECTION III. Results and Discussion Results from the 12 airborne campaigns flown
    over the peach orchard in July 2007 at solar noon showed thermal variations over
    the entire area due to variation in irrigation level. As expected, the canopies
    of trees under RDI were clearly warmer than those of fully irrigated trees (Fig.
    11), with an average difference of 4.3 K between trees supplied with full ET and
    RDI trees. This experiment demonstrated that low-cost thermal imagers onboard
    unmanned vehicles successfully estimated the absolute surface temperature through
    radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction methods, enabling the detection
    of tree water stress levels. Fig. 11. Thermal orthomosaic obtained from the UAV
    over the peach orchard at 40-cm resolution. The zoomed image on the top shows
    the water stressed trees (warmer, in red and yellow) as compared with the fully
    irrigated trees (blue). The bottom right image shows a low-altitude image where
    within-crown thermal variability is observed. Show All Results on the corn field
    experiment flown four times on June 6, 2007 with multispectral [Fig. 12(a)] and
    thermal cameras demonstrated that spectral reflectance was successfully calibrated
    as compared with ground ASD measurements, yielding 1.17% RMSE. The mean spectral
    reflectance and temperature extracted for each variety plot showed a relationship
    between the vegetation index proposed as an indicator of stress (PRI) and plot
    temperature as an indicator of canopy conductance. The reflectance spectra in
    the PRI region between 520 and 580 nm showed a positive slope between 530 and
    570 nm [Fig. 12(b)], typical of plants under water stress [64]. The physiological
    indicator of stress (PRI) and the canopy temperature for each plot were constrained
    to NDVI values ranging between 0.76 and 0.78 to minimize structural and soil effects
    on the indices. The results shown in Fig. 13(a) prove the lack of relationship
    between NDVI and canopy temperature for such a small range of NDVI values. These
    results suggest that the differences in plot temperature were due to canopy conductance
    and water stress levels, but not due to structural parameters or differences in
    ground coverage. On the other hand, physiological indicators of stress such as
    PRI and canopy temperature showed a good relationship within the same NDVI levels
    ( r 2 =0.69) [Fig. 13(b)], suggesting that both visible (400–700-nm spectral range,
    PRI) and thermal regions (7.5–13 μm ) were able to detect crop water stress levels
    from the low-cost UAV platform. Fig. 12. (a) Corn plots of different varieties
    imaged by the MCA-6 camera onboard the UAV system. (b) Extracted reflectance spectra

    thermal camera and spectral indices calculated from the multispectral camera over
    corn blocks under same NDVI levels for (a) block T versus NDVI and (b) block T
    versus PRI. These plots demonstrate the sensitivity of PRI as indicator of water
    stress. Show All One important application in plant breeding would be to use the
    canopy temperature measurements from the UAV platform for screening different
    genotypes for drought avoidance. This approach was successfully used in wheat
    sometime ago [42] and has been tried in other breeding programs (i.e., [43]),
    but it has been limited by operational difficulties associated with the use of
    sensors at ground level. The results obtained from the flights over the corn variety
    trial illustrate the potential of this platform for genotype screening. Fig. 14
    shows the genotypic variability in canopy temperatures measured from the UAV at
    four different times on the 6th of July. On that day, there was significant water
    stress, as indicated by midday leaf water potential values that varied between
    −1.3 and −1.5 MPa. Canopy temperatures in the morning were quite uniform among
    corn cultivars, but they started to diverge as the day went on. Fig. 15 shows
    the genotypic differences between two cultivars that had very similar NDVI but
    that clearly differed in their stress response. In the morning, both canopies
    were cooler than the air, and the stomatal conductance values were quite high,
    indicating high transpiration rates. As water stress set in, the stomata close
    and canopy temperatures increase. By early afternoon, the time of maximum evaporative
    demand, the stomata are quite closed and the canopies are warmest. However, one
    genotype is cooler than the other and has higher stomatal conductance and, hence,
    transpiration (Fig. 15). It should be emphasized that such genotypic differences
    were detected in our flights among commercial varieties, while differences of
    greater magnitude should be expected among breeding lines. Fig. 14. Thermal images
    acquired over the corn field at 0.4-m pixel resolution showing the T c − T a changes
    at four different times of day. The greatest thermal variability between corn
    variety plots is obtained at midday, continuing during the afternoon. Show All
    Fig. 15. Diurnal stomatal conductance (G) and canopy T c − T a acquired from two
    corn cultivars. Differences found in the stomatal conductance at noon for both
    cultivars yielded variations that could be tracked by the thermal imagery. Show
    All The estimation of chlorophyll concentration from the multispectral instrument
    onboard the UAV used the Mahalanois supervised classification method to extract
    pure crown regions of interest for each individual tree in the olive and peach
    orchards. The TCARI/OSAVI chlorophyll index calculated from the mean crown spectra
    extracted from the imagery successfully estimated chlorophyll a+b concentration.
    A comparison between field-measured C ab and airborne-estimated C ab yielded an
    RMSE of 4.2 μ g/cm 2 and r 2 =0.89 (Fig. 16), demonstrating the capabilities of
    the multispectral MCA-6 camera onboard the UAV platform for estimating chlorophyll
    content at the crown level. Fig. 16. Ground truth chlorophyll content ( C ab )
    measured in olive and peach trees compared with UAV-estimated C ab through the
    TCARI/OSAVI index and predictive algorithms. Show All NDVI and LAI relationships
    were studied for olive and corn [Fig. 17(a)]. In the case of olive trees, NDVI
    was calculated for each individual tree using the mean spectra from the same regions
    of interest that were used for chlorophyll content estimation. For the corn field,
    NDVI was calculated using the average spectrum from each block. In both cases,
    NDVI correlated with the ground truth LAI ( r 2 =0.5 for corn; r 2 =0.88 for olive
    trees) . The lower correlation in the corn field is probably related to the differential
    responses of corn canopy architecture to water deficits, as the leaves of some
    cultivars had rolled and become more erected to reduce plant radiation load. The
    resulting RMSE for the estimated LAI was 0.16 [Fig. 17(b)]. From the extracted
    crown spectra in the olive orchard [Fig. 18(a)], maps of mean chlorophyll a+b
    content [Fig. 18(b)] and LAI [Fig. 18(c)] were generated using the relationships
    described earlier. The resulting maps show the spatial variability of chlorophyll
    content and LAI over the orchard obtained from the UAV system. Fig. 17. (a) Relationships

    the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based
    UAV equipped with COTS inexpensive thermal and multispectral imaging sensors.
    The low cost and operational flexibility, along with the high spatial, spectral,
    and temporal resolutions provided at high turnaround times, make this platform
    suitable for a number of applications, including precision farming or irrigation
    scheduling, where time-critical management is required. The laboratory and field
    calibration methods provided a six-band 10-nm FWHM multispectral imagery with
    RMSE of 1.17% in ground reflectance and less than 0.2-m spatial resolution. For
    the thermal camera, the atmospheric effects on transmittance and atmospheric thermal
    path radiation were found to be very important even for low-altitude flights where
    errors higher than 4 K could be achieved if those effects were not considered.
    Atmospheric correction methods based on MODTRAN radiative transfer model showed
    the successful estimation of surface temperature images of 40-cm spatial resolution,
    yielding RMSE < 1 K. Appropriate bandset configurations selected for the multispectral
    camera enabled the calculation of several traditional narrowband vegetation indices
    (NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI, and PRI) which were linked to biophysical parameters using
    quantitative methods based on physical approaches such as PROSPECT, SAILH, and
    FLIGHT models. The validation results obtained for the estimation of LAI in corn
    ( r 2 =0.5) and olive trees ( r 2 =0.88) , chlorophyll a + b concentration (RMSE=4.2
    μ g/cm 2 ; r 2 =0.89) , and the relationships between canopy temperature and stomatal
    conductance in corn revealed results comparable to those obtained in similar experimental
    campaigns using current state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer of multiband sensors
    onboard manned aircraft [25], [36], [40] and open way to the use of this platform
    as a screening tool in drought resistance breeding programs. The PRI used for
    stress detection demonstrated on imagery acquired over corn fields that the vegetation
    index was well related with canopy temperature ( r 2 =0.69) , suggesting its use
    as a good indicator of water stress. Photogrammetric techniques were required
    to register the frame-based imagery to map coordinates. Cameras were geometrically
    characterized with their intrinsic parameters, achieving location errors within
    one pixel size. These techniques, along with the position and attitude data gathered
    from the autopilot, enabled the generation of large mosaics semiautomatically
    with the minimum use of ground control points. The main limitations encountered
    for this platform were the endurance (20 min) and the low flight speed (30 km/h),
    limiting the productivity to 70 hectares per flight. However, the operating flexibility
    of vertical takeoff and landing platforms make it ideal for experimental purposes.
    For large commercial agricultural applications, where hundreds of hectares should
    be monitored quickly, the use of fixed-wing UAVs with enhanced endurance, moderate
    cruise speeds, and easier operation would be preferred to rotary-wing aircrafts.
    UAV-based remote sensing platforms are expected to fill the gap in the extended
    use of remote sensing in agriculture. with the cost reduction of autopilots and
    imaging sensors, it will soon become an invaluable tool to monitor the water status
    of crops, with the aim of achieving Jackson''s envision in the 1970s for real-time
    irrigation scheduling and crop monitoring. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like

    • The potential of low-cost UAV-based image data for maize ETc prediction was
    evaluated. • Three vegetation indices NDVI, SAVI, and EVI were used to determine
    Kcb. • Two different forms of Ks methods (CWSI and DACT) were compared. • The
    robustness and adaptability of UAV-based ETc estimation model across different
    irrigation treatments was discussed. Abstract Timely and accurate estimation of
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is essential for efficient irrigation management
    at the farmland scale. However, effective decision-making for irrigation scheduling
    requires high spatiotemporal-resolution data to provide within-field heterogeneity
    information. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of optical and
    thermal information obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to quantify
    maize (Zea mays L.) ETc within the framework of the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient
    approach. Canopy temperature-based crop water stress index (CWSI) and number of
    degrees above canopy threshold (DACT) were used to determine the stress coefficient
    (Ks). Three types of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted
    vegetation index (SAVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were adopted to determine
    basal crop coefficient (Kcb). Then the two forms of stress coefficient in combination
    with three vegetation indices (VIs) were evaluated to estimate daily crop ETc
    under different irrigation treatments over two years in the southwest region of
    Inner Mongolia, China. The results demonstrated that the combination of NDVI and
    CWSI produced the best estimates of maize ETc, with R2 of 0.84 and root mean square
    error (RMSE) of 0.50 mm/day. The DACT-based model also performed well, with R2
    of 0.77–0.80 and RMSE of 0.53 mm/day. Although the results varied with irrigation
    levels, the daily mean bias error of ETc predictions over different years indicated
    acceptable accuracy, with a mean bias error (MBE) of 0.48 mm/day. Sensitivity
    analyses indicated that ETc models were most sensitive to the slope of the linear
    regression between Kcb and VIs, followed by soil evaporation constant and influential
    factor in Ks_DACT. From this study, the combinations of vegetation index and CWSI,
    as well as DACT, were recommended as alternative approaches for estimating ETc
    due to intrinsic simplicity and easy interpretation. These ETc models relying
    on UAV-based multi-sensor data thus show promising potential in farmland-scale
    applications. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Unmanned

    approachWater stress coefficient 1. Introduction Water scarcity will increase
    rapidly in irrigated agriculture due to population growth and an increase in food
    demand by 2050 (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012, Elliott et al., 2014; Molden,
    2007; Ray et al., 2013). In semi-arid and arid areas, the use of deficit irrigation
    has been proposed to alleviate water scarcity and improve yields (Ali et al.,
    2007; Farre et al., 2009; Fereres et al., 2007; Tari et al., 2016). A key aspect
    for deficit irrigation relies on precise information about crop water requirements,
    including timely and accurate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimation (Helman
    et al., 2019). Conventionally, ETc can be monitored using in-situ measurements,
    such as weighing lysimeters (Lopez-Urrea et al., 2012), eddy covariance systems
    (Liu et al., 2013), and large aperture scintillometers (Hemakumara et al., 2003).
    However, such methods are not suitable for large-scale estimates of ETc due to
    their substantial expense and land surface heterogeneity. A practical and commonly
    accepted indirect approach, the FAO-56 method, estimates ETc by multiplying the
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by a crop coefficient (Kc) (Allen et al., 1998).
    Kc represents characteristics of a specific crop with respect to canopy properties,
    ground cover, and aerodynamic resistance; however, in-situ measurement of it still
    cannot describe the spatial variation of ETc within a farm. (Anderson et al.,
    2017, Er-Raki et al., 2007, Glenn et al., 2011, Katerji and Rana, 2006, Testi
    et al., 2004, Pereira et al., 2015). Significant advances in remote sensing technology
    have provided temporally and spatially distributed information regarding crops.
    Combining remote sensing-based data with the FAO-56 method makes it possible to
    monitor large-scale ETc in support of irrigation management. Relevant studies
    have been conducted over the past two decades (Bausch, 1995, Calera Belmonte et
    al., 2003, Campos et al., 2010, Campos et al., 2017, Choudhury et al., 1994; Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2013; Pôças et al., 2015). Furthermore, numerous other studies have investigated
    approaches using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs) for ETc prediction of
    annual crops in a simple, robust, and operational manner(Campos et al., 2010,
    Campos et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2017a, Jin et al., 2017b; Mateos et al., 2013).
    Nevertheless, satellite data cannot obtain timely crop growth information during
    the entire growing season, and cannot describe the detailed variation of ETc at
    the farmland scale due to low resolution and variable weather conditions (Wan
    et al., 2020). Recent developments in the miniaturization of sensors and energy
    storage technology have led to the current explosion in the applications of Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for data acquisition for precision agriculture because of
    their high spatio-temporal resolution compared with satellite platforms (Colomina
    and Molina, 2014, Hill et al., 2017, Sidike et al., 2018). The UAV imagery-based
    multispectral VIs have exhibited a relatively high prediction accuracy with regard
    to estimating Kc at farmland scale. Shao et al. (2021) utilized different types
    of VIs extracted from UAV-based multispectral imagery to monitor maize Kc during
    an entire growing season. UAV-based systems have the advantage of rapidly mapping
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and a significant relationship
    between NDVI and the Kc in maize (Zea mays L.) was observed over the entire growing
    season (Zhang et al., 2019). The combined use of VIs derived from UAV-based multispectral
    images was also applied to predict ETc with the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach
    in maize (Tang et al., 2019), but the prediction accuracy was low with the root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 0.95 mm/day. Various studies demonstrated that appropriate
    VIs (NDVI, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and enhanced vegetation index
    (EVI)) can be used to efficiently monitor Kc compared with traditional measurements
    (Pôças et al., 2020). However, the application of VIs for the prediction of actual
    Kc values is not successful. The main problem is that most of the commonly used
    VIs represent the effects of potential growth reduction, but often lose sensitivity
    to water stress when its effect is only noticeable on the transpiration rates
    (Pôças et al., 2020). Due to the relationship between vegetation surface temperature
    and transpiration, thermal-based methods are highly suited for the detection of
    water stress status (Han et al., 2016, Pereira et al., 2015; Pôças et al., 2020;
    Veysi et al., 2017). Kullberg et al. (2017) compared several indices, including
    the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tcratio), Degrees
    Above Non-Stressed (DANS), and Degrees Above Canopy Threshold (DACT), based on
    canopy temperature for assessing the crop water stress coefficient (Ks) and resulting
    ETc using the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach. Olivera-Guerra et al. (2020)
    developed a new irrigation retrieval method at the Landsat pixel-scale based on
    optical and thermal data and the Ks derived from land surface temperature data.
    Currently, the use of satellite coincident optical and thermal data is still hampered
    by the lack of fine spatial and temporal resolutions at the farmland scale (Wulder
    et al., 2019). In addition, UAV-based thermal imagery has been applied for crop
    water status detection (Martinez et al., 2017; Santesteban et al., 2017; Zhang
    et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019), but has not been tested to estimate ETc from
    thermal-based Ks. As stated above, Ks can be quantified by crop canopy temperature.
    Therefore, it is necessary to investigate which simple method is better for assessing
    Ks and ETc around solar noon on sunny days on a farmland scale. In addition, the
    great potential of using combined data from multiple sensors to detect Ks and
    improve ETc assessment has not been well studied using UAVs. Here, we utilized
    UAV-based VIs and crop canopy temperature products to conduct a two-year study
    over a maize farm. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) investigate
    the potential of low-cost UAV-based imagery for maize ETc estimation; (2) compare
    the accuracy of each method to predict daily ETc, through a combination of three
    methods (NDVI, SAVI, and EVI) to determine basal crop coefficient (Kcb) and two
    different forms (CWSI and DACT) of Ks methods; and (3) evaluate the robustness
    and adaptability of UAV-based ETc estimation model across different irrigation
    treatments. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Field experimental design A two-year
    field experiment was conducted on a 1.13 ha farm field situated in Zhaojun Town
    in the southwest region of Inner Mongolia, China (40°26''0.29"N, 109°36''25.99"E).
    The climate is semi-arid and the soil type is loamy sand. A more detailed description
    of the site is provided by Zhang et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019, Zhang et al.,
    2019. The field was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system (Valmont Industries,
    Inc., Nebraska, USA) (Fig. 1). Maize (cv. ‘Junkai 918′) was planted in mid-May,
    tasseled in July, and harvested for silage in September 2018 and 2019. Inter-row
    spacing was 0.58 m and row direction was east-west. To avoid plant nutrient stress
    and weeds, fertilizer and herbicide were applied according to local farmer practices.

    indicate five treatment (TR) region divisions. Red dots are time domain reflectometry
    (TDR). In both years of the experiment, there were five treatments and five levels
    of irrigation. Each of the treatments was replicated three times with an individual
    plot size of 6 × 6 m. Treatment 1 was applied irrigation to fully satisfy crop
    water requirements during the whole growing season. In 2018, due to frequent rainfall
    during the entire growing season, deficit irrigation treatments were only applied
    during the rapid and middle growth stages. In 2019, the deficit irrigation treatments
    were applied during the entire growing season. Around 90 % of field water holding
    capacity was the benchmark of abundant irrigation. The amount of irrigation (Table
    1) in each treatment was measured by rain gauge cylinders with three replications.
    Meteorological data were obtained from a weather station located on a 1-ha alfalfa
    plot adjacent to the research field. The time courses of precipitation and maximum
    air temperature during the maize growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are shown in
    Fig. 2. The total precipitation in the period was 272 mm and 113 mm in 2018 and
    2019, respectively. The daily maximum air temperature ranged between 20 and 36 °C
    in both years. Table 1. Irrigation water amounts applied (mm) during the early,

    UAVs were used to capture images between 11:00 and 14:00 local time over the entire
    maize growing season in 2018 and 2019. The interval between flights was 10–20 min.
    The date of UAV data collection and weather conditions were shown in Table 2.
    The DJI Phantom 4 Pro (DJI, Shenzhen, China) obtained nadir (camera lens downward
    vertically) RGB images by flying at an altitude of 50 m above ground level (AGL).
    The instrument’s field of view was 84° and there were 90 % front and side image
    overlaps. With these specifications, the spatial resolution was 1.25 cm. A six-rotor
    unmanned aircraft DJI S900 (DJI, Shenzhen, China) platform was developed to carry
    multispectral and thermal cameras (Fig. 3). The payload lift capability was 2 kg.
    The multispectral camera, MicaSense RedEdge (RedEdge, MicaSense, Inc., Seattle,
    WA, USA) with a 5.5 mm focal lens, includes 5 bands (Blue, Green, Red, Near IR,
    and Red Edge) and produces 1280 × 960 pixels multispectral images. The FLIR Vue
    Pro R 640 thermal imager (640 ×412 pixels, 13 mm lens, and 9 Hz frequency) with
    a spectrum range of 7.5–13.0 µm was used to record the thermal imagery. A Pixhawk
    autopilot (CUAV, Guangzhou, China) was used as a flight control system and allowed
    for waypoint operations. The UAV flight path of the DJI S900 was planned using
    Mission Planner ground control station software (ArduPilot). The flight heights
    were set at 60 and 70 m AGL for thermal and multispectral images, respectively,
    and the flight path resulted in 85 % front and side overlap, providing ground
    sampling distances of 7 cm and 4.77 cm, respectively. The surface temperature
    was measured with a handheld infrared thermometer (RAYTEK ST60 +) over black and
    white diffuse boards (Group VIII, Provo, Utah, USA) and water during the UAV flight.
    More detailed calibration information for the UAV-based thermal imagery is provided
    in Zhang et al. (2019). Table 2. The date of data collection. DAS: day after sowing;

    soil water content, canopy height, and leaf area index. Volumetric water contents
    at depths of 30, 60, and 90 cm in the soil profile were measured by using the
    traditional gravimetric method with three measurements in each plot. The dates
    of in-situ soil moisture observations were shown in Table 2. Each time-domain
    reflectometry (TDR) (TDR-315 L, Acclima, Meridian, Idaho, USA) was used to record
    volumetric soil water content every 30 min at depths of 30, 60, and 90 cm in each
    irrigation treatment. Plant heights (h) were manually measured using a measuring
    tape, with three readings in each plot. LAI was measured at the same observation
    points for plant height using an LAI-2200 plant canopy analyzer (LI-COR, Lincoln,
    NE, USA) on the corresponding flight days. 2.2.3. Image processing The Pix4Dmapper
    software (Pix4DInc., Lausanne, Switzerland) was used to mosaic and orthorectify
    the UAV RGB, multispectral, and thermal images. The multispectral images were
    calibrated using MicaSense calibrated reflectance panels (MicaSense, Seattle,
    WA, USA) during the flight. The raw multispectral image digital numbers were later
    converted to reflectance values. During post-processing, thermal images adjusted
    parameters to environmental conditions, such as air temperature and humidity,
    to conduct radiometric conversion. 2.3. Canopy spectral and thermal information
    extraction UAV-based VIs were extracted from the raw spectral bands (red, green,
    blue, near-infrared, and red-edge) and used as canopy spectral features. Additionally,
    three kinds of VIs, previously used to estimate Kcb, were calculated (Table 3).

    cover (fc) and maize canopy temperature were estimated using the red-green ratio
    index (RGRI)-Otsu method (Zhang et al., 2019). The formulas for RGRI calculation
    are presented in Table 3. Additionally, fc, the percentage of vegetation area
    per ground surface area, was extracted from RGB imagery using the RGRI method.
    Classified maize pixels were divided by the total number of pixels in the plot
    to calculate fc. The maize pixels (value: 255) in the RGB images could be classified
    with the OTSU method. The classification image values were multiplied by the corresponding
    thermal infrared image values to extract the temperature of maize canopy (T).

    extraction of maize canopy. For the soil mask image, the pixel digital values
    of maize were 255, and the pixel values of soil were 0. Two water stress indices
    (CWSI and DACT) were used to calculate Ks. The formulas for CWSI and DACT calculations
    are presented in Table 3. The DACT was calculated using the canopy temperature
    and the canopy temperature threshold (Tcritical). Tcritical is a known constant
    for a given crop. For maize, 28 °C has been suggested by the ARS Plant Stress
    and Water Conservation Laboratory (Evett et al., 2000, DeJonge et al., 2015).
    The CWSI, where dTm, dTLL, and dTUL are the actual measurement, lower limit, and
    upper limit of the canopy-air temperature difference (Tc-Ta), respectively. CWSI
    can be simplified by taking 5 ºC as the constant dTUL (Cohen et al., 2015, DeJonge
    et al., 2015, Taghvaeian et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2022). In this study, dTLL
    has been established for 2018 and 2019 (Zhang et al., 2022) as shown in (1), (2),
    respectively. (1) (2) where VPD represents vapor pressure deficit. VPD (kPa) is
    related to air temperature and relative humidity, and could be calculated by the
    Eq. (3) (Walter et al., 2000): (3) where Ta represents air temperature (°C), and
    RH represents relative humidity (%). More details of the CWSI calculation can
    be found in Zhang et al. (2022). 2.4. Calculation of evapotranspiration and crop
    coefficient Daily ETc was estimated by the soil water balance equation: (4) where
    ETc,i is evapotranspiration for the day of interest (mm), iPi is precipitation
    for the day of interest (mm), Ii is irrigation for the day of interest (mm), Dr,i
    is deficit for the day of interest (mm), Dr,i-1 is deficit for the previous day
    of interest (mm), Dp,i is deep percolation for the day of interest (mm), ROi is
    surface runoff for the day of interest (mm), and CRi is the capillary rise from
    the deep water table for the day of interest (mm). Runoff and capillary rise were
    ignored due to no slope on the plot area and deep groundwater table. The Dp was
    calculated using the FAO-56 method (Allen et al., 1998). Following irrigation
    or heavy rain, SWC in the root zone might exceed field capacity and thus some
    of them may go down into deeper soil layers. It was assumed that the soil water
    content is at field capacity on the same day of the wetting event, so the Dr,i
    will be zero. ETc,i was estimated by the FAO-56 approach (Allen et al., 1998).
    (5) The basal crop coefficient Kcb and the crop water stress coefficient Ks were
    calculated using the FAO-56 procedures (Jensen and Allen, 2016). Under standard
    conditions (RHmin = 45 %, u2 = 2 m/s), the three key values (looking-up table
    in FAO-56) for the basal crop coefficient Kcb,tab of maize were determined as
    0.15 at the rapid, 1.15 at the middle, and 0.15 at the late growth stage, respectively.
    For calculating the daily actual value of Kcb, the standardized Kcb values are
    adjusted according to observed LAI and h values (Pereira et al., 2020). The modified
    FAO-56 Kcb value can be calculated by (6), (7): (6) (7) where Kcb,adjust is the
    Kcb corrected by meteorological factors; Kcb,tab is the value for Kcb under the
    above referred standard climate; h is the average plant height (m); u2 is the
    daily average wind speed at 2 m above the crop canopy (m/s); RHmin is the minimum
    relative humidity; when the crop dries in the field (Kcb ≤ 0.45), the adjustment
    by Eq. (6) is not required. Kcb, a indicates the Kcb modified by the LAI; Kc,min
    is the minimum value for bare soil (0.15); and k is the canopy attenuation coefficient
    of radiation, and the value of k is 0.7 by Ding et al. (2013). The crop water
    stress coefficient Ks can be expressed as a simple linear model following the
    procedures described in FAO-33 which is equal to the FAO-56 Ks procedure (Jensen
    and Allen, 2016). (8) (9) where θ is the mean volumetric soil water in the root
    zone (m3m−3); θt is the threshold water content (m3m−3); θwp is the permanent
    wilting point (m3m−3); θfc is the field capacity (m3m−3); p is the average fraction
    of available soil water that can be deleted from the root zone before moisture
    stress and is 0.55 for maize as previously recommended (Allen et al., 1998). Values
    for (8), (9) are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Soil characteristics and parameters

    (2013) 2.5. UAV-based ETc estimation methods based on the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient
    approach According to the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach, ETc is defined
    as follows: (10) where Ks is the soil water stress coefficient representing the
    influence of the soil water stress factor on crop transpiration; Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing the ratio of crop transpiration under no stress;
    Ke is the soil evaporation coefficient; ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.
    We evaluated two different forms of the Ks model in combination with three types
    of Kcb approaches. The two forms of the Ks model employed thermal information.
    First, CWSI was used to quantify Ks. According to Jackson et al. (1981), the first
    model was: (11) The second model employed DACT to calculate Ks. On the condition
    that DACT was 0 for no stress and positive infinity for high stress, the normalized
    relationship between Ks and DACT found in Kullberg et al. (2017) can be expressed
    as: (12) a is a variable optimized to reduce the RMSE between Ks determined from
    DACT. NDVI, SAVI, and EVI were used for the estimation of Kcb in this study. The
    linear function of the Kcb_VI approach can be given as: (13) Finally, we assumed
    constant rates of soil water evaporation and Ke values were related to fc according
    to Er Raki et al. (2007). Therefore, Ke values were derived as: (14) The value
    c was based on the frequency of irrigation and rainfall: from the early stage
    start until the NDVImax (DOY 161–202 in 2018 and DOY 159–207 in 2019) 13 and 7
    irrigation/rainfall events of > 0.2 *ET0 occurred (for relevant rainfall events,
    see Allen et al., 2006, p. 153). This was equivalent to rainfall events every
    3 days in 2018 and 7 days in 2019. With an average ET0 of 3.8 mm/day and 4.0 mm/day
    during the growing season, this corresponds to a coefficient of 0.8 in 2018 and
    0.3 in 2019. In order to analyze the effect a particular Kcb method may have on
    the accuracy of each Ks method, each stress coefficient was applied with each
    of VIs (NDVI, SAVI, and EVI) based Kcb values. ETc using all combinations of the
    two Ks methods and three Kcb methods were compared to ETc from the observed TDR
    and soil water balance measurements. Model performance was quantified by using
    the coefficient of determination (R2), RMSE, the mean bias error (MBE) and the
    relative root mean square error (RRMSE). The detailed workflow from feature extraction
    to model building and evaluation is presented in Fig. 5. There was a total of
    100 samples collected from 2018 to 2019, in which 70 samples selected randomly
    were the training set, and the remaining 30 samples were the validation set. For
    estimation models of the Ks, Kcb, and ETc, 70 % of the total samples in 2018 and
    2019 were used as the training set, and the remaining samples were used as the
    validation set. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download : Download

    relative importance of the parameters in the ETc models, three parameters (a,
    b0, and c) were subjected to a sensitivity analysis. a is a key influential factor
    in Ks_DACT; b0 is slope of the linear regression between Kcb and VIs; c is soil
    evaporation constant applied in Ke calculation. In the analysis, the values of
    these parameters were increased or decreased by up to 50 % of their original values
    and the simulated and original ETc values were then compared to determine the
    influence of these parameters on the models. 3. Results 3.1. Validation of soil
    water content by TDR and temperature measured by a thermal infrared camera The
    gravimetric method was used as the standard method to measure SWC at different
    depths in four of the measurement times with TDR, and the relationship was analyzed
    using linear regression with the data obtained from two methods. The measurements
    of TDR had higher accuracy with R2 of 0.95 (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res

    under different irrigation treatments Fig. 8 shows the effects of different levels
    of deficit irrigation on Kcb_FAO, Ks_FAO, and vegetation indices. As shown in
    Fig. 8A and B, Kcb_FAO gradually increased during the early stage, peaked at the
    middle stage, and decreased thereafter at the late stage. Compared with Kcb_FAO
    in 2018 (Fig. 8A), Kcb_FAO in 2019 (Fig. 8B) increased with increasing irrigation
    levels. For instance, the average of Kcb_FAO were 0.89, 0.85, and 0.79 for Tr
    6, 7, and 8, respectively. Compared with Ks_FAO in 2019 (Fig. 8C), Ks_FAO in 2018
    (Fig. 8D) was overall higher due to the large rainfall events occurring during
    the early to middle growth stage. Download : Download high-res image (628KB) Download

    is the boundary between the early and middle stages. The gray dashed line is the
    boundary between the middle and late stages. DAS represents the day after sowing.
    UAV VIs and thermal data were selected and conducted to investigate which parameters
    were sensitive to irrigation levels. As shown in Fig. 8C-J, the VIs increased
    gradually until the middle growth stage and then slightly decreased. Compared
    with SAVI and EVI, a significant saturation phenomenon was observed for NDVI at
    the late growth stage. The VIs in 2018 showed no obvious differences among the
    five irrigation levels during the entire growing season, while the VIs in 2019
    increased with increasing irrigation levels. The results indicate that NDVI, SAVI,
    and EVI are suitable for monitoring Kcb during entire growing season. Additionally,
    the changing pattern of canopy temperature (T) contrasts with the changes of Ks_FAO
    (e.g. the average of T were 26.8 and 32.8 for Tr 1 and 4, while the average of
    Ks_FAO were 0.95 and 0.87), indicating that T can be used to monitor Ks_FAO and
    is closely related to irrigation level during the entire growing season (Fig.
    8K and L). 3.3. Results of Ks and Kcb estimation To convert CWSI and DACT into
    Ks, the relationships between Ks_FAO values and two indices are shown in Fig.
    9A and B. Moreover, the relationships between Kcb_FAO and the three VIs are shown
    in Fig. 9C-E. The positive correlation between Kcb_FAO and VIs (NDVI, SAVI, and

    performed better (RMSE was 0.09). All the VI-based Kcb models exhibited very close

    of the two Ks methods and three Kcb methods is compared with TDR-derived ETc,
    as shown by scatterplots (Fig. 10) that include bias measurements via best fit
    lines (assuming intercept of 0), R2, and RMSE for each method. Satisfactory results
    from the ETc assessment based on Ks_CWSI model were achieved using Kcb_NDVI, Kcb_SAVI,
    and Kcb_EVI methods, with slope, R2, and RMSE of 1.02, 0.84, and 0.50 mm/day,
    0.99, 0.83, and 0.50 mm/day, and 0.924, 0.751, and 0.663 mm/day, respectively
    (Fig. 10A-C). Fig. 10D-F show that Ks_DACT model also provided comparable estimates
    of ETc (NDVI: slope = 1.04, R2 = 0.80, and RMSE = 0.53 mm/day; SAVI: slope = 1.00,
    R2 = 0.77, and RMSE = 0.53 mm/day; EVI: slope = 1.01, R2 = 0.77, and RMSE = 0.53 mm/day).

    Scatterplots of ETc obtained using various methods vs. ETc obtained by TDR soil
    water balance. Ks methods include CWSI (A, B, C) and DACT (D, E, F), Kcb methods
    include NDVI (A, D), SAVI (B, E), and EVI (C, F). Compared with the daily ETc
    values from the TDR soil water balance, RMSE values for each combination of Ks
    and Kcb method in 2018 and 2019 are shown in Table 6. For both Ks methods in 2018,
    the Kcb_SAVI method provided the best prediction accuracy with an average RMSE
    of 0.49 mm/day, while using EVI resulted in greater errors compared with other
    VIs (an average of 0.59 mm/day). In 2018, the two Ks methods performed at similar
    levels of accuracy. The two Ks methods performed at different levels of accuracy,
    and the lower RMSE of CWSI compared with DACT in 2019 indicates that CWSI has
    more potential to be used as a stress coefficient under stressed conditions. EVI
    exhibited the poorest performance in 2019 with an average RMSE of 0.67 mm/day.

    image data for assessment of ETc was confirmed, the influence of different irrigation
    levels on the performance of ETc prediction is still unclear. Fig. 11A shows the
    prediction results under different irrigation levels. The RMSE of using Ks_DACT
    was slightly increased for the more stressed treatments in 2019 (an average of
    0.81 mm/day). The Ks_CWSI model performed well at all treatments (an average of
    0.48 mm/day). Compared with the RMSE values for the two methods in the less stressed
    treatments, the Ks_DACT model exhibited a relatively poorer prediction result
    than the Ks_CWSI in more stressed treatments. Download : Download high-res image

    TDR soil water balance (B). Fig. 11B shows the MBE of daily ETc estimates over
    the study period. All combinations of Ks and Kcb methods overestimated ETc. Moreover,
    the two Ks methods performed at similar levels of accuracy, and the low MBE values
    with Ks_DACT and Ks_CWSI models indicate that these indices have the potential
    to be used to estimate cumulative water use. 3.5. Sensitivity analysis of the
    ETc models Fig. 12 shows the sensitivity analysis of different ETc models toward
    changing parameters a, b0 and c. No sensitivity analysis was done for parameter
    a in Ks_CWSI model as it was estimated independently as a function of VPD. Different
    ETc models exhibited similar behaviors with changing parameters. The sensitivity
    analysis reveals that the decreasing of 50 % of parameters a and c resulted in
    a reduction of 9 % and 18 % in 2018 ETc, respectively, and a reduction of 21 %
    and 10 % in 2019 ETc, respectively, regardless of ETc models. In 2018, when the
    value of parameter b0 was reduced by 50 %, both Ks-based ETc decreased by 33 %,
    35 %, and 24 % for Kcb_NDVI, Kcb_SAVI, and Kcb_EVI models, respectively. In 2019,
    when the value of parameter b0 was reduced by 50 %, both Ks-based ETc decreased
    by 40 %, 43 %, and 32 % for Kcb_NDVI, Kcb_SAVI, and Kcb_EVI models, respectively.
    In general, ETc models were most sensitive to parameter b0 in both years, indicating
    that the major differences in these models are their different descriptions of
    the Kcb. Additionally, the importance of water stress in ETc models was higher
    than soil evaporation under water deficit conditions (Fig. 12D vs. F). Download

    Discussion The spectral information used to calculate VIs from remote sensing
    data has shown potential for ETc prediction, but the reliability and the accuracy
    of these predictions have not been satisfactory under water stress condition (Pocas
    et al., 2020, Tang et al., 2019). For instance, Tang et al. (2019) reported that
    VIs-based ETc prediction model produced low accuracy with RMSE of 0.95–1.25 mm/day
    under different levels of deficit irrigation. This is mainly due to three problems:
    (1) the VIs easily saturate under high biomass conditions (Thenkabail et al.,
    2000, Fu et al., 2014); (2) most commonly used VIs are not responsive to early
    stages of crop water stress (Campos et al., 2013, Pocas et al., 2015); and (3)
    the developed ETc prediction models are not robust enough to assess the ETc of
    contrasting climate years (Pereira et al., 2020, Pocas et al., 2020). In this
    study, we proposed the integration of optical and thermal information to overcome
    the VI-saturation issue, extraction of a thermal-based water stress indicator,
    and development of a prediction model to improve the robustness of response to
    climate change. 4.1. Relationship between UAV-based VIs and Kcb/Ks Remote sensing-based
    VIs have been employed to assess Kcb and irrigation requirements (Campos et al.,
    2010, Campos et al., 2017; Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013; Mateos et al., 2013; Padilla
    et al., 2011), but it has been unclear whether UAV-based image data could monitor
    crop growth to forecast crop coefficients in different years. As shown in Fig.
    8, both Kcb_FAO and UAV-based image data provided time course plots of maize under
    different water applications. UAV-based VIs data were not sensitive to the slight
    water stress condition especially at the middle and late growth stage due to the
    saturation at high canopy coverage, and the results are consistent with previous
    studies (Becker-Reshef et al., 2010; Vergara-Diaz et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2020;
    Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). In the performance of each Kcb estimate method, we
    found that the correlations between Kcb with NDVI, SAVI and EVI were robust regardless
    of growing season and irrigation treatment with RMSE ranging from 0.07 to 0.12
    (Fig. 13A). In this study, the temperature changes showed an opposite trend to
    Ks_FAO, suggesting that temperature could monitor maize water status. Moreover,
    the close linkages between thermal-based temperature and water stress coefficients
    have been shown in many previous studies (Colaizzi et al., 2003, Kullberg et al.,
    2017, Olivera-Guerra et al., 2020). However, the correlation between Ks and DACT
    were more susceptible to climate factors and irrigation treatments in the performance
    of each Ks estimate method especially under water stress conditions (Fig. 13B).
    This indicated that the normalization equations or methodology of Ks_DACT may
    need to be calibrated by applying more severe stressed treatments and different
    climactic conditions. Download : Download high-res image (135KB) Download : Download

    for each treatment (B). UAV-based optical and thermal remote sensing can provide
    a more comprehensive description of maize growth by combining different image
    parameters. Most importantly, UAV-based optical and thermal remote sensing could
    generate high-resolution diagnostic ETc maps at different growth stages to support
    precision field management and decision-making. 4.2. Performance of regression
    methods in maize ETc prediction Previous studies have demonstrated that spectral-based
    indicators (VIs) and thermal-based indicators (CWSI and DACT) extracted from remote
    sensing images were linked to ETc (Mahmoud and Gan, 2019, Mokhtari et al., 2018,
    Olivera-Guerra et al., 2020, Pocas et al., 2020). Our study proved that NDVI,
    SAVI, EVI, CWSI, and DACT from UAV images could provide good characterizations
    of maize evapotranspiration, but they provided different prediction results. Regarding
    Kcb regression methods, Kcb_NDVI and Kcb_SAVI methods generally exhibited very
    close performance in both Ks methods (CWSI and DACT) for the two different years
    (Table 6). Kcb_NDVI model performed slightly better in each Ks based ETc prediction
    in 2019, while Kcb_SAVI model performed better in 2018. However, EVI performed
    slightly worse than the other two methods in both 2018 and 2019, regardless of
    thermal-based indicators (Table 6). This result agrees with previous studies (Pereira
    et al., 2015, Shao et al., 2021) that NDVI and SAVI were superior to EVI in maize
    ETc estimation applications because of the actual vegetation cover conditions
    reflected by these indices. Additionally, relatively lower RMSE values were achieved
    for Ks_CWSI regression in combination with three Kcb methods, compared with the
    Ks_DACT method (Table 6). This is likely attributable to the fact that CWSI obtained
    from in-situ data produced more accurate values than DACT for the prediction of
    crop water stress (Taghvaeian et al., 2014, DeJonge et al., 2015). The best performance
    for ETc prediction was the Ks_CWSI method combined with Kcb_NDVI, achieving an
    R2 of 0.84 and RMSE of 0.50 mm/day (Fig. 10A). Furthermore, compared with CWSI,
    DACT more consistently overestimated ETc on days with higher ETc values. One reason
    could be that DACT underestimated water stress status, and the normalization equation
    used in this study for maize still might not be adequate, as found in previous
    studies regarding optimal empirical values and stress levels (DeJonge et al.,
    2015, Kullberg et al., 2017). The different irrigation levels produced distinct
    maize canopy characteristics, resulting in different spatial and spectral features
    in the UAV-based images. Consequently, the prediction accuracy of ETc would vary
    with irrigation levels, and the mild-stressed irrigation treatments in both years
    exhibited better performance regardless of the Ks methods (Fig. 11A). In addition,
    all treatments produced slightly higher errors from the Ks_DACT model in 2019.
    The reason why the prediction accuracy decreased may be also related to the impact
    of soil evaporation. Soil evaporation is low under water stress conditions, and
    constant evaporation rates cannot reflect the role of soil evaporation, especially
    at early growth stages. Furthermore, the daily MBE values for ETc prediction over
    2018 and 2019 from the Ks_CWSI model and the Ks_DACT model combined with the Kcb_VI
    methods were similar (Fig. 11B). This result agrees with previous studies (Kullberg
    et al., 2017) that DACT had the same performance as CWSI in predicting cumulative
    ETc. Consequently, we concluded that the proposed models were robust in predicting
    ETc between different years. 4.3. Uncertainty and future works Under the current
    framework, the ETc models have the potential to improve irrigation scheduling
    by precisely managing crop stress and water supply. However, it still has some
    weaknesses that should be noted. The ETc calculation was based on the FAO-56 dual
    crop coefficient approach. Although the model validation was satisfactory, there
    still exist fitting parameters (a, b0, and c) in the model that need calibration,
    as the parameters may differ in crop type, irrigation management, and climatic
    conditions (Pocas et al., 2020). The water stress was calculated using stress
    index equations. Further work is suggested to investigate other stress indices
    for Ks evaluation without local calibration, which may reduce limitations in practical
    applications. The soil evaporation parameter c was set to be a constant value
    with the frequency of irrigation and rainfall. Further soil evaporation models
    can be developed to use UAV synthetic aperture radar data for estimating Ke under
    partial and full cover conditions. Moreover, the use of weighing lysimeters to
    validate daily ETc values increases the reliability of these results. For the
    maize ETc estimation models generated in the study, the effects of irrigation
    amount and sensitivity of parameters were analyzed over two years. Future work
    is needed to test the performance of ETc models in other climatological conditions
    to determine the applicability and transferability of these methods. 5. Conclusions
    The ability of optical and thermal information derived from multiple UAV-based
    sensors to monitor crop ETc under different levels of deficit irrigation was evaluated
    using VIs and temperature-based water stress indices. We found that UAV-based
    canopy temperature measurements were suitable for monitoring crop water status
    as well as Ks during the entire maize growing season. Two types of stress coefficient
    models, based on (1) CWSI and (2) DACT, were evaluated and found to provid the
    best results for crop ETc assessment in combination with Kcb_VI approaches in
    2018 and 2019 (R2 of 0.84 and 0.80; RMSE of 0.50 mm/day and 0.53 mm/day, respectively).
    Compared with NDVI and SAVI, the empirical Kcb_EVI model showed a relatively poorer
    prediction result. Although results varied with irrigation levels, daily MBE values
    of ETc prediction indicated that the proposed methods performed robustly over
    different years. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the parameters
    in ETc models, and the models were highly sensitive to the slope of the linear
    regression between Kcb and VIs, followed by soil evaporation constant and influential
    factor in Ks_DACT. The developed approach for estimating maize ETc at the field
    scale with high spatial-temporal resolution can improve irrigation management
    with precision agriculture. Future work is needed to investigate the combined
    use of ancillary models (radar-based models and soil water balance models) to
    retrieve soil evaporation values to further increase the accuracy of ETc estimation.

    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\

    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\
    \ canopy structure (height and Leaf Area Index);\n(iv) crop status; (v) canopy\
    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\
    \ photo to grayscale image, and then conversion to false colors. The upper part\
    \ of the image\n(darker soil color) corresponds to the most drained part of the\
    \ ﬁeld during the winter season, which\nwas then excluded from measurements. Results\
    \ of the experiment are published by Alvino et al. [83],\nreporting the effect\
    \ of shallow water tables on peach trees grafted on three peach seedlings.\nThere\

    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\

  verbatim_quote1: '"There was was a pioneering attempt to achieve airborne RS, unfortunately
    not supported by knowledge appropriate to the task, and this is the main reason
    that the RS image was not orthogonal.

    The goal was to integrate ground photos of each plant with airborne images to
    calculate the leaf area of each tree. For this goal, several trees were fully
    defoliated to have an accurate measure of Leaf Area Index (LAI)."'

  analysis: "The paper demonstrates that: \n1. Planet-derived multivariable linear\
    \ models with variables from different vegetation indices are a significant improvement\
    \ over the simple linear regression model used with the vegetation index time\
    \ series by Pearsons' r scores.\n2. Planet-derived time series of VIs can be used\
    \ to predict stem water potential across different vineyards with diverse soil\
    \ and understory vegetation characteristics with a globally trained ‘global’ multivariable\
    \ linear model using five predictor variables including the difference between\
    \ VI signal at the peak of season and that of the understory vegetation to account\
    \ for the fractional cover of the vines (\"∆VI\").\n3. These predictions using\
    \ the ‘global’ multivariable linear model were quite similar to predictions using\
    \ per-week site-specific models and hence can be used as a fast and efficient\
    \ tool for monitoring stem water potential in Mediterranean vineyards. \n\nThe\
    \ overall relevance score for this paper is 0.9, which is considered to be \"\
    Very Relevant\" on the scale provided. \n\nThe three most relevant verbatim quotes\
    \ from the paper are:\n\nQuote 1: \"Results from the Global-Mult model showed\
    \ that ∆NDVI had a signiﬁcant size effect, being a key factor in predicting Ψstem,\
    \ with only day of year having a stronger size effect and SAVI avg a similar effect\
    \ (Table 3).\n\nQuote 2: \"In general, correlations from simple speciﬁc-date regressions\
    \ between vegetation indices and Ψstem were also high for measurements across\
    \ the vineyard area (0.89 < r < 0.82 for MB-Reg and 0.64 < r < 0.67 for MB-Mult)\
    \ and along the season (r = 0.92 for both MB-Reg and Global-Mult), allowing predictions\
    \ of stem water potential variability in space and time.\"\n\nQuote 3: \"Finally,\
    \ the Global-Mult model with spectral-based indices derived from Planet satellites\
    \ was proposed to predict Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards. After deriving ∆NDVI,\
    \ SAVI avg, NDVI max and NDVI min of a speciﬁc vineyard a real-time Ψstem estimation\

    \a\nAbstract: Spectral-based vegetation indices (VI) have been shown to be good\
    \ proxies of grapevine\nstem water potential (Ψstem), assisting in irrigation\
    \ decision-making for commercial vineyards.\nHowever, VI-Ψstem correlations are\
    \ mostly reported at the leaf or canopy scales, using proximal\ncanopy-based sensors\
    \ or very-high-spatial resolution images derived from sensors mounted on small\n\
    airplanes or drones. Here, for the ﬁrst time, we take advantage of high-spatial\
    \ resolution (3-m)\nnear-daily images acquired from Planet’s nano-satellite constellation\
    \ to derive VI-Ψstem correlations\nat the vineyard scale. Weekly Ψstem was measured\
    \ along the growing season of 2017 in six vines\neach in 81 commercial vineyards\
    \ and in 60 pairs of grapevines in a 2.4 ha experimental vineyard in\nIsrael.\
    \ The Clip application programming interface (API), provided by Planet, and the\
    \ Google Earth\nEngine platform were used to derive spatially continuous time\
    \ series of four VIs—GNDVI, NDVI,\nEVI and SAVI—in the 82 vineyards. Results show\
    \ that per-week multivariable linear models using\nvariables extracted from VI\
    \ time series successfully tracked spatial variations in Ψstem across the\nexperimental\
    \ vineyard (Pearson’s-r = 0.45–0.84; N = 60). A simple linear regression model\
    \ enabled\nmonitoring seasonal changes in Ψstem along the growing season in the\
    \ vineyard (r = 0.80–0.82). Planet\nVIs and seasonal Ψstem data from the 82 vineyards\
    \ were used to derive a ‘global’ model for in-season\nmonitoring of Ψstem at the\
    \ vineyard-level (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5%; N = 970). The ‘global’ model,\nwhich\
    \ requires only a few VI variables extracted from Planet images, may be used for\
    \ real-time\nweekly assessment of Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards, substantially\
    \ improving the efﬁciency of\nconventional in-ﬁeld monitoring efforts.\nKeywords:\

    \ irrigation strategy in vineyards aiming to achieve\nhigh-quality berries for\
    \ premium wine production [1]. However, to optimize grape quality and\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 1615; doi:10.3390/rs10101615\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n2 of 22\nproduction deﬁcit, irrigation should be\
    \ properly controlled. Proper irrigation management is also\ncompulsory to achieve\
    \ uniform quality of berries across the vineyard area. An effective method to\n\
    guide irrigation management of wine grapes is continuous spatial (across the vineyard)\
    \ and temporal\n(along the season) monitoring of grapevine water status [2]. Water\
    \ status is typically quantiﬁed by\nmeasuring vine stem water potential (Ψstem),\
    \ which provides an indication of the impact of soil water\ncontent on grapevine\
    \ water status [3]. To achieve an accurate picture of the water status variability\n\
    across the entire vineyard area, continuous Ψstem measurements are required from\
    \ as many vines as\npossible. This task requires substantial human resources,\
    \ making it time consuming.\nEmerging precision agriculture tools such as proximal\
    \ and remote sensing offer possible\nreplacement, or at least support, of conventional\
    \ in-ﬁeld monitoring techniques [4,5]. Proximal\nand remote sensing tools may\
    \ be used to provide the required information for irrigation management\ncontrol\
    \ [6], as well as to allow spatial consideration of irrigation needs across the\
    \ crop ﬁeld [7]. Remote\nand proximal sensing have been used for monitoring vegetation\
    \ dynamics [8] and processes including\nwater status [9–11], plant nutrient content\
    \ [12,13], plant diseases [14,15] and crop phenotyping [16].\nThe information\
    \ received from sensors mounted on drones or small airplanes can be applied to\
    \ develop\nsite-speciﬁc irrigation and other management decisions [17]. Thermal\
    \ sensors mounted on airplanes\nor drones may provide information on plant water\
    \ status through the use of the crop water stress\nindex [18–20]. Crop water stress\
    \ index (CWSI), which is based on crop canopy temperature [21], has\nbeen recognized\
    \ as a reliable index for monitoring in-ﬁeld water status variability within a\
    \ vineyard\narea [22–25]. CWSI has been shown to correlate with Ψstem, though\
    \ typically displaying different\ncorrelations for different dates along the season\
    \ [26,27].\nAnother approach is to use vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral\
    \ bands as proxies\nfor water status parameters and/or yield production. For example,\
    \ Espinoza et al. [28], found that\nthe normalized difference vegetation index\
    \ (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation\nindex (GNDVI) derived\
    \ from very-high-spatial resolution images (2.6 cm) were both correlated with\n\
    pre-harvest leaf stomatal conductance (gs; r = 0.56 and 0.65, respectively) and\
    \ yield production\n(r = 0.68 and 0.73, respectively) in a cabernet sauvignon\
    \ vineyard near Benton City, Washington.\nBaluja et al. [22] found strong correlations\
    \ of spectral-based vegetation indices such as, GNDVI,\nNDVI and the modiﬁed simple\
    \ ratio (MSR) with gs (r = 0.84, 0.87 and 0.88, respectively) and Ψstem\n(r =\
    \ 0.76, 0.82 and 0.81, respectively) using images acquired from an unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicle in a\ncommercial rain-fed tempranillo vineyard in Spain. Their results\
    \ imply that VIs can serve as good\nwater stress indicators in vineyards when\
    \ using very-high-spatial resolution images (10 cm) that\nallow the extraction\
    \ of pure canopy pixels. As expected, they also found high correlations of thermal\n\
    data with gs and Ψstem; however, the correlation changed along the season [22],\
    \ meaning that a\nper-date calibration should be derived in order to provide recommendations\
    \ for irrigation scheduling\nthroughout the season.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [29]\
    \ proposed a normalized photochemical reﬂectance index (PRInorm) using a\ncombination\
    \ of the re-normalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), which is sensitive\
    \ to canopy\nstructure, and a red edge index, sensitive to chlorophyll content\
    \ (R700/R670), to detect xanthophyll\npigment changes and normalize for leaf area\
    \ and chlorophyll content level reduction induced by water\nstress. They found\
    \ that PRInorm was highly correlated with midday gs (r = 0.89) and leaf water\
    \ potential\n(ΨLeaf; r = 0.88) in an experimental pinot noir vineyard in California.\
    \ Lower correlations were also\nobtained with original PRI (r = 0.72 and 0.7,\
    \ respectively) and NDVI (r = 0.57 and 0.62, respectively) [29].\nUsing leaf-level\
    \ spectroradiometer measurements, Rodríguez et al. [30] and Maimaitiyiming et\
    \ al. [31]\nshowed that water status parameters such as equivalent water thickness\
    \ (EWT), ΨLeaf, Ψstem and gs\ncan be derived from spectral-based VIs in vineyards.\n\
    Though promising, most of these studies (including some not mentioned here) are\
    \ conducted\nat the leaf-level or make use of sensors mounted on small airplanes\
    \ or drones, offering a limited\nmonitoring technique in terms of coverage area.\
    \ The ﬁnancial cost of ground or aerial sensing can\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n\
    3 of 22\nhardly allow their application on a daily basis. Also, historically,\
    \ the satellite spatial and/or temporal\nresolution has been too coarse for in-ﬁeld\
    \ water status monitoring [32].\nA constellation of nano-satellites (using a large\
    \ number of small compact satellites at the same\ntime) was recently suggested\
    \ to overcome this spatio-temporal limitation [33]. Planet [34] is an example\n\
    of such a company operating a large number of CubeSat 3U form (10 × 10 × 30 cm)\
    \ nano-satellites,\nproviding daily images with 4 wavebands (RGB + NIR) at a high\
    \ spatial resolution of 3 m since\nearly 2016.\nIn this study, we make use of\
    \ the high spatio-temporal resolution images provided by Planet to\ncompare four\
    \ different VIs with midday Ψstem measured weekly along the growing season of\
    \ 2017 in\n81 commercial vineyards and in one experimental vineyard (Mevo Beitar)\
    \ in Israel. We examine the\nuse of simple regression and multivariable linear\
    \ models, with several VI-based metrics extracted from\nthe VI time series, to\
    \ predict spatio-temporal variability in Ψstem along the growing season. The main\n\
    goal is to provide a high-resolution satellite remote sensing tool to support\
    \ real-time deﬁcit irrigation\nmanagement in high-quality commercial vineyards.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. The Study Region\nOur study was undertaken over\
    \ 81 commercial vineyards and one experimental vineyard in Israel\nduring the\
    \ 2017 growing season. The study targeted three regions, Judea, Upper Galilee,\
    \ and Golan\nHeights, located in hilly areas in the central and northern parts\
    \ of Israel (approximately 110 km apart;\nFigure 1a) in which grapevines are grown\
    \ in small commercial vineyards for premium high-quality\nwine production. All\
    \ of the vineyards were subjected to a Mediterranean climate, characterized by\n\
    rainfall limited to the mild winter months and hot dry summers.\nFigure 1. (a)\
    \ Location of the three regions with the 82 vineyards used in this study shown\
    \ on a Google\nEarth map, and (b) aerial photograph of the experimental vineyard\
    \ at Mevo Beitar in the Judea region\n(location marked with a red star in (a).\
    \ The 60 plots at Mevo Beitar vineyard in which stem water\npotential (Ψstem)\
    \ was measured in two grapevines per-plot along the 2017 growing season is shown\n\
    in (b).\nIn the Golan Heights region, vineyards typically consisted of cabernet\
    \ sauvignon (32%), merlot\n(16%) and other red and white species (Table A1). Located\
    \ at elevations of 600–1120 m above sea level\n(m.a.s.l.), these vineyards receive\
    \ a mean annual rainfall amount of c. 800 mm y−1. The minimum and\nmaximum mean\
    \ air temperatures in this region during 2017 were −5.6 ◦C and 34.3 ◦C for January\
    \ and\nAugust, respectively.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n4 of 22\nIn the Upper\
    \ Galilee, vineyards consisted of cabernet sauvignon (22%), chardonnay (17%) and\n\
    other red and white species (Table A1), which were grown at elevations of 710–830\
    \ m.a.s.l. The mean\nannual rainfall amount in the Upper Galilee region is 670\
    \ mm y−1, with minimum and maximum\nmean air temperatures of −0.6 ◦C and 33.8\
    \ ◦C for January and August 2017, respectively.\nIn the Judea region, vineyards\
    \ mainly consisted of merlot (40%), cabernet sauvignon (22%) and\nother red species\
    \ (Table A1). Vineyards are typically located at elevation of 600–740 m.a.s.l.,\
    \ receiving a\nmean annual rainfall amount of c. 535 mm y−1. Minimum and maximum\
    \ mean air temperatures in\nthis region were 2 ◦C and 38.2 ◦C for January and\
    \ August 2017, respectively.\n2.2. Characteristics of the Vineyards and Irrigation\
    \ Strategy\nVine spacing in the 82 vineyards was at most 1.5 m × 3 m. Soils are\
    \ quite homogenous in the\nGolan vineyards, consisting mainly of brown alluvial\
    \ soils in the northern vineyards and peat soils in\nthe southern vineyards. In\
    \ Galilee and Judea vineyards, soils are much more heterogeneous, consisting\n\
    mainly of basaltic and brown terra rossa soils.\nThe Mevo Beitar experimental\
    \ vineyard, located within the Judea region (31◦43′ N; 35◦06′ E;\nred star in\
    \ Figure 1a), covers a total area of 2.4 hectares. The average elevation of the\
    \ vineyard\narea is 700 m.a.s.l. Grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon)\
    \ were planted in 2011 in\na northwest-to-southeast direction with a vine and\
    \ row spacing of 1.5 m and 3.0 m, respectively\n(Figure 1b). The height of the\
    \ canopy typically varies between 2.0 m and 2.5 m.\nIrrigation in the 82 vineyards\
    \ was through a surface drip irrigation system using unilateral\ncordons trained\
    \ to vertical shoot positioning (VSP) on a 2-m-high two-wire trellis system. The\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol unit was set manually to be as close as possible to the\
    \ agricultural standard practice [2,35].\nThe irrigation strategy used in the\
    \ vineyards is of deﬁcit irrigation based on ETo (reference\nevapotranspiration)\
    \ information provided by the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS) from a nearest\n\
    IMS station to the vineyard. In practice, irrigation was applied approximately\
    \ once a week, with a\ndaily amount that ranged between 0.8 and 1.43 mm per day\
    \ in Mevo Beitar. Deﬁcit irrigation started\non DOY 131 (DI start; Figure 2) and\
    \ was applied throughout the season until EOS. DI ranged along the\nseason between\
    \ 14% and 25% of the vine evapotranspiration (ETc) [2], while ETc was calculated\
    \ from a\nmodiﬁed leaf area index to crop coefﬁcient ratio for vines [36,37].\n\
    Figure 2. Daily time series of the four vegetation indices and weekly measured\
    \ midday stem water\npotential (Ψstem) along the grapevine growing season at Mevo\
    \ Beitar (VIs are averaged values over all\npixels within the vineyard area).\
    \ Important phenological stages are shown (Pre—the pre-season period\nwhen vines\
    \ are leaﬂess and understory vegetation is absent or dry; SOS—start of season,\
    \ coincident\nwith budburst stage; POS—peak of season, corresponding to full bloom\
    \ stage; EOS—end of season,\nthe harvest stage). DI start is the date when deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation started (DOY 131). Horizontal grey bar\nindicates the period of expansive\
    \ presence of understory weeds and grasses in the vineyard.\nRemote Sens. 2018,\
    \ 10, 1615\n5 of 22\nOther speciﬁc characteristics of the 81 commercial vineyards\
    \ are summarized in Table A1.\n2.3. Measurements of Midday Stem Water Potential\
    \ in Vineyards\nMeasurements of Ψstem were conducted periodically by a team of\
    \ agronomists hired by the\ngrowers, approximately once a week in six grapevines\
    \ per vineyard in each of the 81 commercial\nvineyards throughout the 2017 growing\
    \ season. Ψstem was measured prior to irrigation at solar noon\n(from 12:00 to\
    \ 14:30), using a portable pressure chamber (model Arimad 2, Kfar Charuv, Israel\
    \ and\nArimad 3000, MRC, Hulon, Israel) according to the procedures described\
    \ in [38]. Six sunlit, mature,\nfully expanded leaves from each vineyard were\
    \ double bagged (plastic bags covered with aluminum\nfoil) 1.5 h prior to measurement.\
    \ The leaves were disconnected from the vines by sharp cutting of the\nleaf petiole\
    \ and quickly placed in the pressure chamber. The time elapsing between leaf excision\
    \ and\nchamber pressurization was less than 25 s. The six grapevines were selected\
    \ by visual observation as\nrepresentative of the entire vineyard.\nAt the experimental\
    \ vineyard in Mevo Beitar (Figure 1a, Figure A1), we measured Ψstem in 60\nplots\
    \ (c. 5 m2 each) approximately every week during the 2017 growing season in order\
    \ to monitor\nthe spatial variability in Ψstem across the vineyard area. Each\
    \ plot contained two grapevines (total\nN = 120 vines), from which 4 leaves were\
    \ taken for Ψstem measurements. The Ψstem measurements in\nMevo Beitar were conducted\
    \ using a portable pressure chamber (Arimad 3000, MRC, Hulon, Israel), as\ndescribed\
    \ above.\n2.4. Vegetation Indices\nWe used four VIs in this study: the enhanced\
    \ vegetation index (EVI), the soil-adjusted vegetation\nindex (SAVI), and the\
    \ abovementioned GNDVI and NDVI. These four VIs, as many others, are based\non\
    \ the ratio of solar reﬂection at the visible bands (RGB) to that at the near\
    \ infrared (NIR) waveband\n(Table 1). The four VIs used here are regularly used\
    \ in studies for tracking changes in plant-related\ntraits, such as leaf growth\
    \ (e.g., leaf area index), transpiration and evapotranspiration, as well as CO2\n\
    uptake and aboveground biomass from optical sensors mounted on unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles and/or\nsatellites [9,17,39–42] (see also Box 1 in [32]).\nOf the four\
    \ VIs, NDVI is the most widely used [32]. Although NDVI has some saturation issues\n\
    over dense vegetation [43], it was shown to be very reliable in monitoring vegetation\
    \ dynamics,\nparticularly in natural [8] and agricultural [16] Mediterranean vegetation\
    \ systems. GNDVI, which\nis quite similar to NDVI, with the difference being that\
    \ it uses the green instead of the red band\n(Table 1), is considered to be more\
    \ sensitive to changes in chlorophyll-a concentrations compared to\nNDVI [44,45].\
    \ EVI and SAVI were both designed to overcome the saturation drawbacks in NDVI\n\
    and GNDVI [43,46]. With a canopy background adjustment factor, both indices are\
    \ considered to be\nefﬁcient in terms of reducing soil background effects, with\
    \ SAVI apparently being the most effective in\nthat sense [43].\nThe four VIs\
    \ were derived using the four spectral bands provided by Planet’s images following\n\
    the formulations given in Table 1.\nTable 1. Formulation and source of the four\
    \ vegetation indices used in this study.\nIndex\nFormulation 1\nReference\nGNDVI\n\

    ρ(λ NIR) − ρ(λ Red)\nρ(λNIR) + ρ(λRed) + L2\n[48]\n1 ρ is the surface reﬂectance\
    \ and λ# is the wavelength of a spectral band #. 2 The gain factor G = 2.5; coefﬁcients\n\
    C1 = 6.0 and C2 = 7.5; and the canopy background adjustment factor L1 = 1.0 are\
    \ the standard values used for EVI.\n3 A standard canopy background adjustment\
    \ factor L2 = 0.5 for SAVI.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n6 of 22\n2.5. Phenological\
    \ Stages\nWe deﬁned here three main phenological stages, which may be observed\
    \ through changes in the\nVI time series (Figure 2). The three stages are: start\
    \ of season (SOS), which corresponds to the time\nwhen the vines started their\
    \ growth around DOY 80–90 (budburst stage), approximately one month\nprior to\
    \ the start of the irrigation; peak of season (POS), when the canopy of the vines\
    \ reached their\nfull capacity (around DOY 120–140; full bloom stage); and end\
    \ of season (EOS), around DOY 240–250,\nthe harvest stage.\nExpansive understory\
    \ presence in the form of volunteer weeds and grasses occurs in Israeli\nvineyards\
    \ around DOY 50–85 prior to SOS (see in Mevo Beitar vineyard; Figure 2). This\
    \ understory\nvegetation was treated with herbicide in most of the Galilee vineyards\
    \ and mechanically removed at\nthe end of the spring in the Golan vineyards and\
    \ in most of the vineyards in the Judea region.\nFinally, pre-growth season (Pre)\
    \ was deﬁned here as the time when green vegetation (including\nunderstory weeds\
    \ and grasses) is absent or dry in the vineyard, at approximately DOY 30 (Figure\
    \ 2).\n2.6. Satellite Data\n2.6.1. Planet Satellites\nPlanet [34] is a commercial\
    \ company running a constellation of small, standardized CubeSat 3U\nform factor\
    \ (10 × 10 × 30 cm) nano-satellites of approximately 4 kg in mass. Planet currently\
    \ operates\nmore than 175 of the so-called ‘Doves’ PlanetScope (PS) nano-satellites,\
    \ providing unprecedented daily\nnadir-pointing high-resolution land surface imaging\
    \ of the entire earth. Planet’s PS satellites provide\nimages at a spatial resolution\
    \ of 3 m (nadir ground sampling distance) in four spectral bands (RGB and\nNIR),\
    \ with an equatorial overpass time of 9:30–11:30 a.m. (local time) [33], sometimes\
    \ even three times\na day (i.e., from different Doves). Planet Team currently\
    \ provides a series of application programming\ninterface (API) tools, such as\
    \ Clips API [49].\nIn this study, a total of 3015 clipped PlanetScope Ortho Tiles\
    \ were downloaded for 2017 using the\nClips API for the vineyard areas within\
    \ the three regions of interest (Figure 1a). Tiles were downloaded\nas TIFFs,\
    \ often including several ﬁles for a speciﬁc date with also missing images in\
    \ some dates due to\ncloudy conditions (<10% missing data). Figure A1 shows a\
    \ true RGB color Planet image of Mevo Beitar\nvineyard alongside the plots where\
    \ Ψstem were measured (see Section 2.3), for comparison of scales.\n2.6.2. Building\
    \ Time Series of Planet’s Vegetation Indices in Google Earth Engine\nWe used Google\
    \ Earth Engine (GEE; https://earthengine.google.com/), which is a freely available\n\
    cloud-based geospatial processing platform that combines a large catalog of satellite\
    \ imagery and\ngeospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities\
    \ [50]. All downloaded PS-clipped TIFFs,\nas well as the shapeﬁle vector layers\
    \ of the 82 vineyards (i.e., polygons), were uploaded as image- and\nfeature collections\
    \ to GEE. Then, GEE JavaScript API was used to: (1) calculate the four vegetation\n\
    indices (VIs) for all images; (2) merge the number of images to a single image\
    \ per date using a\nmaximum value criteria (i.e., creating an image mosaic by\
    \ selecting the maximum value for each pixel\nfrom all available images for that\
    \ day) [43]. In this way, noisy data caused by cloud contamination\nand/or sensor\
    \ view uncertainties were eliminated from the image; (3) generate time series\
    \ of the four\nVIs; (4) calculate the time series of the averaged VI over the\
    \ entire area of the vineyard (i.e., over all\npixels within the vineyard area),\
    \ for the 82 vineyards, and for the 60 plots within the vineyard area of\nMevo\
    \ Beitar (Figure 1b).\n2.6.3. Time Series Analysis\nTo further eliminate noisy\
    \ data in the time series, smoothing techniques are usually applied [32].\nHowever,\
    \ these techniques need the time series to be complete or at least have a predeﬁned\
    \ seasonal\nsignal [51]. Because we aim at predicting Ψstem from VIs without having\
    \ prior information on the\nseasonal behavior of the vineyard, conventional smoothing\
    \ techniques could not be used. Instead,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n7 of 22\n\
    we adopted a simple weekly average approach similar to a moving average on a complete\
    \ time\nseries to eliminate noisy data. We calculated the weekly average VI value\
    \ (VI avg) for each vineyard.\nIn addition, for the time series analysis the maximum\
    \ and minimum VI values in each week were\nextracted (VI max and VI min, respectively).\
    \ To further eliminate noise of background signal related to\nsoil and/or understory\
    \ vegetation, the VI avg was scaled by dividing it by the VI avg value at POS.\n\
    Another important variable used in the time series analysis is ∆VI, which is deﬁned\
    \ as the\ndifference between the VI avg at POS and that at Pre, when green vegetation\
    \ is absent in the vineyard.\nThis ∆VI represents the difference in fractional\
    \ vegetation cover between the two periods due to\nleaf expansion and canopy development\
    \ of the vines. This means that vineyards with vines of less\ndeveloped canopies\
    \ will display a small ∆VI compared to those with more developed canopies.\nBecause\
    \ Ψstem is from the vines and VI is a mixed signal from vines and background signal,\
    \ we would\nexpect a negative correlation between ∆VI and the slope of the VI–Ψstem\
    \ relationship, meaning a\nweak VI response (steeper slope) to seasonal variations\
    \ in Ψstem, in vineyards with small ∆VI (less\ndeveloped canopies).\n2.7. Statistical\
    \ Analysis\nThree models were tested in this study:\n1.\nA multivariable linear\
    \ model with ﬁve variables (VI avg, VI max, VI min, ∆VI and day of year)\nwas\
    \ used to predict weekly Ψstem (one model per week) in Mevo Beitar vineyard (hereafter,\n\
    MB-Mult model).\n2.\nA single linear regression model was used in Mevo Beitar\
    \ to predict Ψstem from VIs for the\nentire season using the VI time series (hereafter,\
    \ MB-Reg model).\n3.\nA single ‘global’ multivariable linear model with the same\
    \ variables as in MB-Mult was used\nto predict seasonal Ψstem from VI time series\
    \ of the 81 commercial vineyards (hereafter,\nGlobal-Mult).\nIn Global-Mult, variables\
    \ from all four VIs were ﬁrst used in a single multivariable model with a\ntotal\
    \ of 20 variables, ﬁve variables per VI. Then, to avoid multicollinearity issues\
    \ in the model only the\nstatistically signiﬁcant variables (p < 0.05) with the\
    \ highest size effect in the model were maintained,\none VI per variable (total\
    \ of ﬁve variables). The Global-Mult with the ﬁve variables was then used to\n\
    predict Ψstem in the experimental vineyard of Mevo Beitar, comparing it with MB-Mult\
    \ and MB-Reg.\nIt should be noted that in MB-Mult and Global-Mult, the values\
    \ of the variables change along the\nseason, while the value of ∆VI remains the\
    \ same.\nPearson’s r of the correlation, coefﬁcient of determination (R2), and\
    \ root square mean error (RMSE)\nwere used as measures of model performance and\
    \ to compare between the models. The size effect\nof each variable in Global-Mult,\
    \ which is the effectiveness of the variable in predicting Ψstem, is\npresented\
    \ as LogWorth, deﬁned as −log10(p-value). The larger the LogWorth, the stronger\
    \ is the effect\nof the variable in the model. All statistical analyses were carried\
    \ out using JMP® software version 14.0\n(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\
    3. Results\n3.1. Deriving Midday Stem Water Potential for Mevo Beitar Vineyard\n\
    Figure 2 shows daily time series of the four vegetation indices alongside the\
    \ Ψstem, while both VI\nand Ψstem were averaged over the entire vineyard area\
    \ at Mevo Beitar. In general, all four VIs showed\na decreasing trend similar\
    \ to that of the Ψstem consequential to soil water depletion and increasing\n\
    atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration. The inherent soil-background reduction\
    \ capacity of SAVI\nis well noted in Figure 2, displaying the lowest values in\
    \ comparison to the other three VIs (GNDVI,\nNDVI and EVI).\nRemote Sens. 2018,\
    \ 10, 1615\n8 of 22\nLow VIs values in DOYs 30–50 (Pre stage) are related mainly\
    \ to soil background and dry\nunderstory vegetation. Peak VI at POS is from the\
    \ fully developed canopies of the vines at this\ntime of the season, at the start\
    \ of the irrigation.\nMB-Reg was signiﬁcant for all four VIs (p < 0.01), with\
    \ r = 0.80–0.82 (Figure 3). High VI values\nwere generally associated with less\
    \ negative Ψstem at the time when DI started, while low VI values\nwere associated\
    \ with more negative Ψstem, reﬂecting the water stress condition of the vines\
    \ towards\nEOS (DOY 245).\nFigure 3. The correlation between the time series of\
    \ VI avg and the measured Ψstem in Mevo Beitar\nvineyard. Regressions presented\
    \ are for the four VIs: (a) GNDVI, (b) NDVI, (c) EVI and (d) SAVI.\nShaded band\
    \ indicates 99% conﬁdence intervals for the regression line.\nTable 2 summarizes\
    \ the statistics of MB-Mult for the four VIs. Here, again, SAVI showed a better\n\
    performance than the other three indices, likely due to its higher capacity in\
    \ reducing soil background\neffects. GNDVI, NDVI and EVI show quite similar r\
    \ scores, with NDVI showing a slightly better\nperformance than GNDVI and EVI\
    \ (Table 2). The highest r scores were mostly obtained from DOY 189\ntowards EOS\
    \ (DOY 245), although with a generally higher RMSE as well.\nWith the exception\
    \ of one week (DOY 168), models were generally statistically signiﬁcant along\
    \ the\nseason with an average r score > 0.64 (Table 2). It should be noted, though,\
    \ that the week corresponding\nto DOY 168 was particularly cloudy, which likely\
    \ affected Planet-derived VI and consequently the\nMB-Mult models in this particular\
    \ week.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n9 of 22\nTable 2. Statistics of the per-week\

    \ maps of Ψstem in Mevo Beitar vineyard from MB-Mult using SAVI\nfor selected\
    \ dates. The spatial pattern of Ψstem varies throughout the growing season (Figure\
    \ 4). Ψstem\nin DOY 154 was relatively high across the vineyard compared to other\
    \ dates because of the DI start in\nDOY 131 (Figure 2) and the relatively lower\
    \ atmospheric demand compared to the following weeks.\nFigure 5 shows the difference\
    \ (∆Ψ) between the Ψstem derived from MB-Reg and MB-Mult\n(both using SAVI). ∆Ψ\
    \ in Figure 5 was calculated as the absolute Ψstem value from MB-Reg minus\nthe\
    \ absolute Ψstem value from MB-Mult. Thus, blue colors indicate lower values of\
    \ Ψstem (more\nstressed) in MB-Reg than in MB-Mult, while red colors mean that\
    \ Ψstem was higher (less stressed) in\nMB-Reg than in MB-Mult. Most of the maps\
    \ in Figure 5 show a uniform distribution of ∆Ψ across the\nvineyard, which means\
    \ that MB-Reg was able to reproduce the spatial variability in Ψstem close to\
    \ that\npredicted by MB-Mult, though with some differences in magnitude. Yet,\
    \ at both ends of the growing\nseason, before and after the DI start (DOY 126\
    \ and 245), ∆Ψ across the vineyard shows a signiﬁcant\nspatial variability.\n\
    These results indicate that the measures from both models are consistent with\
    \ one another for\nmuch of the season. Thus, for irrigation management, either\
    \ approach could be used to monitor relative\ndifference (spatial variability)\
    \ within the ﬁeld at Mevo Beitar, to the extent that such information could\n\
    be used to improve the efﬁciency of ground operations.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\

    \ indicates a lower Ψstem value (more stressed) in MB-Reg compared\nto MB-Mult,\
    \ while red color indicates a higher Ψstem value (less stressed) in MB-Reg compared\
    \ to\nMB-Mult.\n3.2. Vegetation Indices and Stem Water Potential in Vineyards\
    \ across Rainfall Gradient\nThe Pearson’s r of the VI-Ψstem linear ﬁt using all\
    \ data from the 82 vineyards together was positive\nand signiﬁcant (p < 0.001),\
    \ with 0.58 < r < 0.68 for the four VIs (Figure 6). Once again, SAVI was\ndemonstrated\
    \ to be the most successful index in tracking seasonal changes in Ψstem in the\
    \ 82 vineyards\n(Figure 6d).\nThe per-vineyard Pearson’s r of the VI-Ψstem linear\
    \ ﬁts ranged between 0.72 and 0.97, with an\naverage r of 0.85 ± 0.06 (Figure\
    \ 7). Linear ﬁts, though, differed between vineyards in terms of intercept\nand\
    \ particularly in slope (Figures 6 and 7).\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n12 of\
    \ 22\nFigure 6. Linear relationships between Planet-derived VI avg: (a) GNDVI,\
    \ (b) NDVI, (c) EVI and\n(d) SAVI, and Ψstem in 82 vineyards (grey lines). The\

    \ four VIs. Error bars denote ±1σ. Mevo Beitar vineyard is indicated\nin red.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n13 of 22\nBackground effects of soil and/or understory\
    \ vegetation were likely responsible for the different\nslopes of the linear ﬁts\
    \ (Figures 6 and 7). Vineyards with a large background effect had more\npronounced\
    \ slopes, meaning weak VI response to seasonal changes in Ψstem. This background\n\
    effect may be noted as a negative correlation between ∆VI and the slope of the\
    \ VIs-Ψstem linear ﬁt in\nFigure 8.\nFigure 8. The relationship between the ∆VI\
    \ and the slope of the VI-Ψstem linear ﬁt in the 82 vineyards.\nNotice that a\
    \ larger slope signiﬁes weaker response of VI to increasing stress (i.e., to decreasing\
    \ Ψstem).\nFigure 8 shows that for vineyards with a small ∆VI (weak VI response\
    \ to Ψstem change), or, in\nother words, with grapevines of less developed canopies\
    \ and thus a larger background effect, the slope\nof the VIs-Ψstem linear ﬁt was\
    \ steeper than for vineyards with a large ∆VI. This suggests that ∆VI is\nan important\
    \ variable in predicting Ψstem and may assist in distinguishing between vineyards\
    \ with\ndifferent levels of background effect.\nThe performance of each of the\
    \ four VIs in a multivariable regression model (one model per\nVI) was quite similar\
    \ (r = 0.76, for the four VIs), with a slight improvement (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5%;\n\
    Figure 9) when using variables from different VIs in Global-Mult (Table 3). Global-Mult,\
    \ though,\nwas a signiﬁcant improvement over the simple linear regression model\
    \ used with the VI time series\n(0.58 < r < 0.68, Figure 6).\nRemote Sens. 2018,\

    \ Mevo\nBeitar vineyard during the season of 2017 and predicted Ψstem using MB-Reg,\

    \ (a) Observed and predicted Ψstem at Mevo Beitar vineyard for the 2017 growing\

    \ and blue shaded bands in (a) indicate\nmodel uncertainties in MB-Reg and Global-Mult,\
    \ respectively, while error bars in MB-Mult and\nobservations denote ±1σ.\nScatterplot\
    \ of observed vs.\npredicted Ψstem for (b) MB-Reg and (c)\nGlobal-Mult.\nGlobal-Mult\
    \ is shown to reproduce seasonal changes in observed Ψstem at Mevo Beitar with\n\
    a fairly high accuracy (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 0.12; bias = 0.07, Figure 10a,c), at\
    \ least as good as the\nsite-speciﬁc models of MB-Reg (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 0.11;\
    \ bias = −0.02, Figure 10a,b) and MB-Mult\n(Figure 10a). Thus, Global-Mult appears\
    \ to present a useful tool for seasonal (weekly) predictions of\nΨstem in Mediterranean\
    \ vineyards.\n4. Discussion\nManagement of spatial variability within a vineyard\
    \ can increase proﬁts signiﬁcantly by allowing\noptimization of yield quantity\
    \ and quality [52,53]. Technologies and methodologies are currently being\ndeveloped\
    \ to allow variable-rate irrigation in drip irrigated vineyards and orchards [54,55].\
    \ Since the\ncurrent state of the art for irrigation decision-making uses time-\
    \ and labor-consuming measurement of\nΨstem [2,35,36,56], remote sensing methodologies\
    \ successfully acting as stem water potential proxies\nhave particular appeal.\
    \ That said, there remains a challenge in ﬁnding remotely acquired data that:\
    \ (a)\nhas sufﬁciently reliable correlation with Ψstem, (b) is affordable and\
    \ accessible, and (c) has both high\nspatial and temporal resolution, each of\
    \ which are necessary in order for the method to be useful for\nhigh frequency\
    \ irrigation scheduling.\nThis study showed a signiﬁcant correlation between vegetation\
    \ indices derived from\nhigh-resolution Planet images (3-m) and Ψstem in Mediterranean\
    \ (Israel) vineyards. Previous studies\nhave shown that CWSI and NIR-based indices,\
    \ like GNDVI and NDVI, may be good indicators of\nwater status in grapevines through\
    \ correlations with leaf stomatal conductance (gs) and water potential\n(ΨLeaf\
    \ and Ψstem). However, these relationships were mostly observed at the canopy-\
    \ [22,28,29] or\nleaf [30,31] levels using manual spectroradiometers or sensors\
    \ mounted on small airplanes and drones.\nAs far as the authors are aware, this\
    \ is the ﬁrst study that shows such a relationship using images of\ncoarser spatial\
    \ resolution acquired from satellites, and more speciﬁcally from Planet nano-satellites.\n\
    One of the main challenges when using satellite information is the spatial resolution\
    \ of the\nimages, which is often coarser than the targeted object and may induce\
    \ a mixed-pixel signal effect. For\nexample, understory vegetation was shown to\
    \ affect satellite spectral signals in complex vegetation\nsystems comprised of\
    \ multi-canopy layers [32]. The multi-canopy layer, vertical mixed-pixel effect\
    \ was\nfurther corroborated in a simulation model by Chen et al. [57], implying\
    \ that understory vegetation\nmay signiﬁcantly affect satellite signals. In our\
    \ case, understory expansion reaches its maximum at\n~DOY 60, while vines budburst\
    \ occurs later at DOY 80–90. Background effect in the vineyards, which\nmay include\
    \ the signal from soil and/or understory vegetation, was observed through a different\n\
    VI-Ψstem linear ﬁt in terms of magnitude of slope (slope ranged between 0.5 and\
    \ 2), meaning that some\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n16 of 22\nvineyards experienced\
    \ weak VI response to seasonal changes in Ψstem, while others experienced a\n\
    stronger response to Ψstem changes. This differential response is due to the fact\
    \ that in vineyards with\ngrapevines of more developed canopies, and consequently\
    \ less exposed understory cover seen from\nthe satellite, the VI signal is mostly\
    \ coming from the vines while in vineyards with less developed\nvines much of\
    \ the VI signal comes from the ground.\nTo overcome this mixed-pixel effect, we\
    \ used the difference between the VI signal at the POS,\nwhich corresponded mainly\
    \ to the grapevines, and that of the understory derived at the Pre (∆VI).\nThat\
    \ way, background effects were eliminated allowing vineyards with diverse soil\
    \ and understory\nvegetation characteristics to be compared and used in a single\
    \ ‘global’ model. Results from the\nGlobal-Mult model showed that ∆NDVI had a\
    \ signiﬁcant size effect, being a key factor in predicting\nΨstem, with only day\
    \ of year having a stronger size effect and SAVI avg a similar effect (Table 3).\n\
    In Mevo Beitar, a highly variable vineyard, weekly based correlations (Pearson’s\
    \ r) of GNDVI,\nNDVI, EVI and SAVI vs. Ψstem were within the range of 0.28–0.84,\
    \ with an average value of 0.65 for all\nindices (Table 2). These results were\
    \ quite similar to previously reported VI-Ψstem correlations found\nby others\
    \ using very-high-resolution images [22,29]. When time series were used in the\
    \ regression\ninstead of date-speciﬁc data, correlations were even higher (0.80\
    \ < r < 0.82). A simple linear regression\nmodel (MB-Reg) was sufﬁcient to reproduce\
    \ temporal, as well as spatial variations in Ψstem in the\nexperimental vineyard.\n\
    In general, correlations from simple speciﬁc-date regressions between vegetation\
    \ indices and Ψstem\nwere also high for the 81 commercial vineyards (r = 0.72–0.97;\
    \ Figure 7), implying that Planet-derived\ntime series of vegetation indices like,\
    \ GNDVI, NDVI, EVI and SAVI may be good indicators of water\nstatus at the vineyard-scale\
    \ level.\nFinally, the Global-Mult model with spectral-based indices derived from\
    \ Planet satellites was\nproposed to predict Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards.\
    \ After deriving ∆NDVI, SAVI avg, NDVI max\nand NDVI min of a speciﬁc vineyard\
    \ a real-time Ψstem estimation may be provided for that vineyard at\na weekly\
    \ basis. The Global-Mult shows promise in improving the efﬁciency of in-ﬁeld conventional\n\
    monitoring efforts.\n5. Conclusions\nThe relationship between stem water potential\
    \ and vegetation indices was evaluated in\nMediterranean vineyards through the\
    \ use of high spatial resolution Planet nano-satellite imaging\non the freely\
    \ available GEE cloud computing system for the ﬁrst time. Using JavaScript API\
    \ in GEE\nallowed fast computation of the derivation of time series of vegetation\
    \ indices for the area of the 82\nvineyards, showing potentials for real-time\
    \ monitoring in small-size agricultural ﬁelds.\nThe four vegetation indices tested\
    \ in this study (GNDVI, NDVI, EVI and SAVI) showed signiﬁcant\ncorrelation with\
    \ stem water potential, with SAVI displaying a slightly better performance, likely\
    \ due\nto its capacity for reducing soil effects. Correlations using of the four\
    \ vegetation indices were high for\nmeasurements across the vineyard area (0.89\
    \ < r < 0.82 for MB-Reg and 0.64 < r < 0.67 for MB-Mult)\nand along the season\
    \ (r = 0.92 for both MB-Reg and Global-Mult), allowing predictions of stem water\n\
    potential variability in space and time.\nA method to reduce the background effect\
    \ of understory vegetation and soil, which accounts for\nthe fractional cover\
    \ of the vines, was also presented. The fractional cover of the vines was retrieved\
    \ as\nthe difference in the value of the vegetation index at the peak of season\
    \ and prior to the appearance\nof green vegetation in the vineyard (∆VI). This\
    \ ∆VI, was negatively correlated with the slope of the\nvegetation index to stem\
    \ water potential relationship, meaning that vineyards with a low fractional\n\
    cover have weak VI response to changes in measured stem water potential. Using\
    \ the ∆VI allowed the\ndevelopment of a ‘global’ multivariable model for predicting\
    \ stem water potential in vineyards with\ndifferent background (soil and understory\
    \ presence) characteristics.\nOverall, the approach presented here shows promise\
    \ in exploiting these technologies, which\ninclude resolving the mixed-pixel problem\
    \ in agricultural as well as in the ecological monitoring of\nRemote Sens. 2018,\
    \ 10, 1615\n17 of 22\nnatural vegetation systems from satellites. The tools developed\
    \ here, i.e., the combination of Planet\nimages and GEE platform, with the aforementioned\
    \ mixed-pixel separation approach, may be also\nused for water status monitoring\
    \ of agricultural ﬁelds other than vineyards.\nFinally, pending further veriﬁcation\
    \ and validation, the proposed ‘global’ model presented here\nmay be used for\
    \ real-time irrigation management along the season from the abovementioned weekly\n\
    values extracted using daily Planet images. Using the ‘global’ model could substantially\
    \ improve\nsampling efﬁciency of conventional water status monitoring. The methodology\
    \ developed in this\nstudy should be further examined with supporting information\
    \ on soil texture, LAI/fractional cover\nand understory vegetation. Moreover,\
    \ a comparison with freely available satellite images like those\nfrom Sentinel-2,\
    \ which have coarser spatial (10–20 m) and temporal (5 day) resolution than Planet,\n\
    should be conducted.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.H. and Y.C.;\

    \ advanced remote sensing systems, more accurate retrievals of crop water\nstatus\
    \ are being made at the individual crop level to aid in precision irrigation.\
    \ This paper summarises\nthe use of remote sensing for the estimation of water\
    \ status in horticultural crops. The remote\nmeasurements of the water potential,\
    \ soil moisture, evapotranspiration, canopy 3D structure, and\nvigour for water\
    \ status estimation are presented in this comprehensive review. These parameters\n\
    directly or indirectly provide estimates of crop water status, which is critically\
    \ important for irrigation\nmanagement in farms. The review is organised into\
    \ four main sections: (i) remote sensing platforms;\n(ii) the remote sensor suite;\
    \ (iii) techniques adopted for horticultural applications and indicators of\n\
    water status; and, (iv) case studies of the use of remote sensing in horticultural\
    \ crops. Finally, the\nauthors’ view is presented with regard to future prospects\
    \ and research gaps in the estimation of the\ncrop water status for precision\
    \ irrigation.\nKeywords: UAS; UAV; drone; unmanned; satellite; water stress; irrigation;\
    \ vegetation index\n1. Introduction\nUnderstanding the water status of crops is\
    \ important for optimal management and application\nof water to accommodate for\
    \ inter and intra-ﬁeld variability to achieve a speciﬁc target, such as\nmaximum\
    \ water use eﬃciency, yield, quality, or proﬁtability [1,2]. The importance of\
    \ optimal water\nmanagement in agriculture in semi-arid or arid regions has become\
    \ increasingly important in light\nof recent water scarcities through reduced\
    \ allocations, as well as increased demand due to greater\nareas under production\
    \ [3,4]. Climate change is expected to further intensify the situation due to\n\
    the increased frequency of heatwaves and drought episodes [5]. Climate change\
    \ coupled with the\nnecessity to increase food production due to an increase in\
    \ global population has placed pressure on\nhorticultural sector to improve eﬃciencies\
    \ in resources use, e.g., water, for sustainable farming [6–10].\nHorticultural\
    \ crops will have to produce more ‘crop-per-drop’ in the face of limited water\
    \ resources.\nInformed management of water resources whilst maintaining or increasing\
    \ crop quality and yield are\nthe primary goals of irrigation scheduling in horticulture.\
    \ These goals can be achieved by improving\nour understanding of the water status\
    \ of the crops at key phenological stages of development.\nTraditional decision-making\
    \ for irrigation of horticultural crops includes using information from\na combination\
    \ of sources such as historical regimes, soil moisture measurements, visual assessments\
    \ of\nsoil and/or crop, weather data including evapotranspiration (ET), and measurements\
    \ of crop water\nstatus using direct-, proximal- or remote-sensing techniques\
    \ [11–13]. Some growers undertake routine\nground-based measurements, e.g., pressure\
    \ chamber, for estimation of crop water status to make\ndecisions on irrigation\
    \ [14–16]. These ground-based measurements are robust; however, destructive,\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/agronomy10010140\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 35\ncumbersome, and expensive to acquire a reasonable\
    \ amount of data [14,16–18]. Consequently, the\nmeasured leaf is assumed to represent\
    \ the average population of leaves of the individual crop, and\na few crops are\
    \ assumed to represent the average population of the entire irrigation block.\
    \ As a\nresult, over- or under-watering can occur, which can lower yield and fruit\
    \ quality [19–22]. This is\nespecially evident for non-homogenous blocks where\
    \ spatial variability of soil and water status is\nexpected [23–25].\nTo address\
    \ some of the limitations of ground-based measurements, remote measurement\ntechniques\
    \ were introduced with capabilities to measure at higher spatial resolution, larger\
    \ area, and\non a regular basis [26–29]. Remote sensing, in particular, unmanned\
    \ aircraft systems (UAS), presents a\nﬂexible platform to deploy on-demand sensors\
    \ as a tool to eﬃciently and non-destructively measure\ncrop water status [30].\
    \ Using thermal and spectral signatures, remote sensing techniques can be used\n\
    to characterise a crop’s water status. Knowledge of crop water status allows growers\
    \ to more eﬃciently\nschedule irrigation (i.e., when and how much water to apply).\
    \ In this regard, UAS platforms provide a\nconvenient methodology to monitor the\
    \ water status across a farm, both spatially and temporally at\nthe canopy level\
    \ [31–33]. The spectral, spatial, and temporal ﬂexibility oﬀered by UAS-based\
    \ remote\nsensing may in future assist growers in irrigation decision-making [34,35].\n\
    This review provides an overview of the application of remote sensing to understand\
    \ the\ncrop’s water status (e.g., leaf/stem water potential, leaf/canopy conductance),\
    \ soil moisture, ET, and\nphysiological attributes, all of which can contribute\
    \ to understanding the crop’s water status to\nimplement precision irrigation.\
    \ Although the key focus of this review is UAS-based remote sensing,\na comparison\
    \ has been undertaken with other remote sensing platforms, such as earth observation\n\
    satellites, which are being increasingly used to acquire similar information.\
    \ In the following sections,\nwe provide an overview of the most common remote\
    \ sensing platforms in horticulture, various sensors\nused for remote sensing,\
    \ and several predictive indices of crop water status. Two case studies of remote\n\
    sensing in horticultural crops, grapevine and almond, are then presented followed\
    \ by an overview of\nthe current research gaps and future prospects.\n2. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms\nGround-based direct or proximal sensors acquire instantaneous\
    \ water status measurement from\na spatial location. For decision-making purposes,\
    \ the data is generally collected from multiple\nlocations across a ﬁeld, which\
    \ allows geospatial interpolation, such as kriging, to be applied [36–38].\nThis\
    \ scale of data collection is, however, cumbersome, ineﬃcient, and error-prone,\
    \ especially for water\nstatus measurements of large areas [17]. Monitoring and\
    \ observing farms at a larger spatial scale\nprompted the launch of several earth\
    \ observation satellite systems that typically operate at an altitude\nof 180–2000\
    \ km [39]. Manned high-altitude aircraft (operating within few km) and, more recently,\
    \ UAS\n(operating under 120 m) ﬁlled the spatial gap between high-resolution ground\
    \ measurements and\nrelatively low-resolution satellite measurements [40,41].\
    \ In the context of water status estimation for\nhorticultural crops, all the\
    \ aforementioned remote sensing platforms are utilised depending on the\nuser\
    \ requirements [23,42,43]. Each remote sensing platform has its own advantage\
    \ and shortcomings.\nThe decision to obtain remote sensing crop water status data\
    \ from one or more of these platforms will\ndepend on the spatial and temporal\
    \ resolution desired. Satellite and manned aircraft can be useful\nfor regional-scale\
    \ characterisation, whereas UAS can be more useful to map the intra-ﬁeld variability.\n\
    Vehicle-based ground systems also possess similar measurement capabilities, like\
    \ remote sensing,\nhowever, at a smaller scale [44,45]. These systems can move\
    \ within the horticultural rows obtaining\nwater status measurements of adjacent\
    \ plants while the vehicle is moving, enabling them to cover a\nrelatively larger\
    \ area as compared to ground-based direct measurements [46–48].\n2.1. Satellite\
    \ Systems\nThe use of satellite systems for remote sensing started with the launch\
    \ of Landsat-1 in 1972 [39,49].\nThe subsequent launch of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos\
    \ in 1999 opened the era of commercial satellite\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n3 of\
    \ 35\nsystems that resulted in rapid improvement in imaging performance, including\
    \ spatial and spectral\nresolution [50]. Continued launch of satellites from the\
    \ same families, with newer sensor models\nand improved capability, resulted in\
    \ the formation of satellite constellations (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel,\nSPOT, RapidEye,\
    \ GeoEye/WorldView families). The satellite constellation substantially improved\
    \ the\nrevisit cycle of the satellite system [51]. Recently, the miniature form\
    \ of the satellite termed Nanosat or\nCubesat has been developed, which can be\
    \ deployed on the same orbit in a large number (20s–100s),\nenabling frequent\
    \ and high-resolution data acquisition (e.g., Dove satellite from Planet Labs)\
    \ [52].\nThe earth observation satellite system, such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS,\
    \ RapidEye, and GeoEye,\nhave been used to study horticultural crops (Table 1).\
    \ These satellite system oﬀer camera systems\nwith spectral bands readily available\
    \ in visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and\nthermal infrared\
    \ (TIR). The measurement in these bands provides opportunities to study a crop’s\
    \ water\nstatus indirectly via, for example, calculation of the normalised diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI),\ncrop water stress index (CWSI), and ET [8–10] at the\
    \ ﬁeld- and regional-scales.\nTable 1. Some satellite systems that have been used\
    \ to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nSatellites\nBand Numbers:\

    \ of bands; V = visible, NIR = near infrared, SWIR = short-wave\ninfrared, TIR\
    \ = thermal infrared, Pan = panchromatic, C = coastal, Ci = cirrus, RE = red edge,\
    \ WV = water vapour.\nThe reﬂected/emitted electromagnetic energy from the crop\
    \ reaching the sensor is recorded at a\nspeciﬁc wavelength. The width of the observed\
    \ wavelength expressed in full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) is called spectral\
    \ resolution. The number of observed bands and the spectral resolution\nindicates\
    \ the ability of the satellite to resolve spectral features on the earth’s surface.\
    \ Commonly used\nearth observation satellite systems possess between four and\
    \ 15 bands with approximately 20–200 nm\nFWHM spectral resolution. The bands are\
    \ generally designated for the visible and NIR region with\nextended capabilities\
    \ in SWIR, TIR, as well as red edge region (Table 1). The most widely used band\n\
    combinations to study the water status of vegetation are the visible, NIR and\
    \ TIR bands [23,25,53,54].\nWith the plethora of satellite systems currently available,\
    \ user requirements on band combination\nmay be achieved by using multiple satellites.\
    \ However, acquiring an extra or a narrower band to the\nexisting capabilities\
    \ is not possible.\nThe ground distance covered per pixel of the satellite image\
    \ is called the spatial resolution,\nwhereby, a higher spatial resolution indicates\
    \ a smaller ground distance. Existing satellite systems,\ndue to their lower spatial\
    \ resolution and large coverage, are suited to study larger regions [55]. For\
    \ a\nsmaller observation area, such as a farm block, an irrigation zone, a single\
    \ row of the horticultural crop,\nor a single canopy, this spatial resolution\
    \ is considered sub-optimal. Often, a pixel of the satellite image\ncomprises\
    \ of multiple rows and multiple canopies of horticultural crops [42,56]. Thus,\
    \ the spectral\nresponse on a single pixel of the satellite image includes a mixed\
    \ spectral signal from the canopy,\ninter-row vegetation and/or bare soil. The\
    \ mixed-pixel is particularly unavoidable in horticultural\ncrops with large inter-row\
    \ surfaces, introducing errors in satellite-based estimations [42,56]. Improving\n\
    the spatial resolution from freely available Landsat/Sentinel satellites (spatial\
    \ resolution 10–15 m) to\nsuch as WorldView-3 (spatial resolution 0.3 m), does\
    \ not necessarily resolve single canopies of many\nhorticultural crops.\nCurrent\
    \ satellite systems generally oﬀer a temporal resolution of about 1–2 weeks this\
    \ resolution\ncorresponds to the satellite’s revisit interval (Table 1). For example,\
    \ freely available Landsat-8 and\nSentinel-2 oﬀer revisit cycles of 16 and 5 days,\
    \ respectively. Although the MODIS sensor on NASA’s\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n\
    4 of 35\nTerra and Aqua satellites oﬀer a greater temporal resolution (1–2 days),\
    \ its spatial resolution is relatively\ncoarse (250 m–1 km) to be valuable for\
    \ horticulture [25]. The revisit cycle of satellites does not alone\nrepresent\
    \ the timeframe on which the data can be interpreted. For instance, post-data\
    \ acquisition,\nthere are often delays in data transfer to the ground station,\
    \ handling, and delivery to the end user.\nThe end user then needs to process\
    \ the data before making an interpretation. Such processing can\nbe a combination\
    \ of atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections, where applicable [57,58].\n\
    Furthermore, as the agricultural applications of the satellite imagery are illumination\
    \ sensitive and\nweather dependent, conditions have to be optimal on the satellite\
    \ revisit day to avoid data corruption\ndue to, for example, cloud cover [23,53].\
    \ Cloud corrupted data (~55% of the land area is covered by\ncloud at any one\
    \ time [59]) will require users to wait for the next revisit to attempt the data\
    \ acquisition.\nTime-series image fusion techniques, such as the spatial and temporal\
    \ adaptive reﬂectance fusion\nmodel, can improve the spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ of the satellite data [60,61]. These fusion\ntechniques blend the frequent (however\
    \ low-resolution) with higher-resolution (but infrequent) satellite\ndata [62,63].\
    \ The result combines the best aspects of multiple satellite systems to produce\
    \ frequent and\nhigher-resolution data, which can be useful for timely monitoring\
    \ of water status.\nThe clear advantage of the satellite system is the ability\
    \ to capture data at a large scale and at an\naﬀordable cost (e.g., the user can\
    \ download Landsat and Sentinel data for free). The compromise with\nthe satellite\
    \ data is in spatial resolution, as well as the relatively long revisit cycle\
    \ (in the order of days\nto weeks), making the data less than ideal for speciﬁc\
    \ applications, e.g., irrigation scheduling.\n2.2. Manned Aircraft System\nOperating\
    \ within few kilometres above ground level, manned aircraft have been used to\
    \ remotely\nacquire agricultural data at higher spatial detail (compared to the\
    \ satellites) and over a larger region\n(compared to UAS) [42,64]. Light ﬁxed-wing\
    \ aircraft and helicopters are the commonly used manned\naircraft employed in\
    \ agricultural remote sensing. The ﬁxed-wing aircraft generally ﬂies higher and\n\
    faster, enabling the coverage of a larger area, whereas the helicopters are traditionally\
    \ ﬂown lower\nand slower, enabling a spatially detailed observation. A signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of the manned aircraft,\ncompared to UAS, lies in their ability to\
    \ carry heavier high-grade sensors, such as AVIRIS, HyPlant,\nHySpex SWIR-384,\
    \ Specim AisaFENIX, and Riegl LMS Q240i-60 [65–67]. The use of manned aircraft\
    \ is,\nhowever, limited by high operational complexity, safety regulations, scheduling\
    \ inﬂexibility, costs, and\nproduct turnaround time. As a result, these platforms\
    \ are barely used as compared to the recent surge\nin the use of UAS, speciﬁcally\
    \ for horticultural crops [68–70].\nIn horticulture, manned aircraft was used\
    \ to characterise olive and peach canopy temperature\nand water stress using speciﬁc\
    \ thermal bands (10.069 µm and 12.347 µm) of a wideband (0.43–12.5 µm)\nairborne\
    \ hyperspectral camera system [71,72]. This work found moderate correlations (R2\
    \ = 0.45–0.57)\nof ground vs. aerial olive canopy temperature measurements [72],\
    \ and high correlations (R2 = 0.94)\nof canopy temperature vs. peach fruit size\
    \ (diameter) [71]. The advantage of manned aircraft for\nremote sensing of a large\
    \ region was highlighted in recent work that characterised regional-scale\ngrapevine\
    \ (Vitis vinifera L.) water stress responses of two cultivars, Shiraz and Cabernet\
    \ Sauvignon, in\nAustralia [64]. Airborne thermal imaging was able to discriminate\
    \ between the two cultivars based on\ntheir water status responses to soil moisture\
    \ availability (Figure 1).\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n5 of 35\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140 \n5 of 35 \n \n \nFigure 1. Water status of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon\
    \ under similar soil moisture as captured from \nmanned aircraft [64]. \n2.3.\
    \ Unmanned Aircraft Systems \nBoth the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant\
    \ of UASs are used in agricultural remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages\
    \ and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this\
    \ regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their categorisation\
    \ \n[74], and overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters\
    \ [75], in the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors,\
    \ a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter,\
    \ among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree\
    \ of freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\
    \ developed fixed-\nwing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities,\
    \ such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse \nVTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures\
    \ the pros of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing, making \nthem a promising platform\
    \ for agricultural purposes. In the context of precision agriculture, the \napplication\
    \ of UAS, their future prospects, and knowledge gaps are discussed in [53,78–81].\
    \ While \nmany horticultural crops have been studied using UAS technology, the\
    \ most studied horticultural \ncrops are vineyards [31,82–84], citrus [85,86],\
    \ peach [32,33], olive [18,87,88], pistachio [89,90], and \nalmond [91–94], among\

    \ variant of UASs are used in agricultural remote sensing.\nEach variant has its\
    \ advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, ﬂexibility, and coverage.\n\
    In this regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their\
    \ categorisation [74], and\noverview of structural characteristics, as well as\
    \ ﬂight parameters [75], in the context of agricultural use.\nDepending on the\
    \ number of rotors, a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a quadcopter, a hexacopter,\n\
    or an octocopter, among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can ﬂy with\
    \ a higher degree of\nfreedom [76], while ﬁxed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward\
    \ at a certain speed to maintain thrust.\nAs a result, rotary-wing UAS provides\
    \ ﬂexibility and speciﬁc capabilities, such as hovering, vertical\ntake-oﬀ and\
    \ landing, vertical (up and down) motions, or return to the previous location.\
    \ On the contrary,\nﬁxed-wing UAS ﬂy faster, carry heavier payloads, and have\
    \ greater ﬂying time enabling coverage of\nlarger areas in a single ﬂight [77].\
    \ Recently developed ﬁxed-wing UAS with vertical take-oﬀ and landing\ncapabilities,\
    \ such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse VTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures\n\
    the pros of both ﬁxed-wing and rotary-wing, making them a promising platform for\
    \ agricultural\npurposes. In the context of precision agriculture, the application\
    \ of UAS, their future prospects,\nand knowledge gaps are discussed in [53,78–81].\
    \ While many horticultural crops have been studied\nusing UAS technology, the\

    Both the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant of UASs are used in agricultural\
    \ remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis\
    \ sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this regard, the literature\

    \ overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters [75], in\
    \ the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors, a rotary-wing\
    \ UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter, among\
    \ others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree of\
    \ freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\
    \ developed fixed-\nwing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities,\
    \ such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse \nVTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures\
    \ the pros of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing, making \nthem a promising platform\

    \ spectral bands, and temporal \nresolution to collect data on any good weather\
    \ day. However, like satellite and manned aircraft, the \nUAS is inoperable during\
    \ precipitation, high winds, and temperatures. By easily altering the flying \n\
    altitude, the UAS provides higher flexibility to observe a larger area with lower\
    \ spatial resolution or \nsmaller area with much greater detail [103]. Temporally,\
    \ the UAS can be scheduled at a user-defined \ntime at short notice, thus accommodating\
    \ applications that are time-sensitive, such as capturing vital \nphenological\

    \ sensors and \ninterchangeability between sensor payloads; thus, any desired\
    \ combination of sensors and spectral \nbands can be incorporated to target specific\
    \ features. \nUAS-acquired image data requires post-processing before it can be\
    \ incorporated into the grower \ndecision-making process. Mosaicking of UAS images\
    \ currently has a turnaround time of \napproximately one day to one week, subject\
    \ to the size of the dataset, computational power, and \nspectral/spatial quality\
    \ of the product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance,\
    \ \nwhereas the spatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established\
    \ horticultural crops. \nHigher spectral quality demands calibration of the spectral\
    \ sensors and correction of atmospheric \neffects. Following post-processing of\
    \ aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be \nhighly correlated\
    \ with ground-based data [82,102,106]. \nThe most common UAS-based sensor types\
    \ to study the crop water status are the thermal, \nmultispectral and RGB, while\
    \ hyperspectral and LiDAR (Light detection and ranging) sensors are \nused less\
    \ often [23,79,107]. Spectral sensors provide the capability to capture broader\
    \ physiological \nproperties of the crop, such as greenness (related to leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content and health) and biomass, \nthat generally correlate with crop water\
    \ status [82,108]. Narrower band spectral sensors provide \ndirect insight into\
    \ specific biophysical and biochemical properties of crops, such as via photochemical\
    \ \nreflectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF),\
    \ which reflects a plant’s \nphotosynthetic efficiency [109,110]. Thermal-based\
    \ sensors capture the temperature of the crop’s \nsurface, which indicates the\

    \ has a turnaround time of approximately\none day to one week, subject to the\
    \ size of the dataset, computational power, and spectral/spatial\nquality of the\
    \ product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance, whereas\
    \ the\nspatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established\
    \ horticultural crops. Higher\nspectral quality demands calibration of the spectral\
    \ sensors and correction of atmospheric eﬀects.\nFollowing post-processing of\

    \ pointclouds\nwith suﬃcient accuracy for canopy level assessment [111–118].\n\
    3. Remote Sensor Types\n3.1. Digital Camera\nA digital camera typically incorporates\
    \ an RGB, modiﬁed RGB, and a monochrome digital camera.\nThe lens quality of the\
    \ camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution of the\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 35\ncamera determines its spatial resolution and\
    \ details within an image. The RGB camera uses broad\nspectral bandwidth within\
    \ the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received at the\n\
    visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve\
    \ dimensional properties\nof the crop, terrain conﬁguration, macrostructure of\
    \ the ﬁeld, and the spatial information. Based on\nthe dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the resource need\n\
    practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more quickly use available\nwater resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if irrigation is not suﬃcient.\nThe evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be useful to understand the\
    \ spatial\nvariability within the ﬁeld and corresponding water requirements. The\
    \ macro-structure of horticultural\ncrops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the fraction of ground cover, and missing\nplants, can be identiﬁed\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\n\
    conﬁguration in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM) generated from a digital\
    \ camera can also\nenable understanding of the water status in relation to the\
    \ aspect and slope conﬁguration of the terrain.\n3.2. Multispectral Camera\nA\
    \ multispectral camera oﬀers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum.\nMost common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include\
    \ rededge and NIR\nbands in addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure\
    \ 3a,c). Conﬁgurable ﬁlter placement of\nthe spectral band is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported\
    \ to perform\nwith consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric\
    \ calibration and atmospheric\ncorrection [123–125].\nTheir spatial resolution\
    \ has been found to be suﬃcient for horticultural\napplications enabling canopy\
    \ level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as\nrelatively\
    \ low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n7 of 35 \n \nof the camera determines its spatial resolution\
    \ and details within an image. The RGB camera uses \nbroad spectral bandwidth\
    \ within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received \n\
    at the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to\
    \ retrieve dimensional \nproperties of the crop, terrain configuration, macrostructure\
    \ of the field, and the spatial information. \nBased on the dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the \nresource need\
    \ practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more \nquickly use available water resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if \nirrigation is not sufficient. The evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be \nuseful to understand\
    \ the spatial variability within the field and corresponding water requirements.\
    \ \nThe macro-structure of horticultural crops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the \nfraction of ground cover, and missing plants, can be identified\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the \nallocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\
    \ configuration in the form of a digital elevation model \n(DEM) generated from\
    \ a digital camera can also enable understanding of the water status in relation\
    \ \nto the aspect and slope configuration of the terrain. \n3.2. Multispectral\
    \ Camera \nA multispectral camera offers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. Most \ncommon airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which\
    \ include rededge and NIR bands in \naddition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g.,\
    \ Figure 3a,c). Configurable filter placement of the spectral \nband is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of horticultural\

    \ by vegetation spectral index called NDVI (Table 2, Equation (3)). Once the vegetation\n\
    starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reﬂectance in the NIR region\
    \ is reduced, while the\nreﬂectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress\
    \ is reﬂected in the vegetation proﬁle and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 35\n\
    easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations\
    \ with a wide\narray of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content,\
    \ leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress,\nand occasionally yield [34,82–84,127].\n\
    The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the\
    \ red and NIR\nbands where reﬂectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested\
    \ that the sharp transition between\nthe red absorbance and NIR reﬂection is able\
    \ to provide additional information about vegetation and\nits hydric characteristics\
    \ [128]. Using the normalised diﬀerence red edge (NDRE) index, the rededge\nband\
    \ was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration\
    \ map [127]. Given the\nsensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications,\
    \ such as crops drought stress [107]. With regard to\nthe water use eﬃciency,\
    \ a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with structural physiological\n\
    indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops [34,82,129].\n\
    3.3. Hyperspectral\nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled\
    \ at a narrower wavelength intervals\nspanning from visible to NIR spectrum at\
    \ a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 3d). Scanning\nat contiguous\
    \ narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three dimensional\
    \ (two\nspatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral\
    \ data cube. The hyperspectral\ndata cube is a hyperspectral image where each\
    \ pixel contain spatial information, as well as the entire\nspectral reﬂectance\
    \ curve [130]. Based on the operating principle and output data cube, hyperspectral\n\
    sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka spectroradiometer),\
    \ whiskbroom\nscanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131].\
    \ A point spectrometer, samples\nwithin its ﬁeld of view solid angle to produce\
    \ an ultra-high spectral resolution spectral data of a\npoint [130,132]. A whiskbroom\
    \ scanner deploys a single detector onboard to scan one single pixel at a\ntime.\
    \ As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of the data\
    \ cube, and as the\nplatform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a\
    \ hyperspectral image [133]. A pushbroom\nscanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous\
    \ detectors arranged in the perpendicular direction of\ntravel and scans the entire\
    \ row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves forward, the successive\nrows\
    \ form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager using diﬀerent\
    \ scanning\ntechniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ [135,136]. The point spectrometer\noﬀers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ [137,138].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n8 of 35 \n \nstarts to experience stress\
    \ (biotic and abiotic), its reflectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the\
    \ \nreflectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reflected in\
    \ the vegetation profile and \neasily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this\
    \ reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide \narray of crops response including\
    \ vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress, \nand\
    \ occasionally yield [34,82–84,127]. \nThe rededge band covers the portion of\
    \ the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR \nbands where reflectance\
    \ increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition \nbetween\
    \ the red absorbance and NIR reflection is able to provide additional information\
    \ about \nvegetation and its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised\
    \ difference red edge (NDRE) \nindex, the rededge band was found to be useful\
    \ in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration \nmap [127]. Given the\
    \ sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought\
    \ stress \n[107]. With regard to the water use efficiency, a combination of vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) along with \nstructural physiological indices were found to be\
    \ useful to study water stress in horticultural crops \n[34,82,129]. \n3.3. Hyperspectral\
    \ \nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower\
    \ wavelength \nintervals spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high\
    \ spectral resolution (Figure \n3d). Scanning at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths,\
    \ a hyperspectral sensor produces a three \ndimensional (two spatial dimensions\
    \ and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data \ncube. The hyperspectral\
    \ data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial \ninformation,\
    \ as well as the entire spectral reflectance curve [130]. Based on the operating\
    \ principle \nand output data cube, hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing can\
    \ include a point spectrometer (aka \nspectroradiometer), whiskbroom scanner,\
    \ pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A \npoint spectrometer,\
    \ samples within its field of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral\
    \ \nresolution spectral data of a point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys\
    \ a single detector onboard \nto scan one single pixel at a time. As the scanner\
    \ rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of \nthe data cube, and as\
    \ the platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral\
    \ \nimage [133]. A pushbroom scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors\
    \ arranged in the \nperpendicular direction of travel and scans the entire row\
    \ of pixels at a time. As the platform moves \nforward, the successive rows form\
    \ a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager \nusing different\
    \ scanning techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ \n[135,136]. The point spectrometer offers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible hyperspectral\
    \ sensors [137,138]. \n \nFigure 4. The data cube structure of different spectral\

    \ [110]. PRI was identiﬁed as one of the best predictors of water stress for a\n\
    vineyard in a study that investigated numerous VIs using hyperspectral imaging\
    \ [140]. High-resolution\nthermal imagery obtained from a hyperspectral scanner\
    \ was used to map canopy stomatal conductance\n(gs) and CWSI of olive orchards\
    \ where diﬀerent irrigation treatments were applied [18]. With the\nlarge volume\
    \ of spatial/spectral data extracted from the hyperspectral data cube, machine\
    \ learning\nwill likely be adopted more widely in the horticultural environment\
    \ to model water stress [141].\nSee Reference [54] for a comprehensive review\
    \ of hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing to detect\nplant water status.\n\
    3.4. Thermal\nThermal cameras use microbolometers to read passive thermal signals\
    \ in the spectral range of\napproximately 7–14 µm (Figure 3b). Small UAS are capable\
    \ of carrying a small form-factor thermal\ncamera with uncooled microbolometers,\
    \ which does not use an internal cooling mechanism and,\ntherefore, does not achieve\
    \ the high SNR that can be found in cooled microbolometer-based thermal\ncameras.\
    \ An array of microbolometer detectors in the thermal camera receives a thermal\
    \ radiation\nsignal and stores the signal on the corresponding image pixel as\
    \ raw data number (DN) values.\nThe result is a thermal image where each pixel\
    \ has an associated DN value, which can be converted to\nabsolute temperature.\
    \ A representative list of commercial thermal cameras used on UAS platforms\n\
    and their applications with regard to agricultural remote sensing is found in\
    \ the literature [23,53,73].\nThermal imagery enables the measurement of the foliar\
    \ temperature of plants. The foliar temperature\ndiﬀerence between well-watered\
    \ and water-stressed crops is the primary source of information for\nwater stress\
    \ prediction using a thermal sensor [142]. When mounted on a remote sensing platform,\
    \ the\ncanopy level assessment of crop water status can be performed on a large\
    \ scale.\nThermal cameras are limited by their resolution (e.g., 640 × 512 is\
    \ the maximum resolution of\nUAS compatible thermal cameras in the current market)\
    \ and high price-tag [53]. The small number of\npixels results in low spatial\
    \ resolution limiting either the ability to resolve a single canopy or ability\
    \ to\nﬂy higher and cover a larger area. If ﬂown at a higher altitude, the eﬀective\
    \ spatial resolution may\nbe inadequate for canopy level assessment of some horticultural\
    \ crops. For example, a FLIR Tau2\n640 thermal camera with a 13 mm focal length\
    \ when ﬂown at an altitude of approximately 120 m\nresults in a spatial resolution\
    \ of 15.7 cm. For relatively large horticultural crops, such as grapevine,\nalmond,\
    \ citrus, and avocado, the resolution at a maximum legal ﬂying altitude of 120\
    \ m in Australia\n(for small-sized UAS) oﬀers an adequate spatial resolution to\
    \ observe a single canopy.\nAnother challenge with the use of thermal cameras\
    \ is the temporal drift of the DN values\nwithin successive thermal images, especially\
    \ with uncooled thermal cameras [143]. Due to the lack\nof an internal cooling\
    \ mechanism for the microbolometer detectors, DN values registered by the\nmicrobolometers\
    \ experience temporal drift i.e., the registered DN values for the same temperature\n\
    target will drift temporally. Thus, the thermal image can be unreliable especially\
    \ when the internal\ntemperature of the camera is changing rapidly, such as during\
    \ camera warmup period or during the\nﬂight when a gust of cool wind results in\
    \ cooling of the camera. To overcome this challenge, the user\nmay need to provide\
    \ suﬃcient startup time before operation (preferably 30–60 min) [102,143–145],\n\
    shield the camera to minimize the change in the internal temperature of the camera\
    \ [142], calibrate the\ncamera [146–153], and perform frequent ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections.\n\
    3.5. Multi-Sensor\nTo carry multiple sensors, the total UAS payload needs to be\
    \ considered that includes, in\naddition to the sensors, an inertial measurement\
    \ unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) for the georeferencing\
    \ purpose [40,154]. Higher accuracy sensors tend to be heavier, and in\na multi-sensor\
    \ scenario, the payload can quickly reach or even exceed the payload limit. This\
    \ has\nlimited contemporary measurements in earlier multirotor UAS requiring separate\
    \ ﬂights for each of\nsensor [126]. The use of ﬁxed-wing UAS has allowed carrying\
    \ higher payloads due to the much larger\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 35\nthrust-to-weight\
    \ ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement\
    \ in\nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload\
    \ 5–6 kg readily available) to\nonboard multi-sensors.\nWater status of crops\
    \ is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including the\nphysiology\
    \ of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological\n\
    factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used\
    \ to acquire measurements\nof the diﬀerent aspects of the crop for water status\
    \ assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\ncombination of sensors found in the\
    \ literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR\nbands) and\
    \ thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status\
    \ of the crop\nusing various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, ﬂuorescence, and structural\
    \ properties, with the aim of\nimproving the water use eﬃciency [102,110,158–160].\n\
    4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture\n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely\
    \ Sensed Images\nGeoreferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed\
    \ images such that the pixels\nrepresenting crops or regions of interest on the\
    \ images are correctly associated with their position on\nEarth. The georeferencing\
    \ process generally uses surveyed coordinate points on the ground, known\nas ground\
    \ control points (GCPs), to determine and apply scaling and transformation to\
    \ the aerial\nimages [161]. Alternatively, instead of GCPs, the user can georeference\
    \ aerial images by using the\naccurate position of the camera, or by co-registration\
    \ with the existing georeferenced map [105,162].\nIn the case of UAS-based images,\
    \ the capture timing is scheduled to ensure a recommended\nforward overlap (>80%)\
    \ between successive images.\nThe ﬂight path is designed to ensure the\nrecommended\
    \ side overlap (>70%) between images from successive ﬂight strips. Thus, the captured\n\
    series of images are processed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique\
    \ to generate a 3D\npointcloud and orthomosaic [73,130] (see Figure 5). Commonly\
    \ used SfM software to process the\nremote sensing images are Agisoft PhotoScan\
    \ and Pix4D. The commonly retrieved outputs from the\nSfM software for assessment\
    \ of horticulture crops include the orthomosaic, digital surface model\n(DSM),\
    \ DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be\
    \ applied to any\nsensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral\
    \ cameras [126,164,165].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n10 of 35 \n \nsensor [126].\
    \ The use of fixed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much\
    \ larger \nthrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155].\
    \ Similarly, recent advancement in \nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have\
    \ enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) \nto onboard multi-sensors.\
    \ \nWater status of crops is a complex process influenced by a number of factors\
    \ including the \nphysiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and\
    \ vigour of the crop, and meteorological \nfactors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this\
    \ reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements \nof the different\
    \ aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\
    \ \ncombination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including\
    \ rededge and NIR \nbands) and thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to\
    \ investigate the water status of the crop \nusing various indicators, such as\
    \ PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of \nimproving\
    \ the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160]. \n4. Techniques of Remote Sensing\
    \ in Horticulture \n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images \nGeoreferencing\
    \ provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels\
    \ \nrepresenting crops or regions of interest on the images are correctly associated\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n11 of 35\nThe complexity of georeferencing of hyperspectral\
    \ observations depends on the sensor type, i.e.,\nimaging or non-imaging. A non-imaging\
    \ spectroradiometer relies on the use of a GNSS antenna and\nan IMU for georeferencing\
    \ the point observation [130,132,138,168]. An imaging hyperspectral camera,\n\
    generally, in addition to GNSS and IMU measurement, uses the inter-pixel relation\
    \ in SfM to produce a\ngeoreferenced orthomosaic [40,134,135,169,170].\n4.2. Calibration\
    \ and Correction of Remotely Sensed Images\nEnsuring consistency, repeatability,\
    \ and quality of the spectral observation requires stringent\nradiometric, spectral,\
    \ and atmospheric corrections [123,171–177]. Spectral and radiometric calibration\n\
    is performed in the spectral calibration facility in darkroom settings. The sensor’s\
    \ optical properties\nand shift in spectral band position are corrected during\
    \ the spectral calibration process. Radiometric\ncalibration enables conversion\
    \ of the recorded digital values into physical units, such as radiance.\nInﬁeld\
    \ operation of the spectral sensor is inﬂuenced by variations in atmospheric transmittance\n\
    from thin clouds, invisible to the human observer. Changes in atmospheric transmittance\
    \ aﬀect the\nradiance incident on the plant. As a result, the change in acquired\
    \ spectral response by the sensor\nmay not represent the change in plants response\
    \ but the change in incident radiation on the plant.\nThe most common method to\
    \ convert the spectral data to reﬂectance is by generating an empirical line\n\
    relationship between sensor values and spectral targets, such as a Spectralon®\
    \ or calibration targets.\nThe use of downwelling sensors, such as a cosine corrector\
    \ [137], or the use of a ground-based PAR\nsensor enables absolute radiometric\
    \ calibration to generate radiance [130].\nThe calibration of the broad wavelength\
    \ multispectral sensor is generally less stringent than\nthe hyperspectral. Generally,\
    \ multispectral sensors are used to compute normalised indices such\nas NDVI.\
    \ The normalised indices are relatively less inﬂuenced, although signiﬁcant, by\
    \ the change\nin illumination conditions which aﬀect the entire spectrum proportionally\
    \ [29,101]. In this regard,\nradiometric calibration of the multispectral camera\
    \ has used a range of stringent to simpliﬁed, and\nvicarious approaches [123,125,171,173,178–180].\
    \ Some multispectral cameras are equipped with a\ndownwelling light sensor, which\
    \ is aimed at correcting for variations in atmospheric transmittance.\nHowever,\
    \ the performance of such downwelling sensors (without a cosine corrector) on\
    \ multispectral\ncameras have been reported to have directional variation resulting\
    \ in unstable correction, indicating\nthe inability of the sensor to incorporate\
    \ the entire hemisphere of diﬀused light [124,137].\nThe radiometric calibration\
    \ of the thermal images is typically based on the camera’s DN to object\ntemperature\
    \ curve, which provides the relationship between the DN of a pixel and a known\
    \ object\ntemperature, usually of a black body radiator. Measurement accuracy\
    \ and SNR of the camera under\nvarying ambient temperatures can be improved by\
    \ using calibration shutters, which are recently\navailable commercially. Furthermore,\
    \ for low measurement errors (under 1 ◦C), thermal data requires\nconsideration\
    \ to the atmospheric transmittance [18,102]. Flying over a few temperature reference\n\
    targets placed on the ground reduces the temporal drift of the camera [142,143,181].\
    \ Temperature\naccuracy within a few degrees was achieved by ﬂying over the targets\
    \ three times (at the start, middle\nand end of UAS operation) and using three\
    \ separate calibration equations for each overpass [142].\nAdditionally, using\
    \ the redundant information from multiple overlapping images, drift correction\n\
    models have been proposed, which lowered temperature error by 1 ◦C as compared\
    \ to uncorrected\northomosaic [152]. The manufacturer stated accuracies (generally\
    \ ±5 ◦C) can be suﬃcient to access the\nﬁeld variability and to detect “hotspots”\
    \ of water status. However, the aforementioned calibration and\ncorrection of\
    \ the thermal cameras are required for quantitative measurement as a goal [143].\
    \ In this\nregard, current challenges and best practices for the operation of\
    \ thermal cameras onboard a UAS is\nprovided in the literature [143].\n4.3. Canopy\
    \ Data Extraction\nA key challenge in remote sensing of horticultural as compared\
    \ to agricultural crops arises due\nto the proportion of inter-row ground/vegetation\
    \ cover and resulting mixed pixels. The proportion\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n12\
    \ of 35\nof the mixed pixels increases with the decrease in spatial resolution\
    \ of the image. Most of the pixels\ntowards the edge of the canopy contain a blend\
    \ of information originating from the sun-lit canopy,\nshadowed leaves, and inter-row\
    \ bare soil/cover crop. A further challenge can arise for some crops,\nsuch as\
    \ grapevine, due to overlapping of adjacent plants.\nThe canopy data from orthomosaic\
    \ has been extracted using either a pixel-based or an object-based\napproach.\
    \ Earlier studies manually sampled from the centre of crop row which most likely\
    \ eliminated\nthe mixed pixels [182]. In the pixel-based approach, techniques,\
    \ such as applying global threshold\nand masking, have been used. Binary masks,\
    \ such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from\nthe sampling [82,84]. Combining\
    \ the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can exclude the\npixels associated\
    \ with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that does not meet the height threshold.\n\
    The pixel-based approach, however, can result in inaccurate identiﬁcation of some\
    \ crops due to pixel\nheterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop\
    \ pattern variability.\nIn the object-based approach, using object detection techniques,\
    \ neighbouring pixels with\nhomogenous information, such as spectral, textural,\
    \ structural, and hierarchical features, are grouped\ninto “objects”. These objects\
    \ are used as the basis of object-based image analysis (OBIA) classiﬁcation\n\
    using classiﬁers, such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine,\
    \ random forest,\nand maximum likelihood [122,183–185]. In the horticultural environment,\
    \ OBIA has been adopted\nto classify and sample from pure canopy pixels [119,122,186].\
    \ Consideration should be provided on\nthe number of features and their suitability\
    \ for a speciﬁc application to reduce the computational\nburden, as well as to\
    \ maintain the accuracies. The generalisation of these algorithms for transferability\n\
    between study sites usually penalises the achievable accuracy. For details in\
    \ object-based approach of\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation, readers are directed\
    \ to literatures [122,183,185,187–189].\nOther techniques found in the literature\
    \ include algorithms, such as ‘Watershed’, which has been\ndemonstrated in palm\
    \ orchards [82,190]. Vine rows and plants have been isolated and classiﬁed using\n\
    image processing techniques, such as clustering and skeletisation [188,191–193].\
    \ Similarly, the gridded\npolygon, available in common GIS software, such as ArcGIS\
    \ and QGIS, can be used in combination\nwith zonal statistics for this purpose.\
    \ When working with the low-resolution images, co-registration\nwith the high-resolution\
    \ images has been proposed, whereby, the high-resolution images enable better\n\
    delineation of the mixed pixels [194]. For this reason, spectral and thermal sensors,\
    \ which are usually\nlow in resolution, are generally employed along with high-resolution\
    \ digital cameras.\n4.4. Indicators of Crop Water Status\nA crop’s biophysical\
    \ and biochemical attributes can be approximated using diﬀerent indices and\n\
    quantitative products. For example, CWSI is used to proxy leaf water potential\
    \ (Ψleaf), stem water\npotential (Ψstem), gs, and net photosynthesis (Pn) [83,100,195].\
    \ With regard to horticultural crops, water\nstatus has been assessed using a\
    \ number of spectral and thermal indices (Table 2).\nTable 2. Commonly used vegetation\
    \ and thermal indices to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nIndicators\n\

    A plant maintains its temperature by transpiring through the stomata to balance\
    \ the energy\nﬂuxes in and out of the canopy. As the plant experience stress (both\
    \ biotic and abiotic), the rate of\ntranspiration decreases, which results in\
    \ higher canopy temperature (Tc), which can be a proxy to\nunderstand the water\
    \ stress in the plant [207]. In this regard, crop water stress showed a correlation\n\
    with canopy temperature extracted from the thermal image [208], which enables\
    \ mapping the spatial\nvariability in water status [209]. Leaf/canopy temperature\
    \ alone, however, does not provide a complete\ncharacterisation of crop water\
    \ status, for instance, an equally stressed canopy can be 25 ◦C or 35 ◦C,\ndepending\
    \ on the current ambient temperature (Ta). Thus, canopy-to-air temperature diﬀerence\n\
    (Tc − Ta) was proposed, which showed a good correlation with the Ψstem, Ψleaf,\
    \ and gs in horticultural\ncrops [85,99,182].\n4.4.2. Normalised Thermal Indices\n\
    The CWSI, the conductance index (Ig) and the stomatal conductance index (I3) are\
    \ thermal\nindices most commonly used to estimate crop water status and gs [210–212].\
    \ These indices provide\nsimilar information, however, use a diﬀerent range of\
    \ numbers to represent the level of water stress.\nThe CWSI is normalised within\
    \ zero and one, whereas Ig and I3 represent stress using numbers\nbetween zero\
    \ and inﬁnity. CWSI has been adopted most widely in horticultural applications\
    \ to\nassess the water status of crops, such as the grapevines [100,213], almond\
    \ [91,198], citrus [85,110], and\nothers [18,87,99,214]. By normalising between\
    \ the lower and upper limits of (Tc − Ta), the CWSI of the\ncanopy presents quantiﬁable\
    \ relative water stress. The formula for CWSI computation is deﬁned as in\nEquation\
    \ (1) [208,212].\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n\
    (1)\nwhere (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL represent the upper and lower bound of\
    \ (Tc − Ta) which are found in\nthe water-stressed canopy and well-watered canopy\
    \ transpiring at the full potential (or maximum) rate,\nrespectively. Assuming\
    \ a constant ambient temperature, Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed to Equation (2),\n\
    which is the most widely reported formulation of CWSI with regard to the horticultural\
    \ remote sensing.\nCWSI = (Tc − Twet)\n\x10\nTdry − Twet\n\x11\n(2)\nwhere Twet\
    \ is the temperature of canopy transpiring at the maximum potential, and Tdry\
    \ is the\ntemperature of the non-transpiring canopy. CWSI has been shown to be\
    \ well-correlated with direct\nmeasurements of crop water status in the horticultural\
    \ environment [18,31,32,90,99]. In this regard,\na correlation of CWSI with various\
    \ ground measurements, such as Ψleaf [18,31,197], Ψstem [33,90,194],\nand gs [18,90,100],\
    \ have been established. Diurnal measurements of CWSI compared with Ψleaf showed\n\
    the best correlation at noon [89,197,209].\nCWSI is a normalised index, i.e.,\
    \ relative to a reference temperature range between Twet and Tdry,\nwhich is speciﬁc\
    \ to a region and crop type; thus, CWSI is not a universal quantitative indicator\
    \ of crop\nwater status. For instance, a CWSI of 0.5 for two diﬀerent varieties\
    \ of grapevines at diﬀerent locations\ndoes not conclusively inform that they\
    \ have equal or superior/inferior water status. Furthermore,\nthe degree of correlation\
    \ can change depending on the isohydric/anisohydric response of crop [214]\nwhere\
    \ early/late stomatal closure aﬀects the indicators of water stress [110]. Moreover,\
    \ phenological\nstage aﬀects the relationship between remotely sensed CWSI and\
    \ water stress [197]. Thus, water stress\nin a diﬀerent crop, at a diﬀerent location\
    \ and at a diﬀerent phenological stage, will have a unique\ncorrelation with CWSI\
    \ and, therefore, needs to be established independently.\nThere are multiple methods\
    \ to measure the two reference temperatures, Twet and Tdry, which\ncould result\
    \ in variable CWSI values depending on the method used. The ﬁrst method is to\
    \ measure the\ntwo reference temperatures on the crop of interest. Tdry can be\
    \ estimated by inducing stomatal closure,\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n14 of 35\n\
    which is the leaf temperature approximately 30 min after applying a layer of petroleum\
    \ jelly e.g.,\nVaseline to both sides of a leaf. This eﬀectively blocks stomata\
    \ and, therefore, impedes leaf transpiration.\nTwet can be estimated by measuring\
    \ leaf temperature approximately 30 s after spraying water on the\nleaf, which\
    \ emulates maximum transpiration [23,83]. The advantage of this method is that\
    \ the stress\nlevels are normalised to actual plants response, whereas the necessity\
    \ to repeat the measurement for\nevery test site after each ﬂight can be cumbersome.\
    \ In an alternative (second) approach the range can\nbe established based on meteorological\
    \ data e.g., setting Tdry to 5 ◦C above air temperature and Twet\nmeasured from\
    \ an artiﬁcial surface. This method is also limited to local scale and presents\
    \ a problem\nregarding the choice of material, which ideally needs to have similar\
    \ to leaf emissivity, aerodynamic\nand optical properties [54,87]. The third method\
    \ uses the actual temperature measurement range\nof the remote sensing image [33,97].\
    \ This method is simple to implement, however, works on the\nassumption that the\
    \ ﬁeld contains enough variability to contain a representative Twet and Tdry.\
    \ Fourth,\nthe reference temperatures can be estimated by theoretically solving\
    \ for the leaf surface energy balance\nequations, however, are limited by the\
    \ necessity to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance [87].\nStandard and robust\
    \ Twet and Tdry measurements are needed to characterize CWSI with accuracy,\n\
    especially for temporal analysis [85,87,211]. The level of uncertainty due to\
    \ the adaptation of diﬀerent\napproaches for Twet and Tdry determination in the\
    \ instantaneous and seasonal measurements of CWSI\nis not known. Nonetheless,\
    \ adopting a consistent approach, CWSI has been shown to be suitable for\nmonitoring\
    \ the water status and making irrigation decisions of horticultural crops [31,85].\n\
    4.4.3. Spectral Indices\nCrops reﬂectance properties convey information about\
    \ the crop, for instance, a healthier crop has\nhigher reﬂectance in the NIR band.\
    \ Most often, the bands are mathematically combined to form VIs,\nwhich provide\
    \ information on the crop’s health, growth stage, biophysical properties, leaf\
    \ biochemistry,\nand water stress [29,215–218]. Using multispectral or hyperspectral\
    \ data, several Vis, such as green\nnormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI),\
    \ renormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI),\noptimized soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI),\
    \ and TCARI/OSAVI, amongst others [34,79,82], can be calculated that correlate\
    \ with the\nwater stress of horticultural crops (see Table 2). The most widely\
    \ studied VI in horticulture, in this\nregard, is the NDVI (Equation (3)).\nNDVI\
    \ = Rnir − Rr\nRnir + Rr\n(3)\nwhere Rnir and Rr represent the spectral reﬂectance\
    \ acquired at the NIR and red spectral regions,\nrespectively. In horticulture,\
    \ NDVI has been used as a proxy to estimate the vigour, biomass, and water\nstatus\
    \ of the crop. A vigorous canopy with more leaves regulates more water, therefore\
    \ remaining\ncooler when irrigated [200] and experiencing early water stress when\
    \ unirrigated. With regard to\nirrigation, the broadband normalised spectral indices\
    \ (such as NDVI) are suitable to detect spatial\nvariability and to identify the\
    \ area that is most vulnerable to water stress. However, these indices are\nnot\
    \ expected to change rapidly to reﬂect the instantaneous water status of plants\
    \ that are needed to\nmake decisions on irrigation scheduling.\nThe multispectral\
    \ indices along with complementary information in thermal wavelengths have\nproven\
    \ to be well suited to monitoring vegetation, speciﬁcally in relation to water\
    \ stress [219]. The ratio\nof canopy surface temperature to NDVI, deﬁned as temperature-vegetation\
    \ dryness index (TVDI),\nwas found to be useful for the study of water status\
    \ in horticultural crops. TVDI exploits the fact that\nvegetation with larger\
    \ NDVI will have a lower surface temperature unless the vegetation is under\n\
    stress. As most vegetation normally remains green after an initial bout of water\
    \ stress, the TVDI is\nmore suited than NDVI for early detection of water stress\
    \ as the surface temperature can rise rapidly\neven during initial water stress\
    \ [200].\nSimilarly, narrowband VIs that have been studied in relation to remote\
    \ sensing of water status are\nPRI and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, which have been\
    \ directly correlated to the crop Ψleaf, gs [110,182,204].\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140\n15 of 35\nSeveral hyperspectral indices to estimate water status have been\
    \ identiﬁed [139]; however, their\napplication in remote sensing of horticultural\
    \ crops is at its infancy. Hyperspectral indices speciﬁc to\nwater absorption\
    \ bands around 900 nm, 1200 nm, 1400 nm, and 1900 nm may be used to detect the\n\
    water status of horticultural crops. The absorption features were found to be\
    \ highly correlated with\nplant water status [139]. Water band index (WBI), as\
    \ deﬁned in Equation (4), has been shown to closely\ntrack the changes in the\
    \ plant water status of various crops [202,203].\nWBI = R970\nR900\n(4)\nOther\
    \ water-related hyperspectral indices with potential application for horticultural\
    \ crops can\nbe found in the literature [139,202,203]. Hyperspectral data possess\
    \ the capability to reﬂect the\ninstantaneous water status of the plant, which\
    \ can be useful for quantitative decision-making on\nirrigation scheduling.\n\
    4.4.4. Soil Moisture\nThe moisture status of the soil provides an indication of\
    \ the available water resource to the crop.\nSoil moisture is traditionally measured\
    \ indirectly using soil moisture sensors placed below the surface\nof the soil.\
    \ A key challenge with using soil moisture sensors are the spatial distribution\
    \ of moisture,\nboth vertically and horizontally, to account for inherent ﬁeld-scale\
    \ variability. For instance, the root\nsystem of some horticultural crops, such\
    \ as grapevine, is capable of accessing water up to 30 m deep,\nwhile customer-grade\
    \ soil moisture probes generally extend to 1.5 m in depth or less. Thus, soil\n\
    moisture probes do not capture all the water available to the crop as they are\
    \ point measures and\nnot necessarily where the roots are located. Moreover, estimation\
    \ of soil moisture across spatial and\ntemporal scales is of interest for various\
    \ agricultural and hydrological studies. Optical, thermal, and\nmicrowave remote\
    \ sensing with their advantages relating to high spatial scale and temporal resolutions\n\
    could potentially be used for soil moisture estimation [220–222]. L-band microwave\
    \ radiometry,\na component of synthetic aperture radar systems, has been shown\
    \ to be a reliable approach to estimate\nsoil moisture via satellite-based remote\
    \ sensing [223], such as using the ESA’s Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS)\
    \ [224] and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites [225,226].\n\
    The limitation of the SMOS and SMAP missions, with regard to horticultural application,\
    \ is their\ndepth of retrieval (up to 5 cm) and spatial resolution (in the order\
    \ of tens of kilometre) [227–229].\nAs an airborne application, the volumetric\
    \ soil moisture has been estimated by analysing the SNR of\nthe GNSS interference\
    \ signal [230,231]. With aforementioned capabilities, a combination of satellite\n\
    and airborne remote sensing may, in the future, be a reliable tool to map soil\
    \ moisture across spatial,\ntemporal and depth scales.\n4.4.5. Physiological Attributes\n\
    Using the SfM on remotely-sensed images, 3D canopy structure, terrain conﬁgurations,\
    \ and canopy\nsurface models can be derived [113,114,119,186,232]. By employing\
    \ a delineation algorithm on the 3D\nmodels, the 3D attributes of the crops and\
    \ macrostructure are determined more accurately [120,122,233].\nCrop surface area\
    \ and terrain conﬁguration (e.g., slope and aspect) may help to develop an optimal\n\
    resource management strategy. For example, crops located at a higher elevation\
    \ within an irrigation\nzone may experience a level of water stress due to the\
    \ gravitational ﬂow of irrigated water.\nUsing the structural measurements, such\
    \ as the canopy height, canopy size, the envelope of each\nrow, LAI, and porosity,\
    \ among others, the water demand of the crop may be estimated. Generally,\nlarger\
    \ canopies tend to require more water than smaller canopies with less leaf area\
    \ [116,157]. Using\nthe temporal measurement of the plant’s 3D attributes, the\
    \ vigour can be computed. Monitoring\ncrop vigour over the season and over subsequent\
    \ years can provide an indication of its health and\nperformance, e.g., yield,\
    \ within an irrigation zone. Canopy structure metrics are closely related to\n\
    horticultural tree growth and provide strong indicators of water consumption,\
    \ whereby canopy size\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n16 of 35\ncan be used to determine\
    \ its water requirements [234]. Other 3D attributes, such as the crown perimeter,\n\
    width, height, area, and leaf density, have been shown to enable improved pruning\
    \ of horticultural\nplants [116,119].\nLAI can be estimated using the 3D attributes\
    \ obtained from remote sensing [114,157,201], whereby,\nhigher LAI is equivalent\
    \ to more leaf layers, implying greater total leaf area and, consequently, canopy\n\
    transpiration. Leaf density, LAI, and exposed leaf area of a crop drive its water\
    \ requirement and\nproductivity [235–237]. Knowledge of ﬁeld attributes, such\
    \ as row and plant spacing, may assist in\ninter-row surface energy balance to\
    \ determine the irrigation need of the plant [238]. Combining the\nstructural\
    \ properties with spectral VIs provide an estimation of biomass [239], which can\
    \ serve as\nanother indicator of the plant’s water requirements. Although physiological\
    \ attributes have been used\nto understand plant water status and its spatial\
    \ variability, they have not been directly applied to make\nquantitative decisions\
    \ on irrigation.\n4.4.6. Evapotranspiration\nThe estimation of ET via remote sensing,\
    \ numerical modelling, and empirical methods have been\nextensively studied and\
    \ reviewed in the literature [240–247]. These models are based on either surface\n\
    energy balance (SEB), Penman-Monteith (PM), Maximum entropy production (MEP),\
    \ water balance,\nwater-carbon linkage, or empirical relationships.\nSEB models\
    \ are based on a surface energy budget in which the latent heat ﬂux is estimated\
    \ as a\nresidual of the net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, and sensible heat ﬂux. The\
    \ models are either one-source\n(canopy and soil treated as a single surface for\
    \ the estimation of sensible heat ﬂux) or two-source\n(canopy and soil surfaces\
    \ treated separately). Improvements over the original one-source SEB models\n\
    were in the form of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm\
    \ [248,249] and\nMapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized\
    \ Calibration (METRIC) [249,250].\nSEBAL oﬀers a simpliﬁed approach to collect\
    \ ET data at both local and regional scales thereby increasing\nthe spatial scope,\
    \ while METRIC uses the same (SEBAL) technique but auto-calibrates the model using\n\
    hourly ground-based reference ET (ETr) data [251]. As such, these and other (e.g.,\
    \ MEP) models rely\non accurate measurements of surface (e.g., canopy) and air\
    \ temperatures, which can be erroneous\nunder non-ideal conditions, e.g., cloudy\
    \ days. There is also a reliance on ground-based sensors to\ncapture ambient air\
    \ temperatures required by the model.\nAmong the existing methods, FAO’s PM is\
    \ the most widely adopted model to estimate reference\nET (ETref or ET0) [252].\
    \ The PM method uses incident and reﬂected solar radiation, emitted thermal\n\
    radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and vapour pressure to calculate ET0 [253].\
    \ Remote sensing\nprovides a cost-eﬀective method to estimate the ET0 at regional\
    \ to global scales [241] by estimating\nreﬂected solar and emitted thermal radiation.\
    \ One of the advantages of using the PM approach is\nthat it is parametrised using\
    \ micrometeorological data easily obtained from ground-based automatic\nweather\
    \ stations. However, PM suﬀers from the drawback that canopy transpiration is\
    \ not dynamic\nas inﬂuenced by soil moisture availability via stomatal regulation\
    \ [241]. From a practical standpoint,\nPM-derived ET0 estimates are used in conjunction\
    \ with crop factors or crop coeﬃcients (kc), which are\nclosely related to the\
    \ light interception of the canopy [254].\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is deﬁned\
    \ as the product of kc and ET0. In the absence of accurate\nETc measurements,\
    \ kc is an easy and practical means of getting reliable estimates of ETc using\
    \ ET0 [255].\nIn this regard, studies have focused on the use of remote sensing\
    \ to study spatial variability in kc and\nETc [101,256–258]. Thermal and NIR imagery\
    \ can be used to compute kc and ETc as transpiration\nrate is closely related\
    \ to canopy temperature [259–261] and kc has been shown to correlate with\ncanopy\
    \ reﬂectance [101,255]. Various thermal indices, such as CWSI, canopy temperature\
    \ ratio, canopy\ntemperature above non-stressed, and canopy temperature above\
    \ canopy threshold, can be used to\nestimate ETc, where CWSI- based ETc was found\
    \ to be the most accurate [24].\nET at a larger scale is typically estimated based\
    \ on satellite remote sensing. The temporal resolution\nof satellites is, however,\
    \ low and inadequate for horticultural applications, such as irrigation scheduling\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n17 of 35\n(e.g., Landsat has a 16-day revisit cycle).\
    \ In contrast, high temporal resolution satellites are coarse in\nspatial resolution\
    \ for ﬁeld-scale observations [25]. The daily or even instantaneous estimation\
    \ of ETc at\nthe ﬁeld scale is crucial for irrigation scheduling and is expected\
    \ to have great application prospects\nin the future [240,259,262,263]. In this\
    \ regard, the future direction of satellite-based ET estimates\nmay focus on temporal\
    \ downscaling either by extrapolation of instantaneous measurement [264],\ninterpolation\
    \ between two successive observations [201], data fusion of multiple satellites\
    \ [25,260], and\nspatial downscaling using multiple satellites [265–268]. An example\
    \ of early satellite-based remote\nsensing for ET is the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration\
    \ Project (MOD16), which was established in\n1999 to provide daily estimates of\
    \ global terrestrial evapotranspiration using data acquired from a\npair of NASA\
    \ satellites in conjunction with Algorithm Theoretical Based Documents (ATBDs)\
    \ [269].\nThese estimates correlated well with ground-based eddy covariance ﬂux\
    \ tower estimates of ET despite\ndiﬀerences in the uncertainties associated with\
    \ each of these techniques.\nUASs are being increasingly utilised to acquire multi-spectral\
    \ and thermal imagery to compute\nET at an unprecedented spatial resolution [270,271].\
    \ Using high-resolution images, ﬁltering the\nshadowed-pixel is possible, which\
    \ showed signiﬁcant improvement in the estimation of ET in\ngrapevine [101]. Using\
    \ high-resolution thermal and/or multispectral imagery, ET has been derived for\n\
    horticultural crops, such as grapevines [270] and olives [271]. The seasonal monitoring\
    \ of ETc at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions is of high importance for precision\
    \ irrigation of horticultural crops in\nthe future [259].\n5. Case Studies on\
    \ the Use of Remote Sensing for Crop Water Stress Detection\nThe increasing prevalence\
    \ of UAS along with low-cost camera systems has brought about much\ninterest in\
    \ the characterisation of crop water status/stress during the growing season to\
    \ inform orchard\nor farm management decisions, in particular, irrigation scheduling\
    \ [272,273]. Traditional methodologies\nto assess crop water stress are constrained\
    \ by limitations relating to large farm sizes and accompanying\nspatial variability,\
    \ high labour costs to collect data, and access to instrumentation that is both\
    \ inexpensive\nand portable [272]. The beneﬁts of precision agriculture [274],\
    \ including through precision irrigation\npractices [1], result in higher production\
    \ eﬃciencies and economic returns through site-speciﬁc crop\nmanagement [275,276].\
    \ This approach has motivated the use of high-resolution imagery acquired\nfrom\
    \ remote sensing to identify irrigation zones [99,277]. The ﬁrst horticultural\
    \ applications of UAS\nplatforms for crop water status measurement were in orange\
    \ and peach orchards where both thermal\nand multispectral-derived VIs, speciﬁcally\
    \ the PRI, were shown to be well-correlated to crop water\nstatus [102]. Here,\
    \ we explore the use of remote sensing and accompanying image acquisition platforms\n\
    to characterise the spatial and temporal patterns of the water status of two economically\
    \ important\nhorticultural crops, grapevine and almond.\n5.1. Grapevine (Vitis\
    \ spp.)\nThe characterisation of spatial variability in vine water status in a\
    \ vineyard provides valuable\nguidance on irrigation scheduling decisions [82],\
    \ and this spatial variability can be eﬃciently\ncharacterised by the use of remote\
    \ sensing platforms [29]. The ﬁrst use of remote sensing in vineyards\nfor crop\
    \ water stress detection was using manned aircraft ﬂown over an irrigated vineyard\
    \ in Hanwood\n(NSW) Australia where CWSI was mapped at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 10 cm [278]. Subsequently, UAS\nplatforms began to be used in vineyards for\
    \ vine water stress characterisation. Early work in this\ncrop used a fuel-based\
    \ helicopter with a 29 cc engine and equipped with thermal (Thermovision\nA40M)\
    \ and multispectral (Tetracam MCA-6) camera systems [102]. The study observed\
    \ strong (inverse)\nrelationships between (Tc − Ta) and gs. A related study showed\
    \ strong correlations between thermal\nand multispectral VIs, and traditional,\
    \ ground-based measures of water status, such as Ψleaf and\ngs [182]. In this\
    \ study, normalised PRI was shown to have correlation coeﬃcients exceeding 0.8\
    \ versus\nboth Ψleaf and gs, indicating that remotely-sensed VIs can be reliable\
    \ indicators of vine water status.\nThermal indices, such as (Tc − Ta) and CWSI,\
    \ were also well-correlated to Ψleaf and gs at speciﬁc times of\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 140\n18 of 35\nthe day. The use of thermal indices, such as CWSI or Ig,\
    \ requires reference temperatures (Twet, Tdry) or\nnon-water stressed baselines\
    \ (NWSB) [279]. Due to the diﬃculty of obtaining reference temperatures or\nNWSB\
    \ using remote sensing, some authors have used the minimum temperature found from\
    \ all canopy\npixels as Twet [199], and Ta + 5 ◦C as Tdry [213,280]. NWSB is typically\
    \ obtained from well-watered\ncanopies, measuring (Tc − Ta) under a range of vapour\
    \ pressure deﬁcit conditions [279]. Thermal water\nstress indices have also shown\
    \ to be useful to distinguish between water use strategies of diﬀerent\ngrapevine\
    \ cultivars [83,281], which is useful for customising irrigation scheduling based\
    \ on the speciﬁc\nwater needs of a given cultivar. More recently, studies have\
    \ used UAS-based multispectral-based\nVIs to train an artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) models to predict spatial patterns of Ψstem [84,282].\nUsing UAS-based\
    \ multispectral data, the authors showed that ANN estimated Ψstem with higher\n\
    accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.15 MPa) as compared to the conventional multispectral\
    \ indices based\nestimation (RMSE over 0.32 MPa).\n5.2. Almond (Prunus Dulcis)\n\
    Almonds are perennial nut trees grown in semi-arid climates and are reliant on\
    \ irrigation\napplications. Their water requirements are relatively high, with\
    \ seasonal ETc exceeding 1000 mm [283].\nThe requirement for prudent irrigation\
    \ management in the face of decreased water availability is\ncritical for maintaining\
    \ tree productivity, yield, and nut quality [284]. Towards this goal, UAS-based\n\
    remote sensing has been used to characterise the spatial patterns of tree water\
    \ status in almond\norchards. A UAS-based thermal camera was used to acquire tree\
    \ the crown temperature data from\na California almond orchard; this temperature\
    \ was used to determine the temperature diﬀerence\nbetween crown and air (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and compared to shaded leaf water potential (Ψsl) [92]. The study\nfound\
    \ a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.72) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψsl. The same\
    \ authors conducted\na follow on study in Spain on several fruit tree species\
    \ including almond. The negative relationship\n(slope and oﬀset) between (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and Ψstem was observed to vary based on the time of observation;\nmorning\
    \ measurements had weak relationships, whereas afternoon measurements had stronger\n\
    relationships [99]. Their proposed methodology allowed for the spatial characterisation\
    \ of orchard\nwater status on a single-tree basis, demonstrating the utility of\
    \ UAS-based crop water stress data.\nBeyond the characterisation of crop water\
    \ stress for irrigation scheduling, there is an opportunity to\nuse this data\
    \ to quantify the economic impact at a spatial level.\n6. Future Prospective and\
    \ Gaps in the Knowledge\nPrecision irrigation is a promising approach to increase\
    \ farm water use eﬃciency for sustainable\nproduction, including for horticultural\
    \ crops [3,5,9,10,274,285]. It is envisioned that the future of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ will incorporate UAS, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing platforms\n\
    alongside ground-based proximal sensors coupled with wireless sensor networks.\
    \ The automation\nof UAS technology will continue to develop further to a point\
    \ that even novice users can adopt\nthe technology with ease. It is also expected\
    \ that the data processing pipeline of remote sensing\nimages will become automated\
    \ to be ‘ﬁt for purpose’ for crop water status measurements. The ideal\nsolution\
    \ may lie in the use of satellites (or sometimes manned aircraft) for regional\
    \ estimation and\nplanning [55,260], UAS for seasonal monitoring and zoning [32,100,197,286],\
    \ proximal sensors for\ncontinuous measurement [287], and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to derive decision-ready products [84,282]\nthat can be used for making irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [31,288–295]. Continued technological\ndevelopments in\
    \ this space will enable growers to acquire actionable data with ease, and eventually\n\
    transition towards semi-automated or fully-automated irrigation applications.\n\
    Remote sensing and current irrigation application technologies are limited in\
    \ temporal and\nspatial resolution, respectively. Although UAS technology can\
    \ deliver sub-plant level spatially explicit\ninformation of water status, the\
    \ size of the management block is much coarser, typically over 10 m.\nHence, further\
    \ improvements in variable rate application technologies, e.g., boom sprayers,\
    \ or zoned\ndrip irrigation, are required to fully exploit high-resolution UAS\
    \ measurements. Nonetheless, the\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n19 of 35\nrequired resolution\
    \ of remote sensing should be guided by the underlying spatial variability of\
    \ the crop.\nFor ﬁelds with relatively lower spatial variability, low/medium-resolution\
    \ remote sensing imagery\nmay suﬃce for crop water status assessment [278,296,297].\n\
    Remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of plant water status using the regression-based\n\
    approach through several calculated reﬂectance indices. In comparison, physical\
    \ and mechanistic\nmodels, e.g., radiative transfer models and energy balance\
    \ models, incorporate both direct and indirect\nmeasures of the canopy, therefore\
    \ establishing a basis for diﬀerences in plant water status. Using a\nsimilar\
    \ approach, predictions of crop water status using regression-based remote sensing\
    \ models can\nbe improved by incorporating some direct auxiliary variables.\n\
    Further developments in thermal remote sensing are also expected, speciﬁcally,\
    \ the advent of new\nthermal and hybrid thermal-multispectral water status/stress\
    \ indices that are more sensitive to canopy\ntranspiration. The most widely-adopted\
    \ thermal index, CWSI, is an instantaneous measure that is\nnormalised to local\
    \ weather conditions and inﬂuenced by genotype and phenotype. For example,\nthe\
    \ relationship between CWSI and crop water status is inﬂuenced by environmental\
    \ conditions\n(e.g., high incident radiation and low humidity vs low incident\
    \ radiation and high humidity) and\nphenological stage [197,214,298]. As a result,\
    \ corresponding ground-based measurements are required\nfor each temporal remote\
    \ measurement to determine the correlation with water status. Hence, temporal\n\
    assessments of water status using thermal cameras will require the incorporation\
    \ of meteorological\ndata along with the thermal response using novel indices.\n\
    In the area of satellite remote sensing, we foresee further developments on temporal\
    \ downscaling\nto achieve daily measurements. A higher temporal resolution may\
    \ be achieved by fusion of multiple\nsatellite observations, such as freely available\
    \ Landsat and Sentinel. Further reductions of temporal\nresolution will require\
    \ interpolation between two successive observations. Furthermore, temporal\nmodels\
    \ of water status could be developed to assist the interpolation to eventually\
    \ satisfy the\nrequirements for irrigation scheduling [25,201,263]. The continued\
    \ advancement and greater availability\nof Nanosat/Cubesat may provide an alternate\
    \ method to capture high-resolution data at a higher\na greater temporal resolution,\
    \ which can be suitable to study the water status of horticultural\ncrops [299–301].\n\
    Crop water status is a complex phenomenon, which can be interpreted with respect\
    \ to a\nnumber of variables. These variables can include spectral response, thermal\
    \ response, meteorological\ndata, 3D attributes of the canopy, and macrostructure\
    \ of the block (farm).\nClearly, there is\nan opportunity for a multi-disciplinary\
    \ approach, potentially incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques which\
    \ incorporate the aforementioned variables to provide a robust estimation of crop\n\
    water status [84,141,282,302,303]. Furthermore, with machine learning algorithms,\
    \ hyperspectral\nremote sensing will provide a wealth of data to estimate crop\
    \ water status. A quantitative product,\nsuch as SIF, derived from hyperspectral\
    \ data will have the potential for direct quantiﬁcation of water\nstress [204,205,304].\
    \ In this regard, the upcoming FLEX satellite mission [305,306] and recent advances\n\
    in aerial spectroradiometry [109,132,137,307–310] dedicated for observation of\
    \ SIF may be unique and\npowerful tools for high-value horticultural crops.\n\
    Multi-temporal images represent an excellent resource for seasonal monitoring\
    \ of changes in crop\nwater status. Five to six temporal points of data acquisition\
    \ at critical phenological stages of crop\ndevelopment have been recommended for\
    \ irrigation scheduling [31,32]. However, for semi-arid or arid\nregions, irrigation\
    \ is typically required multiple times per week. Acquisition and post-processing\
    \ of\nremote sensing data for actionable products multiple times a week is currently\
    \ logistically unfeasible.\nThe fusion of UAS-based remote sensing data, continuous\
    \ ground-based proximal or direct sensors,\nincluding weather station data, can\
    \ potentially inform daily estimates of water status at canopy level.\nThis approach\
    \ will require predictive models, such as those based on machine learning algorithms,\
    \ to\nestimate the current and future water status of the crop. Eventually, growers\
    \ would beneﬁt from the\nknowledge of crop water requirements for the determination\
    \ of seasonal irrigation requirements to\nsustainably farm into the future.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n20 of 35\nOne vision for the future of precision irrigation\
    \ is in automated pipelines to explicitly manage\nirrigation water at the sub-block\
    \ level. This automated pipeline would likely include remote and\nproximal data\
    \ acquisition and processing, prediction and interpretation of crop water status\
    \ and\nrequirements, and subsequently, control of irrigation systems. Recent rapid\
    \ developments in cloud\ncomputing and wireless technology could assist in the\
    \ quasi-real-time processing of the remote sensing\ndata soon after acquisition\
    \ [311–313]. Eventually, automation and computational power will merge to\ndevelop\
    \ smart technology in which artiﬁcial intelligence uses real-time data analysis\
    \ for diagnosis\nand decision-making. Growers of the future will be able to take\
    \ advantage of precise irrigation\nrecommendations using information sourced from\
    \ a ﬂeet of UAS that map large farm blocks on a daily\nschedule, continuous ground-based\
    \ proximal and direct sensors, and weather stations. This data can be\nstored\
    \ on and accessed from the cloud almost instantaneously, used in conjunction with\
    \ post-processing\nalgorithms for decision-making on optimised irrigation applications\
    \ [311,314].\n7. Conclusions\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the\
    \ use of remote sensing to determine the water\nstatus of horticultural crops.\
    \ One of our objectives was to survey the range of remote sensing tools\navailable\
    \ for irrigation decision-making. Earth observation satellite systems possess\
    \ the required bands\nto study the water status of vegetation and soil. Satellites\
    \ are more suitable for scouting, planning,\nand management of irrigation applications\
    \ that involve large areas, and where data acquisition is\nnot time-constrained.\
    \ Manned aircraft are sparingly used in horticultural applications due to the\n\
    cost, logistics, and speciﬁc expertise needed for the operation of the platform.\
    \ UAS-based remote\nsensing provides ﬂexibility in spatial resolution (crop level\
    \ observation achievable), coverage (over\n25 ha achievable in a single ﬂight),\
    \ spectral bands, as well as temporal revisit. Routine monitoring of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops for water status characterisation is, therefore, best performed using\
    \ a UAS platform.\nWe envision a future for precision irrigation where satellites\
    \ are used for planning, and UAS used in\nconjunction with a network of ground-based\
    \ sensors to achieve actionable products on a timely basis.\nThe plant’s instantaneous\
    \ response to water stress can be captured using thermal cameras (via\nindices,\
    \ such as CWSI) and potentially narrow-band hyperspectral sensors (via, for example,\
    \ SIF),\nmaking them suitable to draw quantiﬁable decisions with regard to irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Broadband\nmultispectral and RGB cameras capture the non-instantaneous\
    \ water status of crops, making them\nsuitable for general assessment of crop\
    \ water status. Integrated use of thermal and multispectral\nimagery may be the\
    \ simplest yet eﬀective sensor combinations to capture the overall as well as\n\
    instantaneous water status of the plant. With regard to irrigation scheduling,\
    \ further developments\nare required to establish crop-speciﬁc thresholds of remotely-sensed\
    \ indices to decide when and how\nmuch to irrigate.\nAuthor Contributions: Performed\

    \ of water resources is one of the major methods of water conservation.\nThere\
    \ are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the irrigation needs of diﬀerent agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ because of their\nspatial variability. Therefore, a decision support system\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) by\ncenter pivot was developed. This\
    \ system can process multi-spectral images taken by unmanned\naerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and obtain the vegetation index (VI). The crop evapotranspiration model\n\
    (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were obtained from their established\
    \ relationships with the\nVIs. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system were constituted\
    \ with ETc, CWSI and precipitation.\nTo provide guidance for users, the duty-cycle\
    \ control map was outputted using ambiguity resolution.\nThe control command contained\
    \ in the map adjusted the duty cycle of the solenoid valve, and then\nchanged\
    \ the irrigation amount. A water stress experiment was designed to verify the\
    \ rationality of\nthe DSS-VRI. The results showed that the more severe water stress\
    \ is, the more irrigation is obtained,\nconsistent with the expected results.\
    \ Meanwhile, a user-friendly software interface was developed to\nimplement the\
    \ DSS-VRI function.\nKeywords: decision support system (DSS); variable rate irrigation\

    1. Introduction\nChina is a country with a water shortage, especially in its northwest\
    \ regions. The shortage of\nwater resources restricts agricultural development\
    \ in many provinces, while the need for food has\ndramatically increased with\
    \ the growth of the population. Agriculture is facing more serious challenges\n\
    and requires eﬀective ways for water-saving irrigation. Variable rate irrigation\
    \ (VRI) is distinguished\nfrom traditional precision irrigation and provides such\
    \ a solution. Previous VRI research has focused\non quantitative decision-making\
    \ models, partition management, decision support systems (DSS) and\nvariable outputs\
    \ [1]. There among, the quantitative decision-making model and partition management\n\
    are key parts of VRI, variable output plays the role of executor, and DSS connected\
    \ all parts of VRI.\nThe DSS has been discussed as a popular topic in the VRI\
    \ system. Navarro [2] developed\na DSS for estimating weekly irrigation needs\
    \ on the basis of soil measurements and climatic variables\nwhich were gathered\
    \ by several autonomous nodes deployed in farmland. Nain [3] used a DSS to\ngenerate\
    \ suitable decision outputs for irrigation and fertilization in hilly regions.\
    \ Miller [4] developed\na DSS, which uses the Natural Resources Conservation Service\
    \ Gridded Soil Survey Geographic\nDatabase to estimate water capacity available\
    \ for root zone, and determines irrigation amount based\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19132880\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880\n\
    2 of 15\non the estimates.\nBesides, AgroClimate is a DSS tool for improving the\
    \ eﬃciency of irrigation\nwater usage (http://mz.agroclimate.org/) with its irrigation\
    \ decision made on the basis of daily crop\nevapotranspiration calculated by the\
    \ Hargreaves equation and crop coeﬃcients [5]. Most DSSs are\ngenerally designed\
    \ for speciﬁc crops or farmlands; it is diﬃcult to apply them in other crops or\
    \ the\nsame crop planted in diﬀerent districts. In view of this, Yang [6] developed\
    \ a decision support system\nfor ﬂexible irrigation scheduling (DSS-FIS), in which\
    \ users can modify its input parameters through\na software interface to adapt\
    \ it to various environments.\nThe use of DSSs for irrigation ties in implementing\
    \ a reliable decision method and using decision\ndata sources. Weather forecast\
    \ information can be a way to estimate the water requirements of the\ncrops [7].\
    \ However, this method is unilateral, since it ignores the impact of crop characteristics\
    \ and\nspatial variability. Some studies have used sensors and the global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) to collect\ninformation about speciﬁc soil and plant conditions\
    \ for irrigation scheduling. Sui [8] built a wireless\nsensor network to monitor\
    \ soil water content and collect weather data. O’Shaughnessy [9] used\ninfrared\
    \ temperature (IRT) sensor nodes mounted on masts at the edge of each concentric\
    \ treatment\narea to measure crop canopy temperature. Morari [10] used time domain\
    \ transmissometry (TDT)\nsensors to measure soil moisture content. Since these\
    \ sensors are immobile, the irrigation decision\naccuracy depends on the number\
    \ of sensors in the large-scale planting area or on the truss of the\nsprinkle\
    \ irrigation machine, and large-scale deployment of these sensors is not economical\
    \ for a moving\nsprinkler irrigation system. Also, the sensors mounted in the\
    \ ﬁeld are harmful to the farmland\nsoil ecosystem.\nIn recent years, irrigation\
    \ scheduling could be obtained from some schemes based on various\nremote sensing\
    \ imagery platforms. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of good real-time\n\
    performance and wide coverage on cropland, and makes up for the defects of immobile\
    \ sensors.\nThe development of aerospace technology makes it possible for irrigation\
    \ scheduling to use remote\nsensing imagery platforms, with unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and satellites as common tools.\nHowever, satellites can be inhibited\
    \ by clouds and/or may not be in orbital position during crop\ndevelopment stages\
    \ [11]. Zhang [12] suggested that canopy temperature from UAV thermal infrared\n\
    images could be a way to evaluate the crop water stress state. The thermal infrared\
    \ sensors currently\nmounted are mostly lightweight and uncooled thermal infrared\
    \ cameras. Compared to multispectral\nremote-sensing systems, thermal imagery\
    \ has the advantage of higher reliability, but the multispectral\nremote-sensing\
    \ system has better performance in terms of information acquisition stability\
    \ and mosaic\ntechnology maturity. Meanwhile, canopy temperature measured by thermal\
    \ infrared camera is easily\naﬀected by air temperature and human activity [13].\
    \ Recently, many studies use UAV spectral images\nto mark crop water status through\
    \ the optimization of the vegetation index (VI) and crop water stress\nindex (CWSI)\
    \ model [14]. The VI-CWSI model, as the main index of the DSS, is usually used\
    \ as\nevidence for irrigation dispatching. Zhang [15] used high-resolution UAV\
    \ multispectral imagery to\nmap maize water stress status. The crop evapotranspiration\
    \ model (ETc) is also used as evidence for\nirrigation dispatching. Calera [16]\
    \ reviewed the crop evapotranspiration model (ETc) on optical remote\nsensing\
    \ for the assessment of crop water requirements, and demonstrated that ET can\
    \ be a reliable\nindicator for irrigation assessment. This approach is based on\
    \ the Food and Agriculture Organization’s\n(FAO) method for estimating crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ in which reference evapotranspiration values\nare multiplied by crop coeﬃcients\
    \ (Kc).\nThe coeﬃcient may be derived from multispectral VI.\nSome approaches\
    \ have employed signals in the thermal band obtained from remote sensors as inputs\n\
    for energy balance equations that are solved to estimate ETc [17]. The multispectral\
    \ VI approach for\nestimating crop evapotranspiration requires fewer inputs and\
    \ theoretical background knowledge,\nand is thus simpler than the energy balance\
    \ equations approach. In this paper, multispectral VIs were\nused to calculate\
    \ crop coeﬃcients.\nWater stressed crops manifest symptoms such as leaf wilting,\
    \ stunted growth, and leaf area\nreduction [18]. VI can be used to monitor surface\
    \ vegetation conditions. The structure indices\nbased on visible, near infrared\
    \ and red-edge bands are more widely used, such as the normalized\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 2880\n3 of 15\ndiﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index\n(EVI), simple ratio (SR) and green\
    \ normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI), and visible\natmospherically\
    \ resistant index (VARI). The NDVI is the most often used, partly due to its “ratio”\n\
    properties, which enable the NDVI to cancel out a large proportion of the noise\
    \ caused by changing\nsun angles, topography, clouds or shadow, and atmospheric\
    \ conditions [19]. The SAVI was established\nto improve the sensitivity of the\
    \ NDVI to soil backgrounds [14]. The EVI has thus been considered\na modiﬁed NDVI\
    \ with improved sensitivity to high biomass regions and improved vegetation\n\
    monitoring capability through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and\
    \ a reduction in\natmospheric inﬂuences [19]. The SR can monitor changes in vegetation\
    \ cover and works best when\nvegetation is densely covered [20]. The GNDVI is\
    \ sensitive to crop pigment changes [21]. The VARI can\nreduce the eﬀects of illumination\
    \ and atmospheric conditions [22]. This paper measured reﬂectance\nindices within\
    \ multispectral ranges (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, SR, GNDVI, VARI) to indicate canopy changes\n\
    due to water stress.\nThe DSS has been used in many cases. The constraints of\
    \ some kinds of DSSs widely used\nin agricultural applications have not been eliminated.\
    \ Firstly, the output of the DSS is the input\ninformation of the control system.\
    \ The actual amount of irrigation is based on the crop’s water\nrequirement, which\
    \ is not the only factor in practical irrigation scheduling. The DSS should be\n\
    combined with a VRI control system. Common methods of control systems include\
    \ zone control and\nspeed control [23]. Speed control varies the moving speed\
    \ of the center pivot to accomplish the desired\nirrigation depth, while the duty-cycle\
    \ control changes the on-oﬀ time of individual sprinklers or groups\nof sprinklers\
    \ to achieve the desired irrigation depth. Generally, the VRI control system provides\n\
    opportunities to apply water to management zones by diﬀerent moving rates or diﬀerent\
    \ solenoid\nvalve duty-cycles. Secondly, the CWSI/Kc inversion model (VI-Kc/VI-CWSI)\
    \ is built for speciﬁc districts\nand crops. Diﬀerent crops have diﬀerent optimization\
    \ VI-Kc/VI-CWSI model [24,25]. Diﬀerent districts\nwith the same crop also have\
    \ diﬀerent VI-Kc/VI-CWSI [26]. The DSS based on the ﬁxed model is\nunsuitable\
    \ for other applications. Third, the irrigation amount is the result of a multifactorial\
    \ decision.\nActually, precise measurement of the irrigation requirement is complicated,\
    \ whose implementation\nneeds a lot of funds and time.\nThe concept of a fuzzy\
    \ system has been used for a realistic decision support model. For the\nirrigation\
    \ mission, the interaction between the crop water requirement and irrigation amount\
    \ is not\nalways accurately deﬁned. Therefore, the fuzzy model can be a viable\
    \ alternative [27]. The fuzzy\nsystem has the characteristics of simple rules\
    \ and wide applicability [28], and can analyze the inaccurate\ninformation and\
    \ receive irrigation guidance from complex farming sites [29]. So it is easier\
    \ for users to\naccept DSSs based on fuzzy logic.\nThis study developed a DSS\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) that serviced a center-pivot\nirrigation\
    \ system. The function of the DSS integrated image processing and data analysis\
    \ for UAV\nremote sensing. By using the DSS, users can easily process the image\
    \ and obtain a duty-cycle control\nmap of variable irrigation. The speciﬁc objectives\
    \ of this research were:\n(i) To develop a widely applicable DSS-VRI, which mainly\
    \ embodies the user to change some\nconditional parameters and to construct a\
    \ partial decision model to work in diﬀerent cases.\n(ii) To achieve expected\
    \ irrigation amounts in diﬀerent management areas, by using the duty-cycle\ncontrol\
    \ map generated from the DSS-VRI, which combines the UAV multispectral remote\
    \ sensing\nsystem and fuzzy inference system.\n2. System Description and Operation\n\
    In this study, a DSS-VRI was designed to make an irrigation scheduling map. The\
    \ main structure\nof the DSS-VRI is shown in Figure 1.\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880\n\

    \ an unmanned aircraft \nsystem, a RedEdge multispectral camera (Micasense, Inc.,\

    irrigation. The system is based on the prediction of the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ and rainfall to obtain \nfuzzy crop water consumption and replenishment. The\
    \ crop water stress index (CWSI) was selected \nto represent the state of water\
    \ stress. CWSI = 0 indicates no water stress, while CWSI = 1 indicates the \n\
    most severe stress. The evapotranspiration, rainfall and CWSI were used as three\
    \ input variables for \nthe fuzzy system to infer the duty-cycle for the central\
    \ pivot to be reached in order to change the \nirrigation level within the crop\
    \ area. The duty cycle is the ratio of the‘on’time to the‘on-off’ period for \n\
    solenoid valve. Lower duty cycle represents the less amount of water application.\
    \ \nFuzzy logic can express qualitative knowledge and experience unclear boundaries.\
    \ It uses the \nconcept of membership function to distinguish fuzzy sets, handle\
    \ fuzzy relations, and simulate \nhuman brains to implement rule-based reasoning.\
    \ Irrigation problems do not need a high accuracy \nfor water requirement measurement.\
    \ The integration of fuzzy logic with irrigation planning issues in \nthe field\
    \ is very effective [31]. Therefore, the method of evapotranspiration, CWSI and\
    \ precipitation \nworking together through fuzzy inference system can make better\

    \ of the crop evapotranspiration and rainfall to obtain\nfuzzy crop water consumption\
    \ and replenishment. The crop water stress index (CWSI) was selected\nto represent\
    \ the state of water stress. CWSI = 0 indicates no water stress, while CWSI =\
    \ 1 indicates\nthe most severe stress. The evapotranspiration, rainfall and CWSI\
    \ were used as three input variables\nfor the fuzzy system to infer the duty-cycle\
    \ for the central pivot to be reached in order to change the\nirrigation level\
    \ within the crop area. The duty cycle is the ratio of the ‘on’ time to the ‘on-oﬀ’\
    \ period for\nsolenoid valve. Lower duty cycle represents the less amount of water\
    \ application.\nFuzzy logic can express qualitative knowledge and experience unclear\
    \ boundaries. It uses the\nconcept of membership function to distinguish fuzzy\
    \ sets, handle fuzzy relations, and simulate human\nbrains to implement rule-based\
    \ reasoning. Irrigation problems do not need a high accuracy for\nwater requirement\
    \ measurement. The integration of fuzzy logic with irrigation planning issues\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld is very eﬀective [31]. Therefore, the method of evapotranspiration,\
    \ CWSI and precipitation\nworking together through fuzzy inference system can\
    \ make better decisions for irrigation decision\nthan traditional methods.\n2.2.1.\
    \ Crop Water Evapotranspiration Model (ETc) and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)\n\
    The water requirements were obtained by the FAO suggested relation as follows:\n\
    ETC = KC•ET0\n(1)\nwhere ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration estimated by\
    \ FAO Penman–Monteith method that uses\ndata including altitude, latitude, maximum\
    \ temperature, minimum temperature, mean temperature,\naverage relative humidity,\
    \ wind speed and sunshine hours. KC is a crop coeﬃcient obtained by utilizing\n\

    \ CWSI was also obtained from the relational model\n(VI-CWSI). The models are\

    \ According\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880\n7 of 15\nto the basic knowledge of irrigation,\
    \ 27 fuzzy rules were set for the duty-cycle of the solenoid valve\n(Table 2).\n\

    (ETc==Low) & (Precipitation==Low) & (CWSI==F) => (Duty-cycle=ML)\n2\n(ETc==Low)\

    \ => (Duty-cycle=L)\n27\n(ETc==High) & (Precipitation==High) & (CWSI==ES) => (Duty-cycle=N)\n\
    Note: “Low” is interpreted as less rainfall or evapotranspiration in the coming\
    \ week, “average” and “Normal” as\nnormal rainfall and evapotranspiration in the\
    \ next week, “High” as rainy or high evapotranspiration in the coming\nweek, F\
    \ as crop water stress in the current state. S as mild water stress, and ES as\
    \ most severe stress.\nThese rules were represented with logical operator ‘&’.\
    \ For example, the ﬁrst rule is expressed as\n‘(ETc==Low) & (Precipitation==Low)\
    \ & (CWSI==F)=>(Duty-cycle=ML)’, and is interpreted as less\nrainfall and less\
    \ evapotranspiration in the coming week, low crop water stress in the current\
    \ state,\nso implies lower duty cycle. The duty cycle is the ratio of the ‘on’\
    \ time to the ‘on-oﬀ’ period. Lower\nduty cycles represent lower amounts of water\
    \ application.\n2.3. DSS-VRI Software Design and Operation\nA software was designed\
    \ to implement the proposed methodology. The application system was\nprogrammed\
    \ in Python (python 3.6.2). The DSS-VRI software generally needs about ﬁve minutes\n\
    to get duty-cycle control map, depending on the input data scale. The user interface\
    \ was designed\nand organized into several frames. Figure 4a gives the data input\
    \ interface, which allow the users\nto input multispectral image and to set some\
    \ basic parameters, including geographic coordinates\nand Moving rate of sprinkler\
    \ irrigation machine, parameters of zone management, application depth\nunder\
    \ the 100% moving rate, saving path of duty-cycle control command. Among all parameters,\n\
    geographic coordinates can be used to ﬁnd the center position of the machine in\
    \ remote sensing image.\nZone management parameters are used to set the number\
    \ of electromagnetic valve groups and the\ndistance between the sprinkler center\
    \ and each management group boundary. Moving speed is related\nto the maximum\
    \ crop water requirement. The relationship can be expressed as ‘the more crop\
    \ water\nis required, the slower the speed is’. After all parameter values are\
    \ entered, the user can click the\n“Update” button to get band information and\
    \ header ﬁle of the image. The interface for calculation of\nCWSI, ETc and precipitation\
    \ is shown in Figure 4b. Users can select the VI-Kc model and VI-CWSI\nmodel,\
    \ and enter weather forecast data of the next week to calculate ET0 and rainfall.\
    \ Figure 4c shows\nthe irrigation duty-cycle control map and NDVI map interface.\
    \ Users click the “Irrigation map” and\n“Spectral map” button to get a variable\
    \ irrigation duty-cycle control map and a NDVI map, respectively.\nThe NDVI map\
    \ has the information interaction function, which can display VIs and ETc of the\
    \ mouse\nlocation. Figure 4d shows the local data analysis interface, which can\
    \ assist users to observe local\nvariation of VI by using 3D-bar plot. Figure\
    \ 4d presents NDVI examples, including the coordinates,\nNDVI value and spatial\
    \ distribution. Users click the “User manual” button to get help page and\n“Control\
    \ system” to open control system software. In addition, the help page of the DSS-VRI\
    \ can guide\nusers to learn about the system’s structure and function descriptions.\n\

  limitations: 'Although this study presented promising results, its application may
    be limited by several factors. Firstly, the accuracy of the developed system relies
    heavily on the reliability of the data sources, including remote sensing data
    and fuzzy rules. In scenarios where these data sources are compromised or unreliable,
    the accuracy of the system may be affected.

    Secondly, the developed system requires specialized knowledge and expertise to
    implement and operate effectively. This may limit its accessibility and applicability,
    particularly for users who lack the necessary technical background or resources.

    Finally, the study only validates the system in a specific context (maize crop,
    central pivot irrigation system, semi-arid region). The performance and effectiveness
    of the system in diﬀerent contexts (diﬀerent crop types, irrigation systems, climate
    conditions) remain to be investigated.'

    \ to global warming, climate change, and social development\nhave been the most\
    \ death-defying threat to global agriculture production for the optimization of\n\
    water and food security. Reﬂectance indices obtained by an Analytical Spectral\
    \ Device (ASD) Spec\n4 hyperspectral spectrometer from tomato growth in two soil\
    \ texture types exposed to four water\nstress levels (70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60%\
    \ FC, and 40–50% FC) was deployed to schedule\nirrigation and management of crops’\
    \ water stress. The treatments were replicated four times in a\nrandomized complete\
    \ block design (RCBD) in a 2 × 4 factorial experiment. Water stress treatments\n\
    were monitored with Time Domain Reﬂectometer (TDR) every 12 h before and after\
    \ irrigation to\nmaintain soil water content at the desired (FC%). Soil electrical\
    \ conductivity (Ec) was measured daily\nthroughout the growth cycle of tomatoes\
    \ in both soil types. Ec was revealing a strong correlation\nwith water stress\
    \ at R2 above 0.95 p < 0.001. Yield was measured at the end of the end of the\
    \ growing\nseason. The results revealed that yield had a high correlation with\
    \ water stress at R2 = 0.9758 and\n0.9816 p < 0.01 for sandy loam and silty loam\
    \ soils, respectively. Leaf temperature (LT ◦C), relative leaf\nwater content\
    \ (RLWC), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), Leaf area index (LAI), were measured\
    \ at each\ngrowth stage at the same time spectral reﬂectance data were measured\
    \ throughout the growth period.\nSpectral reﬂectance indices used were grouped\
    \ into three: (1) greenness vegetative indices; (2) water\novertone vegetation\
    \ indices; (3) Photochemical Reﬂectance Index centered at 570 nm (PRI570), and\n\
    normalized PRI (PRInorm). These reﬂectance indices were strongly correlated with\
    \ all four water\nstress indicators and yield. The results revealed that NDVI,\
    \ RDVI, WI, NDWI, NDWI1640, PRI570,\nand PRInorm were the most sensitive indices\
    \ for estimating crop water stress at each growth stage in\nboth sandy loam and\
    \ silty loam soils at R2 above 0.35. This study recounts the depth of 858 to 1640\n\
    nm band absorption to water stress estimation, comparing it to other band depths\
    \ to give an insight\ninto the usefulness of ground-based hyperspectral reﬂectance\

    \ and increasing global water scarcity, water stress has been the most perilous\
    \ abiotic\nstressor to plant growth. However, to increase food production using\
    \ a minimal amount of\nwater, timely detection and quantiﬁcation of crop water\
    \ status in crop production are very\nvital in precision agriculture technology\
    \ [1–3].\nRemote sensing, as a tool in precision agriculture to effectively schedule\
    \ irrigation\nin vegetable production, has not been extensively developed, especially\
    \ in greenhouse\nvegetable production. For sustainability of agricultural water\
    \ management, timely iden-\ntiﬁcation of plant abiotic stress is required [4],\
    \ to improve food and water security. It is\npossible to relate available soil\
    \ water to crop leaf water content if the density and water\ncontent of the crop\
    \ leaf is highly correlated to the available soil water [5–8].\nA remote sensing\
    \ approach in assessing crop water status is fast, accurate, less\nlaborious,\
    \ and non-destructive at different scales (ground, airborne, and satellite) of\n\
    measurements [4,9–11]. According to Ihuoma and Madramootoo [4], Streher et al.\
    \ [12],\nZhang et al. [13] and Nemeskéri et al. [14], hyperspectral spectra reﬂectance\
    \ extending\nfrom the visible to the near-infrared to the midway infrared can\
    \ provide spectral features\nconcerning differences in the physiology, biophysical,\
    \ and biochemical composition of crop\nleaf. Zhang and Zhou [15] and Zhou et al.\
    \ [16], reported that hyperspectral reﬂectance\nin assessing crop water stress\
    \ is very important for crop yield forecast. The technique\nfor remote sensing\
    \ of crop water stress has included crop leaf temperature and other\nvegetation\
    \ index determination using red and near-infrared reﬂectance. Remote sensing\n\
    of crop leaf is mainly performed by obtaining the electromagnetic wave reﬂectance\
    \ in-\nformation from leaves using passive sensors [9,17–20]. According to Katsoulas\
    \ et al. [8]\nand Honkavaara et al. [21], the reﬂectance of light spectra from\
    \ plants varies with plant\ntype, the growth stage of the crop, water content\
    \ within tissues, and other inherent factors.\nMoreover, spectral reﬂectance characteristics\
    \ of crop leaves are mostly dependent on the\nbiochemical, biophysical, and morphological\
    \ characteristics of the leaves [5,22,23].\nHyperspectral remote sensing of crop\
    \ leaf using an Analytical Spectrometry Device\n(ASD) is based on the following\
    \ spectra band regions: (i) the ultraviolet region (UV), which\nranges from 10\
    \ to 380 nm; the visible spectra region, which ranges from 380 to 740 nm; the\n\
    near-infrared band (740–1400 nm), and 1400 to 2500 nm ranges for the short wavelength\n\
    region [24–26]. According to Hatﬁeld et al. [27], the surface of leaves’ absorptivity\
    \ or\nemissivity in the thermal waveband of a healthy and fully grown green plant\
    \ is generally\nbetween the range of 0.96–0.99, whereas dry or unhealthy plant\
    \ emissivity rate generally\nranges from 0.88 to 0.94. The use of hyperspectral\
    \ reﬂectance to assess plant water stress or\nphysiological changes is very complicated,\
    \ as the mechanisms linking spectra reﬂectance\nand emission to plant functional\
    \ traits are not always clear or known [26]. Spectroscopy\ntechniques coupled\
    \ with deep learning algorithms have been used for leaf morphological\nand biochemical\
    \ traits in crop photosynthesis potential estimation, leaf chlorophyll content\n\
    estimation, sensitivity in PRI water stress assessment, NDWI, WI, SRWI vegetation\
    \ indices\nfor water stress assessment as well as structure vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI, RDVI,\nmNDVI750, and many other VIs (Ihuoma and Madramootoo [4],\
    \ Ustin et al. [5], Gao [6], Ga-\nmon et al. [10], Zhang et al. [13], Nemeskéri\
    \ et al. [14], Zarco-Tejada and Ustin [17], Roujean\nand Breon [28], Gitelson\
    \ et al. [29], Sakamoto et al. [30], Peñuelas et al. [31], Chen et al. [32],\n\
    Chen et al. [33], Liu et al. [34], Mzid et al. [35], Rouse et al. [36], Zeng et\
    \ al. [37]), to evaluate\nwater stress based on leaf reﬂectance successfully by\
    \ using speciﬁc wavelengths or indices\nrelated to crop water status of crops\
    \ at different growth stage and water treatment levels.\nVegetation indices that\
    \ measure crop canopy greenness are sensitive to both leaf area and\nchlorophyll\
    \ content [3,5].\nHowever, the pigment-based indices such as NDVI, RDVI, CLgreen\
    \ help researchers to\nbetter understand the biophysical and biochemical processes\
    \ of crop leaves and also help\nin predicting crop yield (Katsoulas et al. [8],\
    \ Zhang et al. [9]). According to Zhang et al. [38],\nwater index vegetation indices\
    \ such as WI, NDWI, NDWI1640, NDWI2130, and SRWI are\nvery essential in the estimation\
    \ of leaf temperature, leaf relative water content, leaf area\nindex (LAI), yield,\
    \ and end of season biomass within 980 and 1240 nm. The photochemical\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 5705\n3 of 17\nindex is a very good indicator of photosynthetic rate\
    \ and spatiotemporal scales, this has\nbeen used by (Fischlin et al. [39], Magney\
    \ et al. [40], Garbulsky et al. [41], Wong and\nGamon [42], Zhang et al. [43]),\
    \ for the detection of the reactivation of photosynthesis in\nstress evergreen\
    \ species.\nThe effects of seasonal drought on the photosynthetic apparatus have\
    \ also been de-\ntected by satellite-based PRI. Maximum CO2 assimilation has also\
    \ been efﬁciently estimated\nby PRI under severe drought conditions and this has\
    \ established that changes in PRI were\ncorrelated with water stress in maize\
    \ (Zhang et al. [9]). Photosynthetic variability induced\nby heat and drought\
    \ is simultaneously accompanied by complex physiological and bio-\nchemical processes,\
    \ which could constrain the PRI-based estimation of the photosynthetic\napparatus\
    \ (Zhou et al. [16], Magney et al. [40], Garbulsky et al. [41], Wong and Gamon\
    \ [42],\nZhang et al. [43], Gamon et al. [44], Massonnet et al. [45] and Pedrol\
    \ et al. [46]). For\noptimization of tomato productivity, adequate and well-planned\
    \ irrigation scheduling\nis required to ensure adequate water supply during the\
    \ entire growth cycle. It is very\nnecessary to make very good irrigation scheduling\
    \ management decisions to reduce the\nimpact of global warming, climate change,\
    \ drought, and the high competition of other\nwater users on the high demand of\
    \ the limited availability of freshwater resources for irri-\ngation. According\
    \ to Afzal et al. [47], precise irrigation scheduling is essential to optimize\n\
    irrigation water use, improve crop yield, and avoid excessive irrigation that\
    \ may result in\nyield, water loss [4], or leaching of agricultural nutrients\
    \ that would degrade soil and water.\nHowever, implementation of this novel strategy\
    \ requires accurate information on plant\nwater status [38,48,49]. This study\
    \ focuses on estimating water stress on tomato growth in\ndifferent soils at different\
    \ ﬁeld capacity (FC%) using greenness vegetation indices, water\nindices, and\
    \ photochemical indices and comparing it with crop water stress indicators\n(LT\
    \ ◦C, RLWC, LAI, LCC) and yield. Results from this study have proven a strong\
    \ correla-\ntion between the water stress indicators and vegetation indices (VI’s)\
    \ obtained from ASD\nhyperspectral reﬂectance for estimating water stress in tomatoes\
    \ grown in different soil\ntexture types and has clearly explained and offered\
    \ hypothetical management decisions\nfor optimizing water productivity and rapid\
    \ identiﬁcation of water stress in greenhouse\ntomato cultivation.\n2. Materials\

    \ Water Stress Treatment\nIrrigation water was applied through a gravity-driven\
    \ drip system, with a discharge of\n1.2 L/h, and the ﬂow rates were calibrated\
    \ in the ﬁeld. Water stress treatment was applied\nbased on the soil ﬁeld capacity.\
    \ Soil moisture content (SMC) in each pot was continuously\nmeasured with soil\
    \ moisture sensors Time Domain Reﬂectometers (TDR). The water stress\ntreatment\
    \ levels for each treatment used were 70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60% FC, and\n\
    40–50% FC. The upper irrigation and lower irrigation thresholds were set at 10%\
    \ depletion\nof soil FC% for each treatment. The volumetric soil water content\
    \ and the observed soil\nmoisture content measured by a Time Domain Reﬂectometry\
    \ (IMKO. TRIME. PICO TDR\nHD2 64) every 12 h before and after irrigating the plants\
    \ was used to determine the soil\nmoisture content before water application. The\
    \ probes of TDR were inserted throughout\nthe soil medium in the bucket at a depth\
    \ of 30 cm. The volume of water applied to soil\nto bring the soil back to ﬁeld\
    \ capacity was calculated based on the following equation by\nHamouda et al. (2019),\n\
    I = Q + (SWC − AWC) × DSM\nA\n× 1000,\n(1)\nwhere I is the irrigation water (mm),\
    \ Q is the volume of ponding water (mm), SWC is the\nsaturated water content of\
    \ the soil (%), AWC is the actual water of the soil when irrigating\n(%), DSM\
    \ is the dry soil mass (kg), and A which is the area of a truncated cone is given\
    \ by\nthe equation\nA = π\n\x10\nR2 + r2\x11\n+ π(R + r)\nq\nh2 + (R − r)2,\n\
    (2)\nwhere: R is the radius of the bottom base; r is the radius of the top base\
    \ and h is the slant\nheight of the truncated cone. High-quality irrigation water\
    \ was applied through a drip\nsystem, with emitters placed in each pot. Water\
    \ stress treatment was introduced 2 weeks\nafter transplanting based on soil %\
    \ FC.\n2.3. Soil Water Content Measurement\nSoil water content was measured using\
    \ the TDR and the Gravimetric technique. These\ntwo techniques measured different\
    \ values of soil water content for the same soil type at\nthe same ﬁeld capacity.\
    \ A correlation was used to establish a relationship between the\nTDR readings\
    \ and the gravimetric reading to give a good reﬂection of Available Soil Water\n\
    Content (AWC) for the two soils used for the experiment to maintain continuous\
    \ and\nconstant FC% for each treatment [50]. The comparison of TDR probe moisture\
    \ values\nand gravimetric moisture values plotted against each other revealed\
    \ a very high correla-\nSensors 2021, 21, 5705\n5 of 17\ntion between TDR probe\
    \ moisture values and gravimetric moisture values estimated in\nthe laboratory.\n\
    2.4. Plant Nutrition and Pest and Diseases Management\nFertilizer applications\
    \ were performed twice during the planting season (on the\n20 November onset of\
    \ the vegetative stage) with 20-20-20 N-P-K water-soluble fertilizer,\nat a rate\
    \ of 3.5 kg of N per hectare for both soils due to the high levels of NPK already\n\
    available in the soil. This was changed to calcium nitrate after the ﬁrst fruits\
    \ were noticed\nand later changed to potassium nitrate during the fruits’ expansion\
    \ stage. Organic pesticide\n(neem oil plus emulsifying soap) was applied in a\
    \ ratio of 2:1 in 15 L of water biweekly.\nWeeds were handpicked from pots and\
    \ woven polyethylene plastic mulch was used to\ncontrol weeds on the greenhouse\
    \ ﬂoor.\n2.5. Field Measurements\nPlant biotic stress was based on the physiological\
    \ parameters of the plant and this\nwas measured at each growth stage of the growth\
    \ cycle (vegetative stage, anthesis stage,\nfruit development stage, and senescence\
    \ stage) for the two soil types that were used in\nthe experiment. Parameters\
    \ measured include leaf temperature (LT ◦C), leaf chlorophyll\ncontent (LCC),\
    \ leaf area index (LAI), and leaf relative water content (LRWC). Crop leaf\ntemperature\
    \ was measured with a Raytek® handheld non-contact infrared thermometer\nwith\
    \ an emissivity of 0.95 Wm−2 and a display resolution of 0.2 ◦C (0.5 ◦F). The\
    \ thermome-\nter was held 30 cm above the tomato leaf with the laser point set\
    \ at an angle of 90◦ to\nthe horizontal [4,51]. Infrared thermometer measurements\
    \ were taken at each growth\nstage of the tomato growth cycle on ﬁve sampled plants\
    \ in each treatment block. Leaf\ntemperatures were measured at four viewing directions\
    \ (north, south, east, and west) and\naverage temperatures for each treatment\
    \ were calculated. Temperature readings were taken\nbetween 11:00 a.m. and 2:00\
    \ p.m. to ensure maximum sunlight intensity in the greenhouse\nand on the plants’\
    \ leaves as recommended by Ihuoma and Madramootoo [4]. Leaf relative\nwater content\
    \ (LRWC) was measured at each stage of plant growth by sampling young\nand fully\
    \ expanded leaves from 4 plants in each treatment. The leaf samples were enclosed\n\
    in a plastic zip bag and kept in a cooling chamber at 5 ◦C and transported to\
    \ the laboratory.\nFresh weight (FW) was recorded using an electronic scale and\
    \ the weight was recorded.\nSamples were immersed in distilled water for 72 h,\
    \ blotted, and weighed to obtain the\nturgid weight (TW). Finally, leaf samples\
    \ were dried at a temperature of 72 ◦C in an oven,\nuntil constant dry weight\
    \ (DW) was achieved. Leaf relative water content was calculated\nusing the equation\
    \ by [4,18,52],\nLRWC = (FM − DM)\n(TM − DM) × 100,\n(3)\nwhere, LRWC% = Leaf\
    \ Relative Water Content, FM = fresh leaf mas, DM = dry leaf mass,\nTM = turgid\
    \ leaf mass\nLeaf chlorophyll content was measured using a Handheld Konica Minolta\
    \ SPAD 502\nchlorophyll meter. SPAD measurements were taken on the newest fully\
    \ expanded leaf at\neach growth stage of the tomato growth stage. Reading was\
    \ taken on a designated leaf\non all plants approximately half the distance of\
    \ each leaf and halfway between the leaf\nedge [29,53]. SPAD data was converted\
    \ to N-sufﬁciency Index using a plant with no water\nstress as the reference plant\
    \ using the equation by [54]\nNSI =\nSPADtarget\nSPADre f erence\n,\n(4)\nLeaf\
    \ Area Index (LAI) was determined using the destructive method, all leaves were\n\
    removed separately from sampled plants (4 plants) from each treatment at each\
    \ growth\nstage of tomato growth, and 12 to 20 leaves were collected per plant.\
    \ Leaves were placed\nSensors 2021, 21, 5705\n6 of 17\ninto a rectangular sketch\
    \ of white paper. Leaf area was calculated using grid or graph\npaper technique,\
    \ a linear regression model of leaf area (LA) developed [23]. The leaf area of\n\
    the tomato was related to variable leaf dimensions (LL and LW) using an equation\
    \ by [23]\nLA = 0.00409 ×\n\x12\n192.68 ×\n\x12 LL\n100\n\x13\n×\n\x12 LW\n100\n\

    \ by one plant\nin the cropped area.\n2.6. Hyperspectral Data Acquisition and\
    \ Processing\nHyperspectral remote sensing is the measurement of reflected radiance\
    \ on the narrow\ncontinuous spectral bands over the full visible and solar reflective\
    \ spectrum. Tomato leave\nreflectance was measured using Analytical Spectral Device\
    \ (ASD) Field Spec 4 (FS4), a non-\nimage spectrometer. The spectral range of\
    \ this highly resolving device covers wavelengths\nbetween 350 and 2500 nm, spectral\
    \ resolution varying from 3 to 700 nm in the very short\nand 10 to 1400/2100 nm\
    \ in the further wavelengths, with a sampling interval of 1.4 nm at\n350–1050\
    \ nm and 2 nm at 1000–2500 nm, which has a scanning time of 100 milliseconds.\
    \ This\nhyperspectral device (ASD) has stray light specification of VNIR 0.02%,\
    \ SWIR 1 and 2 is 0.01%,\nwavelength reproducibility 0.1 nm, wavelength accuracy\
    \ 0.5 nm, maximum radiance VNIR\n2× Solar, SWIR 10× Solar. The device records\
    \ spectra based on the information of 2151 bands.\nThe ASD has three detectors\
    \ which include 1. VNIR detector (350–1000 nm):512 element\nsilicon array; 2.\
    \ SWIR 1 detector (1000–1800 nm): Graded Index InGaAs Photodiode, TE\nCooled;\
    \ 3. SWIR 1 detector (1800–2500 nm): Graded Index InGaAs Photodiode, TE Cooled.\n\
    Each detector has noise equivalent radiance (NEdL) of 1.0 × 10−9 W/cm2 /nm/sr\
    \ at 700 nm,\n1.2 × 10−9 W/cm2 /nm/sr at 1400nm, and 1.9 × 10−9 W/cm2 /nm/sr at\
    \ 2100 nm, respec-\ntively. The ASD with an input of 1.5 m fiber-optic (25◦ field\
    \ of view) with an optional narrow\nfield of view fiber optics was calibrated\
    \ for tomato leaf reflectance measurement using the\nreflectance from a whiteboard\
    \ (Spectralon panel). The pistol was focused perpendicular to\nthe plant leaf\
    \ at a target distance of 100 cm to achieve a ground area of 44 cm in diameter.\
    \ This\nwas performed following the recommendation of Danner et al. (2015) (24).\
    \ The instrument\nwas controlled on an IBM Lenovo intel® Core™ 2 Duo CPU T7100@1.80\
    \ GHz, 1.79 GHz,\n0.97 GB of RAM. With windows® 7 64-bit. ViewSpec Pro was used\
    \ to process reflectance\ndata gathered by the RS3 software.\nSpectral Vegetative\
    \ Indices\nNarrow-band spectral vegetation indices (SVI’s) which have revealed\
    \ the possibility\nfor evaluating the characteristics of vegetation parameters\
    \ related to plant physiology, mor-\nphology, and biochemistry were preselected\
    \ for analysis. These spectral transformations\nof two or more bands designed\
    \ to enhance the contribution of vegetation properties have\nreliable spatial\
    \ and temporal intercomparisons of crops’ photosynthetic activity and canopy\n\
    structural variations. It is a very powerful tool in assessing changing climate\
    \ or global\nwarming. The VIs used in this study were grouped into three, which\
    \ include (i) greenness\nvegetation indices, (ii) water content vegetation indices,\
    \ and (iii) photochemical vegetation\nindices. Four greenness vegetation indices\

    One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences between crop water\n\
    stress indicators (leaf temperature (LT ◦C), relative leaf water content (RLWC)\
    \ %, leaf\nchlorophyll content (LCC) mg g−1, and leaf area index (LAI) m2/m2)\
    \ of the tomato plant\nand spectral vegetative indices (VIs) (NDVI, mNDVI750,\
    \ RDVI, CLGREEN, WI, WBI, SRWI,\nNDWI, NDWI1640, NDWI2130, and PRI among treatments\
    \ and blocks. IBM SPSS Statistics\n21 package was used for the statistical analysis.\
    \ Pearson correlation coefﬁcient in a two-\ntailed test of signiﬁcance was used\
    \ to describe the effect of soil ﬁeld capacities of the two\nsoil types on tomato\
    \ because they were continuous scale variables that were also normally\ndistributed.\
    \ The correlation assumes a value of (−1 and +1) which explains the variance\n\
    in data concerning water stress. A negative value means perfect negative correlation,\
    \ a\npositive value means perfect positive correlation. One-way analysis of variance\
    \ (ANOVA)\nwas conducted and Fisher’s Least Signiﬁcant Difference was used to\
    \ separate the signiﬁcant\ndifferences among treatments at 0.001, 0.01, and 0.05\
    \ signiﬁcant levels. Linear regression\nanalysis was used to determine the relationship\
    \ between spectral reﬂectance variables\nand water stress indicators in a bivariate\
    \ analysis in a two-tailed test run in IBM SPSS\nstatistic 21.\n3. Results\n3.1.\

    \ Content Measurement\nThe soil water content measured in this study revealed\
    \ a strong positive correlation\nbetween TDR moisture values measured in the ﬁeld\
    \ and gravimetric moisture values\nestimated in the laboratory for sandy loam\
    \ and silty loam soils. The correlation coefﬁcient\nSensors 2021, 21, 5705\n12\
    \ of 17\nturned out to be R2 = 0.9628 for sandy loam soil and R2 = 0.9212 for\
    \ silty loam soils. As\na result of the statistical analysis, the relationship\
    \ between the gravimetric method and\nthe TDR measurements was found to be signiﬁcant\
    \ (p < 0.05). The result of the analysis\nsuggested that there was a strong relationship\
    \ among the measurements. The ﬁndings of the\npresent study are similar to the\
    \ studies conducted by Abdullah et al. [50], Berni et al. [56],\nChung et al.\
    \ [57], Tanriverdi [58] and Degirmenci et al. [59] who reported that there\nwas\
    \ a strong relationship between the gravimetric and TDR measurement methods at\n\
    R2 = 0.8–0.98 (p < 0.05). According to Liu et al. [34], Topp [60], Matema [61],\
    \ Sun and\nYoung [62], a strong relationship between the gravimetric soil moisture\
    \ measurement\nand that of the TDR equipment yielded very good results in determining\
    \ the soil water\ncontent and the difference between the measurements performed\
    \ by gravimetric and TDR\nequipment was found to be statistically signiﬁcant in\
    \ terms of reducing labor and time\n(p < 0.01) [58]. Due to the strong correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient between the gravimetric water\ncontent and TDR water content value,\
    \ TDR equipment can be straightforwardly used\nin measuring soil water content\
    \ in sandy loam and silty loam soils to save a signiﬁcant\namount of time and\
    \ labor as compared to the gravimetric measurement method, which is\nlaborious\
    \ and very destructive [50,59,63–65].\n4.2. Effect of Water Stress on Ec and Yield\n\
    The changes in water content and the resultant increase in Ec between the wetting\n\
    and drying periods were relatively minor. However, soil electrical conductivity\
    \ (Ec) in-\ncreased with reducing soil AWC. Water stress treatments applied in\
    \ this study caused a\nreasonable to severe stress on the plants at each growth\
    \ stage. High water stress resulted\nin high Ec levels which affected plant water\
    \ uptake from the soil, hence reducing the\ntranspiration rate of the leaves,\
    \ leaf photosynthetic efﬁciency, and crop yields. According\nto Nemeskéri et al.\
    \ [66], in limited water supply conditions, plants reduce the intensity of\ntranspiration\
    \ and close stomata. As a result, the canopy temperature starts to rise. Tomato\n\
    crop exposed to 40–50% FC treatment recorded the lowest crop yield (yield loss\
    \ of 70.3\nand 67.1%) and high Ec value of 2.6 and 3.0 µs for sandy loam and silty\
    \ loam, respectively,\ncompared to the highest yield obtained from the 70–100%\
    \ FC treatment for both sandy loam\nand silty loam soils. However, high water\
    \ stress had signiﬁcant effects on soil Ec (salinity)\nand tomato yields in this\
    \ experiment as shown in Figure 3. Results from this research\nare similar to\
    \ the results of Zhang et al. [13], Liu et al. [34], Mohamed and EL-Aziz [66],\n\
    Nemeskéri et al. [67], who reported that induction of severe water stress signiﬁcantly\n\
    reduces the yield of tomato plants. Nemeskéri et al. [14], Chen et al. [33], Patanè\
    \ et al. [68],\nPék et al. [69], Helyes et al. [70], also reported that the best\
    \ marketable yields of tomato are\nalways reached with the highest water supply\
    \ rate. The highest marketable yields recorded\nin this study were under the 70–100%\
    \ FC water stress treatment (full irrigation) with a\nvalue of 170 t/ha and 135\
    \ t/ha for sandy loam and silty loam soils, respectively, which is\nno different\
    \ from the ﬁndings of Takács et al. [71] and Lu et al. [72], who suggest that\
    \ the\nrate of regulated deﬁcit irrigation should be no less than 50% of water\
    \ demand because,\nunder this level, the water stress is too severe. However,\
    \ water stress treatment had a\nstrong correlation with crop yield (R2= 0.9758\
    \ and 0.9816 p < 0.01) for sandy loam and silty\nloam soils, respectively, and\
    \ also had a strong correlation with Ec (R2 = 0.9651, p < 0.01).\nThis was conﬁrmed\
    \ by Ihuoma and Madramootoo [4] in narrow-band reﬂectance indices\nfor mapping\
    \ the combined effects of water and nitrogen stress in ﬁeld-grown tomato crops.\n\
    The result rationalizes the need for adequate application of water concerning\
    \ the soil type\nand FC% to enhance the productivity of tomatoes. Ihuoma and Madramootoo\
    \ [4], also\nsuggested that effects of prolonged water and nitrogen stress might\
    \ have induced structural\nand morphological changes in the plants, such as changes\
    \ in leaf structure, shape, and leaf\nthickness, which might be the cause of reducing\
    \ yield. Gitelson et al. [29], Zhang et al. [43],\nNemeskéri et al. [14,67], Patanè\
    \ et al. [68], Takács et al. [71], and Chakroun et al. [73], also\nreported a\
    \ signiﬁcant correlation between water stress and plant yield, biomass, leaf area\n\
    index, and chlorophyll content, which is consistent with the results of this study.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 5705\n13 of 17\n4.3. Vegetation Indices versus Water Stress\
    \ Indicators and Yield\nThe imposed water stress treatments in this study were\
    \ very adequate to help estimate\ncrop water status for the advancement and authentication\
    \ of spectral reﬂectance indices\nto detect water stress in tomatoes. This study\
    \ revealed that NDVI and RDVI were the\ngreenness vegetative indices that had\
    \ the best correlation with water stress indicators,\nleaf temperature (LT ◦C),\
    \ RLWC, LAI, and yield for sandy loam and silty loam soils.\nFinding by Ihuoma\
    \ and Madramootoo [4] also conﬁrmed that NDVI and RDVI revealed\na good correlation\
    \ with yield and chlorophyll content in estimating crop water stress.\nThe relationship\
    \ between NDVI, RDVI, and water stress indicators may be due to the\ndynamics\
    \ of plant canopy parameters. The results from this study were also in agreement\n\
    with the ﬁndings of Ustin et al. [5], Gao [6], Katsoulas et al. [8], and Sakamoto\
    \ et al. [30],\nwho reported that narrow-band and broad-band indices for assessing\
    \ crop water status\nare very sensitive to water stress. The high correlation\
    \ between NDVI, RDVI, and water\nstress indicator was also conﬁrmed in the ﬁndings\
    \ of Mzid et al. [35], Rouse et al. [36],\nWittamperuma et al. [74] and Tittebrand\
    \ and Spank [75]. NDVI and RDVI, according to\nUstin et al. [5] and Zarco-Tejada\
    \ and Ustin [17], are the most popular SVI for biophysical\nparameter retrieval,\
    \ and are very sensitive in water stress and chlorophyll estimation. In\naddition,\
    \ WI, NDWI, and NDWI1640 were the water index vegetation indices that had a\n\
    high correlation with water stress indicators used in this study for both soil\
    \ types. This\nhigh correlation can be explained by the band length (reﬂectance\
    \ near 980 or 1240 nm)\nwhich corresponds to strong water absorption and the reﬂectance\
    \ near 860 nm provides\nthe datum for comparing spectra. However, WI, NDWI measure\
    \ plant water content that\nis mostly held in the leaves that is actual liquid\
    \ water in leaves instead of vapor. The\nresults are in agreement with Ustin et\
    \ al. [5], Gao [6], Katsoulas et al. [8], Zarco-Tejada\nand Ustin [17], Chen et\
    \ al. [33] and Huete et al. [76]. PRInorm was the photochemical\nvegetation index\
    \ that showed a high correlation with all the vegetation. The correlation\nbetween\
    \ PRInorm and water stress indicators can be explained by the interactions among\n\
    the eco-physiological indicators of plant water stress, as explained by Zhang\
    \ et al. [9],\nMagney et al. [40], Garbulsky et al. [41], Wong and Gamon [42],\
    \ and Gamon et al. [44].\nHowever, PRI570 and water stress indicators had a fairly\
    \ good relationship by improving\non the sensitivity of detecting water stress\
    \ in tomatoes. Equally, this study has shown that\nall vegetation indices showed\
    \ a correlation with water stress indicators but NDVI, RDVI,\nWI, NDWI, NDW1640,\
    \ PRI570, and PRInorm were the best suited for water stress detection in\ngreenhouse\
    \ tomato production. The results suggest these VIs was not signiﬁcantly affected\n\
    by changes in environmental factors.\n5. Conclusions\nThis study assessed very\
    \ high-resolution narrow-band hyperspectral thermal imagery\nacquired from tomato\
    \ growth using ASD SPEC 4 in an experiment comprising four water\nstress treatments\
    \ (70–100, 60–70, 50–60, 40–50% FC) in sandy loam and silty loam soils for\ncrop\
    \ water stress assessment. However, the use of reﬂectance indices for sensing\
    \ the effects\nof water stress in tomato plants at different growth stages in\
    \ sandy loam and silty loam\nsoils revealed that plants grown in each of these\
    \ soils have different spectral signatures at\nthe different growth stages but\
    \ displayed similar trends. Quantifying crop leaf water status\nwith remote sensing\
    \ from the spatial and temporal resolutions it provides imparts highly\nvalued\
    \ information for making good irrigation management decisions towards optimizing\n\
    crop productivity. Testing different spectral reﬂectance indices between 531 to\
    \ 2130 nm\nto estimate water stress in tomato growth by comparing various reﬂectance\
    \ indices and\ntheir relationship with water stress indicators showed that the\
    \ NDVI, RDVI, WI, NDWI,\nNDWI1640, PRI570, and PRInorm were the most sensitive\
    \ indices for detecting water stress\nwithin all the growth stages. This implies\
    \ that spectra reﬂectance from 531 to 1640 nm band\ndepth is ideal for estimating\
    \ water stress in tomato growth in sandy loam and silty loam\nsoils in a greenhouse.\
    \ This technique is capable of timely and accurately estimating actual\ncrop water\
    \ status from leaves to scheduling irrigation (date of irrigation, and the speciﬁc\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 5705\n14 of 17\ncrop that requires the water). This technique\
    \ is also unique in determining the onset of\nwater stress in crops grown in sandy\
    \ loam and silty loam soils. In this study, these VIs have\naccurately estimated\
    \ water stress in tomato growth in sandy loam and silty loam soils in a\ngreenhouse\
    \ even though the relationships between water stress indicators and the selected\n\
    indexes were high. Further studies on tomato growth in different agroecological\
    \ zones\nneed to be conducted. This was beyond the scope of this study.\nAuthor\

  analysis: "The paper attempts to use remote sensing and crop models for estimating\
    \ evapotranspiration of an almond and pistachio orchard. The primary approach\
    \ they use is to connect a dual crop-coefficient approach and a water stress coefficient\
    \ to crop-related parameters derived from remote sensing. The Kc term is estimated\
    \ from fIPARd which is derived from remote sensing NDVI data and LAI measurements.\
    \ The water stress coefficient is estimated by using canopy temperature data collected\
    \ from aircrafts and regressions with stem water potential. The combination of\
    \ these three parameters and reference evapotranspiration is used to estimate\
    \ daily actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa). The paper uses a simple 2-source\
    \ energy balance approach for comparison. Model results are compared with daily\
    \ ETa derived from eddy covariance and surface renewal measurements, finding R2\
    \ values greater than 0.7 for all cases and RMSE less than 1.0 mm/day for all\
    \ but one case (pistachio using surface renewal for an RMSE of 0.91). \n\nThe\
    \ novelty of the approach is that it combines aspects of simple vegetation indices\
    \ (NDVI), canopy temperature, and stem water potential to estimate three different\
    \ parameters of a fairly simple ETa model. The model could be applied at a field\
    \ scale as all data are collected at the same time and spatial resolution. Many\
    \ of the parameters are also derived from publicly available satellite data, which\
    \ makes the application more feasible.\n\nThe first limitation is the lack of\
    \ spatial information in the derived parameters. There is no discussion as to\
    \ the spatial representativeness of the collected thermal data. While the NDVI\
    \ is derived from Landsat data, several of the parameters are currently only collected\
    \ at a field scale for research purposes. Making this approach operational would\
    \ require the spatial collection of canopy temperature and stem water potential.\n\
    \nThe second limitation is that the regressions between canopy temperature and\
    \ stem water potential for estimating the Ks coefficient are very empirical and\
    \ not well explained. It is not clear how well these regressions would perform\
    \ across different sites and years. The study was conducted for a single year\
    \ with non-water-limiting conditions, so the water stress coefficients are limited\
    \ to these conditions.\n\nThe third limitation is that the comparisons with eddy\
    \ covariance and surface renewal are collected at a single field location. There\
    \ is no comparison of spatial variability of measured vs. modeled ETa, which could\
    \ lead to erroneous conclusions on the validity of the approach across a field\
    \ or orchard. \n\nDespite these limitations, the paper provides a valuable proof-of-concept\
    \ for a remote sensing based approach for estimating ETa that can be used to guide\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Additional work should be done to address the limitations\
    \ mentioned above, such as testing across sites, conditions, and spatial scales."

    \ As competition for water resources increases\ndue to growth in population, California’s\
    \ tree nut farmers are committed to improving the efﬁciency\nof water used for\
    \ food production. There is an imminent need to have reliable methods that provide\n\
    information about the temporal and spatial variability of crop water requirements,\
    \ which allow\nfarmers to make irrigation decisions at ﬁeld scale. This study\
    \ focuses on estimating the actual\nevapotranspiration and crop coefﬁcients of\
    \ an almond and pistachio orchard located in Central Valley\n(California) during\
    \ an entire growing season by combining a simple crop evapotranspiration model\n\
    with remote sensing data. A dataset of the vegetation index NDVI derived from\
    \ Landsat-8 was used\nto facilitate the estimation of the basal crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kcb), or potential crop water use. The soil water\nevaporation coefﬁcient (Ke)\
    \ was measured from microlysimeters. The water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) was\nderived\
    \ from airborne remotely sensed canopy thermal-based methods, using seasonal regressions\n\
    between the crop water stress index (CWSI) and stem water potential (Ψstem). These\
    \ regressions were\nstatistically-signiﬁcant for both crops, indicating clear\
    \ seasonal differences in pistachios, but not in\nalmonds. In almonds, the estimated\
    \ maximum Kcb values ranged between 1.05 to 0.90, while for\npistachios, it ranged\
    \ between 0.89 to 0.80. The model indicated a difference of 97 mm in transpiration\n\
    over the season between both crops. Soil evaporation accounted for an average\
    \ of 16% and 13%\nof the total actual evapotranspiration for almonds and pistachios,\
    \ respectively. Veriﬁcation of the\nmodel-based daily crop evapotranspiration\
    \ estimates was done using eddy-covariance and surface\nrenewal data collected\

    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n2 of 22\n1. Introduction\nThe State of California\
    \ (CA) has the greatest production of tree nut crops worldwide. Among\nthem, almond\
    \ acreage is estimated at 940,000 bearing acres and represents a 5.2-billion-dollar\
    \ industry,\nwith around 1 million tons produced in 2016. CA also produces 98%\
    \ of the pistachios in the United\nStates and is the second largest producer worldwide\
    \ with more than 240,000 acres planted producing\nover 0.27 million tons of pistachios\
    \ per year [1,2]. Most of these two nut crops are planted in the\nCentral Valley,\
    \ a region with a hot Mediterranean climate in which agricultural and environmental\n\
    needs, along with the increasing demand of a growing population, to compete for\
    \ their share of the\nlimited water resources.\nAlmonds and pistachios are two\
    \ high-value crops that have a reputation of being drought tolerant,\nproducing\
    \ modest yields with very little water [3,4]. However, irrigation is critical\
    \ in producing high\nyields of top quality nuts [5,6]. Some research studies agreed\
    \ that water productivity in almond and\npistachio is around 2.4 and 3.6 kg·m3,\
    \ respectively [7,8]. To produce just these two crops, California\nneeds around\
    \ 1.7 billion m3 of water per year. Because water resources are becoming scarce\
    \ in CA\nand drought periods trend to be more frequent and of longer duration\
    \ [9], there is an urgent need\nto continue to reduce water use during agricultural\
    \ production. The historic drought from 2012 to\n2016 increased grower awareness\
    \ of efﬁcient water use practices and therefore forced them to put\ninto practice\
    \ irrigation water-saving strategies (e.g., regulated deﬁcit irrigation). However,\
    \ in order\nto determine optimal irrigation scheduling and to adopt such strategies\
    \ efﬁciently, it is necessary to\nhave reliable methods that provide information\
    \ about the temporal and spatial variability of crop\nwater requirements and,\
    \ to understand the seasonal physiological responses to water stress. Therefore,\n\
    the need for developing simple crop evapotranspiration (ET) modeling approaches\
    \ with the inclusion\nof water stress indicators is required to quantify stress\
    \ under deﬁcit irrigation (DI) applications and for\nscheduling irrigation [10].\n\
    Remote sensing data has been widely used in the assessment of crop ET and crop\
    \ water stress\nto obtain spatial information. Reﬂectance-derived vegetation indices\
    \ (VI) such as the normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI), have been empirically\
    \ regressed with basal crop coefﬁcients (Kcb)\nand applied to a reference ET (ETo)\
    \ to estimate crop water use, such as with FAO56 [11,12]. Although\nsimple and\
    \ widely-applied, this method may be too simplistic for crops undergoing deﬁcit-irrigation\n\
    scheduling because it only accounts for the potential evapotranspiration that\
    \ a crop would have with\nno modiﬁcation in stomatal conductance or crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kc) due to water stress. In addition, these\ntechniques assume that variations\
    \ in potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc) are linearly related to\ncanopy size,\
    \ and are not sensitive to crop phenology and canopy architecture [13]. Other\
    \ techniques\nare based on combining both thermal and optical data to directly\
    \ obtain actual crop evapotranspiration\n(ETa) through energy balance models [14–16].\
    \ Although these models are able to estimate ETa\nwith ﬁne accuracy, they have\
    \ limitations because they require the retrieval of a large number of\nphysical\
    \ parameters and modeling options. In addition, some of these models, such as\
    \ mapping\nevapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration\
    \ (METRIC) [17] or the simpliﬁed\nsurface energy balance (SEBAL) [18] model are\
    \ sensitive to the deﬁnition of hot (zero transpiration) and\ncold (potential\
    \ transpiration) pixels, which can lead to user subjectivity in deﬁning those\
    \ anchor pixels.\nWhen moderate crop water stress is imposed, ETa drops below\
    \ ETc. Traditionally, the adoption\nof DI strategies have been beneﬁcial for fruit\
    \ and nut tree species to increase water productivity and\nfruit quality [8,19–21].\
    \ DI aims at the partial replacement of water lost to ETc in order to reach speciﬁc\n\
    water deﬁcit thresholds in the soil and plant. However, when dealing with DI in\
    \ commercial orchards,\nimplementing a water deﬁcit based solely on the ETa/ETc\
    \ ratio may contain signiﬁcant errors. These\nerrors are due to (a) possible inaccuracies\
    \ on ETa and ETc estimations, (b) the lack of knowledge on\nthe particular thresholds\
    \ below which there is a reduction of transpiration due to water stress, and (c)\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n3 of 22\nthe difﬁculty of achieving a spatially-homogenous,\
    \ targeted soil, or plant water status across the\norchard [22]. Spatial differences\
    \ in soil type and depth, canopy architecture, and fruit load contribute\nto variations\
    \ in plant water status within the orchard. In addition, the relative insensitivity\
    \ of canopy\nETa to stomatal closure suggests that approaches based on energy\
    \ balance models currently used to\nestimate ETa may fail to detect plant water\
    \ stress [23]. Therefore, a sensitive physiological indicator\nthat integrates\
    \ both soil and climatic conditions, and can quantify the impact of stomatal closure\n\
    on ETa is required in order to determine the inﬂuence of environmental and cultural\
    \ conditions on\nplant water status. For this reason, some researchers argue that\
    \ plant-based approaches, whereby\nplant water status threshold values are imposed,\
    \ are preferable to ET-based approaches. Among\nthem, midday stem water potential\
    \ (Ψstem) has been commonly used as a precise plant water status\nindicator [24–26].\
    \ Nevertheless, due to major inconveniences in measuring Ψstem manually at large\n\
    scales, new approaches based on thermal remote sensing imagery have been successfully\
    \ developed\nto estimate Ψstem in woody crops [27–29]. These approaches regress\
    \ Ψstem with the crop water stress\nindex (CWSI), which is a function of leaf\
    \ temperature and can also be deﬁned as (1 − ETa/ETc) [30,31].\nTherefore, our\
    \ hypothesis is that since Ψstem has been successfully regressed with CWSI in\
    \ many\ndifferent crops, the seasonal regressions of CWSI-Ψstem for almond and\
    \ pistachio trees, obtained from\nairborne thermal imagery, can be used to assess\
    \ a water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) that can be assimilated\ninto an empirically-based\
    \ ET model. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility\n\
    of using this simple ET-based model to estimate ETa of an almond and pistachio\
    \ orchard during an\nentire growing season by combining multispectral and thermal\
    \ remote sensing imagery. Veriﬁcation of\nthe estimates of Kc and ETa will be\
    \ achieved using data obtained with the eddy covariance and surface\nrenewal methods.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Site\nThe study site was located in Madera\
    \ County, Central Valley, California, a few kilometers north of\nthe San Joaquin\
    \ River (36◦49′15.85”N, 120◦12′1.20”W; Figure 1). The climate in the region is\
    \ typically\nMediterranean with average annual high and low temperatures of 24.2\
    \ and 9.2 ◦C, respectively,\nand an average precipitation (1928–2010) of 311 mm\
    \ that falls predominantly during the winter season\n(November–March). In 2016,\
    \ the mean annual temperature, accumulated precipitation and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) were 16.7 ◦C, 300 and 1357 mm, respectively. Daily maximum solar radiation\n\
    (Rs) in the area was 347 W·m−2 (DOY 187). Soil is classiﬁed as a deep sandy loam\
    \ (6–14% clay,\n67–78% sand), moderate to well drained soils that formed in sandy\
    \ alluvium from dominantly granitic\nrocks [32].\nTwo commercial nut orchards\
    \ were chosen to estimate crop evapotranspiration during the entire\ngrowing season\
    \ by using remote sensing. The ﬁrst, was an 18 year-old, 16-ha commercial almond\n\
    orchard. The orchard was planted with cv. Nonpareil and cv. Carmel, on alternating\
    \ rows with a dense\ncanopy and high coverage. Trees were planted at a spacing\
    \ distance of 5.5 m apart and with 7.3 m\ninter-row. Trees in adjacent rows were\
    \ offset by one half of the spacing distance. The irrigation system\nconsisted\
    \ of a single dripline connected to micro-sprinklers (Fan-Jet, Bowsmith, USA),\
    \ with a 3.5 m\nwetting radius. Each tree was irrigated at a rate of 38–45 L·h−1.\
    \ The second orchard was a 14-year-old,\n16 ha cv. Kerman cultivar pistachio orchard.\
    \ Trees were planted at a spacing distance of 5.2 m apart\nwith 5.8 m driveways\
    \ between tree rows. The irrigation system consisted on two drip lines of eight\n\
    drippers per tree with a discharge rate of 3.8 L·h−1. The amount of irrigation\
    \ water applied in the\nalmond and pistachio orchards during the growing season\
    \ was 898.0 and 762.5 mm, respectively.\nIrrigation in both orchards was scheduled\
    \ following the protocol of the nut company. The almond\norchard was irrigated\
    \ weekly with a timing ranging from 2 (beginning of the season) to 70 hours/week\n\
    (after harvest of cv. Nonpareil). From August through mid-September, the almond\
    \ orchard was dried\nfor periods of 14 days to enable harvest. In pistachio, irrigation\
    \ periods ranged from 5 (beginning of\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n4 of 22\n\
    the season) to 50 hours·week−1 (late July) and the orchard was dried for a period\
    \ of 13 days before\nharvest (early October).\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, x FOR PEER\

    \ carry out ﬁeld measurements. Each plot contained\nfour rows of six trees, and\
    \ measurements were taken from the four central trees in the two middle rows\n\
    of each plot (Figure 2). All the other trees in the plot were guard trees. During\

    \ plots were in addition to the higher canopy coverage of the\nprimary orchard\
    \ study plots and allowed us to better understand the relationship between the\
    \ NDVI\nand canopy light interception over a range of canopy sizes.\nThe volume\
    \ of water applied in the orchard was measured daily by installing into the dripline\
    \ of\neach plot a water meter pulse sensor connected to a CR1000 (Campbell Scientiﬁc,\

    \ to\nvolumetric soil water content (θv) using a calibration curve that was determined\
    \ in a previous study\nconducted in the same orchards [33].\nMidday stem water\
    \ potential (Ψstem) was measured every one to two weeks during the\ngrowing season\
    \ in both orchards following the protocols described by McCutchan and Shackel\
    \ [34].\nAll measurements were taken within one hour of solar noon, with four\
    \ trees measured in each plot,\nas well as two additional measurements in the\

    \ in\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n5 of 22\nten trees in the additional water-stressed\
    \ plot. A pressure chamber (3005 series portable plant water\nstatus console;\
    \ Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used. Shaded leaves\
    \ were\nwrapped in plastic bags covered with aluminum foil for one hour prior\
    \ to the Ψstem measurement.\nThe fraction of the intercepted PAR (photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation) solar radiation (fIPAR) and\nleaf area index (LAI) were measured\
    \ following identical protocols for both orchards. Measurements\nwere conducted\
    \ at solar noon every two to four weeks throughout the year during the growing\
    \ season\nusing a portable ceptometer (AccuPAR model LP-80, Decagon Devices Inc.,\
    \ Pullman, WA, USA).\nIncident PAR above and below the canopy were measured for\
    \ each tree. The PAR intercepted by the\ncanopy (fIPAR) was calculated dividing\
    \ the averaged below canopy PAR (fIPAR below) by the incident\nPAR taken in full\
    \ sunlight at an open site with no interference from the canopy (fIPAR above).\
    \ Daily fIPAR\n(fIPARd) was calculated by using the hourly model of light interception\
    \ [35]. The parameter of porosity\nof Oyarzun’s model was estimated so that the\
    \ noon fIPAR value of the hourly simulation was equal to\nthat measured in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Tree structural parameters such as tree height, crown width perpendicular\
    \ to\nand along rows, and branch insertion height were also measured. fIPARd was\
    \ calculated by integrating\nthe diurnal course of simulated fIPAR. LAI was also\
    \ obtained from fIPARd, using the approach presented\nby Campbell and Norman [36]\
    \ and setting a leaf absorptivity for light at 0.9.\n2.3. Remote Sensing Data\n\
    A data set consisting of 25 dates of Landsat-8 Level 1 product images for atmospherically-corrected,\n\
    top of the canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) covering both\
    \ orchards was acquired\nfrom the USGS. The study orchards fall on two scenes,\
    \ path/row 42/35 and 43/34, which provided L8\ncoverage four times each month\
    \ for the period February to December 2016. The NDVI for each plot\nand date were\
    \ extracted from each image using the ArcGIS software (version 10.5.1). Then,\
    \ in order to\nremotely estimate fIPARd, the NDVI was regressed against fIPARd\
    \ and LAI measurements. In addition,\nthe NDVI of the adjacent orchards with younger\
    \ trees was also obtained and regressed with in-situ\nmeasurements of fIPARd.\
    \ These regressions were used to estimate the daily fraction of intercepted\n\
    radiation (fIPARd est) over a wider range of canopy closures throughout the growing\
    \ season and used as\ninput to the model.\nThe airborne thermal campaign consisted\
    \ of four ﬂights conducted on 17 May 2016 (DOY 138), 22\nJune 2016 (DOY 174),\
    \ 21 July 2016 (DOY 203) and 11 August 2016 (DOY 224). Image acquisition and\n\
    pre-processing were managed by Ceres Imaging (Oakland, CA, USA; www.ceresimaging.net).\
    \ Images\nwere acquired between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. (Paciﬁc Time, PST) (GTM-7)\
    \ with the thermal sensor FLIR\nA65 (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA). The\
    \ image resolution is 640 × 512 pixels, with a ﬁeld of\nview (FOV) of 45◦ × 37◦\
    \ using 13 mm lens. Spectral response was in the range of 7.5–13 µm. The spatial\n\
    resolutions differ between ﬂights and pixel size ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 meters,\
    \ due to differences in the\nﬂight altitude between dates, which varied from 500\
    \ to 1000 meters. These differences in pixel size\ndid not affect the extraction\
    \ of pure vegetation pixels, since crown area of both crops was signiﬁcantly\n\
    greater than the pixel size (Figure 2). In-situ temperature was measured for ground-based\
    \ calibration\ntargets with a portable IR-gun (Fluke 572 infrared thermometer,\
    \ Everett, WA, USA). As targets, we\nused black and white 2.4 × 2.4 m painted\
    \ panels and 2.0 × 2.0 m inexpensive textile sheets of cotton.\nIn addition, concurrent\
    \ with image collection, we took temperature measurements of asphalt, concrete,\n\
    bare soil, and a tomato ﬁeld located adjacent to the almond orchard. Image orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ was\ncompleted using ground control points (GCP). The GCP panels were divided\
    \ into quadrants and\npainted black and white in opposite corners. The position\
    \ of the center of each GCP was acquired\nwith a handheld GPS (Global Positioning\

    \ geo-rectiﬁcation was done with the software package ENVI 4.7.\nRemote Sens.\

    \ an eddy-covariance (EC) and surface renewal (SR) \nsystems. In both orchards,\
    \ the flux towers were located close to the experimental plots and facing \ninto\
    \ the predominant wind direction (west). Both the EC and SR systems were installed\
    \ in the \npistachio orchard, while only a SR was installed in the almond orchard.\
    \ In the pistachio orchard, the \nflux tower included the following instrumentation\
    \ at 6 m over the soil surface: Infrared Gas Analyzer \nIRGA (LI-7500, LI-COR\
    \ Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, \nCampbell\
    \ Scientific Inc. Logan, UT, USA); a REBS Q7.1 net radiometer (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, \nUSA); and two FW3 Type-E fine-wire thermocouples (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA). In addition, \nthe ground heat flux was measured using three\
    \ sets of HFP01-SC soil heat flux plates (Campbell Sci., \nLogan, UT, USA) and\
    \ soil temperature averaging sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, \n\
    UT, USA). The sensible heat flux (H) was obtained from the 3D sonic anemometer\
    \ on a half-hour \nbasis. Instrumentation in the almond orchard was installed\
    \ at 9 m above the ground and consisted of \nthe following: Kipp & Zonen NR Lite\
    \ 2 net radiometer, two FW3 Type-E fine-wire thermocouples \n(Campbell Sci., Logan,\
    \ UT, USA) and two non-contact SI-121 thermal-infrared radiometer sensors \n(IRTs)\
    \ (Apogee Instruments Inc., Logan, USA). The latter were installed at 1.5 m above\
    \ the canopy of \ntwo almond trees, positioned with a 45˚ angle and ensuring that\
    \ the targeted area was pure canopy \nvegetation. The sensor has a narrow 18˚\
    \ half-angle field of view and a response time of 0.6 seconds. \nWe used the same\
    \ instrumentation as in the pistachio orchard to measure the ground heat flux\
    \ in the \nalmond orchard. \nThe SR is an alternative and inexpensive approach\
    \ to EC for measuring sensible heat flux density \n(H) [37,38]. Although this\
    \ system requires only a fast-response air temperature sensor, it needs to be\
    \ \ncalibrated [37]. The calibration factor alpha is obtained from the slope of\
    \ the regression between a \nstandard H (generally taken as eddy covariance measurements)\
    \ forced through the origin versus \nuncalibrated surface renewal sensible heat\
    \ flux measurements [39]. In this study, the alpha weighting \nfactors (α) were\
    \ obtained from another flux tower installed in an almond orchard located in Belridge\
    \ \n(CA, USA) (35º30’25.47’’N, 119º40’04.99’’W). Almond tree from that orchard\
    \ were of similar age and \nstructural properties as those from our study site,\
    \ and α was obtained from available data of both EC \nand SR [23,40]. Monthly\
    \ averaged data for the period 2008–2011 was used to calibrate the H obtained\
    \ \nfrom the SR system installed in the almond orchard (Table 1). Latent heat\
    \ flux (LE) of both orchards \nwas then estimated as a residual of the energy\
    \ balance (LE=Rn-G-H). The averaged values of H and \nLE were calculated and recorded\
    \ with an output frequency of 30 min and converted to ETa (ETaobs) by \nFigure\

    Crop evapotranspiration was measured with an eddy-covariance (EC) and surface\
    \ renewal (SR)\nsystems. In both orchards, the ﬂux towers were located close to\
    \ the experimental plots and facing into\nthe predominant wind direction (west).\
    \ Both the EC and SR systems were installed in the pistachio\norchard, while only\
    \ a SR was installed in the almond orchard. In the pistachio orchard, the ﬂux\
    \ tower\nincluded the following instrumentation at 6 m over the soil surface:\
    \ Infrared Gas Analyzer IRGA\n(LI-7500, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), three-dimensional\
    \ sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell\nScientiﬁc Inc. Logan, UT, USA); a REBS Q7.1\
    \ net radiometer (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA); and two\nFW3 Type-E ﬁne-wire\
    \ thermocouples (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA). In addition, the ground heat\n\
    ﬂux was measured using three sets of HFP01-SC soil heat ﬂux plates (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA)\nand soil temperature averaging sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientiﬁc\
    \ Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The sensible\nheat ﬂux (H) was obtained from the 3D sonic\
    \ anemometer on a half-hour basis. Instrumentation in the\nalmond orchard was\
    \ installed at 9 m above the ground and consisted of the following: Kipp & Zonen\n\
    NR Lite 2 net radiometer, two FW3 Type-E ﬁne-wire thermocouples (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA)\nand two non-contact SI-121 thermal-infrared radiometer sensors\
    \ (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments Inc.,\nLogan, USA). The latter were installed at\
    \ 1.5 m above the canopy of two almond trees, positioned with\na 45◦ angle and\
    \ ensuring that the targeted area was pure canopy vegetation. The sensor has a\
    \ narrow\n18◦ half-angle ﬁeld of view and a response time of 0.6 seconds. We used\
    \ the same instrumentation as\nin the pistachio orchard to measure the ground\
    \ heat ﬂux in the almond orchard.\nThe SR is an alternative and inexpensive approach\
    \ to EC for measuring sensible heat ﬂux density\n(H) [37,38]. Although this system\
    \ requires only a fast-response air temperature sensor, it needs to\nbe calibrated\
    \ [37]. The calibration factor alpha is obtained from the slope of the regression\
    \ between\na standard H (generally taken as eddy covariance measurements) forced\
    \ through the origin versus\nuncalibrated surface renewal sensible heat ﬂux measurements\
    \ [39]. In this study, the alpha weighting\nfactors (α) were obtained from another\
    \ ﬂux tower installed in an almond orchard located in Belridge\n(CA, USA) (35◦30′25.47”N,\
    \ 119◦40′04.99”W). Almond tree from that orchard were of similar age and\nstructural\
    \ properties as those from our study site, and α was obtained from available data\
    \ of both\nEC and SR [23,40]. Monthly averaged data for the period 2008–2011 was\
    \ used to calibrate the H\nobtained from the SR system installed in the almond\
    \ orchard (Table 1). Latent heat ﬂux (LE) of both\norchards was then estimated\
    \ as a residual of the energy balance (LE=Rn-G-H). The averaged values\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n7 of 22\nof H and LE were calculated and recorded with\
    \ an output frequency of 30 min and converted to ETa\n(ETaobs) by dividing LE\
    \ by 2.45 MJ·mm−1 of water vaporized. Daily calculations of ETaobs were used to\n\
    validate the empirically-based ET-model approach developed in this study to estimate\
    \ almond and\npistachio ETa.\nAgrometeorological data was acquired from the CIMIS\
    \ network of weather stations of\nCalifornia [41]. The study site is located between\
    \ two weather stations in the San Joaquin Valley:\nMadera (#188; Lat/Long: 37.02◦N,\
    \ 120.15◦W), and Westlands (#105; Lat/Long: 36.63◦N, 120.38◦W).\nThus, data from\
    \ both stations was averaged to provide the weather input data sets and reference\n\
    ETo. In addition, air temperature (Ta) for each orchard was obtained from the\
    \ FW3 type-E ﬁne-wire\nthermocouples, installed in each ﬂux tower.\nTable 1. Monthly\

    2.5. Estimates of Actual Crop Evapotranspiration (ETa) and Coefﬁcients\nThe actual\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (ETa) was calculated as\nETa = ETo (Kcb Ks + Ke + Kcc)\n\
    (1)\nwhere, Kcb is the basal crop coefﬁcient from the dual crop coefﬁcient approach,\
    \ which essentially\nrepresents transpiration under non-water limited conditions\
    \ [42]; Ks is a water stress coefﬁcient, Ke is\nthe soil water evaporation coefﬁcient,\
    \ and Kcc is the crop cover coefﬁcient. The actual crop coefﬁcient\n(Ka), which\
    \ is considered as the ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration, was calculated\
    \ as\nKa = Kcb Ks + Ke + Kcc\n(2)\nIt is widely acknowledged that the fraction\
    \ of crop intercepted radiation (fIPAR) is a major\ndeterminant of the basal crop\
    \ coefﬁcient (Kcb) [43,44]. As previously described in Section 2.3, fIPARd was\n\
    derived throughout the growing season by regressing it with the reﬂectance vegetation\
    \ index NDVI,\nwhich was acquired from Landsat-8. Since we could not ﬁnd any study\
    \ that presented the fIPARd-Kcb\nresponse for almonds, it has been assumed in\
    \ this study that this regression is similar to that developed\nfor peach trees,\
    \ another Prunus species [44]. Marsal et al. [44] used Cropsyst to simulate the\
    \ seasonal\npatterns of fIPARd, ETc, Kcb and Ψstem for peach trees; we borrowed\
    \ Equation 4 from Marsal et al. to\nestimate almond Kcb from fIPARd. For pistachio,\
    \ Kcb was empirically derived using the crop coefﬁcients\n(Kc) from Goldhamer\
    \ et al. [45] and deducting the weekly averaged Ke derived in this study. Then,\n\
    to obtain the Kcb as function of fIPARd, we used the relationship between crop\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET)\nwith the percent area shaded by the canopy developed\
    \ by Fereres et al. [46], and assuming that fIR was\nequivalent to shaded proportion.\
    \ An empirical polynomial relationship relating fIPAR with fIPARd was\ndeveloped\
    \ (R2 = 0.57, n = 93) using all measurements conducted in the pistachio plots\
    \ throughout the\ngrowing season (Equation 3).\nfIPARd_pist = −2.981 (fIPAR)2\
    \ + 3.452 (fIPAR) − 0.37\n(3)\nThen, Kcb for both crops was calculated as\nKcb_alm\
    \ = −0.982(fIPARd)2 + 2.559(fIPARd) − 0.474\n(4)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n\
    8 of 22\nKcb_pist = −0.324 (fIPARd_pist)2 + 1.721(fIPARd_pist) + 0.045\n(5)\n\
    The water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) was retrieved from canopy thermal-based methods.\n\
    The methodology consisted on the seasonal estimation of Ks from measurements of\
    \ Ψstem, which\nwere conducted in each plot every one to two weeks, and using\
    \ the seasonal regressions obtained\nbetween the remotely sensed crop water stress\
    \ index (CWSI) and Ψstem. Then, the Ks was obtained as\nKs = 1 − CWSI\n(6)\nIn\
    \ order to calculate the CWSI for almonds, canopy temperature (Tc) of two almond\
    \ trees was\ncontinuously monitored from mid-April to October 2016 with two infrared\
    \ radiometer (IRT) sensors.\nTc was recorded every minute and stored as 30-min\
    \ averages and these data were used to calculate the\nalmond baseline of the CWSI.\
    \ The empirical CWSI was calculated as [30], which can be represented as\nCWSI\
    \ =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(7)\nwhere Tc − Ta is\
    \ the difference between canopy and air temperature; (Tc − Ta)LL is the lower\
    \ limit of\n(Tc − Ta) of a canopy which is transpiring at the potential rate,\
    \ and (Tc − Ta)UL the expected differential\nin the case of a non-transpiring\
    \ canopy.\nThe non-water stressed baseline (NWSB) was obtained by regressing half-hourly\
    \ values of\n(Tc − Ta) against vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m.\
    \ Only data within two days\nafter each irrigation event, which had wind speed\
    \ below 6 m·s−1, were used in the assessment of\nthe NWSB. The (Tc − Ta)LL was\
    \ then obtained taking the minimum values of Tc − Ta for each VPD.\nThe upper\
    \ limit (Tc − Ta)UL was obtained by solving the NWSB regression equation for VPD=0,\
    \ then\ncorrecting for the difference in vapor pressure induced by the difference\
    \ in temperature Tc − Ta.\nAs previously reported by Bellvert et al. [28], a phenological\
    \ response was identiﬁed in the NWSB.\nTherefore, data was separated between early\
    \ phenological stages (from April to beginning of July)\nand late stages (from\
    \ early July to harvest at the end of August). In pistachio, CWSI was calculated\n\
    using the baselines developed by Testi et al. [47]. Air temperature (Ta) was obtained\
    \ from the ﬁne-wire\nthermocouples and relative humidity (RH) was obtained using\
    \ a Watchdog 1000 series micro station\n(Spectrum Technologies, 3600, IL, USA)\
    \ installed in each orchard. On the four dates of the thermal\nairborne campaign,\
    \ the CWSI was then calculated in those trees where Ψstem was measured and the\n\
    regression between both parameters was acquired for each day. Crown-averaged temperatures\
    \ for\neach tree were extracted and converted to CWSI by using image processing\
    \ methods.\nSoil evaporation was measured with simple microlysimeters (ML). ML\
    \ were made by cutting\ncommercial PVC pipe and closing the bottom end with caps.\
    \ These were positioned in a PVC pipe\nouter casing installed into the soil. Dimensions\
    \ of each ML were 0.12 m in height and 0.0974 m\nof internal diameter. Three and\
    \ four ML were installed in the soil wetted area of each plot of the\nalmond and\
    \ pistachio orchard, respectively. In the almond orchard, microlysimeters were\
    \ positioned\nhalf-way between a tree and micro-sprinkler, separated by a distance\
    \ of 0.92 m from each. In the\npistachio orchard, two ML were positioned on either\
    \ side of the middle tree, between drip emitters.\nMeasurements were conducted\
    \ seven times throughout the growing season and each time, the ML\nmeasurements\
    \ were weighted for two to three consecutive days. The procedure consisted on\
    \ removing\nthe ML from the soil taking care to preserve the structure of the\
    \ extracted and remaining soil. Then,\nin order to ensure that only water evaporation\
    \ from the ML was measured, soil clinging from the\nexternal surfaces of the ML\
    \ was removed. Soil evaporation (Esoil) and the soil water evaporation\ncoefﬁcient\
    \ (Ke) were calculated by the relationship\nEsoil = ∆MML\nAML\n× Awet mm·day−1\n\
    (8)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n9 of 22\nKe = Esoil\nETo\n(9)\nwhere, ∆MML is\
    \ microlysimeter daily variation of mass (grams); AML is microlysimeter surface\
    \ area\nwith a value of 74.55 cm2 (1 mm of evaporation corresponded therefore\
    \ to 0.007455 liters or 7.455 g of\nwater evaporated); Awet is wetted soil area\
    \ (%); and ETo is daily evapotranspiration (mm).\nThe wetted soil area around\
    \ a tree was measured using a measuring tape. The procedure consisted\nof dividing\
    \ the tree spacing area into four quadrants and measuring the percentage of wetted\
    \ area in\neach quadrant. Ke was calculated during the growing season based on\
    \ the number of days after each\nirrigation event. Evaporation after a rainfall\
    \ event was considered in the same way as an irrigation\nevent, but where the\
    \ entire soil surface was completely wetted, Awet was considered equal to the\n\
    spacing per tree.\nThe cover crop coefﬁcient (Kcc) was obtained as\nKcc = CCw\n\
    SD (GC)\n(10)\nwhere, CCw is cover crop width (m), which was measured every two\
    \ to three weeks, SD represents the\nspacing distance, and GC is the percentage\
    \ of green cover, which was estimated visually.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1.\
    \ Stem Water Potential and Volumetric Soil Water Content\nThe seasonal pattern\
    \ of stem water potential (Ψstem) and volumetric soil water content (θv) is\n\
    presented in Figure 3. Before harvest, Ψstem values ranged between −0.8 to −1.6\
    \ MPa and between\n−0.5 to −1.4 MPa for almond and pistachio, respectively (Figure\
    \ 3a). Ψstem of both crops decreased\nthrough the season, reaching minimum values\
    \ at harvest. Minimum Ψstem values for almonds were\n−3.3 MPa, coinciding with\
    \ the end of the drying period. Ψstem of both crops also showed a clear\nresponse\
    \ to θv, yielding coefﬁcients of determination (R2) of 0.89 and 0.74 for almonds\
    \ and pistachios,\nrespectively. Soil texture in both orchards was sandy loam,\
    \ with 19.5% and 10.3% of soil water content\nrespectively at ﬁeld capacity and\
    \ wilting point across the entire soil proﬁle [48]. Similarly to Ψstem,\nθv across\
    \ both sites decreased throughout the season, except for a slight increase in\
    \ the θv just before\nharvest due to an irrigation event, which increased the\
    \ Ψstem values to the same level as those measured\nin pistachios (Figure 3b).\
    \ The θv in the pistachio orchard at the top 0.9 m was slightly higher than in\n\
    the almond orchard throughout the growing season. Therefore, the lower θv in the\
    \ almond orchard\nmay explain, in part, the reason why Ψstem values were lower.\n\

    \ range, (R2 of 0.88 \nand 0.96 for pistachio and almond, respectively; Figure\
    \ 4b). The little shift in this regression indicated \nFigure 4. (a) Seasonal\

    \ over its entire range, (R2 of 0.88 and\n0.96 for pistachio and almond, respectively;\
    \ Figure 4b). The little shift in this regression indicated that,\nfor any given\
    \ value of the fIPARd, the NDVI was slightly higher in almonds than in pistachios.\
    \ This\ncan probably be explained by a cover crop or even a leaf angle effect.\
    \ While the pistachio orchard had\nbare soil, most of the almond orchards had\
    \ cover crop (i.e., weeds) between rows, in part, because\nthe almond orchard\
    \ was irrigated by micro-sprinklers, whereas the pistachio orchard was irrigated\n\
    via drip irrigation under the trees. The regression with LAI, however, was non-linear\
    \ and, above LAI\nvalues of ~2, the NDVI tended to saturate and became less sensitive\
    \ to variations in LAI (Figure 4c).\nThis saturation effect has been widely reported\
    \ in many studies.\n3.3. Soil Water Evaporation Coefﬁcient (Ke)\nKe was measured\
    \ from mid-April to mid-August, when tree foliage had reached full development.\n\
    Data showed that Ke was dependent on the irrigation frequency and system. In both\
    \ orchards, irrigation\nwas scheduled on a weekly basis and particularly during\
    \ the summer, with long irrigation events\nranging from 24 to 36 consecutive hours.\
    \ Therefore, Ke declines daily following each irrigation event\n(Figure 5). On\
    \ the same day of an irrigation event, Ke corresponded to maximum values of 0.24\
    \ and\n0.18 for almond and pistachio, respectively. The shifting of soil evaporation\
    \ between both orchards\nwas explained by the irrigation system. The micro-sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system installed in the almond\norchard corresponded with a higher\
    \ wetted soil surface, and consequently, a higher soil evaporation\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2018, 10, 2001\n11 of 22\nrate in comparison to the drip irrigation system in\
    \ the pistachio orchard. Comparing the accumulated\nsoil evaporation on a weekly\
    \ basis, it was estimated that the pistachio orchard evaporated up to 35%\nless\
    \ than the almond orchard. Some studies have found that Esoil in a drip-irrigated\
    \ almond orchard\n(canopy cover (CC) = 63%, irrigation at full replacement of\
    \ ET) accounted for 23.6% of ETc, on average,\nduring the growing season [54].\
    \ On the other hand, Iniesta et al. [55] reported Esoil losses that amounted\n\
    to 30% of seasonal ETc for fully-irrigated pistachios (CC = 57%) with a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system. In our\nstudy, Esoil for the growing season accounted for an average\
    \ of 16.1 and 13.1% of ETa for almonds and\npistachios, respectively (Table 2).\
    \ Overall, Esoil depends on the type of irrigation system, irrigation\nfrequency,\
    \ fraction of radiation reaching the soil surface, atmospheric evaporative demand\
    \ (ETo) and\nsoil inﬁltration rate [56]. Therefore, variations in reported Esoil\
    \ values can be explained by variations in\nthese parameters. For instance, dissimilarities\
    \ in Esoil comparing our almond orchard and results of\nthe pistachio orchard\
    \ reported by Iniesta et al. [55] might be explained by differences in canopy\
    \ cover.\nBoth orchards were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler system, but the\
    \ almond average canopy cover\n(~85%) was higher than the pistachios, reducing\
    \ therefore the amount of radiation reaching the soil\nsurface, and thus Esoil.\n\
    \ \np\np\nq\ny\ny\norchards, irrigation was scheduled on a weekly basis and particularly\
    \ during the summer, with long \nirrigation events ranging from 24 to 36 consecutive\
    \ hours. Therefore, Ke declines daily following each \nirrigation event (Figure\
    \ 5). On the same day of an irrigation event, Ke corresponded to maximum \nvalues\
    \ of 0.24 and 0.18 for almond and pistachio, respectively. The shifting of soil\
    \ evaporation \nbetween both orchards was explained by the irrigation system.\
    \ The micro-sprinkler irrigation system \ninstalled in the almond orchard corresponded\
    \ with a higher wetted soil surface, and consequently, a \nhigher soil evaporation\
    \ rate in comparison to the drip irrigation system in the pistachio orchard. \n\
    Comparing the accumulated soil evaporation on a weekly basis, it was estimated\
    \ that the pistachio \norchard evaporated up to 35% less than the almond orchard.\
    \ Some studies have found that Esoil in a \ndrip-irrigated almond orchard (canopy\

    \ of ETc, on average, during the growing season [54]. On the other hand, Iniesta\
    \ et \nal. [55] reported Esoil losses that amounted to 30% of seasonal ETc for\
    \ fully-irrigated pistachios (CC = \n57%) with a micro-sprinkler system. In our\
    \ study, Esoil for the growing season accounted for an \naverage of 16.1 and 13.1%\
    \ of ETa for almonds and pistachios, respectively (Table 2). Overall, Esoil \n\
    depends on the type of irrigation system, irrigation frequency, fraction of radiation\
    \ reaching the soil \nsurface, atmospheric evaporative demand (ETo) and soil infiltration\
    \ rate [56]. Therefore, variations in \nreported Esoil values can be explained\
    \ by variations in these parameters. For instance, dissimilarities \nin Esoil\
    \ comparing our almond orchard and results of the pistachio orchard reported by\
    \ Iniesta et al. \n[55] might be explained by differences in canopy cover. Both\
    \ orchards were irrigated with a micro-\nsprinkler system, but the almond average\
    \ canopy cover (~85%) was higher than the pistachios, \nreducing therefore the\
    \ amount of radiation reaching the soil surface, and thus Esoil. \n \nFigure 5.\

    \ for almonds in this study.\nThe seasonal pattern of the CWSI, which was calculated\
    \ using Tc from the two IRTs installed\non the almond trees, can be observed in\
    \ Figure 7. CWSI ranged from zero to one throughout the\ngrowing season, with\
    \ sharp peaks before irrigation events and dropping close to zero once irrigation\n\
    was applied. The sandy loam soils of this orchard have little capacity to retain\
    \ water, thus the low\nfrequency of irrigation events caused large oscillations\
    \ of water status within a week. At the beginning\nof the season, CWSI was unreasonably\
    \ high for some speciﬁc days and there were large differences\nbetween both IRTs.\
    \ On those days, VPD was low, and because under these circumstances the difference\n\
    between (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL is very small, the signal-to-noise ratio to\
    \ calculate CWSI is small,\nso CWSI at these times may contain signiﬁcant sources\
    \ of error. The CWSI reached maximum values in\nmid-July, when the atmospheric\
    \ demand was high and for a few weeks, the amount of water applied\nwas not enough\
    \ to supply all crop water demand. Also, during the drying period prior to harvest,\n\
    irrigation was intentionally cut off for 14 days and CWSI peaked at a maximum\
    \ value of 0.8. Upon the\nresumption of irrigation during the post-harvest stage,\
    \ CWSI recovered again. Measurements of Ψstem\nin those trees agreed with CWSI,\

    \ for the other three image acquisition dates (DOY 174, 203, and 224), characterized\n\
    by a more anisohydric behavior, due to a lower efﬁciency at controlling Ψstem\

    \ and that applied through irrigation and rainfall\naccounted for 140.7 and 102.8\
    \ mm for almond and pistachio, respectively. This corresponded to the\naveraged\
    \ amount of water stored in a sandy loam soil for all of the growing season. As\
    \ previously\nmentioned, the amount of water loss due to soil evaporation (Esoil)\
    \ accounted for 16.1% and 13.1%\nfor almond and pistachio, respectively. On the\
    \ other hand, the water consumption coming from\nvegetation ground cover (CC)\
    \ was almost negligible, being 2.20% and 0.84% of total ETa for almond\nand pistachio,\
    \ respectively.\nThe seasonal trend of both modelled and observed (ﬂux tower data)\
    \ actual crop\nevapotranspiration (ETamodel, ETaobs) is shown for the almond (Figure\
    \ 9a) and pistachio (Figure 10a)\norchards. In almonds, crop evapotranspiration\
    \ increased sharply from early March to mid-July,\nwhen maximum values of ~8.5\
    \ mm·day−1 were achieved. After mid-July, ETamodel, ETaobs, and\nETo dropped progressively\
    \ until the end of the season. The decrease in ETa starting on DOY 226\ncorresponded\
    \ with the drying period at harvest. During that period, transpiration declined\
    \ to\nminimum values of 2.2 mm day−1 when the cv. Nonpareil and cv. Carmel were\
    \ harvested, which\ncorresponded to a measured Ψstem of −3.3 MPa. Although both\
    \ ETamodel and ETaobs dropped during\nperiods of low Ψstem, values of modelled\
    \ ET (ETamodel) were lower than ETaobs. This phenomenon was\nobserved to occur\
    \ several times throughout the growing season (i.e., DOY 99, 100, 126, 162, 172,\
    \ 193,\n205, and 220), suggesting that either the model exaggerates water stress,\
    \ or that it may be difﬁcult to\nquantify water stress in almond using energy\
    \ balance techniques. Spinelli et al. [23] suggested a similar\nconclusion. They\
    \ argued that the unresponsiveness of LE to reductions in canopy conductance during\n\
    periods of low Ψstem could be due to the inﬂuence of aerodynamic conductance (ga)\
    \ [74], as well as\nthe overriding contribution of LE coming from shaded leaves\
    \ within a canopy, which respond less\ndramatically to water stress. The same\
    \ study also indicated that because the response of LE to gs\ndepends on ga, stress-related\
    \ reductions in ET are more likely on a high wind speed day (high ga),\nthan during\
    \ a low ga (calm) day. Although these hypotheses may offer potential insights,\
    \ this aspect\ndeserves more attention in further studies. Moreover, this singularity\
    \ was not seen in pistachios,\nthough unfortunately we did not have the ﬂux data\
    \ needed throughout the growing season to conﬁrm\nit, particularly during the\
    \ drying harvest period. Crop evapotranspiration in pistachios followed\nthe same\
    \ trend as almonds, but ETa was slightly lower (Figure 10a). Maximum values reached\
    \ to\n~7.5 mm·day−1 (DOY 179).\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n16 of 22\nRemote\

    \ a useful, practical, and affordable tool for the grower to measure plant water\n\
    status of an entire orchard, we have shown that thermal-based remote sensing can\
    \ be successfully used\nto determine the water stress coefﬁcient (Ks). The CWSI-Ψstem\
    \ relationship (where Ks = 1 − CWSI)\nshowed a temporally-variable seasonal response\
    \ for both crops with r2 ranging from 0.54 to 0.82. These\nregressions can be\
    \ used in irrigation scheduling of almond and pistachio, if Ψstem is either measured\n\
    or estimated and a speciﬁc threshold value is selected.\nDespite these results,\
    \ the high cost and operational limitations of the acquisition of high resolution\n\
    thermal imagery across the growing season demonstrates a signiﬁcant constraint\
    \ in using these\ntechnologies operationally for scheduling irrigation. Therefore,\
    \ we suggest that future studies should\nfocus on the use of decision-oriented\
    \ crop models, which are fed by remote sensing data, and have the\nability to\
    \ spatially simulate crop water status and water requirements across the season.\

  analysis: 'This research paper provides an in-depth review of plant response-based
    sensing and control strategies in sustainable greenhouse production. Its primary
    focus is on how the microclimate surrounding the plant greatly influences plant
    growth and development, emphasizing the need for more precise control strategies
    based on plant responses.


    The authors highlight the importance of understanding plant-environment interactions,
    especially at the microclimate level, to optimize greenhouse production and achieve
    high-quality yields. They discuss the concept of the "speaking plant" approach,
    where plant responses are monitored and used to adjust environmental parameters
    for better plant growth and development.


    Various non-invasive and non-contact sensing techniques are reviewed, including:


    * **Spectral techniques:** Using the reflection and transmission properties of
    light to assess plant health, nutrient status, and water stress.

    * **Infrared thermometry:** Measuring canopy temperature to detect water stress
    and schedule irrigation.

    * **Machine vision and image processing:** Analyzing plant images to track growth,
    detect stress, and assess leaf area.

    * **Acoustic emission:** Detecting sounds emitted by xylem cavitations to indicate
    water stress.


    The authors conclude by emphasizing the importance of plant response-based sensing
    and control for sustainable greenhouse production. They call for further research
    and development of automated plant monitoring systems that can provide real-time
    information about plant health and environmental conditions, enabling precise
    control and optimization of greenhouse production.'

    \ concerns in experimental design for both\nresearch in plant systems and greenhouse\
    \ plant production. Microclimates surrounding plants are\nnot usually uniform.\
    \ Therefore, many samples and sensors are required to obtain a true representa-\n\
    tion of the plant population. A plant monitoring system capable of reducing the\
    \ required number of\nsamples by reducing environmental variability would be more\
    \ advantageous. To better understand\nplant-environment interaction, it is essential\
    \ to study plants, microclimate surrounding the plants and\nthe growth media.\
    \ To achieve this, the monitoring system must be equipped with proper instrumen-\n\
    tation.\nTo achieve proper management practices and sustainable greenhouse production,\
    \ it is essential ﬁrst\nto understand plants and their interactions with their\
    \ surroundings and then establish plant\nresponse-based sensing and control strategies\
    \ for greenhouse processes. Therefore, an e#ort was\nconducted to review and discuss\
    \ current sensing and control strategies in greenhouse research and\nplant production\
    \ and provide recommendations on plant response-based sensing and control\nstrategies\
    \ for sustainable greenhouse production.\nKey words: Automatic control, Greenhouse,\
    \ Plant monitoring, Sustainable, Speaking plant.\n+. Introduction\nPlants grow\
    \ as a result of their genetic traits and\nthe inﬂuences of the surrounding environment.\
    \ To\nachieve high yield and high quality horticulture pro-\nduction, extensive\
    \ e#orts have to be devoted to\noptimizing environmental factors in controlled\
    \ envi-\nronment agriculture. More importantly, an under-\nstanding of how plants\
    \ interact with their aerial\nenvironment is central to establishing better control\n\
    strategies and management for greenhouse plant pro-\nduction.\nTo better understand\
    \ plant-environment interac-\ntion for research and sustainable plant production\
    \ in\ncontrolled environment agriculture, it is essential to\nstudy both the microclimate\
    \ surrounding the plants\nand the growth media.\nFor instance, plant-water\nrelationships\
    \ should be studied by monitoring both\nsupply (water reservoir) and demand (transpiration)\n\
    conditions.\nTo achieve this, the system must be\nequipped with proper instrumentation\
    \ to continually\nmonitor soil moisture and plant microclimate condi-\ntions such\
    \ as air temperature, humidity, radiation,\nair velocity, and CO, level.\nThus,\
    \ an automated\nplant monitoring system is desirable to collect su$-\ncient and\
    \ accurate information on the true physio-\nlogical state of the plants under\
    \ observation.\nThe e#ect of environmental variability is one of\nthe major concerns\

    \ Microclimates surrounding plants are usu-\nally not uniform.\nTherefore, many\
    \ samples and\nsensors are required to obtain a true representation\nof the plant\

    \ of samples\nby reducing environmental variability would be ad-\nvantageous.\n\
    ,. Sensing Macroclimate or Microclimate?\nTraditionally,\nenvironmental\nparameters\n\
    in\na\ngreenhouse such as air temperature, humidity, and\ncarbon dioxide concentration\
    \ are being controlled\nusing feedbacks from one location as being a repre-\n\
    sentative condition in the greenhouse. Therefore, the\nmacroclimate is controlled.\
    \ However, the microcli-\nmate at the plant and leaf boundary layer control the\n\
    exchange processes between the plants and their\nsurroundings. Furthermore, the\
    \ microclimate is in-\nﬂuenced not only by the macroclimate but also by\nthe physical\
    \ state of the plants.\nThe most energy\ne$cient systems are those which have\
    \ the most direct\ne#ect on the microclimate in the greenhouse (Bailey,\n+32/;\
    \ Boulard, ,**.).\nThus, an understanding of\ninteractions between the plants\
    \ and their micro-\nclimate is signiﬁcant to establish better control\nstrategies\
    \ in greenhouse plant production.\n-. Interactions of the Plants with Microclimate\n\
    Dynamic response of plants to changes in their\nenvironment is called “speaking\
    \ plant” (Takakura et\nal., +31.; Udink Ten Cate et al., +312; Hashimoto\nand\
    \ Nonami, +33,). For better synthesis of control\nsystems in the greenhouses,\
    \ the dynamics of both the\ngreenhouse and the plants must be considered. The\n\
    concept of the speaking plant approach and plant\nresponse-based sensing could\
    \ be valuable to have a\nbetter understanding of the interactions between the\n\
    microclimate and the physical conditions of the\nplants. Thus, the physical responses\
    \ of the plants to\nenvironmental changes are monitored and the infor-\nmation\
    \ could be utilized to identify conditions which\nput the plants under stress\
    \ and to avoid the occur-\nrences of these conditions or to control greenhouse\n\
    microclimate to achieve more e$cient and optimal\nproduction.\n.. Plant Response-Based\
    \ Sensing\nAutomated environmental control systems o#er\nopportunities to improve\
    \ production quality and uni-\nform plant growth in controlled environment agri-\n\
    culture. Most control strategies in controlled envi-\nronment plant production\
    \ systems depend on the\nfeedback of local environmental parameters such as\n\
    air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, etc.\nHowever, dynamic responses of\
    \ plants could also be\nconsidered for adjusting environmental parameters\nto\
    \ improve plant growth and development. In this\nsense, it is desirable to “Let\
    \ plants say what they\nneed,” to communicate information about their\nphysical\
    \ conditions and their needs. Thus, direct and\nreal-time monitoring of plant\
    \ responses and pro-\ncesses along with the local environmental parameters\nhave\
    \ the potential to improve plant production\nenergy e$ciency compared to conventional\
    \ control\nstrategies.\nToday, with the advancement of computer and\nsensor technologies,\
    \ microprecision technology is\navailable for controlled environment plant produc-\n\
    tion. The microprecision technology does not always\nmean a higher order of engineering\
    \ precision but it\nrefers to a technology which makes it possible to ﬁrst\nidentify\
    \ what is needed, how much is needed, and\nwhen it is needed, and then performs\
    \ the action\nrequired to meet the identiﬁed quantitative and qual-\nitative needs\
    \ of the plants as precisely as possible\n(Murase, ,**,). Some of the available\
    \ micropreci-\nsion technologies are the speaking plant approach,\nartiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ biorobotics, and biomecha-\ntronics. Some of these techniques and technologies\n\
    are invasive and require contact measurements.\nHowever, for automation in plant\
    \ production, real-\ntime monitoring is required and non-invasive and\nnon-contact\
    \ sensing and monitoring are desirable.\nResearchers have reported using spectral\
    \ (including\nvisible, near infrared, and infrared), machine vision,\nand acoustic\
    \ techniques to extract plant response\ninformation.\n.. +\nSpectral techniques\n\
    The interaction of sunlight with crop canopies and\nplant leaves could be used\
    \ to obtain valuable infor-\nmation about the plant and its status.\nThe plant\n\
    canopy acts like a turbid medium to the photons\npassing through the atmosphere.\
    \ The proportions of\nabsorbed, reﬂected and transmitted photons are a\nfunction\
    \ of the leaf condition and the waveband.\nGreen leaves absorb strongly in the\
    \ visible waveband\n(-2*\x0112* nm) and reﬂect most of the energy in the\nnear\
    \ (12*\x01+,+** nm) and middle infrared (+,-**\x01\nJ. Agric. Meteorol. \x01\x02\

    \ char-\nacteristics drive the absorption in the visible portion\nof the light\
    \ spectrum. The amount of the absorption\nis governed by the quantity of these\
    \ pigments.\nCanopy reﬂectance is a#ected by leaf reﬂectance,\nplant structure\
    \ and other background in a sensor’s\nﬁeld of view.\nThe most commonly used vegetation\
    \ indices to\ndetermine plant status are RVI (Ratio Vegetation\nIndex), DVI (Di#erence\
    \ Vegetation Index), and\nNDVI (Normalized Di#erence Vegetation Index).\nThe components\
    \ controlling leaf absorption are chlo-\nrophyll in the visible spectrum and leaf\
    \ structure in\nthe near infrared.\nStudies have showed that reﬂectance measure-\n\
    ments considering the near-infrared spectra allow the\ndiscrimination of nutrient\
    \ deﬁciencies (Grae# et al.,\n,**.). At the same time, researchers have reported\n\
    that plant water status can be detected by the meas-\nurement of plant near-infrared\
    \ and middle-infrared\nreﬂectance.\nThe assessment of plant water status\nusing\
    \ the spectral band of +,-**\x01,,/** nm was found\npromising (Yang and Ling,\
    \ ,**-).\nFluorescence was reported as a sensitive indica-\ntor of changes in\
    \ a plant’s photosynthetic system.\nStudies have reported that plant ﬂuorescence\
    \ emis-\nsion corresponded to water and temperature stresses\nand nutrient deﬁciencies\
    \ (Chappelle et al., +32.;\nBaker and Ort, +33,; Buschmann et al., +330). One\n\
    of the main challenges of using the plant ﬂuorescence\nmethods in commercial plant\
    \ production settings is\nthat the plant ﬂuorescence is a weak signal which can\n\
    be lost under broad-spectrum ambient lighting con-\nditions.\nHowever, the relative\
    \ referencing method\n(RRM),\nintroduced\nby\nNorikane\nand\nKurata\n(,**+), showed\
    \ a promising new approach for plant\nhealth status monitoring.\nThey developed\
    \ a non-\ncontact, non-invasive system using the RRM method\nto detect plant water\
    \ stress under continuous broad-\nspectrum ambient lighting conditions, the conditions\n\
    found in commercial greenhouse settings.\nTheir\nsystem was successfully used\
    \ to detect ﬂuorescence\nchanges of the plants due to water stress prior to\n\
    signiﬁcant changes in turgidity.\n.. ,\nInfrared thermometry\nPlant canopy temperature\
    \ has been investigated as\nan indicator of its water status. As plants are heated\n\
    by radiation, plants transpire to prevent overheating.\nPlant canopy temperature\
    \ rises if there is not enough\nwater or the heating load exceeds the transpirative\n\
    cooling load. Commercially available portable infra-\nred (IR) thermometers have\
    \ made non-contact leaf-\nsurface-temperature measurements and assessment\nof\
    \ plant water stress possible. With the potential use\nof IR thermometers, several\
    \ indices have been pro-\nposed for irrigation scheduling: Stress Degree Day\n\
    (SDD) (Idso et al., +311); Temperature Stress Day\n(TSD) (Gardner et al., +32+);\
    \ and Crop Water\nStress Index (CWSI) (Jackson et al., +32+).\nEm-\npirically\
    \ derived CWSI (Idso et al., +32+; Pinter et\nal., +32-; O’Toole et al., +32.;\
    \ Hattendorf et al.,\n+33*; Wanjura and Upchurch, +332) and theore-\ntically derived\
    \ CWSI (Jackson et al., +32+; O’Toole\nand Hatﬁeld, +32-; Clawson et al., +323;\
    \ Stang-\nhellini et al., +33,; Qiu et al., ,***; Kacira et al.,\n,**,a) have\
    \ been evaluated. Because it is simple and\nrequires only three variables to be\
    \ measured (canopy\nand air temperatures and relative humidity), the\nempirical\
    \ CWSI approach has received much atten-\ntion.\nThe success of assessing plants’\
    \ water status\nusing the empirical CWSI approach depends on ac-\ncurate determination\
    \ of upper and lower limits for\na speciﬁc cultural condition.\nOnce established,\
    \ a\nplant’s water status can be quickly determined from\nmeasurements such as\
    \ temperature di#erence be-\ntween plant canopy and ambient air, (Tc\x01Ta) and\n\
    vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD), which is calculated\nfrom relative humidity and temperature\
    \ of air. The\nLower Limit (non-water stressed baseline), (Tc\x01\nTa)lowerlimit,\
    \ is obtained from well-watered plants\ntranspiring at potential rate while the\
    \ Upper Limit,\n(Tc\x01Ta)upperlimit, is established using data collected\nfrom\
    \ severely stressed plants, theoretically speaking,\nnon-transpiring plants.\n\
    For a given (Tc\x01Ta) and\nVPD, a point B in Fig. + can be deﬁned.\nThe\nFig.\

    \ tem-\nperature measurements for current environmental\nconditions were also\
    \ introduced for infrared ther-\nmometry applications for water stress detection\n\
    (Jones et al., +331; Jones, +333a).\nThis approach\nenabled absolute estimates\
    \ of conductance and evap-\noration. Jones (+333b) further introduced the use\
    \ of\nsurfaces of known conductance to water vapor such\nas wet ﬁlter paper covered\
    \ by a calibrated medical\ndressing. Thus, the use of these internal references\n\
    established a di#erent deﬁnition of Stress Index\nwhich was proportional to leaf\

    Twet\x02\n(,)\nWhere a depends upon wind speed and air tempera-\nture.\nThermal\
    \ imaging (thermography) has also been\nused mainly for plant-water relations.\n\
    The major\ninterest in thermal imaging has been the study of\nstomatal behavior\
    \ as an indicator of plant water\nstatus, stress occurrence, and its use in irrigation\n\
    scheduling. The concept in thermal imaging is same\nas in infrared thermometry;\
    \ however, thermography\nmay o#er advantages in terms of image operation\nand\
    \ improved sampling. One of the problems with\nthermal imaging is the Gaussian\
    \ noise dependent on\nboth sensor quality and image temperature (Jones\nand Leinonen,\
    \ ,**-). Another problem with ther-\nmal imaging could be spatial errors in calibration\n\
    across a target image drifting with time.\nThus, a\nsubtraction methodology was\
    \ recommended to im-\nprove the comparability of information across the\nwhole\
    \ image (Jones et al., ,**,). The concept in this\nmethod was based on taking\
    \ a reference image of a\nhomogenous reference surface, subtracting it from a\n\
    sample image and then adding back to all pixels of\nthe average temperature of\
    \ the reference image.\n.. -\nMachine vision and image processing\nMachine vision\
    \ is a non-invasive, non-contact\nsensing technology that could be used for direct\n\
    monitoring of plant responses to environmental con-\nditions.\nThe technique aims\
    \ to duplicate human\nvision by electronically perceiving and understand-\ning\
    \ an image with multi-dimensional capability. Ma-\nchine vision can be used to\
    \ characterize a tar-\ngeted object using morphological (size, shape, tex-\nture,\
    \ etc.), spectral (color, temperature, moisture),\nand temporal (growth rate,\
    \ development, dynamic\nchange of spectral and morphological states) fea-\ntures.\
    \ For instance, the rate change of Top Projected\nCanopy Area (TPCA) was used\
    \ to determine nutri-\nent stress in lettuce plants (Giacomelli et al., +332),\n\
    plant development (Ling et al., +33/), the e#ect\nof light quality on plant growth\
    \ (Sase and Ling,\n+330), and water stress in New Guinea Impatiens\n(Kacira et\
    \ al., ,**,b).\nFurthermore, movement\nof leaﬂets (Oosterhuis et al, +32/), tracking\
    \ of leaf\ntips (Seginer et al., +33,; Kurata and Yan, +330;\nRevollon et al.,\
    \ +332), and image boundary move-\nments (Nyakwende et al., +331) have been used\
    \ to\ndetect water stress in the plants, and image process-\ning was also used\
    \ to determine seedling quality (Sase\net al., +33,; McDonald et al., ,**.).\n\
    .. .\nAcoustic emission\nAcoustic emission (AE) monitoring involves lis-\ntening\
    \ to the sounds (which are usually inaudible to\nthe human ear) made by a material\
    \ or structure in\nuse and drawing conclusions about its “state of\nhealth” from\
    \ what is heard.\nAcoustic Emission\nrefers to the generation of transient elastic\
    \ waves\nduring the rapid release of energy from localized\nsources within a material.\
    \ The technique is based on\nthe detection and conversion of these high frequency\n\
    elastic waves to electrical signals.\nThe acoustic emission technique (as a result\
    \ of\nxylem cavitations) can be used directly and non-\ninvasively to indicate\
    \ the water stress of plants. The\nwater in the xylem of a transpiring plant is\
    \ normally\nunder tension.\nHowever, when the soil dries, the\ntension in the\
    \ xylem gradually increases. When the\nwater column fractures or empties as a\
    \ result of\nfailure either by cohesion between water molecules\nor by adhesion\
    \ to the conduit walls, these cavitation\nevents result in a rise in acoustic\
    \ emissions. Thus,\nJ. Agric. Meteorol. \x03\x04\x05\x06\a\b 0+ (+), ,**/\n\t\
    \ 18 \t\nthese acoustic emissions can be detected in ultra-\nsonic frequencies\
    \ by using proper instrumentation.\nShifeng et al. (,**-) developed a system to\
    \ automat-\nically acquire real-time AE signals and transpiration\ndata from tomato\
    \ plants and to detect water stress.\nTheir results showed good agreement between\
    \ the\nacoustic emission rate from stems and water stress\nconditions. Furthermore,\
    \ it was also shown that the\nAE rate changed gradually with the change in the\n\
    transpiration rate of the tomato plants and was also\nrelated to the environment\
    \ of the plants.\nThe AE technique was also used successfully to\ndetermine the\
    \ root growth of the plants in soil\n(Okushima et al., +330; Durairaj et al.,\
    \ ,***).\n/. Conclusions and Recommendations\nTraditional environmental control\
    \ strategies for\ncontrolled environment plant production systems\ndepend on macroclimate\
    \ parameters such as air tem-\nperature, humidity, solar radiation, etc. In reality,\n\
    there is always non-uniformity in the interior envi-\nronment of the greenhouses.\
    \ However, the microcli-\nmate at the plant and leaf boundary layer control the\n\
    exchange processes between the plants and their\nsurroundings.\nFurthermore, the\
    \ most energy e$-\ncient systems are those which have the most direct\ne#ect on\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse. There-\nfore, developing plant response-based\
    \ sensing and\ncontrol strategies is signiﬁcant for high quality and\nyield in\
    \ production and energy e$ciency in con-\ntrolled environment plant production.\n\
    In order to\nachieve this, automated monitoring of plant health\nand growth is\
    \ needed.\nHowever, automated moni-\ntoring using real-time data from the plants\
    \ must be\nable to determine the true state or condition of\nthe plants while\
    \ imposing a minimum of physical\ndisturbance on the plants and their environment.\n\
    Therefore, non-contact, non-invasive sensing meth-\nods and technologies are more\
    \ desirable.\nThis paper introduced some of the non-contact\nFig. ,. A schematic\
    \ of a controlled environment plant production system using plant responses as\n\
    feedbacks for climate manipulation.\nKacira et al.: Plant Response-Based Sensing\
    \ for Control Strategies in Sustainable Greenhouse Production\n\x01 19 \x01\n\
    and non-invasive plant monitoring techniques which\ncould be used to assess the\
    \ status of the plant health\nand growth for applications in controlled environ-\n\
    ment plant production systems. Studies referenced\nin this paper indicate promising\
    \ results and applica-\ntions of techniques for assessment of plant health and\n\
    growth.\nHowever careful attention must be paid\nwith appropriate use of the techniques\
    \ in commercial\ngreenhouse settings.\nMost of the spectral sensing techniques\
    \ rely on the\nreﬂectance properties of a single leaf from the plant.\nFurther\
    \ research must be carried out and meth-\nodologies should be developed to obtain\
    \ reﬂectance\nproperties from whole plant canopies to determine\nthe status of\
    \ the plants under certain conditions.\nLeaf reﬂectance and transmittance and\
    \ the amount\nof leaf area per unit ground area a#ect the whole\ncanopy reﬂectance.\
    \ When the plant canopy closure\nis not reached, background soil reﬂectance becomes\n\
    a noise source in the spectral measurement. Further-\nmore, attention must also\
    \ be paid to plant structure\nand some geometrical considerations during spectral\n\
    measurements including solar zenith angle, observa-\ntion angle (angle between\
    \ sensor and the leaf) and\nﬁeld-of-view of the sensor.\nPlant leaf temperature\
    \ and application of infrared\nthermometry is promising for detection of water\n\
    stress and can be used for irrigation management.\nCWSI could be used to detect\
    \ and quantify drought\nstress and the irrigation could be managed based on\n\
    this index. Theoretical calculated CWSI, however,\nrequires many accurately measured\
    \ environmental\nparameters.\nThe complexity of the CWSI calcula-\ntion must be\
    \ reduced to meet practical concerns of\nﬁeld applications. Empirically determined\
    \ CWSI, on\nthe other hand, is more user friendly for commercial\nsettings. The\
    \ e#ectiveness of this sensing technique\nto detect water stress and the robustness\
    \ of con-\ntrolled irrigation based on CWSI, nonetheless, need\nto be evaluated\
    \ for di#erent plants and environ-\nmental conditions.\nAttention must be paid\
    \ to the\nappropriate use of the sensor. For example, it has to\nbe made sure\
    \ that the sensor sees the target but not\nthe background all the time.\nMachine\
    \ vision techniques have been demon-\nstrated as a promising tool for real-time\
    \ plant health\nand growth monitoring.\nFor detection of plant\nstatus under certain\
    \ conditions, it is necessary to\nestablish quantitative baselines for detection\
    \ of\nstresses with the markers being used.\nMost of the\nstudies using machine\
    \ vision applications to deter-\nmine plant stresses, especially water stress,\
    \ focused\non tracking of leaf tip and the change of leaf inclina-\ntion from\
    \ a single plant leaf. An alternative must be\nthe analysis of the image of the\
    \ whole canopy, rather\nthan that of the individual plant part, to extract\ninformation\
    \ related to the average status of the plant\ncanopy for more practical and cost-e#ective\
    \ applica-\ntions in commercial production settings.\nThe acoustic emission technique\
    \ to monitor plant\ngrowth and detection of water stress on the plants\nis still\
    \ in its infancy.\nThe approach seems to be\nscientiﬁcally sound; however, additional\
    \ research is\nneeded to establish strong methodologies and base-\nlines to determine\
    \ the true status of the plants under\nvarying environmental conditions.\nIt is\
    \ important to characterize the interactions\nbetween the plants and their environment\
    \ if an auto-\nmated plant monitoring system or control strategy is\nto be established.\
    \ A well designed plant monitoring\nsystem should be capable of dealing with environ-\n\
    mental variability, monitoring both plant microcli-\nmate and soil conditions,\
    \ and providing non-contact\nsensing.\nSuch plant monitoring systems and tech-\n\
    nologies must consist of a data acquisition system,\nbased on high precision sensors,\
    \ sensor data storage\nand transmission and sophisticated computer soft-\nware\
    \ or algorithm to interpret these data in relation\nto the status of the microclimate,\
    \ plant and control\nactions for optimal plant production (Fig. ,). For\nsustainable\
    \ production, a proposed system must be\nresource-conserving, socially supportive,\
    \ commer-\ncially competitive, and environmentally sound.\nReferences\nBailey,\

  analysis: "This study assessed the applicability of optical and thermal data acquired\
    \ from airborne remote sensing platforms to detect water stress in maize. The\
    \ analysis centered on determining whether water stress indicators derived from\
    \ both sources could differentiate between levels of water deficit in a maize\
    \ field. The evaluation focused on the potential of the data to suitably discriminate\
    \ water stress at different times during the day, as well as identifying the time\
    \ of day most appropriate for gathering such data. \n\nThe findings from the study\
    \ suggest that high-resolution optical and thermal images were effective in detecting\

    \ NDVI performed similarly throughout the day, proving capable of distinguishing\
    \ variations in canopy biomass and structure among plots rather than assessing\
    \ leaf physiology.\n\nThe study also suggested the slope of the evolution of Tc\
    \ during the morning was well correlated with stomatal conductance, making it\
    \ a promising indicator for tracking water status. Its primary advantage is that,\
    \ unlike single-time temperature measurements, it encompasses stomatal behavior\
    \ in response to changing environmental variables that occur throughout the day."

    \ CASI (Itres Research Ltd., Calgary, AL, \nCanada) and thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech\
    \ Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) data were acquired at \nthree different times during\
    \ the day on a maize field (Zea mays L.) grown with three different \nirrigation\
    \ treatments. An intensive field campaign was also conducted concurrently with\
    \ \nimage acquisition to measure leaf ecophysiological parameters and the leaf\
    \ area index. The \nanalysis of the field data showed that maize plants were experiencing\
    \ moderate to severe \nwater stress in rainfed plots and a weaker stress condition\
    \ in the plots with a water deficit \nimposed between stem elongation and flowering.\
    \ Vegetation indices including the normalized \ndifference vegetation index (NDVI)\
    \ and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) computed \nfrom the CASI images,\
    \ sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F760) and canopy temperature \n(Tc) showed\
    \ different performances in describing the water stress during the day. During\
    \ the \nOPEN ACCESS\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n627 \n \n \nmorning overpass,\
    \ NDVI was the index with the highest discriminant power due to the \nsensitivity\
    \ of NDVI to maize canopy structure, affected by the water irrigation treatment.\
    \ As \nthe day progressed, processes related to heat dissipation through plant\
    \ transpiration became \nmore and more important and at midday Tc showed the best\
    \ performances. Furthermore,  \nTc retrieved from the midday image was the only\
    \ index able to distinguish all the three \nclasses of water status. Finally,\
    \ during the afternoon, PRI and F760 showed the best \nperformances. These results\
    \ demonstrate the feasibility to detect water stress using thermal \nand optical\
    \ airborne data, pointing out the importance of careful planning of the airborne\
    \ \nsurveys as a function of the specific aims of the study. \nKeywords: diurnal;\
    \ temperature; fluorescence; PRI; water stress; corn \n \n1. Introduction \nThe\
    \ prospects of water scarcity are increasing in many world areas [1] stimulating\
    \ the development \nof techniques enabling an efficient use of water in agriculture.\
    \ The minimization of water losses in \nagriculture is in fact a requisite to\
    \ release water resources to other sectors of society where demand is \nincreasing\
    \ [2]. In Italy, maize (Zea mays, L.) is a crop widely cultivated and with large\
    \ irrigation \nrequirements. The timely assessment of maize water status is important\
    \ for accurate irrigation scheduling \nand to avoid both waste of water and loss\
    \ of crop yield. \nPhotosynthesis is among the primary processes affected by water\
    \ stress as a result of both stomatal \nand non-stomatal (biochemical) limitations\
    \ [3]. Stomata closure is a common mechanism used by plants \nto prevent leaf\
    \ desiccation in response to water stress conditions. It generally occurs due\
    \ to a decline in \nleaf turgor and atmospheric vapor pressure along with root-generated\
    \ chemical signals causing a \nmeasurable reduction of leaf stomatal conductance\
    \ to water vapor [4] and transpiration rate. The decrease \nin evaporative cooling\
    \ causes an increase of vegetation temperature that can be tracked using thermal\
    \ \nimagery [5,6]. The relationship between vegetation temperature and transpiration\
    \ rates is affected by \nwater stress experienced by the plants but also by environmental\
    \ parameters, as the vapor pressure deficit \nof the air (VPD). The crop water\
    \ stress index (CWSI) [7] has been proposed to normalize the difference \nbetween\
    \ canopy temperature and air temperature (ΔT) by the evaporative demand. The CWSI\
    \ can be \ncomputed based on an empirical approach relating ΔT to the VPD of a\
    \ “non-water-stressed baseline” \nreferring to a well-watered crop transpiring\
    \ at the potential rate (for a recent review refer to [8]). \nAdditionally, when\
    \ photosynthesis is inhibited, as it is in water stress conditions, plants absorb\
    \ more \nenergy than can be used for photosynthesis. Plants react to such conditions\
    \ activating protective \nmechanisms to avoid light-induced oxidative damage.\
    \ These mechanisms consist in the dissipation of \nexcess excitation energy as\
    \ chlorophyll fluorescence and/or heat. Since these two occur in competition \n\
    with photosynthesis, variations of the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence and heat\
    \ dissipation have been \nexploited to detect stress-induced variations in photosystem\
    \ II efficiency [9]. Both sun-induced \nchlorophyll fluorescence (F760) and heat\
    \ dissipation can in principle be retrieved using hyperspectral \noptical data.\
    \ The heat dissipation can be detected using the Photochemical Reflectance Index\
    \ (PRI), \noriginally proposed [10] to track changes in the de-epoxidation state\
    \ of the xanthophyll cycle pigments, \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n628 \n\
    \ \n \nrelated to heat dissipation. PRI has been used to track photosynthesis\
    \ changes caused by water stress \nconditions with varying degrees of success\
    \ [11–14]. In particular, PRI has been shown to be able to track \nthe evolution\
    \ of maize water stress from the early phase when only the plant physiology is\
    \ affected [12] \nto the later ones when also plant structure changes [11], showing\
    \ higher potentiality than the traditional \ngreenness indices that hardly detect\
    \ early stress conditions. More recently, the estimation of sun-induced \nchlorophyll\
    \ fluorescence in the far-red region (at 760 nm) has been proven feasible from\
    \ remote sensors, \nand fluorescence has been evaluated as a novel remote measure\
    \ to detect plant physiological changes \ndue to environmental constraints [15,16].\
    \ \nIn this study, we used thermal and optical remote sensing imagery collected\
    \ from an airborne platform \nat three different times during the day (morning,\
    \ midday and afternoon) to detect maize water stress. An \nairborne campaign was\
    \ conducted with the visible and near infrared CASI 1500 (Itres Research Ltd.)\
    \ \nand thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech Inc.) sensors over an experimental maize field\
    \ treated with three \ndifferent irrigation regimes. As far as the authors know,\
    \ a comparison of the performances of different \nwater stress indicators derived\
    \ from both optical and thermal high resolution data during the day has not \n\
    been fully explored yet. A better understanding of the performances of different\
    \ remotely sensed water \nstress indicators is essential for farmers and service\
    \ providers to support agricultural management. \nThe specific objectives were\
    \ to: (i) determine the potential of using airborne optical and thermal image\
    \ \nacquisitions to detect different levels of water deficit in a maize field;\
    \ (ii) assess the performances of \neach radiometric quantity derived from the\
    \ images analyzed separately; (iii) compare different \nvegetation indices, canopy\
    \ temperature and CWSI to identify the best indicator of water stress at \ndifferent\
    \ times of the day and; (iv) the best time of the day for data collection and\
    \ mapping. \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. Experimental Area and Field Campaigns\
    \ \nThe study was conducted at the “Vittorio Tadini” experimental farm located\
    \ in Northern Italy at \nlatitude 44°58ʹ49.00ʹʹN, longitude 9°40ʹ48.50ʹʹE, elevation\
    \ 87 m a.s.l. Maize plants were sown on  \nJune 3, 2010 over an area of about\
    \ 1.2 ha. The field campaign was conducted between July 19 and 22, \n2010 (between\
    \ 46 and 49 days after sowing). Plants were in their pre-flowering stem elongation\
    \  \nstage [17] with an average of 10 leaves emerged. This timing was selected\
    \ for the survey because maize \nis more sensitive to water stress between the\
    \ elongation and flowering stage [18]. \nThree water regimes were randomly assigned:\
    \ rainfed, water deficit imposed between stem elongation \nand flowering and full\
    \ irrigation (Irr0, Irr1 and Irr2, respectively). Water regimes were applied according\
    \ \nto a split-plot experimental design with four blocks (Figure 1), being the\
    \ water regime, the whole-plot \ntreatment, crop species (maize and sorghum) and\
    \ the split-plot treatment. Irrigation requirements were \ncalculated from a daily\
    \ soil water balance: Irr2 plots were supplied with the volume of water needed\
    \ to \nbring Available Water Content (AWC) back to field capacity, whenever it\
    \ dropped below 70%; Irr1 \nplots were supplied with the volume of water needed\
    \ to keep AWC between 30% and 60%. Each subplot \nwas then divided into two more\
    \ plots, 15 × 16.5 m each, the first one not fertilized, the second one \nfertilized\
    \ with 100 kg·ha−1 to enhance the variability of the biophysical parameters. The\
    \ results shown \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n629 \n \n \nin the study refer\
    \ only to maize plots and include both nitrogen treatments. Further details about\
    \ the \nstudy site are reported in Panigada et al. [11] and Cilia et al. [19].\
    \ \n \nFigure 1. Experimental field location in Northern Italy and treatment scheme.\
    \ The irrigation \nlevels are shown as small circles in rainfed plots (Irr0),\
    \ medium circles in water deficit plots \n(Irr1) and large circles in full irrigation\
    \ plots (Irr2). Red circles indicate the position of the \ntwo infrared radiometer\
    \ sensors in the maize field. \n2.2. Canopy Temperature \nThermal data were taken\
    \ continuously on two maize plots, a rainfed (Irr0, plot 29) and a fully irrigated\
    \ \n(Irr2, plot 28) plot (Figure 1). The instruments used were two infrared radiometer\
    \ sensors SI-111 \n(Apogee, UT, USA) with a 22° half-angle field of view positioned\
    \ 3 m above the ground with an \ninclination of 45°. These measurements were collected\
    \ every 5 min and stored in a datalogger  \n(model CR10X, Campbell Sci., Logan,\
    \ UT, USA). The single-band infrared temperature sensors covered \nthe range between\
    \ 8 and 15 μm with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C. Air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity\
    \ \n(RH) were measured above the canopy with a portable weather station equipped\
    \ with Vaisala sensors. \nThe difference between crown and air temperature (ΔT)\
    \ was calculated using temperature data measured \nat the same time. ΔT was calculated\
    \ because it provides the gradient for the flow of sensible heat toward \nor away\
    \ from a vegetal surface, regulated by plant evapotranspiration [20]. Positive\
    \ values of ΔT \ncorrespond to flow of sensible heat away from the canopy, indicating\
    \ a reduction of transpiration rates. \n2.3. Field Data \nLeaf measurements were\
    \ collected between 11:00 and 12:30 UTC on July 19 and 20 on maize plots \nto\
    \ track the effects of water stress on crop condition and functioning. Measurements\
    \ were conducted on \nthe youngest fully expanded leaf. \n \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.\
    \ 2015, 4 \n630 \n \n \nThe efficiency of light reactions of photosynthesis was\
    \ measured on single leaves using the miniaturized \nFluorescence Yield Analyser\
    \ (Mini-PAM) (H. Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with a leaf clip holder \ndescribed\
    \ in Bilger et al. [21]. Measurements were conducted on 45 plants per treatment\
    \ (15 leaves from \nfifteen different plants in each plot, n = 360). The steady-state\
    \ value of fluorescence (Ft) was measured \nunder incident photosynthetic photon\
    \ flux density (PPFD) conditions and a saturating light pulse  \n(800 ms duration,\
    \ intensity ~4000 µmol·m−2·s−1) was superimposed on the prevailing environmental\
    \ \nlight level to measure the maximum light adapted fluorescence yield (F'm).\
    \ The effective quantum yield \nof photosystem II (ΔF/F'm), reflecting the fraction\
    \ of light utilized in photosystem II photochemistry at \na given light intensity,\
    \ was then calculated as (F'm − Ft)/F'm. \nLeaf CO2 exchanges were measured with\
    \ an open infrared gas exchange system (CIRAS-1, PP-Systems, \nStotfold, UK).\
    \ Measurements were performed at ambient CO2 concentrations and illumination using\
    \ a \nParkinson leaf chamber clamped to single leaves. Instantaneous net assimilation\
    \ (Ai) and stomatal \nconductance to water vapor (Gi) were recorded simultaneously\
    \ on three leaves from different plants from \nsix plots (block 2). \nThe relative\
    \ chlorophyll content (Chl) was measured with a SPAD 502 meter (Minolta, Tokyo,\
    \ Japan) \non 10 leaves from 10 different plants for each plot. The SPAD is a\
    \ non-destructive, hand-held instrument \nthat measures light attenuation at 650\
    \ nm (i.e., close to the maximum total chlorophyll absorption) and \n950 nm from\
    \ a 0.06 cm2 leaf area. Differences in light attenuation are converted in SPAD\
    \ unit, \nproportional to leaf chlorophyll concentration. \nLeaf samples for the\
    \ estimation of water content were collected in the twelve fertilized plots (four\
    \ \nleaves from different plants for each plot). The leaf equivalent water thickness\
    \ (EWT) and the relative \nwater content (RWC) were calculated according to the\
    \ following equations: \nܧܹܶ=ܨܹ−ܦܹ\nܣ (1)\nܴܹܥ=ܨܹ−ܦܹ\nܹܶ−ܦܹ (2)\nwhere FW is the\
    \ fresh weight of leaf disks with an area (A) of 3.8 cm2; DW is the dry weight\
    \ of the leaf \ndisks dried at 80 °C in an oven until constant weight; TW is the\
    \ turgid weight measured on the leaf disks \nimmersed for 72 h in distilled water,\
    \ blotted and weighed. \nFinally, the leaf area index (LAI, m2 m−2) and the photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation absorbed by \nvegetation (APAR) were measured in each plot\
    \ using a linear ceptometer in the PAR (Photosynthetically \nActive Radiation)\
    \ domain (SunScan Canopy Analysis System, Delta-T devices, Burwell, UK). \nMeasurements\
    \ were conducted according to the SunScan user manual [22]: incident and reflected\
    \ \nradiation was measured from about 0.5 m above the top of the canopy in each\
    \ plot; the direct to diffuse \nradiation ratio was estimated by conducting a\
    \ second incident radiation measurement after shadowing \nabout 1/4 of the probe\
    \ sensors (100 cm long); seven readings of transmitted solar radiation at ground\
    \ \nlevel were collected and averaged along a transect crossing two consecutive\
    \ crop rows. LAI was then \nestimated exploiting the SunScan internal software.\
    \ Leaf absorption in the PAR domain was assumed to \nbe equal to 0.85, while the\
    \ ellipsoidal leaf angle distribution parameter was set to 1.37 [23]. The APAR\
    \ \nwas computed as: \nܣܲܣܴ=ܲܣܴ௜−ܲܣܴ௧−ܲܣܴ௥(3)\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4\
    \ \n631 \n \n \nwhere PARi is the above-canopy incident PAR, PARt and PARr are\
    \ the transmitted and reflected  \nPAR, respectively. \n2.4. Airborne Hyperspectral\
    \ Imagery Acquisition and Processing Techniques \nAn airborne campaign was conducted\
    \ by the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aerospacial \n(INTA) on July 19.\
    \ Images were acquired with a CASI 1500 (Itres Research Ltd.) and an AHS-160 \n\
    (Sensytech Inc.) sensor. Three surveys were scheduled at 8:30, 11:30 and 14:30\
    \ UTC in order to \ncharacterize photoprotection, fluorescence and temperature\
    \ differences related to plant water stress \nduring the course of the day. The\
    \ sensors onboard the same airplane were flown at a relative height of \n1067\
    \ m to acquire AHS images with a 2.5 m pixel resolution and at 2013 m to acquire\
    \ CASI images at \n1 m pixel resolution. In Tables 1 and 2 the sensor and the\

    \ to the upper limit of the ΔT value of a canopy where \ntranspiration is completely\

    \ the data variance is explained by the factor \nirrigation. A high correlation\
    \ ratio (close to 1) means that the factor irrigation explains all the data variance.\
    \ \nThe relationships between field measurements and vegetation indices have been\
    \ assessed extracting \nmean reflectance spectra from an area centered in each\
    \ of the 24 maize plots (3 × 3 pixels for AHS and \n9 × 9 pixels for CASI corresponding\
    \ to 56 m2 and 81 m2, respectively). The analysis of the sensitivity \nof different\
    \ indices to the applied water regimes has been conducted extracting mean spectral\
    \ data from \nthe same areas. The effect of the irrigation treatment on the radiometric\
    \ quantities investigated in this \nstudy was tested with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis\
    \ test. \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Field Data \nThe deficit irrigation\
    \ regimes applied in this experiment caused a general decrease of different leaf\
    \ \nparameters as compared to the full irrigation regime. The percentage variation\
    \ of each parameter \ncompared to the value measured in the Irr2 plots is reported\
    \ in Table 4 together with the correlation ratio \ndescribing the effect of the\
    \ irrigation treatment on the measured parameters. \nThe CO2 instantaneous assimilation\
    \ (Ai) and instantaneous stomatal conductance (Gi) were the \nparameters most\
    \ affected by water regimes, with a decrease in Irr0 plots greater than 20% compared\
    \ to \nIrr2 plots. This is not surprising because stomatal conductance is one\
    \ of the most reliable indicators of \nwater stress as water stress induces stomatal\
    \ closure to reduce the transpiration rate and therefore the \nCO2 assimilation\
    \ rate. ΔF/Fm' showed a decrease of 15% in Irr0 plots, while leaf biochemical\
    \ parameters \n(Chl, EWT and RWC) showed a reduced variation caused by water regimes\
    \ with a maximum decline of \n6%. Plants reacted to water stress also by reducing\
    \ LAI. In fact, a reduction of 20.7% was observed from \nIrr2 to Irr1 and a reduction\
    \ of 31% from Irr2 to Irr0. However, LAI measurements were characterized \nby\
    \ a higher within-treatment variability (coefficient of variation of 17%, 30%\
    \ and 35% for Irr2, Irr1 and \nIrr0 plots, respectively) compared to leaf measurements,\
    \ lowering the amount of LAI variance explained \nby the factor irrigation (η2\
    \ = 0.42). It is interesting to note that the coefficient of variation of LAI\
    \ within \ntreatments increased as the water stress increased. \n \n \nISPRS Int.\

    \ majority \nof the day and finally started to decrease in the mid-afternoon following\
    \ the decrease in T air. On the \ncontrary, ΔT measured on the Irr2 plot showed\
    \ positive values only for about six hours during the day, \nfrom 9:00–15:00 local\
    \ solar time. Furthermore, the maximum ΔT value (0.9 °C) was considerably lower\
    \ \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n636 \n \n \nthan the maximum value recorded\
    \ in the Irr0 plot. In the first part of the morning and late afternoon, \nfully\
    \ irrigated maize plants had lower Tc than Ta due to the cooling effect of transpiration.\
    \ \nThe difference between canopy and air temperature is a reliable indicator\
    \ of water status [7] and  \nthe observed ΔT difference between the two plots\
    \ can be attributed to restricted transpiration due to \nwater limitation in Irr0\
    \ causing an increase in canopy temperature. The relationship between plant water\
    \ \nstress and Tc is well known, due to the fact that water deficit induces a\
    \ decrease of leaf stomatal \nconductance, as observed in Table 4, with a consequent\
    \ reduction of the evapo-transpiration rate and  \nan increase of leaf/canopy\
    \ temperature [37]. The close link between ΔT and stomatal conductance is \nconfirmed\
    \ by the significant relationship between the average ΔT values extracted from\
    \ the AHS map \nand field measurements of Gi collected simultaneously to the midday\
    \ airborne overpass (R2 = 0.58,  \np < 0.05, n = 6) (Figure 3a). ΔT showed the\
    \ best fitting with ΔF/Fm' (R2 = 0.66, p < 0.001, n = 24)  \n(Figure 3b). ΔF/Fm'\
    \ is related to plant photosynthetic efficiency and it has been often used as\
    \ indicator \nof plant status. In this study, ΔF/Fm' is highly correlated with\
    \ Gi (r = 0.96) thus can be regarded as an \nindicator of leaf photosynthetic\
    \ efficiency due to water stress comparable to Gi. However, we are aware \nof\
    \ the fact that for a wider range of values, the relationship between ΔF/Fm' and\
    \ Gi would not be linear, \ncompromising the possibility to use ΔF/Fm' as indicator\
    \ of water stress. A strong relationship between \nΔT and leaf EWT was also observed\
    \ (R2 = 0.52, p < 0.01, n = 12). \n \nFigure 3. Relationship between image-based\

    \ and p values of the linear regressions are reported. \nMaps of Tc computed for\
    \ each overpass over the 24 maize plots are shown in Figure 4. \nMaximum canopy\
    \ temperatures corresponded to rainfed plots reaching values of 40 °C at midday.\
    \ \nThe temperature of the stressed canopies was greater than Ta by a maximum\
    \ difference of about 11 °C. \nWell-watered plots had lower Tc than Ta, particularly\
    \ during the afternoon, due to the cooling effect  \nof transpiration. \nThe accuracy\
    \ of the maps has been evaluated comparing the average Tc value measured on ground\

    \ the airborne sensor are slightly lower than those measured on ground and the\
    \ \nunderestimation tends to increase with Tc (slope of the regression line equal\
    \ to 0.88). Differences can \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n637 \n \n \nbe\

    \ three water treatments (average of four plots each) derived \nfrom the AHS images\
    \ (Figure 6) are similar to those observed on the ground (Figure 2). Mean plot\

    \ with the mean \ntemperature of the rainfed plots being from 3 °C–4.7 °C warmer\
    \ than the irrigated treatment Irr2 in the \nmorning and at midday, respectively.\
    \ \nThe difference between water treatments was maximized at midday with all three\
    \ treatments being \nstatistically different according to the Kruskal–Wallis test.\
    \ On the contrary, the intermediate treatment \nIrr1 was not distinguishable from\
    \ the other two during the morning and afternoon overflights. Even \nthough Tc\
    \ and ΔT have been considered reliable indicators of water stress starting from\
    \ 1970–1980 [7], \nchanges in Tc during the day only recently have been proposed\
    \ as an indicator [38]. The change between \nthe morning and midday Tc was found\
    \ here to correlate with Gi with an R2 of 0.65, while the change \nbetween midday\
    \ and afternoon Tc yielded to a weaker relation (R2 = 0.22, n = 6). Thus, careful\

    \ n = 24) confirming previous results [11] obtained on the same study \nsite using\
    \ the AISA Eagle hyperspectral airborne sensor (Specim, Finland). \nPRI and F760\
    \ were significantly related to leaf ΔF/Fm' measurements (R2 = 0.46, p < 0.001\
    \ and R2 = 0.39, \np = 0.004, n = 24, for PRI and F760, respectively), while the\
    \ relationship with Gi was significant only \nwith PRI (R2 = 0.65, p = 0.05, n\
    \ = 6). Interestingly, the relationships between ΔF/Fm' and Gi and Fy760 \nare\
    \ both significant and with higher determination coefficients compared to those\
    \ between ΔF/Fm' and \nGi and F760 (R2 = 0.44, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.51, p = 0.11\
    \ for ΔF/Fm' and Gi, respectively). It is worth \nnoting that while F760 was positively\
    \ related to ΔF/Fm', the sign of the relationship changes when we \nnormalize\
    \ F760 by APAR (Fy760). This means that stressed plants emitted more fluorescence\
    \ per unit of \nabsorbed PAR radiation. Further studies are needed to confirm\
    \ this observation for different species, \nphenological stages and experimental\

    \ midday and comparable values in the \nmorning and afternoon. Irr2 plots had\
    \ always higher NDVI values followed by Irr1 and Irr0 plots.  \nOnly Irr0 and\
    \ Irr2 plots were statistically different. NDVI diurnal course is similar between\
    \ the three \ntreatments and can be explained by variations in the sun-target-sensor\
    \ geometry during the day affecting \nthe bidirectional reflectance distribution\
    \ function (BRDF) and by the canopy elements in the sensor field \nof view. TCARI/OSAVI\
    \ related to Chl content showed a reduced variability between treatments \n(differences\
    \ not statistically significant) and also an almost absent diurnal shape. The\
    \ weak relationship \nbetween TCARI/OSAVI and water stress is in agreement with\
    \ results of the field data analysis showing \nthat plants reacted to water stress\
    \ by reducing LAI rather than Chl that was in fact weakly affected by \nthe irrigation\
    \ level (maximum reduction of 5.7% compared to Irr2 plots). This can be explained\
    \ \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n641 \n \n \nconsidering that leaf elongation\
    \ is among the plant processes most sensitive to water shortage [41]. Water \n\
    deficit induces a reduction of plant growth rate, and consequently LAI, before\
    \ triggering the degradation \nof leaf pigments. VARI showed a behavior similar\
    \ to that of NDVI. The main differences are that VARI \nenhanced differences between\
    \ Irr0 plots and the other two groups at midday and differences between \nIrr2\
    \ and the other two groups during the afternoon. \nThe diurnal changes of PRI\
    \ are expected to be affected by both BRDF and absorption changes due to \nxanthophyll\
    \ pigments depoxidation caused by diurnal water stress changes. Even if previous\
    \ studies \nhave demonstrated that the PRI index is sensitive to water stress\
    \ levels, they also report that it is  \naffected by the confounding effects of\
    \ absorption of photosynthetic pigments, canopy structure, and \nbackground [12,42,43].\
    \ \nF760 showed a diurnal trend mirroring the one of the incident photosynthetically\
    \ photon flux density \nwith higher values in Irr2 plots followed by Irr1 and\
    \ then Irr0 plots. On the contrary, Fy*760 shows a \nmore stable daily course\
    \ (Figure 8f) with the lowest values observed in Irr0 and the highest in Irr2\
    \ plots. \nThis confirmed results obtained in previous studies where the F760\
    \ was lowered in plots with deficient \nwater supply [11]. Again, only Irr0 and\
    \ Irr2 plots were statistically different in terms of both F760 and \nFy*760.\
    \ However, the spectral resolution of the CASI sensor is not optimal for the estimation\
    \ of F760 and \nwe cannot exclude that the lower performances of F760 in stress\
    \ detection compared to Tc could be \npartially explained by F760 estimations\
    \ not accurate enough. A new airborne sensor specifically intended for \nsun-induced\
    \ chlorophyll fluorescence estimation has been recently developed by the Forschungszentrum\
    \ \nJülich (Germany) in cooperation with the Finnish company Specim [44] and will\
    \ open the possibility to \nfully verify the potential of fluorescence for stress\
    \ detection with the best currently available spectral \nand radiometric resolution\
    \ in the red and far-red regions. \n3.5. Synthesis of Thermal and Optical Data\
    \ \nResults obtained from both the AHS and CASI images at different times of the\
    \ day have been \nsummarized in Table 5 where the indices previously analyzed\
    \ separately have been listed according to \ntheir non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis\
    \ statistic. Indices listed first are those showing variations attributed \nto\
    \ water stress the most. NDVI performs better in discriminating different water\
    \ stress levels during the \nmorning flight. We propose the following explanation\
    \ for this finding. NDVI has been shown to be \nsensitive to LAI; thus, the highest\
    \ ranking observed during the morning can be attributed to differences \nin LAI\
    \ values between plots irrigated with different water regimes. Structural LAI\
    \ differences are the \nmost evident during the morning because plants have not\
    \ yet completely activated the dynamic \nmechanisms to cope with water stress.\
    \ Thus, differences in biophysical and structural characteristics of \nthe maize\
    \ canopy due to the long term stress imposed have the strongest influence on the\
    \ measured \nsignal. As the day progresses, differences due to the regulation\
    \ of evapotranspiration driven by water \navailability become predominant and\
    \ ΔT performs better in discriminating different water levels. This \nreasoning\
    \ is corroborated by the fact that the performance of NDVI is not lowered dramatically\
    \ during \nthe day, while the performance of other indicators (ΔT at noon, PRI\
    \ in the afternoon) that is improved \nwith respect to the morning overpass. During\
    \ the afternoon, irrigated plants may have reduced their \nregulation capacity\
    \ through evapotranspiration due to high Ta and potential limitations in water\
    \ \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n642 \n \n \navailability typical of a full,\
    \ sunny day. At this time, PRI and F760 are the parameters differing the most\
    \ \namong treatments. \nTable 5. Ranking of different indices derived from both\
    \ the AHS and CASI indices for  \nthe three overpasses based on the non-parametric\
    \ Kruskal–Wallis test. The value of the \nKruskal–Wallis statistic is reported\
    \ within brackets. \nMorning \nMidday \nAfternoon \nNDVI (11.045) \nTc and ΔT\

    \ ΔT (10.205) \nTCARI/OSAVI (2.195) \nTCARI/OSAVI (1.34) \nTCARI/OSAVI (0.32)\
    \ \nThe ranking of best performing indices can be used to empirically identify\
    \ the most suitable time \ninterval for obtaining airborne images to be used to\
    \ monitor crop water status. The optimum time to \nacquire thermal images is around\
    \ noon, confirming previous results obtained by Bellvert et al. [45]  \nin vineyards.\
    \ Better performances of ΔT around noon can be also partially explained considering\
    \ that in \nthe morning and afternoon images, the mutual shading of leaves increases\
    \ causing different degrees of \nstomatal conductance within the canopy and lowering\
    \ the relationship between ΔT and water stress. \nNDVI performed evenly during\
    \ the course of the day. This is because it tracked variations induced by \nwater\
    \ stress on canopy structure and green biomass that are expected not to vary during\
    \ the course of \none day. However, NDVI is expected to work only when the stress\
    \ induces a variation in canopy biomass \nand structure. In a previous study by\
    \ the authors [12], NDVI was not able to detect a moderate water \nstress condition,\
    \ affecting the plant physiological status but not the canopy structure. PRI and\
    \ fluorescence \nappears to be more discriminant in the afternoon overpass. \n\
    We cannot exclude though, a superimposed effect of changing illumination geometry\
    \ during the day, \nnot easily quantified, which could partially explain the changes\
    \ in the relative performances of optical \nindices, fluorescence and temperature\
    \ observed during the day. \n4. Conclusions \nWith increasing water scarcity in\
    \ many areas of the world, suitable indicators of crop water status are \nbecoming\
    \ more and more relevant to assist in precision irrigation management. In this\
    \ study, airborne \nremote sensing data acquired with the hyperspectral CASI and\
    \ AHS sensors were used to detect water \nstress in maize at three different levels\
    \ of irrigation. \nField data showed that at the time of the overpasses maize\
    \ plants were experiencing a mild to severe \nwater stress in rainfed plots and\
    \ a weaker stress condition in the plots with water deficit imposed between \n\
    stem elongation and flowering. The performances of different vegetation indices,\
    \ F760 and ΔT in water \nstress detection were evaluated using three airborne\
    \ overpasses conducted in the morning, midday  \nand afternoon. \nThe study demonstrated\
    \ the feasibility of using high resolution optical and thermal images to detect\
    \ \nconditions of water deficit in a maize field. The optimum time to differentiate\
    \ different water stress \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n643 \n \n \nconditions\
    \ was around noon using thermal images. PRI and F760 (Fy*760) showed the best\
    \ performances \nin the afternoon. NDVI performed evenly throughout the day, being\
    \ able to detect differences among \nplots due to canopy biomass and structure\
    \ and not due to leaf physiology. The slope of the evolution of \nTc during the\
    \ morning was well correlated with stomata conductance and is proposed as a promising\
    \ \nindicator to track water status. Its main advantage relative to single-time\
    \ measurements of temperature \nis that it encompasses stomatal behavior in response\
    \ to the evolution of meteorological variables during \nthe day. \nAcknowledgments\

    \ \n \nAbstract \nThermal imaging has shown potential to assist with many aspects\
    \ of irrigation management that include \nscheduling application of water and\
    \ detecting leaking irrigation canals and delivery systems. There are particular\
    \ \nchallenges for use of thermal imaging for scheduling irrigation in humid subtropical\
    \ climates, which include the \nneed for fine delineation of canopy temperatures\
    \ under low vapor pressure deficits, proper accounting for \nmicrometeorological\
    \ conditions, and altitude effects on canopy temperature represented at the camera.\
    \ A review \nof pertinent issues involved in using thermal methods for sensing\
    \ canopy temperature is presented that can be \napplied to the imaging problem.\
    \ Altitude effects were demonstrated in a new field experiment, and multiple \n\
    regression was used to indicate and model weather and altitude effects. The use\
    \ of spatial statistics was shown to \nenhance the value of thermal imagery using\
    \ sensor fusion. Thermal imagery was also useful in detecting leakage \nfrom irrigation\
    \ systems in the context of overall irrigation system management.  \nKeywords:\

    \ statistics \n1. Introduction \nCanopy temperature has proven its utility for\
    \ detection of crop water stress over large field scales, but has yet to \nfind\
    \ widespread acceptance as a tool for water management based on canopy temperature\
    \ status. Temperature of \na crop canopy is related to general physiological status\
    \ of the crop (Inoue, 1990), which includes photosynthesis, \nrespiration, and\
    \ stomatal conductance. As crop water status is a major component influencing\
    \ canopy \ntemperature, remote measurement of this variable over pertinent phenological\
    \ stages could optimize water \napplication amounts.  \nThe use of canopy temperature\
    \ for water management in humid subtropical climates is considered problematic\
    \ \nwith current technologies. As the crop begins to show signs of stress, small\
    \ increases in canopy temperature can \nbe difficult to detect with adequate resolution\
    \ (Thomson and Sullivan, 2006). Prevailing low vapor-pressure \ndeficit (VPD),\
    \ which is characteristic of a humid subtropical climate, reduces the magnitude\
    \ of natural crop \nwww.ccsenet.org/jas                        Journal of Agricultural\

    \ by evaporation. Compounding the problem is frequent and periodic cloud cover\
    \ (characteristic of this \nclimate), which rapidly alters canopy temperature\
    \ (Pennington and Heatherly, 1989). Inoue (1990) acknowledges \nthat physiological\
    \ measurements cannot be analyzed and interpreted correctly without concurrent\
    \ \nmicrometeorological data. New technological approaches are thus needed to\
    \ overcome these complications so \ncrop- and soil-specific needs can be met with\
    \ the assistance of thermal detection methods. In this paper, we \nexamine pertinent\
    \ research and present new experiments illustrating use of canopy temperature\
    \ as a basis for \ndetermining temporal changes in crop water stress. The review\
    \ portion is not all-inclusive but attempts to \nhighlight issues of particular\
    \ significance. We discuss positive aspects as well as challenges for using thermal\
    \ \ntechniques from aircraft-based remote sensing platforms and introduce a method\
    \ that uses a fusion of visible, \nnear infrared (NIR), and thermal imagery coupled\
    \ with spatial statistics to help identify areas prone to early \nwater/heat stress\
    \ in highly heterogeneous cotton fields, early senescence promoted by water/heat\
    \ stress, and field \nareas that might require variable application of defoliants/harvesting\
    \ aids. Thermal imagery has been beneficial \nfor our work in supporting irrigation\
    \ system diagnostics, and examples are presented for detection of water \nleakage\
    \ from irrigation canals and polypipe systems. \n2. Background - thermal Sensing\
    \ for Detection of Crop Water Stress \n2.1 Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)  \n\
    Canopy-to-air temperature difference (CATD) can provide information on crop energy\
    \ status. As the leaf \ntranspires, it cools relative to the surrounding air;\
    \ however as water becomes limiting, transpiration is reduced \nand the leaf temperature\
    \ increases. Under certain environmental conditions, this measurement alone may\
    \ be \nsufficient to determine water stress for specific crops (Gardner et al.,\
    \ 1992a, 1992b). Most of the successful work \nin this area has been accomplished\
    \ in arid, semiarid, or Mediterranean climates, as large CATD permit adequate\
    \ \nsensitivity for water management. Mathematical relationships using canopy\
    \ temperature have been developed \nwith an eye on practical irrigation scheduling\
    \ (Pinter and Reginato, 1981; Stockle and Dugas, 1992; Colaizzi et \nal., 2003;\
    \ Cohen et al., 2005).  \nA well known index that indicates a relationship between\
    \ canopy temperature and the difference between “well \nwatered baseline” and\
    \ “high stress” canopy temperatures is the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) (Jackson\
    \ et al., \n1981). Most studies have used the crop-water stress index (CWSI) for\
    \ full canopies; however, complications \narise when attempting to apply this\
    \ index in fields with partial canopy cover. Regardless of the climate \ncharacteristics\
    \ (humid or arid), early season CWSI values are particularly difficult to obtain\
    \ with partial canopies. \nIn the early growing season when plants are small or\
    \ populations are sparse, a portion of the soil surface is \nusually viewable\
    \ by infrared thermometer when canopy temperature measurements are made (Irmak\
    \ et al., 2000). \nAlthough ground-based infrared sensing systems and hand-held\
    \ devices could be physically manipulated to \nprovide temperature of the canopy\
    \ only by viewing at oblique angles or close-up, a more realistic approach is\
    \ to \nconsider the effect of soil cover and develop methods to determine the\
    \ relative influence of canopy and soil on \nremotely sensed temperature. Moran\
    \ et al. (1994) developed a method to combine spectral vegetation indices \nwith\
    \ composite surface temperature measurement to allow application of CWSI theory\
    \ to partially vegetated \nfields. The authors developed a vegetation index/temperature\
    \ (VIT) bounded trapezoid to plot surface-air \ntemperature difference against\
    \ fractional vegetation cover.  \nEmekli et al. (2007) evaluated the CWSI for\
    \ irrigation scheduling of bermudagrass using infrared thermometry. \nThe authors\
    \ examined four irrigation treatments corresponding to levels of evaporation as\
    \ measured by Class A \nevaporation pan; a non-irrigated treatment was also implemented.\
    \ Both soil water content and potential were \nmonitored using a neutron probe\
    \ and tensiometers, and CWSI values were empirically determined. In this study,\
    \ \nthe visual quality of bermudagrass was monitored seasonally using a Munsell\
    \ color scale. The authors concluded \nthat the CWSI could be used as a criterion\
    \ for irrigation timing of bermudagrass, and an acceptable color quality \ncould\
    \ be sustained seasonally if the CWSI value stayed below about 0.10. Kar and Kumar\
    \ (2007) used a lower \nand upper limit for calculation of the CWSI in groundnut\
    \ under irrigated ecosystem. The lower baseline was \ndeveloped with linear regression\
    \ analysis for measurements in the cold season after the crops had received full\
    \ \nirrigation on humid and dry days, whereas the upper limit was determined by\
    \ monitoring plants and recording \nwhen the transpiration rate closely approached\
    \ zero. Kashefipour et al. (2006) defined a linear relationship \nbetween yield\
    \ and CWSI for Spring Corn by implementing five irrigation treatments. Maximum\
    \ yield occurred \nat a CWSI value of 0.05 and maximum water productivity occurred\
    \ at a CWSI of 0.15 for their experiment.     \nIdso (1982) indicated the importance\
    \ of accurately specifying the non-stressed baseline for CWSI calculation. \n\
    Baseline from an artificial wet reference surface (Meron et al., 2003) was used\
    \ to specify the wet CWSI baseline, \nTcm for a study by Cohen et al. (2005),\
    \ who used the CWSI to estimate leaf water potential. Use of this reference \n\

    \ and Education \n105\nsurface greatly simplified use of the CWSI, as it was easy\
    \ to maintain as compared with well-watered crop \nsections. The authors used\
    \ a Thermacam model PM545 thermal imaging camera mounted 5-m above the ground,\
    \ \npointing downward to image the canopy. Camera resolution was adequate to distinguish\
    \ leaves from soil so only \nleaves could be analyzed. The authors found very\
    \ good correlation between CWSI and leaf water potential \nmeasured using an ARIMAD\
    \ 1 pressure chamber. Alchanitis et al. (2010) compared theoretical and empirical\
    \ \napproaches for estimating leaf water potential and found that empirical temperature\
    \ baselines performed better \nthan those derived from energy balance equations.\
    \ Normalization of the CWSI can be complicated under \nchanging atmospheric conditions.\
    \ Grant et al. (2007) addressed the issue of leaf angle and suggested that average\
    \ \ntemperatures over the canopy containing several leaves within the measurement\
    \ area could reduce the impact \nleaf angle variation in grapevine. The authors\
    \ indicated that thermal imaging can be useful to detect stressed vs. \nnon-stressed\
    \ areas as their thermal measurements vs. porometry (indicating stomatal conductance)\
    \ have \nsuggested. Alchanatis et al. (2006) indicated the difficulties present\
    \ in adopting the crop water stress index \n(CWSI) for practical irrigation management.\
    \ Temperatures of the relevant crop canopy, of the general leaf \npopulation,\
    \ and of the soil background can be mixed, altering the represented value of canopy\
    \ temperature. \nPractical use of the index will require methodologies to automatically\
    \ process thermal and associated imagery, \nwhich includes partitioning of shaded\
    \ and exposed portions of the canopy (Jiménez-Bello et al., 2011). The \nauthors\
    \ developed a system to automatically analyze and process simultaneous thermal\
    \ and RGB imagery; the \nlatter used to identify vegetative portions from the\
    \ image using unsupervised classification. \n2.2 Time-temperature Thresholds \
    \ \nResearchers have used the canopy temperature measured by infrared thermometer\
    \ (IRT) with time thresholds to \nassist with practical irrigation scheduling\
    \ (Wanjura et al., 1995; Mahan et al., 2005). The idea was to signal \nirrigation\
    \ based on the amount of time a crop-specific canopy temperature threshold is\
    \ exceeded by modeling the \nCWSI as a function of environmental factors. The\
    \ amount of time that calculated canopy temperature is above \nthe threshold temperature\
    \ can be used to schedule irrigation. Peters and Evett (2008) developed a completely\
    \ \nautomated center pivot irrigation system based on this concept. Canopy temperature\
    \ data were logged from \nsixteen calibrated IRTs on the center pivot lateral.\
    \ Minutes that the canopy temperature as read by IRTs \nexceeded a threshold temperature\
    \ were accumulated during the day. If the daily total exceeded the time threshold\
    \ \nat the end of the day, irrigation of a fixed depth was initiated. The authors\
    \ did not accumulate time at all for their \ntime-temperature threshold method\
    \ if relative humidity was too high (VPD too low). Yield of soybeans was \ncompared\
    \ between irrigation scheduled using the time-temperature threshold method and\
    \ weekly scheduled \nirrigation using a neutron probe to determine the amount\
    \ of water required to replenish the profile to field \ncapacity. No significant\
    \ differences were found between water use efficiency or yield between the two\
    \ \nscheduling methods.  \n2.3 Plant Response to Variations in Solar Radiation\
    \  \nNo matter which scheme is developed to utilize canopy-air temperature difference\
    \ for determination of crop \nwater stress, plant response to varying solar radiation\
    \ and cloud cover effects needs to be considered. Variable \ninsolation is prevalent\
    \ in humid regions and it is thus especially critical to adequately resolve CATD\
    \ during \nperiods of low vapor-pressure deficit. To help quantify these cloud\
    \ cover effects, Pennington and Heatherly \n(1989) logged solar radiation using\
    \ a pyranometer and canopy temperature using an infrared temperature sensor. \n\
    The authors then plotted solar radiation (SR) against canopy-air temperature difference\
    \ for cotton, and obtained a \ngood linear fit but with a fair amount of scatter\
    \ (R2 = 0.84). The canopy typically took about 100 s to stabilize to \na new temperature\
    \ after a cloud passed over the field. When these time lags were accounted for,\
    \ a much better fit \nof the canopy-air temperature difference/solar radiation\
    \ data (R2 = 0.98) was obtained.  \n2.4 Aerial Determination of Canopy Temperature\
    \  \nImaging sensors have been used on aerial platforms to determine canopy and\
    \ soil temperature. These systems \nhave the potential for rapidly determining\
    \ the onset of water stress in the whole field or sections of a field. \nThermal\
    \ sensing from easily scheduled aerial platforms might hold the key to practical\
    \ adoption of canopy \ntemperature-based technologies for irrigation scheduling\
    \ if proper application and analysis techniques are \nemployed.  \nEarly work\
    \ by Bartholic et al. (1972) used an airplane-mounted Texas Instruments (TI) RS-14\
    \ scanner to \nmeasure thermal radiance in the 8 to14 µm wavelength interval.\
    \ A radiance difference of 6 C was observed \nbetween the most and least water-stressed\
    \ plots. Heilman et al. (1976) used an aerial thermal scanner at aircraft \naltitudes\
    \ of 610 and 1220 m to measure canopy temperatures for estimation of evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET). \nAtmospheric attenuation produced errors of 1 to 6 C in scanner measurements,\
    \ so a correction procedure relating \nwww.ccsenet.org/jas                   \

    \ 1916-9760 \n106\ntemperature error to atmospheric perceptible water was applied.\
    \ Relative errors ranged from +62.5 to -43.6% \nbetween lysimetric and model-based\
    \ estimates of ET. The effect of temperature error on ET was partially \ninfluenced\
    \ by thermal diffusion resistance, which was derived from wind and air temperature\
    \ profiles. Smith et \nal. (1989) studied how radiative surface temperature of\
    \ a water-stressed crop could be used to indicate sources of \nvariability in\
    \ soil characteristics. Instrumentation included a Daedalus thermal scanner (DEI-100)\
    \ with a \n120-degree field-of-view, mounted in an aircraft flown at 1000-m altitude.\
    \ The authors also measured \nground-based surface temperatures with an Everest\
    \ Interscience Series 100 handheld IR thermometer. Analysis \nof data indicated\
    \ patterns in radiative surface temperature obtained using the aerial system could\
    \ be related to \nspatial differences in soil type and water availability under\
    \ complete crop cover.  \nAs part of a multifaceted remote sensing program, Goodrich\
    \ et al. (1998), Qi et al. (1998), and Moran et al. \n(1998) used an Agrometrics\
    \ single-band thermal video system to measure surface temperatures for ET \ndetermination\
    \ over a riparian zone. The aerial system gave 0.5 m ground resolution and covered\
    \ spectral \nwavelengths of 8 to 12 µm. Preliminary results from Qi et al. (1998)\
    \ showed that spatial ET could be mapped \nusing thermal images obtained from\
    \ the single-channel Agrometrics sensor. Micrometeorological factors such as \n\
    wind speed and solar radiation seemed to influence transpiration more than stomatal\
    \ conductance for a study on \ngrassland (Shimoda and Oikawa, 2008). González-Dugo\
    \ et al., (2006) indicated that canopy temperature \ndetermined by aerial remote\
    \ sensing (ATLAS sensor) was very sensitive to variations in plant water stress\
    \ for \nmoderately stressed crops and had a linear relationship with CWSI. This\
    \ has positive implications for irrigation \nscheduling since canopy temperature\
    \ within the moderate stress range is where most irrigation decisions are \nmade.\
    \ Berni et al. (2009) used an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with both a thermal\
    \ and six-band \nmultispectral camera to map biophysical parameters and crop water\
    \ stress. This image fusion technique \ndetermined the potential of using the\
    \ multispectrally-based photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to map crop \nwater\
    \ stress. PRI was well correlated with canopy temperature, and the study highlighted\
    \ the importance of \natmospheric correction as a function of acquisition altitude.\
    \ Thomson et al. (2005) used a Raytheon Palm-IR \nthermal imaging camera, which\
    \ indicated visible differences in canopy temperature before and after irrigation.\
    \ \nHowever, varying cloud cover appeared to alter image contrast and relative\
    \ temperature representations within a \nfield for other image pairs. Temperature\
    \ effects due to shading have been determined or modeled (Zhang et al., \n2001;\
    \ Leinonen and Jones, 2004), and their observations of cloud cover effects were\
    \ consistent with those of \nPennington and Heatherly (1989).   \n3. New Experiments\
    \ Using Thermal Imagery for Crop Water Stress Detection and Irrigation System\
    \ \nDiagnostics \n3.1 Environmental Effects on Representation of Canopy Temperature\
    \ and Temporal Crop Response to Water Stress \n3.1.1 Procedures \nThermal imagery\
    \ was obtained of a field planted in soybeans (Glycine max) at the USDA ARS Mechanization\
    \ \nFarm near Stoneville, MS, USA. Soil moisture data were obtained to give an\
    \ indirect indication of pending crop \nwater stress that could be associated\
    \ with readings from both ground-based and aerial canopy-temperature \nsensors.\
    \ Previous research showed little correlation (r = 0.22) between data from soil\
    \ water sensors and \ncanopy-air temperature difference as measured by ground-based\
    \ IRTs (Thomson et al., 2005). However, other \nvariables that could influence\
    \ readings from the IRTs were not accounted for. More importantly however, soil\
    \ \nwater sensors measure water potential within a small zone of influence in\
    \ the soil and variability is expected to \nbe high within a field. In our case,\
    \ soil water sensors provided useful information on wetting trends due to \nrainfall\
    \ or irrigation and drying trends for comparison of imagery on a temporal basis.\
    \ For fine textured alluvial \nsoils typical of the Midsouth US, soil drying in\
    \ excess of one week before irrigation commences is not \nuncommon.  \nWatermark\
    \ 200-SS soil water sensors (SWS) were installed at four stations and at three\
    \ depths per station (23, 46, \nand 69 cm) of a center pivot irrigated field of\
    \ soybeans (Fig. 1, Fig. 6) planted in a clay soil of the Sharkey series \n(very-fine,\
    \ smectitic, thermic Chromic Epiaquerts). In the early morning, these sensors\
    \ were read along with \nreadings of leaf temperature (three leaves per station)\
    \ using both an Exergen IRT/C-K-80F/27C and Apogee \nIRTS-Pc precision IRT; the\
    \ latter was purchased with custom calibration coefficients. Air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, and wind speeds were measured at the moment of fly-over\
    \ using a Kestrel 4000 Pocket Weather \nTracker (Table 1). Photosynthetically\
    \ Active Radiation (PAR) was measured using a Li-cor Li-191SB quantum \nsensor\
    \ and Li-1000 data logger. Except for the Watermark readings, measurements were\
    \ repeated in the early \nafternoon. Rainfall and irrigation amounts (Fig. 2)\
    \ were measured using a Productive Alternatives rain gauge.  \nwww.ccsenet.org/jas\

    An Electrophysics PV-320T thermal imaging camera (320 X 240 pixel resolution)\
    \ was used in an Air Tractor \n402B agricultural airplane (Fig. 3) to obtain thermal\
    \ imagery in the 7 -14 µm spectral range. The pilot was \ninstructed to fly at\
    \ an altitude of approximately 457 m (1500 ft) over the 3-ha field between 10:30\
    \ and 13:30 for \nall flights. Approximate altitudes for each flight were recorded\
    \ by the Satloc Airstar M3 GPS receiver with Wide \nArea Augmentation System (WAAS)\
    \ differential correction. Although vertical accuracy is only within 6 m \ntypically\
    \ for WAAS-corrected receivers (Wilson, 2011), this was deemed to be adequate\
    \ as long as an offset was \napplied to account for inaccuracy of represented\
    \ elevation at ground-level. \nImages were captured and processed using Electrophysics\
    \ Velocity 2.1 image analysis software. For a \nreasonable span and good resolution\
    \ of temperature represented by the images, a range between 28 and 33 C (83 \n\
    and 93 F) was chosen. Within this range, the maximum temperature difference within\
    \ the field was typically \nabout 3 to 4 C. Temperatures could be represented\
    \ either by digital numbers (DNs), energy values, or actual \ntemperature. Because\
    \ temperature resolution was greater using DNs, a relationship of DN vs. temperature\
    \ was \nmade within the temperature range chosen. \n3.1.2 Results \nOver a full\
    \ canopy, canopy temperature represented by the camera was 4 to 6 C cooler than\
    \ temperatures \nmeasured of single leaves using Apogee precision IRTs. This difference\
    \ was smaller when the IRTs measured \nseveral leaves of a single plant later\
    \ in the season, taking care not to include soil background. Subsequent \nanalysis\
    \ indicated a linear influence of altitude on canopy temperature (Fig. 4). Data\
    \ for Fig. 4 were obtained at \nseveral altitudes flown by the pilot over the\
    \ same field. Since pixel resolution depended on altitude and a single \npoint\
    \ would represent different ground area at different heights, a field of soybeans\
    \ in a uniform well-irrigated \nfield of Sharkey series clay soil was chosen that\
    \ exhibited spatially uniform canopy temperature as determined \nby thermal imaging.\
    \ The pilot flew upwards in a spiral fashion and back down to obtain several data\
    \ points. \nUsing the Electrophysics Velocity 2.1 software, canopy temperatures\
    \ were later extracted from the same spatial \nlocation of uniform temperature\
    \ on the image. All weather variables were obtained the instant a single altitude\
    \ \nwas flown.  \nMultiple Regression Analysis using SAS 9.1.3 indicated that\
    \ altitude explained 58% of the variability in canopy \ntemperature (Fig. 4).\
    \ Standard error of the estimate = 0.59 and the model was statistically significant\
    \ at the 0.01 \nlevel. With additional variables introduced, [Altitude + PAR]\
    \ accounted for 73% of the variability in canopy \ntemperature and [RH + altitude]\
    \ accounted for 76 % of the variability in canopy temperature.  \nOne temperature\
    \ value was also obtained as a cloud passed over (not shown in Fig 4). When the\
    \ regression was \nre-cast with this data point included (Fig. 5), altitude then\
    \ explained 41% of the variability in canopy temperature. \nStandard error of\
    \ the estimate = 0.81 and the model was statistically significant at the 0.05\
    \ level. With additional \nvariables introduced, [Altitude + PAR] accounted for\
    \ 76 % of the variability in canopy temperature. When \nrelative humidity (RH)\
    \ or (Air Temperature)2 was added to the model as a third variable, R2 increased\
    \ to 0.87.  \nThe effects indicated above accounted for much of the differences\
    \ in canopy temperature, but canopy shading \nappeared also to be a significant\
    \ effect as a single pixel from the camera represented a composite of shaded and\
    \ \nsunlit leaves. This is due to the limited spatial resolution of the camera.\
    \ At 457 m altitude, the 320 X 240 pixel \nresolution translates into about 0.93\
    \ m/pixel ground resolution for the field of view of that camera. The degree of\
    \ \nthis shading effect was noticed to vary slightly with time of day and viewing\
    \ angle, but this effect was not \nquantified. Figure 6 illustrates images of\
    \ a soybean canopy obtained with the Electrophysics camera at 460-m \naltitude.\
    \ Dark areas indicate cooler temperatures; lighter shades indicate warmer temperatures.\
    \ A constant range \nof temperatures between 28 and 33 C (83 and 93 F) corresponding\
    \ to pixel values was set for consistency \nbetween images. This is a relatively\
    \ narrow range within which the full range of color differences could be seen\
    \ \nin a field. Typical canopy temperatures as measured by the camera ranged from\
    \ 28 to 31 C (83 and 88 F). \nRainfall on days 195, 199, and 202 kept the soil\
    \ environment adequately replenished with water (Fig. 2). This \nwas confirmed\
    \ by readings from soil water sensors (Fig. 1). The image obtained on day 207\
    \ can serve as a \nbaseline for comparison with subsequent days. Rainfall totalled\
    \ 1.9 cm over days 208 and 209 but soil water \nsensor (SWS) readings indicated\
    \ slightly drier soil conditions on day 214. The image for day 214 appears to\
    \ \nshow a warmer canopy overall, but the high degree of temperature increase\
    \ was not consistent with the crop’s \napparent stress level as indicated indirectly\
    \ by SWS. Altitude of flight was lower for this run, as was PAR. \nWeather was\
    \ generally clear on this date however, so it is not clear if the low PAR value\
    \ obtained was \nshort-lived or if the plants had time to change temperature within\
    \ a 100-s window (Pennington and Heatherly, \n1989). Spatial differences in canopy\
    \ temperature were well defined for days 221 and 229. This pair of images \nindicates\
    \ how a temporal comparison should look if conditions are consistent between days.\

    \ of image capture, solar radiation, and flight altitude were all closely comparable.\
    \ No significant rainfall \noccurred between those days, and temporal analysis\
    \ of Watermark readings indicated higher soil-water potential \nat the 46 cm depth\
    \ at three out of four stations on day 229. \n3.2 Spatial Relationships Involving\
    \ Canopy Temperature  \nWater management is one important aspect of crop production,\
    \ but the crop production system frequently \nrequires multiple decisions to be\
    \ made. Nowhere is this more apparent than with cotton production. Cotton \nmanagement\
    \ involves many factors that must work together properly to ensure a high yielding\
    \ and quality crop. \nDepending on soil texture, nutrient levels, and other field\
    \ characteristics, some field areas have lower yield \npotential and have differing\
    \ needs with regard to timing of water application and insecticide management.\
    \ We \nthus decided to investigate sensor fusion methods that include thermal\
    \ imaging to delineate field areas requiring \nmore attention with regard to water\
    \ and pest management.   \n3.2.1 Procedures \nThermal images acquired over a five-week\
    \ interval from July through August 2006 (using an Electrophysics \nPV-320T camera\
    \ mounted in an agricultural aircraft flown at an altitude of 460 m) were composited\
    \ (Fig. 7) to \nproduce a cumulative thermal map of a cotton canopy. This 2.3-ha\
    \ field was managed uniformly with regard to \nnutrient levels and was non-irrigated.\
    \ In addition to the thermal images, two Color Infrared (CIR) images (12-bit,\
    \ \n0.15 m resolution) were obtained using the Emerge Digital Sensor System (DSS)\
    \ (Emerge Sensor Group, \nAndover, MA, USA); this camera was flown at an altitude\
    \ of 600 m on 10 July and 24 August 2006. Images \nwere processed using an intensity\
    \ normalization method followed by calculation of Normalized Difference \nVegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI). These two normalized CIR images were also processed using Isodata\
    \ unsupervised \nclassification (Jensen, 1996) to establish two classes (coded\
    \ 0 = no vegetation and 1 = vegetation); zonal means \nwere subsequently calculated\
    \ for each image (i.e., resampled to 1-m resolution) resulting in assessments\
    \ of \npercent cover. Canopy cover change was determined by subtracting the classified\
    \ July image from the vegetation \nmapped in late August.  \n3.2.2 Results and\
    \ Discussion \nHighly significant patterns of yield linked to the thermal zonation\
    \ were evident in this irrigated field (using a \nbivariate Local Indicator of\
    \ Spatial Association or LISA map) with close to 65% of the field extent at p\
    \ ≤ 0.01 \nand 15% of the field area at 0.01< p ≤ 0.05. Another bivariate LISA\
    \ map, using GeoDa (Spatial Analysis \nLaboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,\
    \ IL, USA) charts significant autocorrelations (p ≤ 0.05) \nbetween cotton canopy\
    \ cover change and the cumulative thermal maps (Fig. 7A).  \nLow canopy cover\
    \ change was coupled with the lowest cumulative canopy temperatures (depicted\
    \ in dark shade). \nSimilarly, the adjacent areas of the field (portrayed in lighter\
    \ shade) displayed relatively high canopy cover \nchange paired with low canopy\
    \ temperature change. The second bivariate LISA map (comparing patterns of \n\
    yield with in-season canopy cover change - Fig. 7B), resolves four field-scale\
    \ production zones including: (1) \nhigh yielding areas with low canopy cover\
    \ change; (2) a more scattered grouping of high yielding areas paired \nwith relatively\
    \ high canopy cover change; (3) “stressed” portions of the field with low yield\
    \ and low canopy \ncover change; and (4) low yielding areas coupled with relatively\
    \ high canopy cover change. Ground-truthing \ndemonstrated that from mid to late\
    \ August, cotton plants subjected to consistently high temperatures had 50 - \n\
    90% open boll. These results indicate that composited thermal imagery combined\
    \ with tracking canopy cover \nchange at key phenological stages could be useful\
    \ for the in-season prediction of yield potential as well as early \nsenescence\
    \ promoted by heat/water stress in highly heterogeneous cotton fields. Management\
    \ of water \n(termination of irrigation) is tied to phenological stage in cotton,\
    \ and maps such as these could also foster the \ndevelopment of site-specific\
    \ insecticide applications to protect high-yielding areas and promote cost-effective\
    \ \napplication of defoliants/harvest aids. Assuming an irrigation system is capable\
    \ of varying water application \nrates or can be scheduled by zones, spatial differences\
    \ as indicated in thermal imagery could be useful for \nirrigation timing decisions\
    \ on select portions of the field.  \n3.3 Irrigation System Diagnostics  \nDetection\
    \ of water leaks in irrigation systems has been successfully accomplished using\
    \ thermal imagery. Huang \net al. (2009) used a multispectral imaging system that\
    \ included an Indigo Systems Merlin Thermal IR 12-bit \ncamera (Niceville, FL,\
    \ USA) and dual digital Dalsa 1M30 cameras (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) fitted\
    \ with \ninterference filters for the Red (0.66 µm ) and NIR (0.8 µm) wavelengths.\
    \ This imaging system was mounted on \nan aircraft and flown at low altitude to\
    \ collect the images over the irrigation canal systems in the Lower Rio \nGrande\
    \ Valley of Texas, USA. Thermal, Red, and NIR images were collected of 24 selected\
    \ canal segments \nwww.ccsenet.org/jas                        Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Science                    Vol. 4, No. 4; 2012 \nPublished by Canadian Center\
    \ of Science and Education \n109\nwithin 11 irrigation districts in this region.\
    \ In image analysis, the thermal images worked well in detecting leaks \nfrom\
    \ concrete canal segments, and ancillary data from the higher resolution Red,\
    \ NIR, and NDVI images were \nused to indicate the presence of trees or shadows\
    \ that might normally be seen as water leakage if thermal \nimagery alone were\
    \ used. NDVI images were also valuable in detection of areas of higher grass density\
    \ around \nearth canal segments, which might be inferred as higher seepage in\
    \ those areas. The results of image analysis \nindicated that 140 sites had possible\
    \ canal leakage problems (point leak and/or seepage). A site evaluation was \n\
    performed to document the type and severity of the leaks at 28 of the sites. Twenty-six\
    \ sites were confirmed to \nhave leaks, representing a success rate of 93%. The\
    \ method of fusion of information from thermal, Red and NIR \nimages could have\
    \ widespread application for detecting leaks and seepage in irrigation systems.\
    \  \nAnother example from our research illustrates how useful information on water\
    \ leakage and other \nirrigation-related characteristics can be obtained. Figure\
    \ 8 illustrates an image taken over a corn/soybean rotation \nstudy in the Spring\
    \ of 2005 at the USDA ARS Stoneville research fields. Moving from left to right\
    \ in the image, \nthe soybean soil environment was drying from the previous irrigation\
    \ causing higher canopy temperature as \nindicated by lighter shaded areas. To\
    \ the right of that field, corn was being irrigated or was just recently irrigated.\
    \ \nThe irrigation pipe at the top of the corn field is a dark shade indicating\
    \ that water was still flowing. Lighter “hot \nspots” can be seen in the field,\
    \ which indicate restricted water flow to these areas most likely due to trash\
    \ or high \nspots. If these are determined to be high spots, careful field levelling\
    \ might be in order. The area to the right of \nthe corn field shows system leakage\
    \ down several furrows of a soybean field (indicated by the darker shade). To\
    \ \nthe right of that leakage is evidence of a previous irrigation that was stopped\
    \ a few days before, as this field was \nirrigated inadvertently. This error in\
    \ irrigation was not apparent to the naked eye at the time of image acquisition.\
    \  \n4. Summary - Research Advances, Needs, and Challenges \nChallenges exist\
    \ for improving thermal imagery products to accurately track spatiotemporal changes\
    \ in \ncanopy-air temperature difference (CATD). An experiment that varied altitude\
    \ also considered variable solar \nradiation, wind, ambient air temperature, and\
    \ RH, and preliminary relationships were developed over a uniform \nfield of planted\
    \ soybeans. Thermal imagery has shown utility in providing geospatial information\
    \ as one \ncomponent of a multi-sensor implementation to determine field areas\
    \ requiring more attention with respect to \ntimely application of water and other\
    \ field inputs. Spatial statistics has shown utility in tracking variability in\
    \ the \nfield, and the example presented herein from our research was for cotton,\
    \ a crop that requires intensive \nmanagement and fine-scale application of insecticide,\
    \ harvesting aids, and water. Using spatial information and \nground truthing,\
    \ a variable-rate irrigation system could be used to apply water by zones, paying\
    \ particular \nattention to those areas prone to stress using prior information.\
    \ Although on-the-go application using thermal \nimagery might be feasible using\
    \ time-temperature thresholds or similar methods that rely on CATD, methods for\
    \ \ndelineation of CATD that account for weather variables and height of image\
    \ acquisition need to be fine-tuned if \ncanopy temperatures are to be acquired\
    \ from aerial platforms.  \nSuccessful application of canopy temperature-based\
    \ strategies for irrigation in humid subtropical climates \nincludes many challenges.\
    \ The following attempts to summarize these challenges and indicate progress.\
    \  \n1) Cameras or ground-based sensors must demonstrate adequate spectral or\
    \ measurement resolution of canopy \ntemperature difference as the crop begins\
    \ to require water replenishment. It may not be feasible to track temporal \n\
    trends in crop water stress when prevailing VPD is very low. This situation is\
    \ commonplace in many areas of the \nSouthern US although not as consistent in\
    \ the Midsouth US. This limitation has also been realized in previous \nresearch.\
    \  \n2) Time lags in plant response due to either step changes in incoming solar\
    \ radiation or haze need to be \nconsidered when using any thermal detection method.\
    \ From aerial imagery, we have noticed lower image \ncontrast and radiometric\
    \ resolution on cloudy days so temperature readings should best be made under\
    \ cloudless \nconditions and carefully monitored for haze that can influence canopy\
    \ temperature.  \n3) Since much research has been done with regard to yield response\
    \ and stress levels associated with CWSI, this \nindex can be utilized either\
    \ with aerially obtained canopy temperature data or with corroborating ground\
    \ IRT \nmeasurements. To make the CWSI equation palatable for practical use, a\
    \ mobile water surface can be used to \nobtain wet canopy (baseline) temperature\
    \ as previous research has suggested.  \n4) In an experiment we conducted that\
    \ considered varying altitude, altitude accounted for 58% of the variability \n\
    in canopy temperature. When the variable solar radiation (SR) was added, this\
    \ value increased to 73%. Variables \naltitude and RH accounted for 76% of the\
    \ variation. These results were specified during periods on cloudless \nperiods,\
    \ a condition that should be met if at all possible when determining canopy temperature.\

    \ in R2 by introducing SR as a variable indicates high sensitivity to this variable.\
    \ Relationships like these \ncould be used to spectrally re-scale thermal imagery\
    \ for temporal comparison.  \n5) We have found that use of a weather instrument\
    \ to record instantaneous readings at the moment of imaging \nwas more convenient\
    \ and accurate than using logged data from a nearby weather station. Leaf angle\
    \ effects from \ntemperatures obtained ground truthing IRTs could be reduced by\
    \ averaging temperatures over canopy sections \ninstead of from single leaves,\
    \ as previous research has indicated. Our experience with post-processed thermal\
    \ \nimagery indicates that images should be captured from moving digital video\
    \ at a consistent viewing angle; \nimages should be obtained at the same time\
    \ of day.  \n6) Fusion of sensing methods that include thermal sensing and multispectral\
    \ imaging may ultimately be more \nbeneficial to facilitate crop management. Our\
    \ use of geospatial yield, stress, and canopy cover relationships have \nshown\
    \ utility in spotting areas of a field that require more attention, and this information\
    \ could assist in \ndeveloping a water management plan that suits a particular\
    \ field based on soil texture and environment. As water \nmanagement is frequently\
    \ interrelated with management of other inputs (such as application of insecticide\
    \ and \nharvesting aids for cotton), fusion of imaging methods can provide information\
    \ on management of water as they \nrelate to maturity-based indices.  \nReferences\

  title: Potential and Challenges in Use of Thermal Imaging for Humid Region Irrigation
    System Management
  verbatim_quote1: As the crop begins to show signs of stress, small increases in
    canopy temperature can be difficult to detect with adequate resolution (Thomson
    and Sullivan, 2006).
  verbatim_quote2: All studies have used the crop-water stress index (CWSI) for full
    canopies; however, complications arise when attempting to apply this index in
    fields with partial canopy cover.
  verbatim_quote3: In the early growing season when plants are small or populations
    are sparse, a portion of the soil surface is usually viewable by infrared thermometer
    when canopy temperature measurements are made (Irmak et al., 2000).

  analysis: "This paper presents a model to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET)\
    \ under water stress conditions by combining the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient\
    \ (Kc) approach with remote sensing data from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)\
    \ multispectral camera. The model was developed and tested using data from a maize\
    \ crop in the North China Plain, and the results showed that it can accurately\
    \ estimate ET under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. \n\nThe model\
    \ uses a water stress coefficient (Ks) derived from canopy temperature measurements\
    \ to account for the effects of water stress on ET. Canopy temperature is closely\
    \ related to crop water status, and it can be measured remotely using infrared\
    \ sensors. The Ks derived from canopy temperature measurements was found to be\
    \ a good indicator of crop water stress and could be used to improve the accuracy\
    \ of ET estimates under water stress conditions. \n\nThe model was evaluated using\
    \ data from a field experiment that included three different irrigation treatments:\
    \ full irrigation, moderate deficit irrigation, and severe deficit irrigation.\
    \ The results showed that the model could accurately estimate ET under all three\
    \ irrigation treatments, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 1 mm/day.\
    \ \n\nOverall, the model presented in this paper is a promising tool for estimating\
    \ crop ET under water stress conditions. The model is relatively simple to implement\
    \ and does not require a lot of input data. It can be used to improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling and water management practices, which can help to increase crop yields\
    \ and reduce water use."

    \a\nAbstract: As the key principle of precision farming, variation of actual crop\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET)\nwithin the ﬁeld serves as the basis for crop management.\
    \ Although the estimation of evapotranspiration\nhas achieved great progress through\
    \ the combination of diﬀerent remote sensing data and the FAO-56\ncrop coeﬃcient\
    \ (Kc) method, lack of the accurate crop water stress coeﬃcient (Ks) at diﬀerent\n\
    space–time scales still hinder its operational application to farmer practices.\
    \ This work aims to explore\nthe potential of multispectral images taken from\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for estimating the\ntemporal and spatial variability\
    \ of Ks under the water stress condition and mapping the variability of\nﬁeld\
    \ maize ET combined with the FAO-56 Kc model. To search for an optimal estimation\
    \ method,\nthe performance of several models was compared including models based\
    \ on Ks either derived\nfrom the crop water stress index (CWSI) or calculated\
    \ by the canopy temperature ratio (Tc ratio),\nand combined with the basal crop\
    \ coeﬃcient (Kcb) based on the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\nindex (NDVI).\
    \ Compared with the Ks derived from the Tc ratio, the CWSI-based Ks responded\
    \ well to\nwater stress and had strong applicability and convenience. The results\
    \ of the comparison show that\nET derived from the Ks-CWSI had a higher correlation\
    \ with the modiﬁed FAO-56 method, with an\nR2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE)\
    \ = 0.95 mm/d, and d = 0.94. In contrast, ET derived from\nthe Ks-Tc ratio had\
    \ a relatively lower correlation with an R2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 1.25 mm/d. To obtain\n\
    the evapotranspiration status of the whole maize ﬁeld and formulate reasonable\
    \ irrigation schedules,\nthe CWSI obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer\
    \ was inverted by the renormalized diﬀerence\nvegetation index (RDVI) and the\
    \ transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance index (TCARI).\nThen, the whole\
    \ map of Ks can be derived from the VIs by the relationship between CWSI and Ks\n\
    and can be taken as the basic input for ET estimation at the ﬁeld scale. The ﬁnal\
    \ ET results based on\nmultispectral UAV interpolation measurements can well reﬂect\
    \ the crop ET status under diﬀerent\nirrigation levels, and greatly help to improve\
    \ irrigation scheduling through more precise management\nof deﬁcit irrigation.\n\

    \ climate is characterized by long periods of drought and strong interannual\n\
    variability in rainfall amounts and distribution, leading to high year-to-year\
    \ variability in agricultural\ndevelopment and production [1]. The North China\
    \ Plain is one of the most important agricultural\nregions because it accounts\
    \ for about one-ﬁfth of national food production. In this area, rainfall cannot\n\
    meet the crop water requirements, and the overexploitation of groundwater aggravates\
    \ water scarcity,\nreduces the groundwater table, and threatens sustainable agriculture\
    \ [2]. Irrigation is then necessary\nto prevent water stress and ensure proﬁtable\
    \ yields. To determine the optimal irrigation scheduling\nand adopt such strategies\
    \ eﬃciently, it is necessary to have reliable methods of providing information\n\
    about the temporal and spatial variability of crop evapotranspiration (ET) within\
    \ the ﬁeld scale [3].\nThe direct ET measured methods consist of the use of a\
    \ lysimeter, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio,\nand soil water balance. However, they\
    \ face important limitations due to expensive techniques and\nlow spatial representativeness\
    \ of measurements, particularly in agricultural ﬁelds characterized by a\nhigh\
    \ level of heterogeneity in terms of crops and water status [4]. The indirect\
    \ form can be made from\nempirical equations that use agronomic, biophysical,\
    \ and meteorological elements as input variables [5].\nAs the most widely used\
    \ method for the determination of ET, the FAO-56 dual crop coeﬃcient (Kc)\napproach,\
    \ published by the Food and Agriculture Organization in Irrigation and Drainage\
    \ Paper No.\n56 [6], has received favorable acceptance and application worldwide\
    \ [5,7]. The dual Kc approach\ndescribes the relationship between the daily evapotranspiration\
    \ of a given crop and the reference\nevapotranspiration (ET0) by separating the\
    \ single crop coeﬃcient into the basal crop coeﬃcient (Kcb),\nsoil water evaporation\
    \ (Ke) coeﬃcient, and water stress coeﬃcient (Ks). Although simple in design and\n\
    construction, the dual Kc method successfully incorporates a number of consistent\
    \ and compensating\nfactors that distinguishes the ET of any unique crop from\
    \ that of the reference ET [7]. However, the\nmethod is mainly used for the ET\
    \ estimation based on stationary measurements and cannot provide a\nﬁne estimation\
    \ due to inconsistent crop growth.\nTo explore the distribution of crop ET within\
    \ the ﬁeld scale, remote sensing technology provides a\ndependable basis [8].\
    \ The crop coeﬃcient generated from remote sensing based on canopy reﬂectance\n\
    responds to the actual crop condition, captures the variability among diﬀerent\
    \ local atmosphere\nconditions and ﬁeld spatial variability [9], and reﬂects the\
    \ heterogeneity of plant development in large\nirrigated ﬁelds [10–14]. Studies\
    \ have established diﬀerent inversion models between vegetation indices\n(VIs)\
    \ and Kcb [15–18]. For decades, satellite remote sensing images have been the\
    \ main data sources to\nintegrate the FAO-56 for the estimation of crop ET. For\
    \ example, Bellvert et al. [19] used a dataset of the\nvegetation index (NDVI)\
    \ derived from Landsat-8 to facilitate the estimation of the Kcb, and potential\n\
    crop water use. However, the low spatial and temporal resolution of satellite\
    \ data limits its further\napplication in estimating ET within the ﬁeld scale.\
    \ At the same time, cloud cover remains a signiﬁcant\nchallenge in satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing [20].\nAs one of the most important emerging remote-sensing platforms,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) have been gradually employed in precise agriculture.\
    \ Soon, UAVs will be vital tools for\ngrowers as they can cover large areas, and\
    \ take advantage of new sensing, mapping, and data analytical\ntechnologies [21–23].\
    \ Real time mapping and rapid image analysis also provide the early detection\
    \ of\nplant water status for timely irrigation scheduling [24]. Based on these\
    \ advantages, UAVs have broad\napplication prospects for more sophisticated ET\
    \ management within the ﬁeld scale. When dealing\nwith the estimation of ET based\
    \ on a combination of UAV and the dual Kc method under water stress\nconditions,\
    \ four parameters are required: ET0, Kcb, Ke, and Ks. ET0 can be estimated using\
    \ the FAO\nPenman–Monteith formula and the collected meteorological data [25].\
    \ Ke is clearly correlated with\nfoliage cover and irrigation/rainfall event,\
    \ and becomes negligible when the crop completely covers the\nsoil [26]. Many\
    \ studies have validated that Kcb has a strong correlation with NDVI and foliage\
    \ cover,\nand applied to practical water requirement monitoring [16,27]. For instance,\
    \ Han et al. [28] studied the\nfeasibility of UAV multispectral remote sensing\
    \ in the estimation of maize crop coeﬃcients at diﬀerent\ngrowth stages. The results\
    \ showed a strong relationship between UAV-measured NDVI and Kcb, with\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n3 of 22\nan R2 value of 0.82. Although the assimilation\
    \ of FAO-56 and remote sensing data has made such great\nprogress, discrepancies\
    \ between the measured and simulated ET remained when water stress occurred.\n\
    The accurate estimation of Ks is the key to accurately estimate crop ET using\
    \ UAV remote sensing\ndata under water stress conditions. Speciﬁcally, Ks represents\
    \ the fraction of potential transpiration\nrate, with a value from 1 to 0, according\
    \ to the level of water stress, which is directly related to the\nwater content\
    \ in the root zone. Less attention has been paid on determining the water stress\
    \ coeﬃcient\nKs from the remote sensing data because there are diﬃculties in estimating\
    \ soil and root zone moisture\n(or root zone depletion) from remote sensing data\
    \ [29]. It is necessary to use a new indictor, which\nis easy to obtain and can\
    \ respond to real-time plant-water status. Studies [30,31] have proven that\n\
    canopy temperature (Tc) is closely related to soil water content, actual transpiration,\
    \ and crop water\nstress status. Therefore, Ks and canopy temperature are deﬁnitely\
    \ related to each other. Olivera et\nal. [32] used the vegetation and soil temperatures\
    \ retrieved from LST (land surface temperature) data\nderived from the eddy covariance\
    \ system to estimate the Ks. This method is based on the polygon\ndeﬁned in the\
    \ LST–VI space, which needs a large amount of temperature data and has a complex\n\
    analysis procedure. Recently, studies have evaluated indices based on Tc that\
    \ require less information\nfor detecting crop water stress and have shown that\
    \ Ks is related to several crop water stress indices.\nFor instance, Bausch et\
    \ al. [18] successfully used a ratio of canopy temperature as a substitute for\
    \ the\nsoil moisture based Ks. The ET diﬀerence between the two deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments for the 25-day\ninvestigative period calculated by Tc ratio and water\
    \ balance techniques was 21 mm and 4 mm. Kullberg\net al. [33] observed that using\
    \ an appropriate Ks method had the potential to improve irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ to properly manage stress and ensure optimum crop yield under a limited irrigation\
    \ water\nsupply. A noted advantage of non-dimensional crop indices such as CWSI\
    \ (crop water stress index)\nis that they are typically considered to be scalable\
    \ to Ks for ET estimation (i.e., Ks = 1 − CWSI). This\nis also the basis behind\
    \ the Tc ratio approach, although it has dimensionality restrictions [34]. For\n\
    the estimation of Ks based on water stress indices, most studies have used handled\
    \ or stationary\ninfrared thermometers [33–35]. A ground-based platform is still\
    \ time consuming and labor intensive.\nAdditionally, like the estimation by counting\
    \ root zone depletion, it is impractical to estimate ET by\ncombining the Kcb\
    \ of large image pixels with Ks based on ground-point measurements due to the\n\
    heterogeneities of the crop and soil status.\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ technology, high-resolution thermal imagery acquired by\nUAVs has been used\
    \ to map plant water stress indices such as the CWSI, and water deﬁcit index (WDI).\n\
    However, when Kcb and Ks are obtained from diﬀerent sensors (i.e., multispectral\
    \ and thermal sensors),\nthe problem of data fusion and matching will be obstacles\
    \ to ET estimation with the UAV system.\nFor example, as the image resolution\
    \ obtained by the two sensors is diﬀerent, image matching with\ndiﬀerent resolutions\
    \ requires a complicated process. Most importantly, the biggest eﬀect is not only\
    \ on\nthe pixel mixing due to the downscale, but on the georectiﬁcation and co-registration\
    \ of the images,\ntherefore, the asynchronous time and space of the Ks and Kcb\
    \ may inﬂuence the acquisition of maize\nET. Previous studies have indicated that\
    \ multispectral VIs have signiﬁcantly high correlation with\nwater stress indicators.\
    \ For example, Samuel et al. [36] summarized the common spectral vegetation\n\
    indices (VIs) that have been correlated to plant water stress. Studies [37–39]\
    \ suggested that the\nrenormalized diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI) and transformed\
    \ chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI) are useful in plant stress\
    \ monitoring. Therefore, the synchronized acquisition of Kcb\nand Ks using one\
    \ sensor (i.e., a multispectral camera) should be explored.\nThis study aimed\
    \ to estimate more accurate ET maps with UAV-based multispectral images over\n\
    maize in the semiarid region of the North China Plain by applying the FAO-56 dual\
    \ Kc approach.\nMore speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst compared the ET derived from water stress\
    \ indices (CWSI and Tc ratio) and\nNDVI to that calculated with the modiﬁed FAO-56\
    \ dual Kc method by evaluating the suitable water\nstress indicator for local\
    \ maize ET estimation. Next, we investigated the potential of assimilating ET\n\
    estimation with VIs data (multispectral UAV) through the retrieve relation between\
    \ the water stress\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n4 of 22\nindex and VIs to eliminate\
    \ discrepancies caused by using data at diﬀerent scales and obtain a high\nresolution\
    \ (4.7 cm) spatial-temporal ET map.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Site\

    \ Factors and Soil Water Content\nThe weather data were obtained from an automated\
    \ weather station located on a grass reference\nsurface (0.95 ha) that was 1000\
    \ meters away from the research ﬁeld, with observations of rainfall, air\ntemperature\
    \ (Ta), humidity, net solar radiation (Rn), and wind speed (2 m above the reference\
    \ surface).\nExcept for rainfall, the data acquisition interval was 30 minutes.\n\
    Soil water content (SWC) was measured two or three times each week on the day\
    \ before or after\nirrigation within each sampling plot by the traditional gravimetric\
    \ method [43]. At each sampling\nplot, three sampling sites were randomly chosen\
    \ around the center. The samples were collected by soil\naugers at depths of 30\
    \ cm, 60 cm, 90 cm, and 120 cm. Soil samples were put in aluminum boxes to\navoid\
    \ the inﬂuence of evaporation. Basically, the gravimetric method involves taking\
    \ soil samples,\nweighing, oven-drying, and reweighing them, then expressing the\
    \ moisture content (i.e., loss in weight)\nas a percentage of the oven-dry weight.\
    \ This is the weight or mass basis of expressing soil moisture\ncontent. Then,\
    \ by multiplying the bulk density, the results can be expressed in terms of volume\
    \ [44].\nThe average SWC (θ) was estimated by interpolating the soil moisture\
    \ observations of the diﬀerent\ndepths belonging to the root-zone of maize.\n\
    2.2.2. Measurement of Maize Parameters\nMaize canopy temperature (Tc) and UAV\
    \ multispectral data were synchronously collected under\nclear sky at solar noon.\
    \ Tc was collected during the full foliage cover period (6–29 August 2017\nincluding\
    \ the reproductive and maturation stages). A handheld infrared thermometer (Raytek\
    \ ST60+,\nRaytek Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used to measure Tc with a measurement\
    \ error of ±1 ◦C or\n±1% of the reading. The larger values were adopted in the\
    \ practical application. The temperature and\nspectral ranges of the Raytek ST60+\
    \ are −32–600 ◦C and 8–14 µm, respectively. The emissivity value\nwas set to 0.97\
    \ [45]. To avoid the interference of soil, the thermometer was used to sweep the\
    \ canopy\n(about 120◦) perpendicular to the row, 30 cm above the canopy, and at\
    \ a 15◦ horizontal angle. At each\nsample site, three measurements were made to\
    \ obtain the Tc. The values averaged over one sampling\nsite or over one plot\
    \ (yellow circle in Figure 1c) were taken to represent their status.\nThe main\
    \ plant parameters needed to run the modiﬁed FAO-56 model (see Section 2.2.3)\
    \ are\ncanopy height (h) and leaf area index (LAI). A random sampling method was\
    \ used to collect the LAI\nand plant height of maize. An LAI-2200C canopy analyzer\
    \ (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA)\nwas used to measure the LAI of maize;\
    \ 10 sampling points were randomly selected for each plot and\nthe average value\
    \ was obtained. For each plot plant height of maize, 15 representative maize plants\n\
    were randomly selected and measured by tape measure. Cubic spline interpolation\
    \ is a piecewise\nregression approach that uses third-order polynomials for interpolation\
    \ between a series of paired\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n7 of 22\ndata points\
    \ [14]. Thus, cubic spline was used to process the measured LAI and plant height\
    \ data, and\nthen the daily sequence of maize LAI and plant height data were obtained.\n\
    2.2.3. The Modiﬁed FAO-56 Dual Crop Coeﬃcient Method\nIn FAO-56, the actual ET\
    \ is deﬁned as the product of crop coeﬃcient (Kc) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ET0) [26]. In the dual Kc model, Kc is split into two factors that separately\n\
    describe the evaporation (Ke) and transpiration (Kcb) components. The method has\
    \ been widely used\nin scheduling irrigation and improving agricultural production\
    \ [46]. FAO-56 ET is estimated as follows:\nET = ET0 ∗ (KcbKs + Ke),\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ ET is in mm/d; Ke is the evaporation coeﬃcient of the bare soil fraction; Kcb\
    \ is the basal crop\ncoeﬃcient; Ks is the water stress coeﬃcient; and ET0 is the\
    \ grass reference evapotranspiration in\nmm/d. The stages of canopy temperature\
    \ acquisition and ET estimation were in the period of high\ncoverage (i.e., vegetation\
    \ cover ranging from 0.79 to 0.84 as estimated by an empirical equation based\n\
    on NDVI [47]). With Ke = 0.25 × (1 − fc) [26], it had a minor inﬂuence on total\
    \ ET and was ignored.\nThe ET0 of this reference surface was estimated according\
    \ to the following Penman–Monteith\nequation:\nET0 =\n0.408∆(Rn − G) + γ\n900\n\
    T+273u2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ(1 + 0.34u2)\n,\n(2)\nwhere Rn is the net radiation at\
    \ the crop surface; G is the soil heat ﬂux density (as the magnitude of the\n\
    1-day or 10-day soil heat ﬂux beneath the grass reference surface is relatively\
    \ small, it may be ignored,\nthus Gday = 0 [26]); T is the mean daily air temperature\
    \ at 2 m height; u2 is the wind speed at 2 m\nheight; es is the saturation vapor\
    \ pressure; ea is the actual vapor pressure; ∆ is the slope vapor pressure\ncurve;\
    \ and γ is a psychrometric constant.\nThe basal crop coeﬃcient, Kcb, is generally\
    \ obtained from the guidelines of FAO-56 by looking-up\nthe tabulated value at\
    \ every growth stage and then linearly interpolating it to obtain the daily values.\n\
    The approach from the original FAO-56 dual Kc procedures cannot calculate the\
    \ daily actual value\nof Kcb [42]. Feng et al. [48] modiﬁed Kcb with LAI through\
    \ eddy covariance systems near the\nexperimentation site, which illustrated that\
    \ the modiﬁed dual crop coeﬃcient method could estimate\nmaize ET accurately on\
    \ the North China Plain. Therefore, in order to evaluate the dynamic changes of\n\
    ET in the maize ﬁeld more accurately, the canopy height and LAI were used to modify\
    \ the dynamic\nKcb. The modiﬁed FAO-56 Kcb value can be calculated by Equations\
    \ (3) and (4):\nKcb − Tab = Kc,min +\n\x10\nKcb,full − Kc,min\n\x11\n(1 − exp[−kLAI])\
    \ ,\n(3)\nKcb, full = min(1 + 0.1h, Kc,max) + [0.04(u2 − 2) − 0.004(RHmin − 45)]\n\
    \ \nh\n3\n!0.3\n,\n(4)\nwhere Kc,min is the minimum for bare soil (0.15); Kcb,full\
    \ is the estimated basal Kcb for vegetation having\nfull ground cover; Kc,max\
    \ is the maximum Kc (1.2); RHmin is the minimum relative humidity (%); and k\n\
    is the canopy attenuation coeﬃcient of radiation, and the value of k is listed\
    \ in Table 2.\nThe crop water stress coeﬃcient Ks related to the actual root zone\
    \ water content is a key parameter\nfor calculating and simulating soil water\
    \ conditions. Several linear and curvilinear functions have been\nproposed to\
    \ adjust for the eﬀects of decreasing available water on ET or for the Ks used\
    \ in Equation (1).\nThe simple linear model for estimating Ks as described in\
    \ FAO-33 is commonly used and calculated by\nEquation (5) ,which is an equivalent\
    \ expression to the FAO-56 Ks procedure [49].\nKs − FAO =\n\n1,\nθ ≥ θj\n\

    \ models between UAV-based multispectral VIs and crop coeﬃcients\n(NDVI vs. Kcb\
    \ and TRCAI/RDVI vs. Ks), three VIs were selected: NDVI [50], transformed chlorophyll\n\

    \ and the renormalized diﬀerence vegetation index\n(RDVI) [52]. In addition, cubic\
    \ spline interpolation was used to determine the VI values between two\nﬂight\
    \ overpasses. Their calculation equations are as follows:\nNDVI = ρnir − ρred\n\

    \ of ground objects in the near-infrared, red,\nred-edge, and green bands, respectively.\n\
    2.2.5. Crop Coeﬃcient Estimation Using Reﬂectance Data\nReﬂectance-based basal\
    \ crop coeﬃcient (Kcb) methods have been used to improve the irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ of maize. NDVI is one of the most widely used indices for estimating crop parameters.\n\
    This index is highly sensitive to variations of LAI and the fraction of the ground\
    \ that is covered by\nvegetation, (fc). The NDVI has a linear relationship with\
    \ fc along the whole range of vegetation cover [47].\nAccordingly in this study,\
    \ Equation (10) was used for fc estimation. In this study, one 12 m × 12 m area\n\
    was selected as the spectral sampling plot in each treatment (yellow box in Figure\
    \ 1b). Studies [53,54]\nshowed that Kcb can be estimated from fc.\nfc =\nNDVI\
    \ − NDVImin\nNDVImax − NDVImin\n,\n(10)\nwhere NDVImin and NDVImax are the minimum\
    \ and the maximum values of the NDVI associated\nwith bare soil and dense vegetation,\
    \ respectively. Once fc has been obtained through Equation (10), the\nKcb can\
    \ be estimated as:\nKcb − NDVI = 1.13 fc + 0.14,\n(11)\nThe two diﬀerent Ks obtained\
    \ from CWSI and Tc ratio were derived from the handheld infrared\nthermometer,\
    \ with daily values taken around local times between 11:00 and 13:00 (local time),\
    \ which\nare approximate times of peak stress.\nJackson et al. [30] showed that\
    \ CWSI is inversely related to the water use of the crop under\nconsideration;\
    \ Ks can also be calculated from CWSI by:\nKs−CWSI = 1 − CWSI,\n(12)\nOne of the\
    \ widely used methods for estimating CWSI is based on measured canopy\ntemperature\
    \ [30,55]. The CWSI is deﬁned in Equation (13).\nCWSI = dTm − dTLL\ndTUL − dTLL\n\
    ,\n(13)\nwhere dTm, dTLL, and dTUL are the actual measurement, lower limit, and\
    \ upper limit of the\ncanopy–air temperature diﬀerence (Tc−Ta), respectively.\n\
    More detailed information about local\nCWSI measurements can be found in Zhang\
    \ et al. [39]. CWSI = 0 indicates no water stress, while\nCWSI = 1 indicates the\
    \ most severe stress.\nZhang et al. [39] established linear regression models\
    \ (R2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) between TRCAI/RDVI\nand CWSI (Equation (14)). The local\
    \ calibration of CWSI performed in [39] was also retained here.\nThus, we could\
    \ integrate the remote sensing data into the Ks model by establishing a stable\
    \ relationship\nbetween VIs and CWSI. According to the relationship between Ks\
    \ and CWSI (i.e., Ks = 1 − CWSI)\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n10 of 22\nand to\
    \ rescale the Ks value between 0 and 1, the linear regression models can been\

    \ alternative method to evaluate water stress that only requires the crop canopy\
    \ temperature\nwas proposed by Bausch et al. [35]. The relationship between Ks\
    \ and Tc ratio is as follows:\nKs−Tc ratio = Tc ratio = TcNS\nTc\n,\n(16)\nwhere\
    \ Tc ratio is a stress coeﬃcient proposed as a surrogate for the water stress\
    \ coeﬃcient Ks from\nFAO-56. Tc is the canopy temperature and TcNS is the temperature\
    \ of a fully irrigated, non-stressed\ncanopy, which was chosen as the lowest canopy\
    \ temperature observed at the given timestamp including\nall treatments [34].\
    \ This temperature ratio was found to be capable of quantitatively monitoring\n\
    water stress and can potentially be used in the place of the water stress coeﬃcient\
    \ when soil water\nmeasurements are not available.\n2.2.6. Evapotranspiration\
    \ Comparison and Statistical Analysis\nDue to the lack of validation information\
    \ from an eddy covariance tower or lysimeter, the ET\nestimated by the modiﬁed\
    \ dual Kc method [42,48] was used to validate the model. Ding et al. [42]\nfound\
    \ good agreement between the predicted ET and transpiration using the modiﬁed\
    \ model and\nthe measurements through the lysimeter for maize in 2010, with a\
    \ slope of linear regression of 0.99\n(R2 = 0.90) and 1.01 (R2 = 0.92). Feng et\
    \ al. [48] also obtained similar results and suggested that the\nmodiﬁed dual\
    \ crop coeﬃcient method was suitable for calculating the actual daily ET of the\
    \ main\ncrops across the North China Plain. Studies [56,57] also used the local\
    \ ET estimated by the FAO-56\nKc method to validate the derived ET from their\
    \ model. Thus, employing the ET data estimated by\nthe modiﬁed FAO-56 dual Kc\
    \ method as the validation set had certain accuracy in this study. The\nsimulated\
    \ daily ET of the maize derived from the two Ks methods and NDVI-based Kcb methods\n\
    (ET-CWSI and ET-ratio) were compared with the values obtained from the modiﬁed\
    \ FAO-56 dual\ncrop coeﬃcient method. The ET-CWSI, ET-ratio, and ET-FAO values\
    \ were compared by using a linear\nregression analysis and the statistical parameters\
    \ of the coeﬃcient of determination (R2), root mean\nsquare error (RMSE), and\
    \ index of agreement (d) were used as a relative measure of the diﬀerence\namong\
    \ variables. Perfect agreement would exist between the observed and modeled values\
    \ if d = 1.\nFinally, we compared the cumulative evapotranspiration (CET) obtained\
    \ by the VI method with\nthe water balance approach to evaluate the ability of\
    \ ET determination by UAV. Cumulative ET\nobtained by the soil–water balance [58]\
    \ was used as the reference ET, and a relatively simple relation is\nexpressed\
    \ as:\n(Pr + I) + U − RO − ET − DP − ∆SW = 0,\n(17)\nwhere Pr is the eﬀective\
    \ precipitation; I is the irrigation depth; U is the ground water replenishment;\n\
    RO is the runoﬀ from the soil surface; and DP is the deep percolation of water\
    \ moving out of the root\nzone. ∆SW is the change between the ﬁrst and last measurements\
    \ of soil water storage within the root\nzone. All terms are expressed in mm.\
    \ As soil water content sensors buried at diﬀerent depths in the\nﬁeld showed\
    \ that the soil moisture at 1.2 m changed little during the study period and the\
    \ terrain\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n11 of 22\ninclination was <5%, the U,\
    \ RO, and DP were also considered as zero. Based on the soil–water balance\n(Equation\
    \ (17)) and the above criteria, the CET was determined as follows:\nCET = Pr +\

    \ a \ncertain numeric gradient from 6 to 29 August 2017. Overall, Tc increased\

    \ its maximum value of 0.84 in the late vegetative stage (DOY 207), while the\
    \ LAI was\nstill increasing up until the late reproductive stage (DOY 223). The\

    \ of water stress. On the other hand, a higher CV in TRT 2 demonstrated that\n\
    the dual eﬀect of soil heterogeneity and water stress could severely aﬀect maize\
    \ ET.\nNext, the cumulative daily values of ET from 6 to 29 August 2017 for the\
    \ three irrigation treatments\nwere calculated by two techniques. (1) The VIs\
    \ (the average value of the entire treatment zone) method,\nwhere daily crop water\
    \ requirement (ET) was calculated by multiplying the daily crop coeﬃcients of\n\
    daily ET0 (Equation (1)). As above-mentioned, crop coeﬃcients were derived through\
    \ the relationships\nbetween Kcb and NDVI, and between Ks and TRCAI/RDVI. In addition,\
    \ a cubic interpolation was\nused to determine the values of VIs (NDVI, TRCAI,\
    \ and RDVI) between two UAV ﬂights. (2) The water\nbalance approach (Equation\
    \ (18)). As presented in Table 5, the total water consumption of the three\ntreatments\
    \ for the study period were 75 mm, 53 mm, and 67 mm, respectively. The diﬀerence\
    \ between\nthe cumulative ET calculated by the VIs method and water balance approach\
    \ were 2.6 mm, 8.9 mm,\nand 5 mm, respectively. Note that the retrieved ET were\
    \ similar to the crop water consumption.\nTable 5. Cumulative ET from the 6–29\

    Daily ET represents the most important process for the determination of the surface\
    \ and\nmass-energy interaction for both water resource management and agricultural\
    \ practices. At present,\nthere are mainly two types of models for ET assessment.\
    \ The ﬁrst involves models using thermal band\nbased energy-balance approaches\
    \ (SEB) [59,60]. The second method utilizes the empirical VI model.\nThough the\
    \ surface energy balance models are able to estimate ET with ﬁne accuracy. Deﬁciencies\n\
    in the current suite of thermal data sources (e.g., plenty of data requirements,\
    \ biases, inaccurate\ncalibration, poor spatial or temporal resolution) can strongly\
    \ limit the applicability of such procedures\nfor the continuous monitoring of\
    \ ET at a high spatiotemporal resolution [61]. Due to the longstanding\nfamiliarity\
    \ and widespread use within the irrigation community of crop coeﬃcient approaches\
    \ and\ntheir relative operational simplicity, reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcients\
    \ might elicit a successful and\nfar-reaching approach for improving irrigation\
    \ management [12]. Multispectral VIs calculated from\ncanopy reﬂectance can be\
    \ used to simulate real-time Kcb. Figure 6 shows that there was a strong\nsimilarity\
    \ between the Kcb-NDVI and Kcb-Table. With the help of UAVs, we can provide more\n\
    sophisticated Kcb information for irrigation management. Studies [29,62] showed\
    \ that the VI-Kcb\nmodel can perform well under well irrigation conditions, but\
    \ that it could be diﬃcult to capture actual\nET under the water stress condition.\
    \ Water stress evaluation (Ks) based on soil water storage in the root\nzone is\
    \ the traditional and common method, but is costly and there is a shortage of\
    \ representation. For\ninstance, Er-Raki et al. [29] reported that the original\
    \ FAO-56 model may overestimate eddy covariance\nmeasurements because of the misrepresentation\
    \ of the soil stress factor.\nTo deal with these defects, Ks estimation is mainly\
    \ divided into direct and indirect methods. In\nindirect methods, they usually\
    \ need to ﬁrst obtain the potential ET (PET) and actual ET, and then\ncalculate\
    \ Ks through the soil–water balance. It is diﬃcult to obtain the actual ET because\
    \ sophisticated\nand costly instruments such as eddy covariance and lysimeters\
    \ are generally limited. On the other\nhand, estimating Ks through the indirect\
    \ method is not only laborious, but is also not time-eﬀective.\nDiarra et al.\
    \ [63] highlighted the uncertainty of indirect assessment in detecting crop water\
    \ stress in\nlight of the decision making process for irrigation planning. Therefore,\
    \ the direct calculation of Ks\nis very important for the application of the FAO-56\
    \ dual Kc method. Some studies have employed\nwater stress indices derived from\
    \ temperature data as the proxy. For instance, Kullberg et al. [33] used\nfour\
    \ canopy temperature–based methods (CWSI, degrees above non-stressed (DANS), degrees\
    \ above\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n17 of 22\ncanopy threshold (DACT), and Tc\
    \ ratio derived from infrared thermal radiometer) to calculate Ks and\nestimate\
    \ ET in a deﬁcit irrigation experiment of corn. A similar observation was made\
    \ by this study\nwhen estimating Ks for maize with the CWSI. Figure 9 shows that\
    \ the Ks derived CWSI was useful to\nestimate ET, with an acceptable accuracy\
    \ of R2 = 0.81 and RMSE about 0.95 mm/day when compared\nwith the modiﬁed FAO-56\
    \ Kc method. Bausch et al. [35] also obtained similar results using Tc ratio.\
    \ The\napplicability of the water stress index may be diﬀerent in diﬀerent areas\
    \ and cultivation conditions,\nso it is necessary to choose the local appropriate\
    \ water stress index. Furthermore, the water stress\nindices based on canopy temperature\
    \ may be a more realistic parameter than soil–water content to\nrepresent the\
    \ stress coeﬃcient due to the complicated physiological processes that plants\
    \ undergo as\nthey encounter water stress [35]. In Figure 7, we can see that the\
    \ Ks values calculated by CWSI are\nnot 1, as are the FAO-56 Ks in full-irrigation\
    \ TRT 1. It is probable that even a well-watered crop could\nhave a high canopy\
    \ temperature because of other changes in microclimate such as air temperature\n\
    and vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) [64]. The change in the air temperature surrounding\
    \ the leaf will\nchange the leaf temperature and directly aﬀect the gradient of\
    \ water vapor between the leaf and the\natmosphere. Water deﬁcit stress and heat\
    \ stress may be induced by changes in available water, VPD,\nand increased ambient\
    \ air temperature [65].\nStationary infrared thermometers were mainly used for\
    \ validating the relationship between water\nstress indictors and Ks [33,35],\
    \ which can be greatly constrained by transport and operator costs and it\ncan\
    \ be diﬃcult to obtain large area images of crop. These shortcomings may cause\
    \ signiﬁcant errors\ndue to the diﬃculty of achieving a spatially-homogenous,\
    \ targeted soil, or plant water status. More\nimportantly, it is diﬃcult to obtain\
    \ Kcb and Ks on a large area at the same time. Kcb and Ks from\ndiﬀerent platforms\
    \ and scales will inevitably lead to errors in estimating ET, especially with\
    \ the high\nheterogeneities of soil and crops. Several studies [36,66,67] have\
    \ revealed the feasibility of mapping\ncrop water conditions using spectral vegetation\
    \ indices, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution\ncapabilities that\
    \ are more diﬃcult in the thermal region. The RDVI and TCARI were developed\n\
    to reduce the variability of the photosynthetically active radiation due to the\
    \ presence of diverse\nnon-photosynthetic materials and are useful in plant stress\
    \ monitoring to capture the changes in canopy\nstructures caused by water stress\
    \ [36,68]. Compared to the Ks calculated by on-site measurements, the\nKs based\
    \ on VI-Ks regression models could better reﬂect the water stress conditions of\
    \ maize at the\nﬁeld scale. Taking DOY 231 as an example, the mean ET could well\
    \ reﬂect TRT 2 (69%) and TRT 1\n(100%) in the reproductive stage, with the corresponding\
    \ values of 5.05 mm and 4.23 mm, respectively.\nTable 5 conﬁrmed the utility of\
    \ VIs to help constrain the ET components under three diﬀerent water\ntreatments.\
    \ Cumulative estimated ET diﬀered from the observed by only 2.6 mm, 8.9 mm, and\
    \ 5 mm\nfor TRTs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The result during the 24-day investigative\
    \ period conﬁrmed that\nthe model may be suitable for clearly distinguishing the\
    \ diﬀerent irrigation schemes. In addition, we\ncould obtain accurate ET only\
    \ through the meteorological and UAV multispectral images.\nPrevious studies have\
    \ reported on combining the FAO-56 Kc model with Landsat [13,57,69],\nSPOT [25,70],\
    \ and Sentinel 2 [71] data to estimate the crop coeﬃcient and map crop water consumption.\n\
    However, with satellite remote sensing, a pixel represents a large area. It is\
    \ diﬃcult to observe the\nvariability in crop status on the ﬁeld scale and to\
    \ formulate precise irrigation plans. In addition, newly\nhigher resolution observation\
    \ platforms may be too costly for crop monitoring. In contrast, UAVs\ncan monitor\
    \ ﬁeld ET information scale up information from the leaf to canopy/ﬁeld levels\
    \ and maybe\nsuitable technology for actual problem scouting within the ﬁeld scale.\
    \ From the ET maps (Figure 9), we\ncan observe that the evapotranspiration of\
    \ crops varied even with the same treatment. Table 4 shows\nthe mean and CV values\
    \ of diﬀerent treatments due to the diﬀerent soil texture and soil heterogeneity\n\
    in the ﬁeld. Explicitly, because of the dual eﬀect of soil heterogeneity and water\
    \ stress, the CV of\nET reached 34% on DOY 241. Acquiring such data for planning\
    \ is probably the role most people\nenvisage when they think of UAV remote sensing\
    \ for precision agriculture. For example, Shi et al. [72]\nproposed a decision\
    \ support system for variable rate irrigation through ﬁeld ET maps acquired by\n\
    multispectral UAV images, which were inputs to the fuzzy inference system and\
    \ were successful in\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n18 of 22\nproviding a duty-cycle\
    \ control map for a central pivot variable rate irrigation system. Compared with\n\
    satellite remote sensing data, using UAV for ﬁeld information management has unique\
    \ advantages,\nbut there are still challenges in its application. UAV remote sensing\
    \ images usually need to be acquired\non-site by researchers, which may lead to\
    \ problems if the research area is remote and diﬃcult to reach,\nand the UAV cannot\
    \ take long-distance photographs due to battery power limitations, so there are\n\
    certain limitations in wider-range crop monitoring. Moreover, using UAVs for planning\
    \ has high costs\nfor data acquisition and analysis. To make monitoring economically\
    \ worthwhile for farmers, new\nmethods of analysis are needed to bring costs down.\
    \ Even so, UAV technology is now available to give\nfarmers the data products\
    \ they have long been requesting from remote sensing [73]. In sum, this study\n\
    demonstrates the feasibility of mapping maize crop ET under the water stress condition\
    \ and monitor\nits spatial variability at a ﬁeld scale by using UAV-based VI-Kcb\
    \ and VI-Ks regression models.\n5. Conclusions\nAs the most widely used approach\
    \ for calculating crop evapotranspiration (ET), the FAO-56 dual\nKc method has\
    \ been increasingly used and improved with remote sensing data. However, the accurate\n\
    estimation of the temporal and spatial variability of crop ET within the ﬁeld\
    \ scale is still a challenge,\nespecially when water stress occurs. To better\
    \ monitor water requirements under water stress and\nprovide a simpler and more\
    \ maneuverable method for farming practices, this study investigated\nwhether\
    \ an UAV-based multispectral remote sensing system could map the evapotranspiration\
    \ of\nmaize under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation at the ﬁeld scale as a\
    \ supplement to the dual crop\ncoeﬃcient model. We conﬁrmed that CWSI can be a\
    \ better index assimilated into local maize ET\nestimation under deﬁcit irrigation.\
    \ The comparison results show that the ET derived from Ks-CWSI\nhad a higher correlation\
    \ with the modiﬁed FAO-56 Kc method, with a coeﬃcient of determination\nvalue\
    \ of 0.81, root mean square error value of 0.96 mm/d, and index of agreement value\
    \ of 0.94. Based\non which, a stable relationship between VIs and crop coeﬃcients\
    \ (Kcb and Ks) can be assimilated\ninto the FAO-56 dual Kc method for ﬁeld maize\
    \ ET estimation. Thanks to the UAV system, we could\nobtain high-resolution images\
    \ with higher frequencies for ﬁner irrigation management. In summary,\nthis study\
    \ demonstrates the feasibility of mapping maize crop evapotranspiration and monitoring\
    \ its\nspatial variability within the ﬁeld scale by using UAV-based multispectral\
    \ images under the water\nstress condition. Future experiments will incorporate\
    \ the ground validation (eddy covariance or\nlysimeter) of ET to provide an independent\
    \ assessment of model accuracy and use more convenient\nand reliable water stress\
    \ indices to evaluate crop stress and quantify crop evapotranspiration over a\n\
    longer crop growth period.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.T. and\

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Maize production in Thailand is increasingly suffering
    from drought periods along the cropping season. This creates the need for rapid
    and accurate methods to detect crop water stress to prevent yield loss. The study
    was, therefore, conducted to improve the efficacy of thermal imaging for assessing
    maize water stress and yield prediction. The experiment was carried out under
    controlled and field conditions in Phitsanulok, Thailand. Five treatments were
    applied, including (T1) fully irrigated treatment with 100% of crop water requirement
    (CWR) as control; (T2) early stress with 50% of CWR from 20 days after sowing
    (DAS) until anthesis and subsequent rewatering; (T3) sustained deficit at 50%
    of CWR from 20 DAS until harvest; (T4) late stress with 100% of CWR until anthesis
    and 50% of CWR after anthesis until harvest; (T5) late stress with 100% of CWR
    until anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis. Canopy temperature (FLIR), crop
    growth and soil moisture were measured at 5-day-intervals. Under controlled conditions,
    early water stress significantly reduced maize growth and yield. Water deficit
    after anthesis had no significant effect. A new combination of wet/dry sponge
    type reference surfaces was used for the determination of the Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI). There was a strong relationship between CWSI and stomatal conductance
    (R² = 0.90), with a CWSI of 0.35 being correlated to a 64%-yield loss. Assessing
    CWSI at 55 DAS, that is, at tasseling, under greenhouse conditions corresponded
    best to the final maize yield. This linear regression model validated well in
    both maize lowland (R² = 0.94) and maize upland fields (R² = 0.97) under the prevailing
    variety, soil and climate conditions. The results demonstrate that, using improved
    standardized references and data acquisition protocols, thermal imaging CWSI monitoring
    according to critical phenological stages enables yield prediction under drought
    stress. 1 INTRODUCTION Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important cereal
    grains worldwide in both temperate and tropical regions. In Thailand, it is mostly
    grown on marginal sites in both upland and lowland areas of rainfed cropping systems.
    The impact of recent climate change, triggering more erratic rainfall and longer
    drought periods, has substantially affected maize production in Thailand causing
    disproportionally high yield declines (Hirich et al., 2016; Khongdee et al., 2021).
    The magnitude of yield loss depends on the duration and severity of drought stress
    and the phenological stage at which the crop is affected (Sah et al., 2020). While
    drought stress during early stages of development results in smaller plants with
    a lower photosynthetic potential for overall biomass generation, drought stress
    during later stages (flowering to grain filling) affects yield formation and leads
    to a lower harvest index. Timely irrigation management necessitates sufficient
    water supply at any time of the cropping period to avoid drought and prevent yield
    reduction due to water shortage. Therefore, knowledge of the impact of drought
    stress and methods to identify its occurrence are fundamental in order to deal
    with sub-optimal water supply. Conventional methods for monitoring crop water
    stress rely on soil moisture measurements or determination of the matric potential
    in root zone (Kumar et al., 2020). However, accounting for soil heterogeneity
    in the field is often difficult (Clarke, 1997), additionally, soil water status
    is an indirect way to determine the actual plant water status. Thus, over the
    last three decades, several methods to monitor crop water stress at the plant
    directly have been developed. Crop water stress monitoring by plant-based approaches
    includes the determination of stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, relative
    water content and sap flow measurements (Jones, 2004). These methods, however,
    are time consuming and labour intensive, and some methods are destructive and
    hence are used more in research rather than in irrigation planning (Ihuoma & Madramootoo,
    2017). Remote sensing methods, on the contrary, such as spectral vegetation indices
    and infrared thermography are interesting alternative methods for the practice
    due to their reliability, rapidity of data acquisition and non-destructive nature
    (Ihuoma & Madramootoo, 2017; Mwinuka et al., 2021). Monitoring canopy temperature
    is probably the most practical way to obtain information on the crop water status.
    The temperature of the crop canopy increases as heat (solar energy) is absorbed
    into it but cools when that energy is used to evaporate water or transpire. Stomata
    close in response to soil water depletion, resulting in a decrease in water uptake,
    gas exchange and photosynthesis. Water-stressed plants would thus generally have
    less transpiration and hence a higher temperature than non-stressed ones (Payero
    & Irmak, 2006). Similar effects have been observed as a response to both biotic
    (pests/diseases (Hatfield & Pinter, 1993)) and abiotic (e.g., nutrient (Lin et
    al., 2012)) stress. Thus, if the water stress is the primarily object of thermal
    studies, other stress factors need to be avoided in order that the canopy temperature
    serves as an indicator of plant water status (Payero & Irmak, 2006). Several studies
    have been conducted to develop infrared thermography as a method to identify water
    stress status of crops such as maize (Zia et al., 2013), potato (Solanum tuberosum
    L.) (Gerhards et al., 2016), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Hu et al., 2011), grapevine
    (Vitis vinifera L.) (Jones, 2002; Zia et al., 2009), olive (Olea europaea L.)
    (García-Tejero et al., 2017) and longan (Dimocarpus longan L.) (Wirya-Alongkorn
    et al., 2013). However, numerous climatic and microclimatic factors affect plant
    canopy temperature, such as solar radiation, wind, air temperature and humidity.
    Therefore, thermography measurements alone cannot detect plant water stress. Several
    strategies for measuring crop water stress using infrared thermography have been
    developed. Tc (crop canopy temperature) is used as the key indicator for estimation
    crop water stress in all the methods, usually as a single value during a high
    stress period or by calculating the time duration above a temperature threshold.
    This, however, requires a reference measurement of an unstressed control or a
    complex model to determine this threshold. For example, the difference in temperature
    between the canopy (Tc) and the air (Ta) has long been used as an indicator of
    water stress to account for climate variation. Idso et al. (1977) used the rising
    degree day concept to demonstrate that the accumulation of regular afternoon temperature
    variations, Tc–Ta, during the crop growing season is linearly related to final
    crop yield. Moreover, Wang and Gartung (2010) have reported using canopy temperature
    measurements with infrared thermometry for assessing water status of peach trees
    (Prunus persica) and a reasonable correlation between stem water potential and
    the canopy to air temperature difference was found. However, this method was mostly
    ignored after an introduction of the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) in the early
    1980s (Idso et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981). CWSI uses a wet and a dry surface
    to simulate the border conditions of a non-transpiring and fully transpiring leaf
    to quantify crop water stress based on the current meteorological conditions.
    Applications of CWSI for maize have been evaluated in a number of recent studies
    (Apolo-apolo et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2010; Irmak et al., 2000; Zia et al.,
    2011). To improve the CWSI method, baselines have been established, obtaining
    concurrent measurements of air temperature and relative humidity. Baselines simulate
    the complete dehydration as well as the full watering of the plant in order to
    use as a reference state for the interpretation of plant stress status. Nevertheless,
    established references for fully irrigated plants and completely dry plant conditions
    to monitor plant water deficiency are not yet reliable for all crops (Grant et
    al., 2007). Apolo-apolo et al. (2020) developed new hemispherical wet and dry
    reference surfaces using a cellulose napkin paper together with a hemispheric
    plastic mould and a 3D printer for CWSI detection in maize. This approach allowed
    the accurate determination of Twet and Tdry in maize, though Tdry could be obtained
    directly from a dry artificial reference surfaces (ARS) temperature, a solar radiation-based
    transformation was required to determine Twet from the wet ARS temperature. Estimating
    CWSI in maize crops, however, is still limited as the practical implementation
    of this method by farmers or advisory services remains challenging. This is especially
    true, when considering the future necessity for large-scale and automated procedures
    of image acquisition and evaluation (Zhou et al., 2021), as the more data enter
    into the drought stress assessment to more important is the comparability of different
    data sets. In this study, we hypothesize that using more adequate wet and dry
    references may improve the efficiency of CWSI for monitoring maize water stress.
    Therefore, we conducted two maize water deficit irrigation experiments in order
    to (i) test a new approach to establish wet/dry references for use in CWSI by
    thermal imaging, (ii) to test whether the improved CWSI method relates to stomatal
    conductance and hence water stress and (iii) to assess the potential of the improved
    CWSI to predict maize yield under field conditions. The thermal imaging method
    was first tested under controlled conditions in a greenhouse, which was used as
    a rainout shelter, using controlled-water deficit irrigation treatments to induce
    stress during different critical stages of plant development. Thereafter, the
    improved thermal imaging-based CWSI approach was validated in a lowland field
    experiment under controlled-water deficit irrigation treatments. Finally, the
    developed CWSI method was applied and tested in an upland field experiment under
    rainfed conditions. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Experimental setup This study
    was carried out under two different growing and irrigation conditions. The first
    experiment was conducted in the greenhouse under controlled irrigation conditions
    followed by a similarly irrigated lowland field experiment and finally an upland
    field experiment under rainfed conditions. The first two experiments were implemented
    at Thapo sub-district, Mueang district, Phitsanulok province located in the lower
    north of Thailand (16.73°N, 100.18°E and 16.74°N, 100.21oE; Figure 1). The third
    experiment was conducted at Wang Thong district, Phitsanulok province, Thailand
    (16.90°N, 100.53°E; Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Experimental
    location map For the greenhouse experiment under controlled conditions, maize
    variety CP888 was planted in big plastic containers (with 80 kg soil) from September
    to December 2018. The experimental design was arranged as a randomized complete
    block design (RCBD) with five treatments and five replications. A clay loam soil
    (sand 21.8%, silt 48.1% and clay 30.1%), EC 0.38 dS m−1, pH 5.6, OM 1.2%, total
    N 0.06%, available P 7.99 mg kg−1 and exchangeable K 46.1 mg kg−1 was used in
    experiment. Fertilizer was split-applied to maize, receiving a basal dressing
    of 24 kg ha−1 of N, 24 kg ha−1 of P and 24 kg ha−1 of K as a compound fertilizer
    at maize planting and a top dressing of 86.3 kg ha−1 of N as urea 30 days after
    maize sowing (DAS) as recommended by the Department of Agriculture of Thailand.
    Five irrigation treatments were designed based on the calculation of crop water
    requirement (CWR) being equal to the potential crop evapotranspiration of maize
    (ETc maize), using the modified FAO Penman–Monteith equation to calculate potential
    reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and multiplying it with crop coefficients recommended
    for maize (Kc maize) (Allen et al., 1998). All treatments received 100% CWR up
    to 20 DAS, following with five treatments as follows: (T1) “control” with full
    irrigation: 100% CWR (T2) “early stress”: 50% CWR from 20 DAS until anthesis and
    100% CWR after anthesis until harvest (T3) “sustained deficit”: 50% CWR from 20
    DAS until harvest (T4) “late stress”: 100% CWR up to anthesis and 50% CWR after
    anthesis until harvest (T5) “terminal stress”: 100% CWR up to anthesis and no
    irrigation after anthesis Details of water irrigation scheduling are presented
    in Table S1. The lowland field experiment was conducted from February to May 2020.
    The experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with
    five treatments and five replications. Water deficit treatments were identical
    to T1–T5 described above and arranged according to the greenhouse experiment under
    controlled conditions. The soil was classified as clayey soil (sand 15.5%, silt
    31.51% and clay 49.99%) with pH 7.5, EC 0.48 dS m−1, OM 0.8%, available P 1.81
    mg kg−1, exchangeable K 18.0 mg kg−1 and bulk density of 1.64 g cm−3. The plot
    size was 30 m2. Maize spacing was 75 cm between rows and 25 cm between plants
    in the row. Drip irrigation was applied according to the water deficit treatments.
    Fertilization was according to the recommendations of the department of Agriculture
    of Thailand as described above. In addition, maize yield data and CWSI values
    at 55 DAS from an additional upland maize field under rainfed condition were used
    to repeat the validation of the previously established CWSI–maize yield relationships.
    The experiment was carried out during 2018 on upland soil in a nearby region (Wang
    Thong district, Figure 1), using a split-plot design with three replications.
    Treatments were: July-planted maize sole cropping (control), July-planted maize–mungbean
    (Vigna radiata) relay cropping and June-planted maize sole cropping. Details of
    this experiment, that is, weather, soil and crop management, are described by
    Khongdee et al. (2021). 2.2 Soil moisture and weather data Soil moisture sensors
    (Watermark. IRROMETER, USA) were placed at 10 cm depth from soil surface to monitor
    the soil water potential. Field capacity (FC) and drought stress threshold (TH)
    were calculated based on soil matric potential. Weather data including temperature
    and relative humidity were recorded hourly by Tinytag sensors (Gemini, UK) (Figure
    2). Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was calculated as follows (Monteith & Unsworth,
    2014): (1) where RH is relative humidity (%) and T is air temperature (°C). FIGURE

    in the lowland field (b). Data were collected at Thapo sub-district, Mueang district,
    Phitsanulok province, lower north of Thailand 2.3 Maize growth, physiological
    and yield measurements Maize growth parameters, for example, plant height, leaf
    area, green value (SPAD) and maximum quantum yield of PSII were evaluated every
    2 weeks. Plant height and leaf area of maize were measured by a tape meter. Two
    leaves (No. 3 and 4 from the top) were selected to measure SPAD and maximum quantum
    yield of PSII (Fv/Fm). SPAD and maximum quantum yield of PSII were measured with
    a SPAD-502 meter (Konica-Minolta, Japan) and FluorPen FP 100-MAX meter (Photon
    Systems Instruments, Czech Republic), respectively. Moreover, leaf stomatal conductance
    was measured by Porometer model SC-1 leaf porometer (Decagon Devices, Washington)
    twice a week together with thermal imaging capture. Final maize grain yield under
    controlled and field conditions was collected at 115 DAS and was assessed for
    treatment comparison. 2.4 Thermal image acquisition FLIR camera (model C2, spectral
    range 7.5–14 µm and resolution of 80 × 60 pixel; FLIR Company, USA) was positioned
    at 1.5 m above the top of the maize canopy. The emissivity of the FLIR camera
    was set at 0.95. Thermal images were taken twice a week under both controlled
    and field conditions. After initial tests, the time 12:00–2:00 PM was determined
    as the most appropriate phase to record water stress by thermal imaging (Pradawet
    et al., 2019). Wet and dry reference surface readings, at the same time as thermal
    image acquisition, were used for false colour image interpretation. The green
    colour surface of cellulose sponge cloth (high liquid absorption and retention
    capacity; 3M company) was used for the artificial wet reference (Twet) by soaking
    both sides with water, while the sponge cloth without soaking with water was set
    as dry reference (Tdry) (Figure 3). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    and El3–EI8 plant measurement spots on 3rd or 4th leave 2.5 Thermal image processing
    and computation of CWSI Thermal image processing was done by FLIR Tools software
    version 5.1. Canopy temperature (Tc) was determined from the ellipse tool function
    as the software generates maximum, minimum and average value of leaves temperature
    of each pixel in the selected circle area of the maize leaves No. 3 or 4 from
    the top canopy. Averaged values of three spots of leave temperature were made
    as shown in Figure 2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) was calculated according
    to the equation given below (Jones, 2002). (2) where Tc is mean canopy temperature
    in °C, Tdry is dry reference temperature obtained by sponge cloth without watering,
    and Twet is the wet reference temperature obtained by soaking the sponge cloth
    with water. The CWSI values range between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates maximum stress
    and 0 indicates the absence of water stress. 2.6 Statistical analysis The growth
    and physiological responses of maize under different water deficits at different
    time points were analysed by means of an ANOVA by using JMP Pro 15.1.0 (SAS Institute
    Cary, NC). The Least Significant Difference (LSD) was used to identify significant
    differences among treatments (p ≤ .05 and p ≤ .01) for the greenhouse and the
    lowland field with RCBD design and the upland field with split-plot design. We
    can assume that growth, physiology and yield of maize were independent for each
    time point as they were collected quite far away from each other. Hence, there
    were big differences between maize plants of data points. Yield prediction was
    conducted by developing a linear regression model between crop yield and CWSI,
    using data collected under controlled conditions. For the initial validation of
    the linear regression model, crop yield and CWSI data from the water deficit irrigation
    lowland field experiment at Mueang district, Phitsanulok province, were used.
    The validation was repeated using maize data from an experiment under rainfed
    condition on an upland field at Wang Thong district, Phitsanulok province, where
    the same thermal imaging approach was used. The efficiency of CWSI in a maize
    yield prediction equation model was tested using root-mean-square error (RMSE),
    mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE).
    If RMSE and MAE is zero, it underlines the goodness of the agreement between measured
    and predicted data. NSE ranges between 1.0 (perfect fit) and -∞. NSE lower than
    0 indicates that mean value of observations would have been a better predictor
    than the model (Apolo-apolo et al., 2020). 3 RESULTS 3.1 Soil water condition
    of different water regimes The soil water status under controlled conditions is
    presented as log10 of soil water retention (pF) (Figure 4). The graph shows that
    from emergence until 20 DAS, the soil matric potential was on the same level in
    all treatments (pF = 2.0–2.5). Under full irrigation, soil water retention remained
    steadily in between field capacity and above drought stress threshold. Ten days
    after reducing irrigation to 50% CWR in T2, the soil dried below the drought stress
    threshold level, but regained a favourable moisture level again after reinitiating
    irrigation again after anthesis. Soil moisture of T3 initially followed the same
    pattern as T2 and as the irrigation level remained at 50% CWR drought increased
    until the maize was harvested. Water retention of T4 and T5 was mostly similar
    to control before anthesis phase, but their water content thereafter dropped.
    In addition, it was most pronounced in T5 after anthesis phase exhibiting a water
    retention beyond drought stress threshold value until harvest. For changes in
    weather, the CWR was overestimated between 65 and 72 DAS, leading to a temporary
    surpassing of FC in T1 and T2. The amount of irrigation was subsequently adjusted.

    of CWR after anthesis until harvest; and T5 = late stress with 100% of CWR until
    anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis 3.2 Maize growth and physiological responses
    under different water regimes Under controlled conditions, growth and development
    of maize were significantly affected by the different water regimes (Figure 5).
    Full irrigation up to anthesis until harvest (T1 and T4) increased height of maize
    significantly (p < .05) reaching a maximum height of about 230 cm. With regard
    to the SPAD index, leaf area and maximum quantum yield of PSII of maize leaves
    were also significantly higher in T4 and T5 than in the other irrigation treatments.
    The plant height in the early drought stressed treatments (T2 and T3) was lower
    and did not recover after re-irrigation in T2. T2 and T3 were also low in SPAD
    values with less than 40 SPAD units, the leaf area was less than 6000 cm2 pl−1,
    and maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) was lower than 0.6. Results of maize
    growth and physiology of maize under field conditions were mostly similar to those
    obtained under greenhouse conditions as shown in Figure S1. FIGURE 5 Open in figure

    of CWR from 20 DAS until harvest; T4 = late stress with 100% of CWR until anthesis
    and 50% of CWR after anthesis until harvest; T5 = late stress with 100% of CWR
    until anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis. Note: * = significant differences
    of each time point at p ≤ .05 3.3 Canopy temperature, stomatal conductance and
    relationship to CWSI Canopy temperatures in T2 and T3 were significantly higher
    than in the control (T1) during 30 to 55 DAS under greenhouse and 37 to 50 DAS
    under field conditions as shown in Figure 6a and c. The canopy temperatures of
    T4 and T5 mostly were similar as compared to control. Stomatal conductance showed
    a similar trend as canopy temperature. T2 and T3 had significantly lower stomatal
    conductance than control as shown in Figure 6b and d. FIGURE 6 Open in figure

    T5 = late stress with 100%of CWR until anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis.
    Note: * = significant differences of each time point at p ≤ .05 3.4 Thermal imagery-based
    CWSI response at different levels of irrigation Under controlled conditions in
    the greenhouse, early drought stressed treatments (T2 and T3) showed significantly
    higher CWSI values than other treatments throughout the experiment (Figure 7a).
    Mean CWSI value of T2 and T3 climbed up to 0.35 at 55 DAS, whereas CWSI values
    of the other treatments remained low between 0.05 and 0.15, similar to the control.
    Consequently, yields of maize T2 and T3 were adversely affected, resulting in
    low grain yield production of about 2.5 Mg ha−1, whereas control obtained a median
    of 8.5 Mg ha−1 (Figure 7b). For the lowland field condition, results of CWSI and
    T3 were higher than the other treatments at around 30–50 DAS (Figure 7c), resulting
    in lower yield in T3 (5 Mg ha−1) (Figure 7d). FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    ≤ .05 Stomatal conductance has been widely used as a crop water stress detection
    method. Maize canopy temperature by thermal imaging alone had a very weak relationship
    with maize stomatal conductance (R2 = 0.02) as shown in Figure 8a. However, CWSI
    developed in this study using thermal imaging and improved dry/wet controls was
    strongly (R2 = 0.90) and linearly related to stomatal conductance under greenhouse
    conditions (Figure 8b). FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationships
    between stomatal conductance and canopy temperature (a) and stomatal conductance
    and crop water stress index (CWSI) (b) under controlled greenhouse conditions
    at 55 DAS 3.5 Maize yield prediction using CWSI Among several tested CWSI dates
    from 25 to 60 DAS of maize under greenhouse conditions, Table 1 reveals that measuring
    CWSI at 55 DAS (at tasseling stage) showed the strongest relationship between
    CWSI values and maize grain yield (R2 = 0.84). The linear regression at 55 DAS
    was “Yield = −16.05 × CWSI + 9.646”. Assessing CWSI between 50 and 60 DAS was
    also resulted in a strong relation with grain yield (R2 > 0.65), whereas those
    obtained between 25 and 45 DAS demonstrated a weak yield relation (R2 < 0.65).
    Hence, the linear regression of 55 DAS under controlled greenhouse conditions
    was validated by using CWSI and yield data of maize measured under lowland field
    conditions. The result showed that the yield predictions using CWSI assessment
    at 55 DAS were strongly correlated with yield of lowland maize under water deficit
    irrigation with R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.589, MAE = 0.459 and NSE = 0.843 (Figure 9a)
    as well as yield of upland maize under rainfed condition with R2 = 0.97, RMSE

    DISCUSSION 4.1 Effects of water deficits on maize growth, physiological responses
    and yield production As expected, it was observed that water deficit severely
    affected growth and development of plants as well as yield (Grant et al., 1989;
    Khalili et al., 2013; Patanè, 2011). However, it is important to evaluate growth
    responses dependent on timing and duration of water deficit. In this study, the
    most detrimental plant effect was observed under water deficit in the early stages
    of development and a recovery never took place, even after returning to full irrigation.
    This is a relevant finding considering the specific conditions in Thailand where
    crop development in early off-season production falls into the dry season and
    plants depend solely on potential irrigation, while during the later stages the
    onset of the rainy season lowers the evaporative demand and supplies rainwater
    to the crop. In this study, the establishment of late stress after full irrigation
    was not successful and neither drought stress reactions nor a significant reduction
    in yield were hence observed. Not only height of maize was negatively affected
    by water deficit, but also SPAD, leaf area and photosynthetic system. As reported
    in a number of studies (Ghosh et al., 2017; Greaves & Wang, 2017; Na et al., 2018;
    Romano et al., 2011; Sangakkara et al., 2001), water stress decreased source and
    sink relationships that may also interfere with N uptake and photosynthesis of
    maize. Leaf area was reduced under water deficit conditions; hence, water stress
    significantly decreased radiation use efficiency of maize, which has been also
    reported in the literature (Earl & Davis, 2003; Stone et al., 2001). Chlorophyll
    fluorescence is one of the most powerful and widely used techniques to determine
    the photosynthetic efficiency. In general, the value of maximum quantum yield
    of the photo system II of maize (FV/Fm ratio) could be around 0.8 depending on
    maize variety (Guidi et al., 2019). A decline of this ratio is a good indicator
    of photoinhibition. Our results revealed that the reduction in irrigation by 50%
    from 20 to 60 DAS (T2 and T3) negatively affected the efficiency of maize photosynthesis,
    while control and other treatments remained at the standard value. In addition,
    yield of maize decreased by approximately 64% due to the water management in T2
    and T3. A strong water stress during the vegetative growth stage seriously inhibited
    the growth and leaf area of maize plants and decrease yield (Ghosh et al., 2017;
    Romano et al., 2011). This effect was further enhanced by the observed reduced
    greenness of leaves which is directly linked to less nitrogen uptake and a subsequent
    reduction in leaf area and photosynthetic activity (Urban et al., 2021). Source
    ability is determined by the photosynthetic products assimilated during the maize
    grain filling phase. Sink strength is defined by the growing grains’ capacity
    to absorb these assimilates. Generally, the yield of maize grain has been reported
    to be sink limited (Bonelli et al., 2016). Consequently, seed number per crop
    of T2 and T3 was significantly decreased (data not shown). However, maize with
    even little water stress during the early vegetative growth and late grain-filling
    stages could also decrease growth and yield of maize (Kang et al., 2000; Tariq
    & Usman, 2009). In our study, reducing irrigation by 50% (T4) or 100% (T5) of
    the control amount from anthesis until harvest had no serious effect on maize
    growth and yield. This was because the residual water content in the soil was
    still sufficient for maize to produce grain yield (Figure 3). Thus, in the absence
    of drought stress, stomatal conductance and leave temperature during the critical
    period of these two treatments were similar to the control (Figure 6). Hence,
    reducing irrigation after the critical flowering period of maize had little effect
    on maize yield production. However, these treatments created variation in maize
    yield production under both controlled and field conditions as seen in Figure
    7b and d. 4.2 CWSI indicates water stress levels of maize Canopy temperature is
    a valuable plant water stress indicator that has been used in several crops (Gerhards
    et al., 2016; Wirya-Alongkorn et al., 2013; Zia et al., 2013). In this study,
    it was confirmed that canopy temperature is also an efficient water stress indicator
    for maize, particularly when combined with the newly establish dry/wet references
    used for CWSI calculation. Canopy temperature of maize reliably increased with
    reduced irrigation (Figure 6a and c). Clearly, canopy temperature alone cannot
    efficiently indicate drought stress. This is in part shown by the weak correlation
    with maize stomatal conductance, which served as a reference in this study (Figure
    8a). This is because the impact on overall canopy temperature by leaf transpiration
    was insignificant as compared to environmental factors. Therefore, dry/wet references
    using wet and dry sponges were shown to be a good reference to account for the
    change in environmental conditions and allowed to calculate an improved CWSI to
    quantify water stress levels of maize (Jackson et al., 1981; Jones, 2002). The
    CWSI developed in this study was linearly and highly correlated (R² = 0.90) with
    stomatal conductance under controlled conditions. Even though stomatal conduction
    was used as a reference measurement in this study, data analysis revealed that
    during periods of stress, CWSI remained high and showed lower variation as compared
    to stomatal conductance. This indicates that thermal imaging is a more reliable
    stress indicator for the practice than the determination of stomatal conductance.
    CWSI based on constant wet and dry reference surfaces on the same image excludes
    the human factor, especially when computerized image recognition is used. The
    determination of stomatal conductance in contrast depends on the person taking
    the measurement to assess the situation about environmental factors such as exposure
    to the sun or position within the canopy prior to taking the measurement on a
    limited portion of the canopy (Damour et al., 2010). Furthermore, the measurement
    always implies a certain time delay and unlike thermal imaging which allows to
    assess the whole canopy at the same time, stomatal conductance cannot be measured
    at different points simultaneously. Thus, stress monitoring based on CWSI is likely
    to become more widespread (Zhou et al., 2021). To detect stress based on CWSI,
    the identification of critical values is important (Kacira et al., 2002). In this
    study under controlled conditions, the peak CWSI was 0.35, which was correlated
    with yield losses of up to 64% in T2 and T3, while a CWSI of less than 0.1 indicated
    no stress. Under field conditions, the peak CWSI was 0.42 and lowest CWSI was
    0.1, resulting in maize yield loss up to 38% in T3. Other studies have observed
    different critical CWSI values, depending on the methods applied. For example,
    a low CWSI value of about 0.2 has been reported for maize under well-watered conditions
    and a CWSI of above 0.6 has been reported to reduce maize grain yields by 13%
    under field conditions in subtropical environment (Romano et al., 2011; Yazar
    et al., 1999). The method applied here differed from others mainly in the way
    reference surfaces was used. Grant et al. (2007) and Jones (1999,2002) pioneered
    the use of CWSI based on a method of spraying water on leaves (wet reference)
    and coating leaves with Vaseline (dry reference). Simulation of dry reference
    by clogging leaves with Vaseline leads to permanently closed maize stomata and
    negatively affects leaves functioning. In contrast, the technique shown here can
    quantify water stress levels of maize as well, without interfering with maize
    growth. Romano et al. (2011) used wet (wet bulb) and dry (Ta +5°C) references,
    which were not directly represented on the false colour image and, thus, required
    an extra step of calculation. The most recent study about improving the use of
    reference surfaces for the analysis of CWSI in maize by Apolo-apolo et al. (2020)
    suggests the use of hemispherical bodies of a standardized material. The applicability
    in the field and transferability of the results, however, still need testing.
    This demonstrates the importance of the actual design of the reference surfaces
    especially when applying different methods of image acquisition, for example,
    by a hand-held device or by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The use of standardized
    surfaces is also a very important prerequisite for the development of algorithms
    to improve machine learning methods and statistical models for the application
    of CWSI assessment methods on a larger scale and a higher scale of automation
    (Tariq & Usman, 2009). While these methods may lead to a review of the actual
    references used in practice in the future, the high correlation of the CWSI determined
    based on the sponge material used in this study to stomatal conductance (R² =
    0.90) shows the suitability of the method presented here. 4.3 Validity of improved
    CWSI as maize yield predictor Beyond the sheer detection of drought stress, this
    study shows a way to predict the yield level based on a linear regression equation
    using CWSI55DAS under controlled conditions. Measuring the canopy temperature
    of maize at various growth stages can reveal a range of effects on growth and
    yield development. This study started tracking maize canopy temperature at 25
    DAS and continued until 60 DAS for each 5-day period following the initiation
    of deficit irrigation at 20 DAS. A longer period of water deficit improves the
    predictability of CWSI on maize yield production under controlled conditions.
    CWSI55DAS was the most accurate for predicting final maize yield among the tested
    measurement time options as it was the most critical water requiring period. CWSI55DAS
    developed in the greenhouse revealed a strong correlation with maize yield production
    in the field as well (R² = 0.94 under irrigation maize field experiment and R²
    = 0.97 under rainfed upland maize field condition). Additionally, the results
    of this study show that 55 DAS was a good prediction period because there was
    no major water stress after anthesis or during grain filling, thereby constraining
    the applicability of this specific regression to cases without major late development
    stress. It is easier to calibrate CWSI in the greenhouse than it is in the field
    because the controlled conditions in the greenhouse environment allow for the
    creation of a well-defined and regulated moisture gradient. Water deficits can
    be handled in a manner that is directly related to maize water stress. In contrast
    under field conditions, experiments may be influenced by a variety of causes,
    including abiotic and biotic stress. Rain can fall unexpectedly during a time
    of water scarcity, as illustrated in our results in Figure 1b. Thus, calibrating
    the CWSI in the greenhouse and then validating it in the field can demonstrate
    the effects of water stress more clearly than testing under a single-field condition.
    In this study, CWSI was tested using a hybrid maize variety (CP888) with a harvesting
    cycle of 110 days. For this variety, around 50–55 DAS, maize reached its maximum
    height and started to shed its pollen (tasseling stage). Source and sink relationship
    was imbalanced due to sink being limited (pollen abortion) by drought effects.
    Water stress in maize is the most severe during tasseling and can result in a
    severe yield loss if the tassel is partially lost (Udom & Kamalu, 2019). Therefore,
    this growth stage could be a good measuring time to predict final maize yield
    by CWSI as it is the most sensitive period to water stress. Using this approach
    for yield prediction needs to consider the maize variety as the life cycle of
    each variety is different, meaning that the critical maize growth stages are reached
    at different times. Additionally, microclimate and other stresses, that is, nutrient
    deficiency and diseases must be considered as factors restricting the CWSI''s
    ability to predict final maize grain yield (Nanda et al., 2018). Irmak et al.
    (2000) assessed CWSI of maize under field conditions in a Mediterranean semiarid
    climate and predicted maize yield using CWSI. Their CWSI values of maize at pollinating
    stage were related with maize grain yield by a polynomial function (R² = 0.98).
    Similarly, this study showed that CWSI was related with maize grain yield by a
    polynomial function (Table S2). 5 CONCLUSIONS Along with the development of a
    water stress detection technology, a new wet/dry technique using a sponge cloth
    is proposed to obtain reliable CSWI values. Strong relationships between CWSI
    and stomatal conductance were found under the different maize water deficit treatments,
    showing the suitability of CWSI to quantify maize water stress levels. However,
    in order to make absolute values comparable uniform and standardized references
    are necessary. We conclude that the use of adequate reference surfaces is an important
    prerequisite for the reliable determination of CWSI on the one hand and for the
    comparability of data on the other hand. Maize responded strongly to severity
    and time of water deficits occurring before critical growth stages. In this study,
    due to the conditions on the research site, water deficits after anthesis were
    not prominent and, thus, did not show a major effect on maize growth and yield
    due to sufficient remaining residual water in this clay loam soil. In contrast,
    the yields in treatments subjected to drought stress during crop development were
    reduced by 64% compared with the well-watered control as water stress occurred
    at the critical tasseling stage of maize. This yield reduction did occur even
    when water supply was sufficient at a later stage. Taking this into account, we
    were able to show that a yield loss prediction is best done, when considering
    the severity of the stress and the phenological stage of the crop. Assessing CWSI
    at 55 DAS, that is, at tasseling, had a strong linear correlation with grain yield.
    This linear regression provides a high potential to predict the grain yield of
    this variety based on CWSI values even under field conditions under similar soils.
    Further research is required to determine the robustness of the method under different
    soils, for different varieties and stress patterns. For the agricultural practice,
    in order to accommodate more plants in one picture and hence account for spatial
    variability, a remotely piloted aerial vehicle equipped with a digital camera
    is recommended to be employed to improve early detection of water stress in maize,
    when combined with the developed dry/wet references strategically positioned in
    the field. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was sponsored and supported by the National

    \ and real-time estimation of crop coeﬃcients at the farm scale is one of\nthe\
    \ key prerequisites in precision agricultural water management. This study aimed\
    \ to map the maize\ncrop coeﬃcient (Kc) with improved accuracy under diﬀerent\
    \ levels of deﬁcit irrigation. The proposed\nmethod for estimating the Kc is based\
    \ on multispectral images of high spatial resolution taken using\nan unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle (UAV). The analysis was performed on ﬁve experimental plots using\
    \ Kc\nvalues measured from the daily soil water balance in Ordos, Inner Mongolia,\
    \ China. To accurately\nestimate the Kc, the fraction of vegetation cover (fc)\
    \ derived from the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\nindex (NDVI) was used to compare\
    \ with ﬁeld measurements, and the stress coeﬃcients (Ks) calculated\nfrom two\
    \ vegetation index (VI) regression models were compared. The results showed that\
    \ the NDVI\nvalues under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation had no signiﬁcant\
    \ diﬀerence in the reproductive stage\nbut changed signiﬁcantly in the maturation\
    \ stage, with a decrease of 0.09 with 72% water applied\ndiﬀerence. The fc calculated\
    \ from the NDVI had a high correlation with ﬁeld measurement data,\nwith a coeﬃcient\
    \ of determination (R2) of 0.93. The ratios of transformed chlorophyll absorption\n\
    in reﬂectance index (TCARI) to renormalized diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI)\
    \ and TCARI to\nsoil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were used, respectively,\
    \ to establish two types of Ks regression\nmodels to retrieve Kc. Compared to\
    \ the TCARI/SAVI model, the TCARI/RDVI model under diﬀerent\nlevels of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation had better correlation with Kc, with R2 and root-mean-square error\
    \ (RMSE)\nvalues ranging from 0.68 to 0.80 and from 0.140 to 0.232, respectively.\
    \ Compared to Kc calculated from\non-site measurements, the Kc values retrieved\
    \ from the VI regression models established in this study\nhad greater ability\
    \ to assess the ﬁeld variability of soil and crops. Overall, use of the UAV-measured\n\
    multispectral vegetation index approach could improve water management at the\
    \ farm scale.\nKeywords: crop coeﬃcient (Kc); vegetation indices; deﬁcit irrigation;\

    \ scarcity is a major factor limiting irrigated agriculture, especially in arid\
    \ and semi-arid areas\nof the world. Due to global climate changes and the imbalance\
    \ between water supply and demand,\nit is particularly necessary to improve crop\
    \ water use [1]. Therefore, the regulated deﬁcit irrigation\n(RDI) strategy for\
    \ reducing water consumption is widely used in current agriculture [2]. In this\
    \ context,\nhow to accurately estimate and monitor crop water requirements is\
    \ not only the key for optimizing\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250; doi:10.3390/s19235250\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n2 of 17\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ and improving water use eﬃciency, but also essential research for enhancing\n\
    food production and SAVIng regional water resources [3,4].\nA common indicator\
    \ of crop water requirements is the crop coeﬃcient (Kc), which was presented\n\
    in FAO 56 [5] and is used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by multiplying\
    \ the reference crop\nevapotranspiration (ET0) [6]. The Kc primarily depends on\
    \ meteorological information, crop-speciﬁc\ncoeﬃcients, the lengths of crop growth\
    \ stages, and plant-available soil water [7]. It can be estimated\nusing single\
    \ and dual Kc approaches. The single approach is the averaging of Kc trends that\
    \ incorporate\nplant transpiration (Kcb) and soil evaporation (Ke).\nCompared\
    \ to the single approach, the dual\napproach improves the estimation accuracy\
    \ of ET by considering the plant transpiration and soil\nevaporation separately,\
    \ i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke [8]. However, in practical crop conditions, the Kc needs\
    \ to be\nappropriately adjusted by using a stress coeﬃcient (Ks) for nonstandard\
    \ conditions, especially water\nstress conditions [6]. The dual approach has been\
    \ appropriately used for crops at a ﬁeld or regional\nscale [9–13].\nTo date,\
    \ several methods have been presented to monitor Kc, such as soil water balance,\
    \ eddy\ncovariance, Bowen ratio, lysimeter, and remote sensing [14–18]. In situ\
    \ measurements are likely to be\ntime-consuming and costly, and make it hard to\
    \ consider the spatial variability of crops and soil [19].\nTherefore, remote\
    \ sensing of Kc has become increasingly recommended in irrigation management.\
    \ One\nof the most common approaches is to estimate the real-time Kcb and Kc through\
    \ empirical equations\nof vegetation indices (VIs) such as the normalized diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI) derived from\nmultispectral images [20–23]. Such empirical\
    \ equations rely on the close relationship between the VIs\nand various actual\
    \ plant growth parameters, e.g., leaf area index [24,25], fraction of ground covered\
    \ by\nplants [26,27], and biomass [24,28]. However, Pereira et al. [7] noted that\
    \ NDVI-based methods can not\naccurately observe a decrease in Kc and Kcb when\
    \ crops are under water stress. Zhang and Zhou [29]\nproposed that crop water\
    \ status can be accurately monitored using the VIs which are not only sensitive\n\
    to water information but also contain vegetation growth status. Consequently,\
    \ partial VIs such as\nthe reﬂectance index (TCARI), optimization of soil-adjusted\
    \ vegetation index (OSAVI), soil-adjusted\nvegetation index (SAVI), and renormalized\
    \ diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI) can eﬀectively monitor\ncrop water status\
    \ [30]. For example, Haboudane et al. [31] utilized TCARI/OSAVI to predict maize\n\
    water status in Canada and reported a high correlation between TCARI/OSAVI and\
    \ chlorophyll content.\nZhang et al. [19] evaluated maize water stress and its\
    \ spatial variability by multispectral remote sensing.\nThe results showed that\
    \ two regression models based on TCARI/RDVI and TCARI/SAVI were able to\nmonitor\
    \ the crop water stress index (CWSI) with respective coeﬃcients of determination\
    \ (R2) of 0.81\nand 0.80 under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation.\nUnmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAVs) in remote sensing have exponentially increased in applications\n\
    of precision agriculture over the past decade [32]. Compared to conventional data\
    \ acquisition methods\nfor remote sensing, such as satellites and spectrometers\
    \ [33,34], UAVs oﬀer many obvious advantages\nto support water resource management\
    \ and planning [35,36]. One of the most common advantages is\nthat UAVs can provide\
    \ high-quality data at the required scale and time, while conventional methods\n\
    have not been applied in practice at the farm scale due to their coarse spatial\
    \ resolution, infrequent\ncoverage, and high cost [37,38]. Additionally, UAVs\
    \ can be used to obtain low-cost data as frequently\nas necessitated by the monitoring\
    \ task because of their ease of operation and deployment, their high\nﬂexibility,\
    \ and the decreasing cost of the platform [39]. Thus, UAV-based monitoring has\
    \ become\nincreasingly pervasive in supporting the real-time control of irrigation\
    \ systems.\nIn recent works, the abovementioned Ks has usually been calculated\
    \ using the FAO-56 soil water\ndepletion method proposed by Allen et al. [5].\
    \ For example, Pôças et al. [6] estimated the actual Kc for\nmaize, barley, and\
    \ olive based on VIs and a soil water balance model under water stress conditions.\n\
    The results showed that the Ks computed using the soil water balance model could\
    \ accurately exhibit\nreductions in Kc due to water stress. Another method to\
    \ determine Ks is based on indications of the\ninfrared canopy temperature, such\
    \ as the CWSI. Kullberg et al. [40] compared the performance of\nseveral canopy\
    \ temperature methods converted into Ks. The results showed that the CWSI based\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 5250\n3 of 17\non infrared thermal radiometry (IRT) had the\
    \ best accuracy compared to other methods, and it is\ntypically considered to\
    \ be scalable to Ks. Bellvert et al. [41] stated that mapping CWSI from UAV\n\
    thermal imagery has the limitation of inevitable mixed temperatures coming from\
    \ both the soil and\nleaves due to bigger pixels and full cover. Considering the\
    \ relationship between VIs and the CWSI\ndiscussed above, VIs have been found\
    \ to have a comparable ability to monitor Kc under water stress\nconditions. However,\
    \ research using VIs derived from a UAV multispectral remote sensing system is\n\
    still relatively rare in Kc estimation at the farm scale under diﬀerent levels\
    \ of water stress.\nTherefore, in this study, we established a Kc empirical model\
    \ based on UAV multispectral remote\nsensing to represent the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ of summer maize under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit\nirrigation. The main objectives\
    \ were as follows:\n(1) To explore the diﬀerences in Kc with regard to the soil\
    \ water balance in response to water stress\ntreatments at diﬀerent growth stages;\n\
    (2) To establish Kc regression models based on UAV multispectral VIs that are\
    \ sensitive to maize\nwater stress and compare them with measured crop coeﬃcients;\n\
    (3) To obtain Kc maps derived from the Kc regression model with high spatial–temporal\
    \ resolution\nat the farm scale.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Area\n\
    The study was carried out on an experimental farm located in Zhaojun Town, southwest\
    \ Inner\nMongolia, China (40◦26′0.29′′ N, 109◦36′25.99′′ E). The experimental\
    \ area is approximately 1.13 ha at\n1010 m altitude above the sea level. The climate\
    \ is semi-arid, and the soil type is loamy sand with 80.7%\nsand, 13.7% powder,\
    \ and 5.6% clay. The average ﬁeld capacity (0–90 cm soil depth) is 0.169 m3·m−3,\n\
    and the average soil bulk density is 1.56 g·cm−3. The soil pH, C content, and\
    \ organic matter are 9.27,\n27.35 g/Kg, and 47.17 g/Kg, respectively. Maize (Junkai\
    \ 918) was sowed on 20 May 2017 (day of year\n(DOY) 140), with a 0.58 m planting\
    \ distance and 0.25 m plant spacing, and the row direction was from\neast to west.\
    \ The maize emerged on 1 June, headed on 20 July, and was harvested on 7 September\n\
    (silage), giving a 110-day lifespan [19].\n2.2. Experimental Design\nThere were\
    \ ﬁve diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation treatments for which we divided the\
    \ study\nﬁeld into treatment (TR) regions (Figure 1b). In order to eﬀectively\
    \ collect data and control irrigation\nwater, a 12 × 12 m2 experimental plot was\
    \ chosen in each treatment region. The ﬁve treatments\nwere full irrigation (TR1),\
    \ slight water stress (TR5), moderate water stress (TR2 and TR3), and severe\n\
    water stress (TR4). TR1 represented the total crop water requirement of fully\
    \ watered maize during\nthe whole growth period. The diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation were designed according to the\npercentages of applied water depth\
    \ of TR1 during the late vegetation, reproductive, and maturation\nstages. For\
    \ example, during the maturation stage, 52% of the applied water depth at TR1\
    \ was applied\nto TR2 (Table 1).\nA central pivot sprinkler system (Valmont Industries,\
    \ Inc., Omaha, NE, USA) was used for\nirrigation, and diﬀerent irrigation amounts\
    \ were processed in each treatment region by adjusting\nthe speed of the sprinkler\
    \ system. The test for water application uniformity of the central pivot\nirrigation\
    \ system was carried out in accordance with the standards ANSI/ASAE S436.1 and\
    \ ISO 11545.\nThe uniformity coeﬃcient for the ﬁrst span (research area) of the\
    \ R3000 sprinklers was calculated using\nthe modiﬁed formula by Heermann and Hein\
    \ [42], and the values were 82.7% and 88.3% under 20% and\n40% of full walking\
    \ speed, respectively. The amount of water applied to each treatment was measured\n\
    and recorded using a MIK-2000H ﬂow meter (Meacon Automation Technology co., Ltd.,\
    \ Hangzhou,\nChina). Due to the inﬂuence of rainfall, the actual applied water\
    \ depth (irrigation and rainfall amount)\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n4 of 17\nfor\
    \ each growth stage in each treatment region is shown in Table 1. In order to\

    \ 4 Pro with an 84◦ ﬁeld of view lens, an f/2.8 aperture, and a resolution of\

    \ every 3 to 7 days between\n11:00 and 13:00 local time, at 50 m altitude, and\
    \ with a ground sample distance of 1.4 cm. The overlap\nof imagery to the front\
    \ and side was 80%. The mosaic RGB images were acquired using Pix4DMapper\nsoftware\
    \ (Lausanne, Switzerland). The RGB images of each sampling plot were classiﬁed\
    \ into soil and\nvegetation using supervised classiﬁcation aided by ENVI 5.3 software.\
    \ The fc value was derived as the\npercentage detected as vegetation.\n2.5. Soil\
    \ Water Balance\nThe daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was obtained using the\
    \ soil water balance equation with\nsoil water content measured by TDR [5,43–45]\
    \ (Equation (1)):\nETc = P + I ± ∆SM − Dp − RO + CR\n(1)\nwhere ETc represents\
    \ crop evapotranspiration; P represents the precipitation; I represents the irrigation;\n\
    ∆SM represents the change in water content between two successive days, calculated\
    \ by TDR; DP\nrepresents deep percolation; RO represents surface runoﬀ; and CR\
    \ represents capillary rise from the\ndeep water table, which can be ignored due\
    \ to the shallow to deep water table depth (3–55 m) and\nalso due to no contribution\
    \ from groundwater with capillary rise into the root zone [46]. All terms\nin\

    \ UAV Multispectral Imagery Acquisition\nA multispectral camera (RedEdge, MicaSense,\
    \ Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) was installed on a UAV\nplatform (a six-rotor unmanned\
    \ aircraft S900, manufactured by DJI). The S900 six-rotor UAV has the\nadvantages\
    \ of stable ﬂight and takeoﬀ, strong wind resistance, and low cost. The maximum\
    \ take-oﬀ\nweight is 6 kg, the maximum payload is 2 kg, the maximum wind speed\
    \ it can withstand is 5 m/s, and\nits ﬂight time is 18 min. The RedEdge multispectral\
    \ camera consists of ﬁve bands in the VIS–NIR\nspectral range at 475, 560, 668,\
    \ 717, 840 nm, respectively; a 5.5 mm ﬁxed lens; image resolution of\n1280 × 960\
    \ pixels; and angle of view of 47.2◦ (H). The ﬂight control board used was a Pixhawk\
    \ autopilot\n(CUAV, Guangzhou, China), and the ground control station software\
    \ Mission Planner was used to\nconduct the ﬂight planning.\nUAV multispectral\
    \ data from fourteen ﬂights were acquired at a 70 m ﬂight height with 4.7 cm\n\
    spatial resolution during the study period (2017.06.26~08.29) between 11:00 and\
    \ 13:00 local time.\nThe heading and side overlap and speed of the UAV were 80%\
    \ and 5 m/s, respectively. The mosaic\nmultispectral images were acquired using\
    \ the photogrammetric software Pix4DMapper (Lausanne,\nSwitzerland). In order\
    \ to calibrate the multispectral images, a diﬀuse reﬂector (reﬂectivity 58%, size\n\
    3 × 3 m, Group VIII, Seattle, WA, USA) was used during the data collection. The\
    \ measured image\nradiances were later converted to reﬂectance values to obtain\
    \ spectral reﬂectance images.\n2.7. The Vegetation Index Approach for Crop Coeﬃcient\
    \ Estimation\nIn the present study, the calculation of Kc was made based on the\
    \ dual crop coeﬃcient approach.\nThis approach divides the total crop coeﬃcient\
    \ into crop transpiration (Kcb) and soil evaporation (Ke)\nfractions [47,48].\
    \ The Kc can be calculated as follows:\nKc = Kcb + Ke\n(2)\nwhere Kcb values were\
    \ estimated based on NDVI measurements developed in a modiﬁed approach\nby Er-Raki\
    \ et al. [49], who used 1.07 as the Kcb,max value for durum wheat in a semi-arid\
    \ climate in\nMorocco. In our study, we used 1.15 in Equation (3) as the Kcb,max\
    \ value for maize according to Allen\net al. [5]. In addition, Ke values were\
    \ calculated from the fraction of vegetation cover (fc), which is\nstrongly related\
    \ to the NDVI [50]. Therefore, Kcb and Ke in the NDVI approach were derived as\
    \ [5,51]\nfollows:\nKcb = 1.15 ∗ (1 − (NDVImax − NDVI)/(NDVImax − NDVImin))\n\
    (3)\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n7 of 17\nKe = 0.9 ∗ (1 − fc)\n(4)\nfc = 1.19 ∗ (NDVI\
    \ − NDVImin)\n(5)\nwhere NDVImax and NDVImin are the maximal and minimal measured\
    \ NDVI values during the growing\nperiod. We took values of 0.88 for NDVImax and\
    \ 0.14 for NDVImin according to the UAV map. The value\n0.9 in Equation (4) was\
    \ determined according to FAO 56 [5] based on the observed frequency of\nirrigation\
    \ and rainfall. The value 1.19 in Equation (5) was determined according to González-Piqueras\n\
    et al. [51], based on the fc being less than 80% for maize.\nHowever, the above\
    \ formulas represent potential crop evapotranspiration conditions. When\nwater\
    \ stress occurs, the stress coeﬃcient Ks should be considered. Ks (0 ≤ Ks ≤ 1)\
    \ is deﬁned as the ratio\nof actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETp), proposed by Allen et al. [5].\nThe Ks can be calculated as follows:\n\
    Ks = ETa/ETp = Kc act/Kc.\n(6)\nBased on the principle of energy balance, Jackson\
    \ et al. [52] derived a calculation model for the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI)\
    \ depending on the canopy temperature. The model establishes the\nrelationship\
    \ between Ks and CWSI as\nCWSI = 1 − ETa/ETp = 1 − Ks.\n(7)\nAdditionally, CWSI\
    \ can be estimated by two VI regression models proposed by Zhang et al. [19]\n\
    under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation.\nCWSI-1 =\n\n0\n(TCARI/RDVI\

    \ that need to be solved in the rapid, accurate, and economical estimation of\
    \ crop\ncoeﬃcients [32,53,54]. Previous studies have observed a high correlation\

    \ on a regression model in Castilla La Mancha regions\nfor barley and sunﬂower\
    \ irrigated using sprinklers.\nHowever, most studies have established the relationship\
    \ between Kc and VIs for nonstressed\nconditions or for conditions of a dry soil\
    \ surface, which cannot appropriately depict the actual\nconditions of crop management\
    \ [6]. Crop coeﬃcients derived from VIs often do not consider the\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 5250\n12 of 17\nabovementioned Ks, which should be used to obtain the actual\
    \ Kc under water or salinity stress [7,21].\nStagakis et al. [67] found that most\
    \ optical indices such as NDVI are suitable for tracking the eﬀects of\nlong-term\
    \ water stress on crops, while they are not useful as indicators to detect and\
    \ monitor early\nwater stress conditions. In this work, we also found that the\
    \ NDVI values under diﬀerent levels of\ndeﬁcit irrigation did not signiﬁcantly\
    \ diﬀer in the reproductive stage, but they changed signiﬁcantly in\nthe maturation\
    \ stage, with a decrease of 0.09 in TR4 compared to TR1 (Figure 3a). This is because\
    \ crops\nmay prevent damage through photo-protection strategies to reduce the\
    \ leaf absorbance and reﬂectance\nchanges during short-term water stress [68].\
    \ Moreover, crops consume extra energy by reducing\nchlorophyll b and interconverting\
    \ xanthophyll cycle pigments [69]. Therefore, previous studies found\nthat VIs\
    \ are prone to reﬂecting the chlorophyll and xanthophyll content, which are commonly\
    \ used\nto monitor crop water stress status. For instance, Baluja et al. [70]\
    \ assessed vineyard water status by\nTCARI/OSAVI with R2 values of 0.58 and 0.84\
    \ (n = 10) when compared to stem water potential and\nstomatal conductance, respectively.\
    \ Here, the CWSI based on regression models was used to obtain Ks\nfrom UAV multispectral\
    \ orthomosaic images, and two CWSI estimation methods were derived from\nTCARI/RDVI\
    \ and TCARI/SAVI. These two indices were designed to detect crop water stress\
    \ status\nin a more robust and adequate manner. In a relevant study by Zhang et\
    \ al. [19], TCARI/RDVI and\nTCARI/SAVI were used to evaluate the water stress\
    \ status of maize under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit\nirrigation, with respective\
    \ R2 values of 0.81 and 0.80 at the late reproductive and maturation stages.\n\
    The fc calculated by NDVI and the fc based on ﬁeld measurement were compared.\
    \ It was\nclear that the fc calculated by NDVI had a high correlation (R2 = 0.93)\
    \ with the ﬁeld measurement.\nPrevious studies have shown that the relationship\
    \ between fc and NDVI shows good agreement [49,51].\nConsidering the relationship\
    \ between fc and Ke, we established the Ke regression model. Finally,\nwe obtained\
    \ two diﬀerent models for Kc estimation. Both approaches to Kc in all growth periods\
    \ agreed\nwith the measured Kc data, with R2 and RMSE values varying from 0.68\
    \ to 0.80 and from 0.140 to 0.322,\nrespectively (Table 3). Compared to TCARI/SAVI,\
    \ TCARI/RDVI can more accurately characterize maize\nconditions in each irrigation\
    \ treatment, with smaller estimated deviations. These results are likely\ndue\
    \ to the lower sensitivity of TCARI/SAVI to the inﬂuence of diﬀerent water treatments.\
    \ Therefore,\nwe chose TCARI/RDVI to establish models between VIs and Kc. When\
    \ the water stress conditions were\nmore serious, the Kc model based on TCARI/RDVI\
    \ was less accurate. For example, the R2 and RMSE\nvalues of the Kc model in TR1\
    \ were 080 and 0.140, while the R2 and RMSE values of the Kc model in\nTR4 were\
    \ 0.68 and 0.232, with 32% water applied diﬀerence. The reason for this phenomenon\
    \ may be\nthat optical VIs do not allow the precise detection of serious water\
    \ stress [65]. Similar phenomena\nwere also found by Zhang and Zhou [29], Espinoza\
    \ et al. [71], and Zulini et al. [72].\nThe relationship between the measured\
    \ Kc and predicted Kc based on vegetation indices under\ndiﬀerent water treatments\
    \ was compared in three diﬀerent growth stages. There was a rapidly\ndecreasing\
    \ trend in the slopes of the linear regression models between the measured Kc\
    \ and the\npredicted Kc throughout the growth phase (Figure 6), indicating that\
    \ the correlation of the measured\nKc with the predicted Kc obtained from vegetation\
    \ indices in the late vegetative stage was higher than\nthose in the two other\
    \ growth stages. It could be also observed that when water stress was more\nserious\
    \ in the maturation stage, a higher slope value was found, such as −0.17 in TR4.\
    \ The results\nshowed that UAV multispectral VIs could distinguish diﬀerent levels\
    \ of deﬁcit irrigation treatments.\nOverall, multispectral VIs (NDVI and TCARI/RDVI)\
    \ could be used to monitor the Kc of ﬁeld maize\nduring the whole growth period\
    \ and under diﬀerent water treatments.\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n13 of 17\nSensors\

  title: Maize Crop Coefficient Estimated from UAV-Measured Multispectral Vegetation
    Indices
  verbatim_quote1: Such empirical equations rely on the close relationship between
    the VIs and various actual plant growth parameters, e.g., leaf area index [24,25],
    fraction of ground covered by plants [26,27], and biomass [24,28].
  verbatim_quote2: Therefore, partial VIs such as the reﬂectance index (TCARI), optimization
    of soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI),
    and renormalized diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI) can eﬀectively monitor crop
    water status [30].

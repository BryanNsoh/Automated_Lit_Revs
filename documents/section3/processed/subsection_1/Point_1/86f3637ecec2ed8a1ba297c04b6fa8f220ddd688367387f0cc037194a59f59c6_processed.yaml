- analysis: 'In this study, the authors set out to retrieve land surface temperature
    (LST) from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data using two common algorithms:
    the radiative transfer theory (RTT) equation-based method and the split-window
    (SW) algorithm. The primary goal was to explore the applicability of these algorithms
    to irrigation management and evaluate the accuracy of their results.


    To achieve these objectives, the authors utilized 20 Landsat 8 TIRS images captured
    during the Rabi/Winter season over the command area of the Mula irrigation project.
    They compared the LST retrieved from both algorithms with the standard daily LST
    product of MODIS for cross-validation purposes.


    The results indicated that LST retrieved using the SW algorithm exhibited a higher
    correlation coefficient with MODIS LST in the entire command area and in agricultural
    land (0.938 and 0.925, respectively) compared to the LST output of the RTT method
    (0.902 and 0.894, respectively). A relative comparison of LST products derived
    from RTT and SW algorithms revealed an average difference of ±3 °K. However, this
    difference was negligible (−0.8 to 0.5 °K) in agricultural areas.


    The authors concluded that the SW algorithm yielded more accurate LST at higher
    spatial resolution compared to the RTT method. They emphasized the potential utility
    of these high-resolution LST products in irrigation water management applications.'

  description: Application of satellite remote sensing in generating various geophysical
    parameters of land surface has gained tremendous importance in many branches of
    science and applied research. Out of all geophysical parameters of land surface
    derived from satellite remote sensing, the land surface temperature (LST) is of
    prime importance. LST acts as a governing parameter in water and energy exchange
    between land and atmosphere. It is an essential input to all the numerical weather
    prediction models, most of the process-based hydrological models and even in irrigation
    water management activities. Many algorithms for space-based LST retrieval and
    operational products of LST are available nowadays. However, these products are
    generally coarser in spatial and/or temporal resolutions. In the sector of irrigation
    water management, higher spatial resolution of all the geophysical products is
    prerequisites. Hence, in the present study, LST has been retrieved using two popular
    algorithms viz. radiative transfer theory (RTT) equation-based method and split-window
    (SW) algorithm. LST of Mula irrigation project command area has been retrieved
    using twenty images of Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Operation
    Land Imager (OLI) for entire Rabi/Winter season. Atmospheric parameters needed
    for the LST retrieval have been derived using online atmospheric correction tool.
    The land surface emissivity has been estimated using NDVI threshold technique.
    The standard daily LST product of MODIS has been used to cross-validate the LST

    RTT method (0.902 and 0.894, respectively). The relative comparison of the LST
    products derived from RTT and SW algorithms showed that there is an average difference
    of ±3 °K between these two products. However, the difference is very small (−0.8
    to 0.5°K) in case of agricultural area in the command. The higher correlation
    coefficient values between retrieved LST using both the algorithms and MODIS LST
    products hints toward the higher accuracy of derived LST at higher spatial resolution.
    These high spatial resolution LST products can further be used for irrigation
    water management.

    Application of satellite remote sensing in generating various geophysical parameters
    of land surface has gained tremendous importance in many branches of science and
    applied research. Out of all geophysical parameters of land surface derived from
    satellite remote sensing, the land surface temperature (LST) is of prime importance.
    LST acts as a governing parameter in water and energy exchange between land and
    atmosphere. It is an essential input to all the numerical weather prediction models,
    most of the process-based hydrological models and even in irrigation water management
    activities. Many algorithms for space-based LST retrieval and operational products
    of LST are available nowadays. However, these products are generally coarser in
    spatial and/or temporal resolutions. In the sector of irrigation water management,
    higher spatial resolution of all the geophysical products is prerequisites. Hence,
    in the present study, LST has been retrieved using two popular algorithms viz.
    radiative transfer theory (RTT) equation-based method and split-window (SW) algorithm.
    LST of Mula irrigation project command area has been retrieved using twenty images
    of Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Operation Land Imager (OLI) for
    entire Rabi/Winter season. Atmospheric parameters needed for the LST retrieval
    have been derived using online atmospheric correction tool. The land surface emissivity
    has been estimated using NDVI threshold technique. The standard daily LST product
    of MODIS has been used to cross-validate the LST retrieved from both the algorithms.
    LST retrieved using SW algorithm shows higher correlation coefficient with MODIS
    LST in entire command area and in agricultural land as well (0.938 and 0.925,
    respectively) compared to that of LST output of RTT method (0.902 and 0.894, respectively).
    The relative comparison of the LST products derived from RTT and SW algorithms
    showed that there is an average difference of ±3 °K between these two products.
    However, the difference is very small (−0.8 to 0.5°K) in case of agricultural
    area in the command. The higher correlation coefficient values between retrieved
    LST using both the algorithms and MODIS LST products hints toward the higher accuracy
    of derived LST at higher spatial resolution. These high spatial resolution LST
    products can further be used for irrigation water management. Similar content

    Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques in Kandaihimmat Watershed, Hoshangabad, Madhya
    Pradesh Article 12 September 2018 Introduction Land surface temperature (LST)
    is a key geophysical parameter which influences the process of energy and water
    exchange between land surface and atmosphere (Yu et al. 2014). LST has principle
    significance in various applications viz. hydrological modeling, land surface
    modeling, ecological studies and climate change studies (Kustas and Norman 1996;
    Ramanathan et al. 2001; Kalnay and Cai 2003; Wan et al. 2004; Chapin et al. 2005;
    Liang et al. 2012; Zhang and He 2013; Yu et al. 2014). Like other geophysical
    parameters, LST is also dynamic in nature both spatially and temporally. This
    makes the conventional LST measurement techniques, cumbersome, uneconomic and
    insufficient from user’s point of view. Synoptic and repeated coverage of land
    surface by remote sensing satellites provide an opportunity to retrieve geophysical
    parameters such as LST, at local to global scale from fortnightly to sub-daily
    temporal resolution (Rozenstein et al. 2014). LST products derived from satellite
    remote sensing data have been used for estimating host of the geophysical parameters
    viz. thermal inertia, soil moisture, vegetation water stress, sensible heat flux
    of ground, sensible heat flux of atmosphere and evapotranspiration (Bastiaanssen
    et al. 1998a, b; Allen et al. 2007a, b; Mu et al. 2007; Karnieli et al. 2010;
    Kustas and Anderson 2009; Agam et al. 2008). Among the numerous applications,
    estimation of evapotranspiration is of the particular interest in the field of
    irrigation water management. Owing to the importance of LST in various scientific
    fields, much work has been done towards the development of algorithms/methods
    to retrieve the LST from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data (Li et al.
    2013b). Among the globally dominant sources of remote sensing data in TIR region
    for retrieval of LST, Landsat satellite series stands first due to its data availability
    for relatively longer period (Markham, et al. 2004; Zhang and He 2013; Weng et
    al. 2014), i.e., since 1982 (launch of Landsat 4) to till date (Landsat 8). During
    this period, the remote sensing data in TIR region was also available from other
    sensors viz. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced
    Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) using two long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands,
    however, at coarser spatial resolution, i.e., 500–1000 m. Thematic Mapper (TM)
    onboard Landsat 5 and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) onboard Landsat 7
    provided thermal data using just one LWIR band with higher spatial resolution
    with a 16-day temporal resolution. In accordance with availability of remote sensing
    data in TIR region from Landsat, initially a single-channel (SC) algorithm was
    developed to derive LST (Qin et al. 2001b; Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino 2003; Sobrino
    et al. 2004; Jimenez-Munoz et al. 2009). Along with remote sensing data, SC method
    also requires atmospheric parameters involved in the radiative transfer equation.
    These atmospheric parameters can only be retrieved through complex atmospheric
    transmittance/radiance codes (Li et al. 2013b). This limits the operational applicability
    of SC method in retrieval of LST (Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino 2006). To improve
    the accuracy of LST retrieved from remote sensing data, Sobrino et al. (1993)
    developed an algorithm which requires data observed in two spectrally adjacent
    thermal bands. The algorithm is popularly known as split-window (SW) algorithm,
    which uses two thermal bands typically located in the atmospheric window between
    10 and 12 μm. The basis of SW algorithm is that the radiance attenuation for atmospheric
    absorption is proportional to the radiance difference of simultaneous measurements
    at two different wavelengths, each subjected to different amounts of atmospheric
    absorption (Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino 2008). Majority of operational LST products
    have been generated using SW algorithms from various sensors viz. MODIS, AVHRR,
    Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), Spinning Enhanced Visible and
    Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites
    (GOES) (Wan and Dozier 1996; Sun and Pinker 2003; Pedelty et al. 2007; Niclòs
    et al. 2011; Coll et al. 2012b). Landsat 8 satellite, originally named Landsat
    Data Continuity Mission, was successfully launched on February 11, 2013, which
    carries two sensors onboard: (1) the Operational Land Imager (OLI) with nine spectral
    bands in the visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR)
    spectral regions and (2) the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) with two spectral
    bands in the long-wave infrared region (LWIR) (Rozenstein et al. 2014). Earlier
    sensors of Landsat series had only one thermal band, while the Landsat 8 TIRS
    has two spectrally adjacent thermal bands. These two bands can be utilized to
    retrieve LST using split-window (SW) algorithm with higher accuracy and at finer
    spatial resolution. Though SW algorithm has been regarded as most widely used
    algorithm for LST retrieval attributable to its simplicity and robustness, its
    application with Landsat 8 TIRS data still have some limitations in terms of techniques
    used to estimate atmospheric water vapor content and land surface emissivity (LSE).
    Rozenstein et al. (2014) studied parameter sensitivity of SW algorithm associated
    with Landsat 8 TIRS data. It was suggested to select case-by-case basis trade-off
    between temporal and spatial precision while selecting a data source for estimation
    of the atmospheric water vapor content. This implies that universally applicable
    set of parameters for SW algorithm when used with Landsat 8 TIRS data are not
    available as of now. On the other side, it has been reported that the direct solution
    of simplified radiative transfer equation using single band of Landsat TIRS (band
    10) data may also give more accurate LST compared to results of standard SW method
    (Yu et al. 2014). Keeping this as background, in the present study, LST has been
    estimated from Landsat 8 TIRS data for the command area of Mula irrigation project,
    Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, India, using SW algorithm and RTT-based method.
    Finally, the retrieved LST from both the techniques validated using cross-validation
    and inter-comparison techniques. Study area A major storage dam on the Mula River
    was constructed at Bargaon Namdur in Rahuri Taluka of Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra
    (India), in the early 1970s to irrigate 149 drought-prone villages of the region.
    Mula irrigation project, having gross command area (GCA) of around 1,61,386 ha
    and irrigable command area (ICA) of 82,920 ha, became operational in 1977–1978.
    The location of Mula reservoir and its command area is given in Fig. 1 along with
    mosaic of standard false color composite (FCC) images of command area generated
    using Landsat 8 OLI data of January 08, 2014 (Path 146/Row 047) and January 15,
    2014 (Path 147/Row 046). The irrigation infrastructure in terms of canal network
    and dominant hydraulic structures mapped using IRS P6 (Cartosat-1) PAN data (of
    2.5 m spatial resolution) is also shown in Fig. 1. The cultivable command area
    (CCA) of this project is around 1,38,792 ha, out of which around 1,03,370 ha comes
    under command of Right Bank Canal (RBC) and around 15,182 ha is under the command
    of Left Bank Canal (LBC), remaining 20,240 ha area comes under the command of
    indirect irrigation facility. Fig. 1 Location and standard FCC of Mula command
    area (FCC derived using Landsat OLI data) Full size image Mula command area falls
    under tropical climatic condition with hot and dry summer months (March–June)
    during which temperature reaches up to 44 °C. The annual average rainfall in the
    area ranges from 400 to 600 mm. Around 70 % of annual rainfall is received during
    monsoon period (June–September). Soil in the region varies from reddish brown
    to dark gray and commonly grouped as light to medium black soil. In very few places,
    deep black soil is also observed. Major crops grown in ICA are wheat, gram, sugarcane
    and pulses. However, in the CCA which do not receive irrigation supply from the
    project, pearl millet, sorghum and safflower are the major crops. Erratic nature
    of rainfall and tropical climate make this area more prone to agricultural droughts.
    The underutilization of irrigation potential created in this project has been
    attributed toward the conventional methods of water allocation and distribution
    (Patil 1988). Hence, a project has been envisaged to improve the irrigation distribution
    by adopting demand-based irrigation scheduling. To achieve it, the estimation
    of distributed crop water requirement (CWR)/irrigation water requirement (IWR)
    is  prerequisite. Surface energy balance approach using remote sensing inputs
    may be of use in such projects. However, it requires LST as one of the main input;
    therefore, an attempt has been made to estimate LST of the command area using
    Landsat 8 TIRS data. Methodology and data used In the present study, two most
    popular methods/algorithms of LST estimation have been used to retrieve LST of
    Mula command area using Landsat 8 TIRS data. However, along with TIRS, data from
    OLI are also required to solve the LST estimation procedure in both the algorithms.
    The brief description of both the algorithms followed by estimation of input parameters
    for these algorithms is given in subsequent sections. Radiative transfer theory
    (RTT) equation-based method A simplified RTT equation can be formulated (Eq. 1)
    to estimate the apparent radiance received by a sensor (Mao et al. 2005a, b; Zhang
    and He 2013) as: $$\\it B_{i} (T_{i} ) = \\tau_{i} (\\theta ) \\times [\\varepsilon_{i}
    \\times B_{i} (T_{s} ) + (1 - \\varepsilon_{i} ) \\times I_{i}^{ \\downarrow }
    ] + I_{i}^{ \\uparrow }$$ (1) where \\(B_{i} (T_{i} )\\) is radiance received
    by channel i of the sensor with brightness temperature T i ; B i (T s ) is the
    ground radiance; and τ i (θ) is the atmospheric transmittance for channel i when
    view zenith angle is θ. Landsat 8 TIRS is at an altitude of 705 km with swath
    of 185 km, the maximum zenith view angle in the scene is no more than 7.5° (Qin
    et al. 2001b), so Landsat 8 TIRS can be treated as nadir viewing and the term
    θ can be ignored in Eq. 1; \\(\\varepsilon_{i}\\) is surface emissivity for channel
    i; \\(I_{i}^{ \\downarrow }\\) is down-welling path radiance; and \\(I_{i}^{ \\uparrow
    }\\) is up-welling path radiance. Using Plank’s law, B i (T s ) can be expressed
    as: $$B_{i} (T_{s} ) = \\frac{{2 \\times h \\times c^{2} }}{{\\lambda_{i}^{5}
    \\times \\left( {\\exp \\left( {\\frac{h \\times c}{{\\lambda_{i} \\times k \\times
    T_{s} }}} \\right) - 1} \\right)}}$$ (2) where T s is the land surface temperature
    (°K); c is the speed of light (2.9979 × 108 m/s); h is the Plank’s constant (6.6261
    × 10−34 J s); k is the Boltzmann constant (1.3806 × 10−23 J/K); λ i is the effective
    band wavelength for band i and the mathematical formulation of this parameter
    can be seen in Rozenstein et al. (2014). Solving Eqs. 1 and 2, LST can be estimated
    as: $$\\it \\it T_{s} = \\frac{{C_{1} }}{{\\lambda_{i} \\times \\ln \\left\\{
    {\\frac{{C_{2} }}{{\\lambda_{i}^{5} \\times \\left[ {\\frac{{(L_{\\lambda i} -
    I_{i}^{ \\uparrow } - \\tau_{i} \\times (1 - \\varepsilon_{i} ) \\times I_{i}^{
    \\downarrow } )}}{{\\tau_{i} \\times \\varepsilon_{i} }}} \\right]}} + 1} \\right\\}}}$$
    (3) where \\(T_{s}\\) is land surface temperature (°K); C 1 is 14,387.7 μmK, and
    C 2 is 1.19104 × 108 Wμm4m−2sr−1 (Rozenstein et al. 2014). Landsat 8 data have
    been preprocessed to generate input parameters for Eq. 3. Firstly, OLI and TIRS
    bands of Landsat 8 data are converted to at-sensor level spectral radiance and
    reflectance using the rescaling factors provided in the metadata. At-sensor level
    radiance for Landsat 8 data is estimated using the following equation: $$L_{\\lambda
    } = (M_{L} \\times Q_{\\text{cal}} ) + A_{L}$$ (4) where L λ is spectral radiance
    (Wm−2sr−1μm−1); Q cal is the Level 1 pixel value in DN, M L is the band-specific
    multiplicative rescaling factor and A L is the radiance multiplicative scaling
    factor. Similarly, the Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from Landsat 8 data
    has been estimated as: $$\\rho = (M_{\\rho } \\times Q_{\\text{cal}} ) + A_{\\rho
    }$$ (5) where ρ is the TOA spectral reflectance (unitless); M ρ is the reflectance
    multiplicative scaling factor and A ρ is the reflectance additive scaling factor.
    Values of M L , A L , M ρ and A ρ for each band of OLI and TIRS can be obtained
    from metadata file of Landsat 8 data. Brightness temperature, which is direct
    input of Eq. 7 is estimated for both the bands of TIRS using following equation:
    $$B_{i} (T_{i} ) = \\frac{{K_{2} }}{{\\ln \\left( {\\frac{{K_{1} }}{{L_{\\lambda
    i} }} + 1} \\right)}}$$ (6) where K 1 and K 2 are thermal conversion constants
    for each TIRS bands represented by i, and values of these constant given in Table
    1 are taken from metadata files of Landsat 8 data. Table 1 K 1 and K 2 values
    for Landsat 8 TIRS bands Full size table Estimating LST using Eq. 3 requires information
    regarding atmospheric parameters viz. down-welling path radiance (\\(I_{i}^{ \\downarrow
    }\\)), up-welling path radiance (\\(I_{i}^{ \\uparrow }\\)), atmospheric transmittance
    (τ i ) and surface emissivity (ε i ) for each band (i) along with radiance observed
    by each band of TIRS. The atmospheric parameters listed above can be obtained
    from concurrent radiosounding of the area at the time of Landsat 8 data acquisition.
    However, concurrent radiosounding data are not usually available, except for dedicated
    field campaigns (Yu et al. 2014). Therefore, in the present study, the online
    atmospheric correction tool (http://atmcorr.gsfc.nasa.gov/) has been used for
    estimating atmospheric parameters (\\(I_{i}^{ \\downarrow }\\), \\(I_{i}^{ \\uparrow
    }\\) and τ i ). This online atmospheric correction parameter calculator uses the
    National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) modeled global atmospheric
    profiles interpolated to a given date, time and location as input. The calculator
    processes the inputs using MODTRAN radiative transfer code to derive the site-specific
    atmospheric parameters (Barsi et al. 2005). As the estimation of land surface
    emissivity (LSE) is common to both the methods, it has been discussed in the subsequent
    section. Split-window algorithm Prabhakara et al. (1974) presented methodology
    to determine the sea surface temperature (SST) using Nimbus 3 and 4 IRIS spectral
    data in the 11–13 μm region. They utilized data from three channels in the 10.5–12.9
    μm over cloud-free oceans and concluded that only two of these channels are sufficient
    in routine SST determination. An operational split-window (SW) algorithm was first
    proposed by McMillin (1975) for retrieving SST using difference in atmospheric
    absorption of two adjacent LWIR bands. Price (1984) implemented SW algorithm for
    measurement of LST using AVHRR data from NOAA 7. Subsequently, many researchers
    have modified and implemented the SW algorithm for retrieval of LST using data
    of two adjacent LWIR bands (Becker and Li 1990; Sobrino et al. 1991; Franc and
    Cracknell 1994; Wan and Dozier 1996; Faysash and Smith 1999, 2000; Qin et al.
    2001a; Sobrino and Romaguera 2004; Mao et al. 2005a, b; Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino
    2008; Tang et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2008; Rozenstein et al. 2014). Jimenez-Munoz
    and Sobrino (2008) proposed physics-based algorithm for LST retrieval by solving
    radiative transfer equations for both the bands. The algorithm takes into account
    the effect of emissivity and atmospheric water vapor content on the estimation
    of LST. The simplified formulation of this algorithm suggested by Jimenez-Munoz
    and Sobrino (2008) can be written as: $$T_{s} = TB_{10} + C_{1} \\times (TB_{10}
    - TB_{11} ) + C_{2} \\times (TB_{10} - TB_{11} )^{2} + C_{0} + (C_{3} + C_{4}
    + w) \\times (1 - \\varepsilon ) + (C_{5} + C_{6} + w) \\times \\Delta \\varepsilon$$
    (7) where T s is land surface temperature (°K); TB 10 and TB 11 are brightness
    temperature of band 10 and band 11 of Landsat 8 (ºK); ε is mean land surface emissivity
    (0.5 × [ε 10  + ε 11 ]) of TIR bands; w is water vapor content (g/cm2); ∆ε is
    the emissivity difference (ε 10 − ε 11) and C 0–C 6 are split-window coefficients.
    Values of these split-window coefficients for TIRS of Landsat 8 given by Skokovic
    et al. (2014) are represented in Table 2. Table 2 Split-window coefficient values
    for TIRS of Landsat 8 Full size table This is a fully operational algorithm, as
    it can be applied to any sensor having observation in two adjacent LWIR regions.
    Moreover, the split-window coefficients needed to solve this algorithm are well
    established and published (Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino 2008; Skokovic et al. 2014).
    Keeping in mind, the simple but robust nature of this algorithm and the availability
    of most of the parameters in public domain, this algorithm has also been selected
    in the present study to retrieve LST using Landsat 8 TIRS data. Estimation of
    land surface emissivity Among all the inputs needed for estimation of LST using
    RTT or SW algorithms, land surface emissivity (LSE, ε) is the indispensable one
    (Yu et al. 2014). Theoretically, emissivity (ε) at a given wavelength (λ) and
    temperature (T) can be defined as the ratio of the radiance emitted by a body
    at temperature T to the radiance emitted by a black body at the same temperature.
    The emissivity of land surface differs significantly from unity and changes with
    water content, surface roughness, vegetation condition and viewing angles (Salisbury
    and D’Aria 1992). The direct estimation of LSE from satellite measurements is
    difficult, owing to the combined effects of the LST and LSE (Li et al. 2013a,
    b). However, techniques to retrieve LSE have also evolved with time. The number
    of simultaneous LST and LSE retrieval methods using satellite data has been proposed
    (Li et al. 2013a, b; Masiello and Serio 2013; Masiello et al. 2013 ). However,
    these simultaneous methods are computationally more complex and need sophisticated
    algorithms to estimate LSE (Li et al. 2013a; Masiello and Serio 2013; Masiello
    et al. 2013). This limits applicability of simultaneous methods of LSE and LST
    retrieval to experimental setups only. Operationally, LST retrieval methods with
    prior known LSE are more practical with reasonable accuracy (Sobrino and Raissouni
    2000; Sobrino et al. 2008), and hence, same approach has been used in the present
    study. There are three most popular methods to estimate the LSE using satellite
    data, viz. classification-based emissivity method (CBEM), NDVI-based emissivity
    method (NBEM) and temperature-independent spectral indices (TISI) method. The
    prior two are semi-empirical methods, and the third is multi-channel temperature
    emissivity separation method (Li et al. 2013a, b). Based on the review of these
    three methods done by Yu et al. (2014), the NBEM has been implemented in the present
    study to estimate LSE using following equations: $$\\varepsilon = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}
    a \\times \\rho_{4} + b\\quad &{\\text{NDVI}} < 0.2 \\\\ \\varepsilon_{v,i} \\times
    P_{v} + \\varepsilon_{s,i} \\times (1 - P_{v} ) + C_{i} \\quad &0.2 \\le {\\text{NDVI}}
    \\le 0.5 \\\\ \\varepsilon_{v,i} + C_{i} \\quad &{\\text{NDVI}} \\ge 0.5 \\\\
    \\end{array} \\right.$$ (8) where ρ 4 is reflectivity of red band of OLI sensor,
    P v is vegetation fraction, C is a term which takes the cavity effect into account
    due to the surface roughness, NDVI is normalized difference vegetation index (Tucker
    1979) estimated using OLI data, ε v,i is emissivity of vegetation in ith band
    of TIRS and ε s,i is emissivity of soil in ith band of TIRS. Values ε v,i and
    ε s,i for Landsat 8 TIRS data given in Table 3 are referred from Yu et al. (2014).
    Table 3 Emissivity of soil and vegetation for Landsat 8 TIRS band 10 and 11 Full
    size table The vegetation fraction (P v ) is derived from NDVI estimated using
    reflectance data of red and near infrared bands of Landsat 8 OLI with following
    equation: $$P_{v} = \\left( {\\frac{{{\\text{NDVI}} - {\\text{NDVI}}_{\\hbox{min}
    } }}{{{\\text{NDVI}}_{\\hbox{max} } - {\\text{NDVI}}_{\\hbox{min} } }}} \\right)^{2}$$
    (9) Sobrino and Raissouni (2000) proposed values of NDVImin and NDVImax to be
    0.2 and 0.5, respectively, to apply this method in global condition, the same
    values have been used in the present study. The pixel is considered as bare soil
    (P v  = 0), when NDVI < 0.2 (Sobrino et al. 2008). For this circumstance, the
    emissivity is estimated from an empirical relationship (Sobrino et al. 2004, 2008;
    Baldridge et al. 2009) with the red band reflectance (ρ4) as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\varepsilon_{10} = 0.973 - 0.047 \\cdot \\rho_{4} \\hfill \\\\ \\varepsilon_{11}
    = 0.984 - 0.026 \\cdot \\rho_{4} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (10) The term C,
    used in Eq. 8 to take into account the cavity effect due to the surface roughness,
    can be taken as 0 for the flat surface (Yu et al. 2014), and for other conditions
    it can be estimated as (Sobrino et al. 2001): $$C_{i} = (1 - \\varepsilon_{s,i}
    ) \\cdot \\varepsilon_{v,i} \\cdot F^{\\prime } \\cdot (1 - P_{v} )$$ (11) where
    F′ is geometrical factor ranging from 0 to 1, depending upon the geometric distribution
    of the surface (Sobrino et al. 2008; Coll et al. 2010), it is typically taken
    as 0.55 (Sánchez et al. 2008). Water vapor content (g/cm2) which is used in SW
    algorithm can also be estimated using ground-based instruments like sun photometers;
    however, the availability of sun photometers is limited in developing countries
    (Rozenstein et al. 2014). In these areas, other data sources viz. Precipitable
    Water product (MOD05_L2, MYD05_L2) of MODIS or total column water vapor product
    given by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) can be explored.
    Though spatial resolution of these data products is coarser than TIRS, however,
    spatial variability of water vapor content is captured in these data products,
    which is not possible in sun photometer observation at a given fraction of time.
    Use of these products, in estimation of LST using Landsat 8 TIRS, has been advocated
    by Rozenstein et al. (2014). Hence, Precipitable Water product (MOD05_L2, MYD05_L2)
    of MODIS has been used in the present study to obtain values of w, water vapor
    content (g/cm2). Twenty scenes (Table 4) of Landsat 8 reprocessed (after February
    3, 2014) imagery of Path 146/Row 047 and Path 147/Row 046 covering the study area
    were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).
    Imageries acquired during November 2013–April 2014 are used in the present study
    to map LST of Mula command area for the Rabi (Winter) season. ERDAS Imagine 2014
    has been used for processing of TIRS and OLI data. Customized models were built
    in ‘Model Maker’ environment of ERDAS Imagine for solving all the steps in LST
    estimation using both the algorithms (RTT and SW). A care has been taken to select
    cloud-free images for the study; however, cloud masks have been prepared using
    cirrus band (band 9) and quality assessment (QA) band to avoid the errors induced
    by cloud in the remote sensing data. Brightness temperature of both the TIRS bands
    has been used in LST estimation in SW algorithm. However, recent study by Yu et
    al. (2014) concludes that LST estimated by RTT method using Landsat 8 band 10
    has higher accuracy than band 11; hence, in the present study band 10 of Landsat
    8 has been used in LST estimation using RTT method. Table 4 List of Landsat 8
    images from TIRS and OLI sensors used in the present study Full size table Validation
    of retrieved LST Validation is a process of independently assessing the accuracy
    and uncertainty of the derived output. LST is retrieved from remote sensing data
    by solving many complex process, simplified through inherent assumptions regarding
    atmospheric parameters and LSE, hence, evaluating its accuracy becomes necessary
    from both users and developers point of view (Li et al. 2013a). Out of many challenges
    in retrieving LST from space-based inputs, validation of retrieved LST is also
    a major challenge. Generally, ground observed LST data is used to validate LST
    retrieved from remote sensing data. However, LST is very dynamic in space and
    time, variation of the order 10°K within a distance of few centimeters or 1°K
    within a time of 1 min has been reported in the literature (Prata et al. 1995).
    This limits the applicability of ground-based LST validation in the homogeneous
    areas only. Moreover, it is widely accepted fact that point scale ground measurements
    are greatly incompetent in validation of pixel-based LST retrieved using remote
    sensing data (Hale et al. 2010). Alternatively, standard LST products of same
    area and same time period can be used for validation of the retrieved LST. This
    approach, popularly known as cross-validation, has gained wide acceptance in recent
    times (Trigo et al. 2008; Qian et al. 2013). In the present study, due to non-availability
    of ground observed LST data, the cross-validation approach has been used for validation
    of retrieved LST. MODIS LST product having accuracy within the range of 1°K (Wan
    et al. 2004) has been used to validate the LST retrieved for Landsat 8 TIRS data
    using SW and RTT methods. The daytime (1030 h) LST products derived from MODIS
    onboard Terra for the same dates have been downloaded from web portal of United
    States Geological Survey (USGS). MODIS Reprojection Tool (MRT), provided by Land
    Process Distributed Active Archive Center (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool),
    has been used for converting the LST data from sinusoidal projection system to
    UTM projection system and to generate subset of MODIS LST for the study area.
    From validation point of view, 100 distributed sample sites (pixels/grids of 1000
    m × 1000 m resolution) were identified using random sampling technique (Fig. 2).
    Fig. 2 Location of randomly selected sample grids used to extract LST values for
    cross-validation Full size image The LST values from MODIS and Landsat 8 derived
    products (SW and RTT) were extracted for these 100 sample grids. It is noteworthy
    that the spatial resolution of MODIS and Landsat 8 derived LST products are different.
    To resolve scale issues during cross-validation of LST, researchers have used
    nearest neighbor interpolation technique to resample the derived LST at the same
    spatial scale of MODIS products (Vlassova et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2014). In the
    present study, mean LST values of each Landsat 8 derived products (SW and RTT)
    have been extracted for each sample site (grid) using ‘Zonal Statistics’ tool
    of Arc GIS10.0. These mean LST values, which now represent the area average at
    same spatial scale that of MODIS LST products (i.e., 1 km) have been used for
    cross-validation of derived LST products. Results and discussion Landsat 8 TIRS
    data has been utilized for estimating LST of command area of Mula irrigation project.
    Two popular LST retrieval algorithms have been used viz. radiative transfer theory
    (RTT) equation-based method and split-window (SW) algorithm. Initial preprocessing
    of remote sensing data has been done by building customized models in ERDAS Imagine
    software. The atmospheric parameters necessary for solving RTT method were estimated
    using NCEP modeled global atmospheric profiles in the online atmospheric correction
    tool provided by Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (Barsi et al. 2005). USGS has published that calibration variability of band 10
    of TIRS (0.12 W/m2/sr/μm) is better than of band 11 (0.2 W/m2/sr/μm) (Yu et al.
    2014). Also, band 11 is more affected by the water vapor absorption and so more
    sensitive to errors in atmospheric profiles (Coll et al. 2012a). Hence, in the
    present study, band 10 has been used for LST retrieval using RTT method. SW algorithm
    is the most popular among all the operational algorithms used for space-based
    LST retrieval. The SW algorithm proposed by Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino (2008) has
    been used in the present study, and split-window coefficients required for Landsat
    8 TIRS data have been taken from Skokovic et al. (2014). Land surface emissivity
    (LSE, ε) is an indispensable input in all the LST retrieval algorithms. Though
    methods for simultaneous retrieval of LSE and LST are available, due to their
    computational complexity, prior known LSE method has been implemented in the present
    study. LSE maps for all the twenty dates have been generated using a semi-empirical,
    NDVI threshold method of LSE estimation. Mosaic view of NDVI and LSE estimated
    using NDVI threshold method from two Landsat 8 OLI images acquired on November
    5, 2013 (Path 146/Row 047) and November 12, 2013 (Path 147/Row 046) of the Mula
    command are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Fig. 3 Mosaic of NDVI derived
    from Landsat OLI data of November 5, 2013 (Path 146/Row 047) and November 12,
    2013 (Path 147/Row 046) Full size image Fig. 4 Mosaic of LSE derived from NDVI

    and November 12, 2013 (Path 147/Row 046) Full size image It can be seen from Figs.
    3 and 4 that the LSE is highest in the areas with highest NDVI; therefore, agricultural
    fields with standing crop have the highest NDVI and LSE. These LSE values have
    been utilized in RTT and SW algorithms to derive LST. The spatial mosaic of LST
    derived from Landsat 8 TIRS images acquired on November 5, 2013 (Path 146/Row
    047) and November 12, 2013 (Path 147/Row 046) of the Mula command area using RTT
    and SW algorithms are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. It is noteworthy that
    the spatial mosaic has been prepared for the representation purpose only; however,
    the LST of the area was derived for two different dates as mentioned above for
    respective area of the Mula command covered under each image. The land use land
    cover (LULC) map of Mula command area generated by Narziev (2013) has been used
    in the present study for the purpose of analysis of results derived. The major
    LULC class in the Mula command is agricultural land, with sugarcane as major crop.

    the highest LST value was around 313.71°K, which is in the northern and eastern
    parts of command area covering barren lands, whereas lowest LST value observed
    was around 296.59°K, which is mostly in irrigated agricultural areas situated
    in northern and western parts of the command (Fig. 5). Moreover, in the LST product
    derived from SW algorithm, the highest LST was 315.34°K and lowest LST was 295.27°K,
    which is the hot and cold areas represented in LST of RTT products also (Fig.
    6). Mosaic of LST derived using RTT and SW algorithms for different dates under
    Rabi season are shown in Appendix. In the present study, MODIS LST products have
    been used to validate the LST products derived using SW and RTT algorithms. The
    LST values extracted from 100 sample sites (grids) have been used in regression
    analysis between MODIS LST and retrieved LST. The correlation coefficient between
    MODIS LST and derived LST using SW algorithm and RTT method are 0.938 and 0.902,
    respectively, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. From irrigation water management point
    of view, the LST of agricultural land is most important; therefore, a separate
    analysis of derived LST for nearly homogenous agricultural land has been carried
    out. The result of this analysis also follows the same trend as discussed above.
    The correlation coefficient between MODIS LST with LST retrieved using SW algorithm
    and RTT method are 0.925 and 0.894, respectively, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10.
    The marginal decrease in the values of correlation coefficients between MODIS
    LST and retrieved LST products in the case of agricultural land might have attributed
    to smaller number of sample points (450) participating in regression analysis
    as compared to entire command area case (1350). In both the cases, the LST values
    extracted from retrieved products have passed t-test with MODIS LST products using
    a significance level of 0.05, again indicating a strong correlation between derived
    LST products and standard MODIS LST products. Fig. 7 Correlation analysis of retrieved
    LST from Landsat 8 TIRS data using SW algorithm and MODIS LST products Full size

    LST from Landsat 8 TIRS data using RTT method and MODIS LST products on agricultural
    area Full size image The MODIS LST product is of coarser spatial resolution compared
    to LST retrieved using Landsat 8 TIRS data. However, the high correlation coefficients
    between MODIS LST product and Landsat 8 derived (SW and RTT) LST indicate the
    reliability of the retrieved LST. With reference to values of correlation coefficient,
    in case of entire area and agricultural area analysis, it is clear that LST retrieved
    using SW algorithm appears to be more precise compared to LST retrieved from RTT
    method. The close correlation between retrieved LST using SW algorithm with MODIS
    LST products might have attributed to the fact that MODIS LST products have also
    been generated using standard SW algorithm. Moreover, in the present study, the
    required values of atmospheric water vapor content used to solve the LST retrieval
    algorithms were also taken form MODIS products. To further understand the behavior
    of each algorithm, mean of LST in agricultural sample grids and their standard
    deviation for all the twenty images was analyzed (Figs. 11 and 12). Fig. 11 Comparison
    of mean LST retrieved using SW and RTT methods with MODIS LST in agricultural
    area for different dates Full size image Fig. 12 Standard deviation of LST retrieved
    using SW and RTT methods with respect to MODIS LST products in agricultural area
    for different dates Full size image It is clear from Fig. 11 that LST retrieved
    using SW algorithm follows same trend as the MODIS LST values. The LST retrieved
    using RTT method also in general follows same trend of MODIS LST values; however,
    the bias between MODIS LST and LST of RTT method varies with date. In case of
    LST retrieved using SW algorithm, there is an approximate bias of 2.4 °C with
    respect to MODIS LST values of all dates (Fig. 12). This bias may be a result
    of scale issue in MODIS and Landsat 8 TIRS data. The higher bias between MODIS
    LST and LST retrieved using RTT method may be due to following reasons, the scale
    issue between MODIS and TIRS data and the precision of atmospheric parameters
    used in solving RTT equation. MODIS LST product is generated using standard split-window
    algorithm, which helps in minimizing the effect of atmospheric absorption in thermal
    infrared region on derived LST product. Whereas in RTT method used in the present
    study, only band 10 of Landsat 8 TIRS has been used for retrieving LST. Hence,
    the accuracy of retrieved LST largely depends upon the better representation of
    atmospheric conditions at the time of image acquisition. In the present study,
    NCEP global atmospheric data of 1° × 1° spatial resolution have been used to estimate
    atmospheric parameters needed to solve RTT equation (\\(I_{i}^{ \\downarrow }\\),
    \\(I_{i}^{ \\uparrow }\\) and τ i ). The spatial resolution of NCEP global data
    used is very coarser as compared to TIRS data, which might have added some uncertainty
    in LST estimated in this analysis. Also, there is a time gap of around 30 min
    in the Landsat 8 TIRS data and MODIS daytime data, and these could be the reasons
    for deviation between retrieved LST using RTT method and MODIS LST product. The
    later reason of time gap of 30 min is also valid for difference in LST retrieved
    using SW algorithm and MODIS LST. However, the average difference in LST retrieved
    using SW algorithm and RTT method with MODIS LST product in case of agricultural
    area in the Mula command is around 2.4 and 2.56 °C, respectively, (Fig. 12). This
    indicates the reliability of the retrieved LST using both the algorithms. In addition
    to cross-validation, an inter-comparison of LST retrieved using these two algorithms
    has also been conducted. Based on the validation of LST with respect to MODIS
    LST products, the LST derived from SW algorithm has been assumed to be more accurate
    and used as standard LST in relative comparison of results. To evaluate the relative
    performance of RTT and SW algorithms in estimating LST, a difference map of LST
    derived using both the algorithms has been generated. Difference in LST derived
    from both the methods was in the range of −9 to 12.6°K. Highest difference was
    observed in barren land or settlement areas, whereas difference in LST derived
    using both the methods in agricultural areas of Mula command was in the range
    of −0.3 to 3°K. The higher difference in LST derived using RTT and SW algorithms
    could also be attributed toward the processing errors, as the frequency of these
    values in the difference maps are very low. For better understanding the effect
    of LULC on LST retrieval, the difference in LST under each dominant LULC class
    has been analyzed. In total, 100 sample points per LULC class have been generated
    in the study area using stratified random sampling approach. LST values for these
    sample points under each LULC class have been extracted using ‘Extract Multi Values
    to Points’ tool available in Arc GIS 10.0. The analysis of difference of LST values
    under different LULC classes is given in Table 5. Table 5 Average LST under different
    LULC classes (°K) Full size table As clearly given in Table 5 that the LST values
    estimated using both the algorithms are very close to each other in agricultural
    fields. Lowest deviation between LST products derived using RTT and SW algorithms
    can be seen in the area covered under sugarcane crop. In the area under sugarcane,
    observed difference in minimum, maximum and mean LST are 0.5, −0.8 and 0.3°K,
    respectively, whereas maximum difference in LST products of these algorithms has
    been seen in the fallow land. In fallow land, difference in minimum LST of both
    methods is 1.5°K, and maximum LST difference is −2.7°K. This deviation in LST
    estimated using both the methods may be attributed toward the use of additional
    band (i.e., band 11) of Landsat 8 in SW algorithm. In RTT method, LSE, the important
    parameter in LST retrieval, has been calculated using band 10 only. Whereas in
    SW algorithm, mean and difference of LSE estimated for band 10 and band 11 have
    been used. The cross-validation of retrieved LST using SW and RTT algorithms and
    inter-comparison of both the retrieved LST products indicate that the retrieved
    LST is highly reliable especially in agricultural areas. Conclusions In the present
    study, land surface temperature (LST) has been estimated using two most popular
    algorithms viz. radiative transfer theory (RTT) equation-based method and split-window
    (SW) algorithm. The LST maps of command area of Mula irrigation project have been
    generated using Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data acquired during
    November 2013 to April 2014 (i.e., Rabi season). The atmospheric parameters required
    in RTT method have been simulated by processing NCEP global reanalysis data with
    MODTRAN model available as online atmospheric correction tool. Suitable split-window
    coefficients were adapted for TIRS band 10 and band 11 data from the literature.
    The atmospheric water vapor content has been derived from Precipitable Water product
    of MODIS. Land surface emissivity was estimated using NDVI threshold method. Twenty
    Landsat 8 cloud-free images were processed to estimate LST of the command area
    for the Rabi season of year 2013–2014 using two algorithms (SW and RTT). The MODIS
    daily LST data have been used for cross-validation of retrieved LST. High correlation
    coefficient between MODIS LST values and LST retrieved using both algorithms indicates
    high reliability of these retrievals. The correlation coefficient with MODIS LST
    in entire area and agricultural area are higher in case of LST retrieved using
    SW algorithm (0.938 and 0.925, respectively) compared to that of LST retrieved
    using RTT method (0.902 and 0.894, respectively). This indicates that the LST
    retrieved using SW algorithm are more precise compared to LST retrieved using
    RTT method. Approximate constant bias of 2.4 °C between MODIS LST and LST estimated
    using SW algorithm was observed, and this bias may be attributed toward the issue
    of spatial scale of these products. Relative comparison of LST derived from both
    the algorithms has also been done. Highest difference (−9 to 12.6°K) in LST derived
    by these two algorithms can be observed in barren land or fallow land, whereas
    in agricultural area, the difference is in the range of −0.3 to 3°K. To evaluate
    the effect of LULC on LST retrieval, difference in LST has been analyzed for each
    LULC class separately by extracting LST from 100 randomly distributed points in
    each LULC class. The analysis indicate that minimum difference in LST retrieved
    using RTT and SW algorithm has been observed in sugarcane crop, whereas highest
    difference can be observed in fallow land. Overall, in the command area of Mula
    irrigation project the difference in mean LST of different LULC classes was in
    the range of −0.1 to 0.3°K and the pixel scale difference was ±1–3 °K. Due to
    non-availability of ground observed LST data, cross-validation of retrieved LST
    product has been done using standard MODIS LST products in the present study.
    However, it is noteworthy that in the present case, standard algorithms of LST
    retrieval along with modeled site-specific atmospheric parameters have been used
    to derive LST of the Mula command area. Hence, it can be assumed that the inherent
    accuracy of these algorithms (published in the literature) has been achieved in
    the present attempt also. This is also supported by the results of cross-validation
    analysis. The higher correlation coefficient between MODIS LST values and retrieved
    LST values and also the minor difference in LST derived using RTT and SW algorithms
    in the agricultural area indicate that the LST estimated using both the methods
    are relatively accurate and can be used for further analysis. These higher spatial
    resolution LST products can efficiently be utilized in irrigation water management
    studies. Future work toward validation of these algorithms using ground observed
    LST data and sensitivity analysis of these algorithms using observed atmospheric
    parameters can be taken up. References Agam N, Kustas WP, Anderson MC, Li F, Colaizzi

  limitations: 'The study relies solely on Landsat 8 TIRS data and does not incorporate
    other sources of LST data, such as in situ measurements or data from different
    sensors, for validation. Additionally, the study does not explore the impact of
    atmospheric conditions on the accuracy of LST retrieval, which could be a factor
    in certain geographic regions or seasons.


    The authors mention that they used the online atmospheric correction tool provided
    by Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (Barsi et al. 2005) to estimate atmospheric parameters necessary for solving the
    RTT method. However, they do not provide specific details about the accuracy or
    limitations of this tool.


    The study does not evaluate the computational efficiency of the two algorithms
    used for LST retrieval. In operational applications, where timely access to LST
    data is crucial, the computational time required to process large datasets may
    be a relevant consideration.'

  verbatim_quote1: LST retrieved using SW algorithm shows higher correlation coefficient
    with MODIS LST in entire command area and in agricultural land as well (0.938
    and 0.925, respectively) compared to that of LST output of RTT method (0.902 and
    0.894, respectively).
  verbatim_quote2: The relative comparison of the LST products derived from RTT and
    SW algorithms showed that there is an average difference of ±3 °K between these
    two products. However, the difference is very small (−0.8 to 0.5°K) in case of

  description: Inadequate water application often decreases yield and grain quality.
    Existing methods using single, localized soil moisture or canopy temperature measurements
    do not account for crop water stress on both a high spatial and temporal resolution
    for precision irrigation water management decisions and scheduling. Therefore,
    this study was conducted to understand the feasibility of thermal cameras in order
    to quantify high resolution spatial canopy temperatures in relation to soil moisture.
    The objectives of this study were to deploy a thermal infrared imaging system
    (TIRIS) for high spatial and temporal monitoring of corn canopy temperature in
    greenhouse, test camera durability and measurement accuracy during full-season
    crop development, remove background temperatures with image segmentation, and
    sample individual plants to investigate full-season crop water stress versus soil
    moisture content. A TIRIS was developed using a lightweight uncooled thermal camera.
    Corn plants were divided into well-watered and water-stressed irrigation zones
    to observe stress from water deficits. Canopy temperatures were used to develop
    empirical canopy and air temperature deficit versus vapor pressure deficit linear
    regressions. Results showed that the TIRIS system maintained measurement accuracy
    of ±0.62. °C (. α=. 0.05) while compensating for changing ambient greenhouse conditions.
    Canopy and air temperature deficit versus vapor pressure deficit regression equations
    revealed that the predicted canopy temperature was closely related to characteristic
    water use. Results of the 80-day study demonstrated that 82% of soil moisture
    variation was explained by the crop water stress index (CWSI) values between 0.6
    and 1.0. Results indicated that the CWSI derived by remotely measuring canopy
    temperature using TIRIS can be used as an alternate irrigation scheduling method
    in order to quantify spatial and temporal soil moisture variability.

    agriculture annually uses approximately 80% of the consumptive ground and surface
    water (USDA, 2014). The potential to conserve water relies heavily on decision
    support tools (Rodriguez et al., 2005) which can increase water use efficiency
    using precision irrigation technologies (Ballester et al., 2013, Cohen et al.,
    2005, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008). Quantity of irrigation water and application time
    is among critical decisions producers frequently have to make to develop site-specific
    irrigation plans (Alves and Pereira, 2000, Cohen et al., 2005, Wanjura et al.,
    1992). Precision variable rate irrigation technologies are available which can
    apply a desired amount of water at a controllable increment for optimum crop growth
    and yield (Cohen et al., 2005, Taghvaeian et al., 2013). However, large variability
    may exist in commercial agricultural fields due to soil type and depth, topography,
    climate, specific crop growth period and seed hybrid selection (Cohen et al.,
    2005, Evett et al., 2014). Of the many types of crop stress, water stress is the
    most common and restrictive factor impacting crop yield (Jackson et al., 1981,
    Luvall and Holbo, 1991, Scherrer et al., 2011, Zia et al., 2013) where water stress
    severity depends on timing and duration. Therefore, techniques and technologies
    are needed to accurately classify spatial and temporal crop water need, or crop
    water stress, to gain economic and environment advantages (Herwitz et al., 2004,
    Taghvaeian et al., 2013). Several existing methods to monitor crop water stress
    rely on a combination of single-point soil, plant and atmospheric measurements
    (Alves and Pereira, 2000, Cohen et al., 2005). Soil moisture sensors are one of
    the most common tools being utilized to make irrigation decisions. Newer soil
    moisture probes are capable of quantifying moisture at multiple soil depths. Typically,
    one or two soil moisture probes are installed for a whole field due to the installation
    time, cost and yearly maintenance. However, soil moisture probes are subject to
    error from installation and location choice that do not account for spatial crop
    variability which may exist within the whole field (Moller et al., 2007). Alternative
    methods for detecting crop water stress utilize pressure chambers and leaf diffusion
    porometers to measure individual leaf and stem water potential and leaf stomatal
    conductance, respectively (Ballester et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009a, Grant
    et al., 2007, Idso et al., 1977). However, these techniques are destructive, labor
    intensive, localized, limited by small sample size and unsuitable for automation
    (Ballester et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009a, Cohen et al., 2005, Gontia and Tiwari,
    2008, Jones, 1999, Leinonen and Jones, 2004). Consequently, these drawbacks make
    invasive plant-based crop monitoring impractical at high resolution spatial and
    temporal scale in large acreage production systems like corn, thereby limiting
    producer adoption of these technologies/methods for irrigation decision management
    (Ballester et al., 2013). To address these concerns, thermal sensing approaches
    have been investigated because they are non-contact and less labor intensive,
    and offer non-destructive monitoring to assess crop stress from leaf canopy temperatures
    (Grant et al., 2006, Leinonen and Jones, 2004). Since the 1970s, crop canopy temperature
    has been accepted as an indicator of crop water stress because plants close their
    leaf stomata when they experience water stress in order to retain water, thereby
    lowering stomatal conductance, reducing transpiration, and increasing leaf temperatures
    (Ballester et al., 2013, Grant et al., 2006, Idso et al., 1977, Jones, 1999, Leinonen
    and Jones, 2004, Rodriguez et al., 2005). On the other hand, when leaf stomata
    are open, water in the leaf evaporates through transpiration which cools the leaf
    (Maes and Steppe, 2012). During transpiration, energy from within and surrounding
    the leaf is used to convert water from liquid to a gas that under goes latent
    heat loss which in turn cools the leaf. Current crop growth studies have primarily
    used ground-based thermometry to take canopy temperature measurements and develop
    thermal indices that account for canopy characteristics, soil temperature, and
    atmospheric conditions for site-specific irrigation management and breeding programs
    (Idso et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1981, O’Toole and Real, 1986). According to
    Zia et al. (2013), crop growth stage does not significantly impact canopy leaf
    temperature, thereby supporting the use of leaf temperature as a viable indicator
    of full-season crop health characteristic. Highly integrated thermometric systems
    use an array of infrared thermometers (IRTs) mounted in fixed field locations
    and on dynamic center pivot irrigation systems to measure crop canopy temperatures
    and provide a means of irrigation scheduling (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). IRTs
    provide a single point (comprising of one pixel) average temperature value of
    all objects within the sensor’s field of view (FOV) which could include shaded
    and unshaded plant material; and/or soil background. IRT inaccuracy from background
    temperatures limit their use until the crop reaches a particular maturity stage
    because when plants are small, soil covers a majority of the measurable surface,
    thereby dominating the temperature measurement. Additionally, IRTs cannot measure
    spatial temperature difference between shaded and sunlit leaves where temperature
    differences can drastically differ. Therefore, crop temperature must be segmented
    from the measured temperature value to reduce the influence of soil background
    and shaded lower leaves (Ayeneh et al., 2002, Luquet et al., 2003, Maes and Steppe,
    2012). IRTs are typically mounted to fixed locations within the field or on dynamic
    pivot systems which may limit the spatial coverage area. When mounted to pivot
    systems, useful data may only be collected during a few hours in the day while
    the pivots moves 24/7. Additionally, IRTs can only operate at the temporal resolution
    of irrigation events (often every 3–7 days) and thus lack the high spatial and
    temporal measurement resolution necessary to quantify crop water stress variability
    critical for making weekly irrigation decisions (Colaizzi et al., 2012). An alternate
    to IRTs are low cost and lightweight uncooled thermal infrared (TIR) cameras.
    TIR cameras can spatially map temperatures via a thermal image to measure subtle,
    heterogeneous characteristics of leaf dynamics (Liu et al., 2011). Each image
    is comprised of pixel arrays representative of pixel resolution of the TIR camera.
    Crop canopy temperature monitoring with thermography could allow producers to
    use thermal sensing for crop canopy temperature mapping (Alves and Pereira, 2000,
    Ayeneh et al., 2002, Berni et al., 2009b, Taghvaeian et al., 2013, Wang et al.,
    2010), individual crop temperature profiling (Leinonen and Jones, 2004), and manage
    variable rate irrigation scheduling (Cohen et al., 2005, Colaizzi et al., 2012,
    Fitzgerald et al., 2007). The crop water stress index (CWSI), investigated by
    Idso et al. (1981), has been successfully developed and implemented using IRTs
    that measure canopy temperatures in order to determine variable rate irrigation
    needs (Taghvaeian et al., 2013). Thermography has been recently utilized to further
    develop thermal indices and crop sensing techniques originally developed with
    IRTs. Temperature-based indices have shown significant correlations among crop
    canopy temperature, stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential as correlations
    become more significant as stress intensity increased (Hackl et al., 2012). Thermal
    imagery also requires systems and subsequent data processing techniques to capture,
    analyze, and interpret large amount of images. However, available knowledge regarding
    thermal sensing systems using TIR cameras is limited, and producers are skeptical
    of technology that has demonstrated potential for measuring crop temperature profiles
    for water management in orchards, vineyards, and other specialty crops in areas
    outside of the United States (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2011). Limited studies have
    been conducted using TIR camera systems in the U.S. to measure all-season crop
    temperature with high spatial (i.e., sub-centimeter) and temporal (i.e., minute-to-minute)
    resolutions while testing the thermal cameras’ durability during prolonged operation
    time in varying environmental conditions. Therefore this study was conducted to
    understand the necessary hardware required to capture thermal imagery, segment
    crop canopy from background and establish standard operating procedures to generate
    absolute temperature measurement from relative pixel intensities of lightweight
    uncooled cameras. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) develop and
    deploy a thermal imaging system for monitoring corn canopy at high spatial and
    temporal resolutions in a greenhouse; (2) evaluate the accuracy of the thermal
    imaging system in measuring crop canopy temperatures during a full growing, and;
    (3) investigate full-season air-to-canopy temperature deficit versus VPD transfer
    functions for direct relationships between crop water stress index (CWSI) values
    and soil moisture by automatically evaluating canopy temperature images. 2. Methods
    and materials The irrigation experiment was conducted within the Throckmorton
    Greenhouses of the Agronomy Department at Kansas State University, Manhattan,
    Kansas. On 10 May 2014, corn (Zea mays) seeds were planted in 20 cm diameter pot
    containers with 30 replications. For a full-season study (80 days), the plants
    were separated into two irrigation regimes, well-watered (WW) and water-stressed
    (WS), as shown in Fig. 1. Corn was selected as the crop of choice because it is
    a major irrigated crop in the Midwest and has demonstrated high yield potential
    with supplemental irrigation (Schlegel et al., 2014). Compost material with high
    organic and plant nutrient content was used as potting media with a water-holding
    capacity of 3.4 ml per gram of soil, as determined in an oven drying method (Texas
    Department of Transportation, 2014). All corn seed was planted 4 cm deep, fertilized
    with slow-release nitrogen pellets, and imposed with water treatments directly
    after emergence. Greenhouse temperature was set to 27 °C during the day from 6:00
    to 18:00 h and 20 °C at night from 18:00 to 6:00 h on the following day (Hoeft
    et al., 2004). Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Irrigation treatment layout in greenhouse of the corn
    plants during growth period 1 with water stressed (WS), on the left, and well-watered
    (WW) plants, on the right. Irrigation water quantities required in inches during
    different stages of corn have been established by researchers (Rogers, 2007 and
    Kranz et al., 2008). For this study in the greenhouse, approximate irrigation
    volume for a plant in a pot was calculated based on inches of water used by crop
    on per acre basis in the field during each growth stage (Rogers, 2007). An irrigation
    volume of 50% compared to WW was selected for the WS regimes. As previously mentioned
    the irrigation water volumes were selected to soley create two different water
    availability levels within WW and WS regimes to test TIRIS. Consequently, periods
    of analysis were split into growth periods of (1) germination and seedling stage,
    (2) rapid growth stage, (3) reproductive stage, and (4) maturity stage. Based
    on the size of pot containers used in this study, Table 1 depicts the water amount
    applied to each corn plant during the respective growth stage based on recommended
    water needs suggested by Rogers (2007) as defined by Eq. (1). (1) where Table

    via commercial drip-line under constant pressure from a regulating solenoid valve
    (Production Series Sprinkler Value, Orbit Irrigation Products, Inc., Bountiful,
    Utah, USA) controlled by a zone irrigation controller (Zone Indoor/Outdoor Irrigation
    Controller, Orbit Irrigation Products, Inc., Bountiful, Utah, USA) to maintain
    drip uniformity and repeatability. Precise and timely irrigation regimes were
    applied at 6:00 AM. Fig. 1 shows the irrigation setup and plants under growth
    period 1. 2.2. Thermal imaging and environmental monitoring An automated thermal
    infrared imaging system (TIRIS) was developed and deployed in the greenhouse to
    measure on-demand corn canopy temperatures in order to evaluate measurement accuracy
    and requirements for measuring corn canopy temperatures in precision agriculture
    applications. The TIRIS was comprised of components for remote camera control,
    environmental monitoring sensors, and computer for capturing, storing, and analyzing
    image and environmental data (Fig. 2). For remote monitoring and control of the
    TIRIS, wireless control was enabled using a virtual private network (VPN). Download

    Individual component of the TIRIS. The camera control components stream thermal
    images from the camera into the computer while a suite of sensors monitor environmental
    parameters. Thermal images were obtained with an uncooled Tamarisk® 320 thermal
    infrared (TIR) camera core (DRS Technologies, Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA) with a
    focal length of 11 mm and a 27° × 20° FOV lens. The TIR camera was sensitive to
    long wave infrared (LWIR) electromagnetic radiation from 8 to 14 μm corresponding
    to a temperature span of −66 to 90 °C, and an uncooled microbolometer sensor with
    a 320 × 280 fixed pixel array. The camera was mounted to the greenhouse frame
    at a 4.5 m height nadir to the ground throughout the study, thereby providing
    a spatial resolution of 7.0 mm/pixel, limiting the ground coverage or FOV to 3
    × 2 m. The TIR camera core provided an 8-bit (256 discrete pixel intensity digital
    value (DV)) thermal video. The DRS Camera Control Software was used to control
    the camera’s functions and features. Within the software’s graphical user interface
    (GUI), the TIR camera core was configured for video output and frame rate, and
    thermal detector sensitivity settings. In order to interface and set the TIR camera
    core, a DRS breakout board module (Breakout Box 1003785-001, DRS Technologies,
    Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA) was used to adjust the slope and intercept of the sensitivity
    curve of the thermal detector, thereby adjusting the gain sensitivity (i.e., detectable
    scene temperature span) and level control (i.e., shift offset of the center temperature
    within the temperature span). For instance, a gain of 20 and level of 30 °C will
    program the TIR camera thermal detector to measure temperatures from 20 °C to
    40 °C and saturate everything else. As a result, the thermal detector was able
    to be set for a specific temperature span and offset in order to detect subtle
    scene temperatures differences. Auto gain and level contrast sensitivity was controlled
    via the DRS Camera Control Software (DRS Technologies, Dallas, Texas) to account
    for continuously changing operating camera housing temperatures within the greenhouse.
    Auto gain and contrast maintains distinguishable scene temperatures and high and
    low temperatures within saturation threshold limits (Kuenzer, 2014). The TIRIS
    system was designed to capture analog video output into an analog-to-digital video
    converter (Dazzle DVD Recorder HD, Corel Corporation, USA). This raw analog video
    signal was streamed via a cable into a host computer using LabVIEW™ (National
    Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) image acquisition and processing software.
    Real-time environmental conditions were measured every 2.5 min with a single-board
    microcontroller (Single-Board RIO 9633, National Instruments Corporation, Austin,
    Texas, USA) and placed into a measurement file denoted with the corresponding
    image number from the TIR camera analog video output. When the TIRIS sampled environmental
    parameters, the virtual interface (VI) grabbed the simultaneous image (or frame
    from video), assigned a timestamp, and stored it within the appropriate storage
    folder (Fig. 3) for analysis. Environmental parameters measured included relative
    humidity, air temperature, solar radiation and soil moisture. Relative humidity
    and air temperature were measured with an ambient air sensor (HX303AV, Omega Engineering
    Inc., Stamford, Connecticut, USA) with an accuracy of ±3% and ±0.2 °C, respectively.
    Solar radiance was measured with an pyranometer (SP115, Apogee Instruments, Logan,
    Utah) with an accuracy of ±0.25 W m−2. The soil moisture of two irrigation regimes
    were monitored with four Waterscout SM 100 (Spectrum Technologies, Aurora, Illinois,
    USA) with an accuracy of ±3% soil moisture content (SMC) with two sensors in each
    irrigation regime. The soil moisture sensors were installed according to the sensor
    manufacturer’s installation procedures in order to measure the WW and WS plants
    throughout the season to validate the extent of crop water stress. Download :

    number, and time stamp. To compensate for the influence of environmental conditions
    on the accuracy of the TIR camera, surface mount thermistors (ON-930-44004, Omega
    Engineering Inc., Stamford, Connecticut, USA) with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C measured
    temperature were mounted on the reference panels and placed within the camera’s
    FOV. Reference panels used in the experiment were 10 × 10 cm wooden pads with
    an empirical emissivity of 0.9, whereas corn has an emissivity of about 0.95 (Idso
    et al., 1981). Reference temperature panels were sized accordingly to the camera’s
    spatial resolution and constructed of materials with a low thermal inertia in
    order to resist temperature changes. A reference panel was placed on shaded concrete,
    well-watered soil, and water-stressed soil to generate a set of three known reference
    measured temperatures corresponding to pixel intensity DV. 2.3. Radiometric calibration
    The uncooled TIR camera core measured LWIR energy that strikes the detector material,
    altering the electrical resistance from a temperature change, transforming LWIR
    radiation intensity into a raw DV, thereby generating a thermal image (Kuenzer,
    2014). The uncooled TIR cameras measured relative pixel intensity DV and did not
    provide absolute temperatures. To quantify absolute surface temperature at environmental
    conditions in which the TIR camera was calibrated, a real-time (RT) radiometric
    calibration method was developed. A RT radiometric calibration used RT image pixel
    intensities of a viewable reference panel within the camera’s FOV and the actual
    surface temperatures measured from thermistors to characterize a pixel-to-temperature
    relationship. For any one sampling, the three reference panels always present
    within each image FOV provided a low, in-between, and high temperature due to
    their placement locations. As a result, the low and high reference panels were
    used for the RT radiometric calibration, whereas the in-between reference panel
    acted as a crosscheck for assessing RT measurement accuracy. Static regions of
    interest (ROI) comprising each reference panel, as specified in the automatic
    imaging program, averaged multiple pixels containing digital pixel intensity values
    from TIR camera to correlate to one surface temperature measurement. Raw pixel
    intensities DV (X1, X2) from each image were correlated to actual surface temperature
    (Y1, Y2) to determine the radiometric transfer function slope, as defined by Eq.
    (2): (2) where m = slope of the radiometric transfer function, X1 = pixel intensity
    of the cool reference panel, X2 = pixel intensity of the warm reference panel,
    Y1 = temperature of the cool reference panel, and Y2 = temperature of the warm
    reference panel. By using the slope found in Eq. (2), raw pixel and coinciding
    surface temperature (X1, Y1), the y-intercept of the RT radiometric transfer function
    was determined using Eq. (3): (3) where X1 = reference pixel intensity, Y1 = reference
    temperature, and m = slope of the radiometric transfer function. Using results
    from Eq. (3), instantaneous temperature span was defined by Eq. (4): (4) where
    Tspan = span of temperature captured in the image, and DV = bit-depth of pixel
    intensity (e.g., DV = 256 for 8-bit images). Using the resulting radiometric calibration
    function from Eqs. (2), (3), the TIR camera core was found to be directly sensitive
    (R2 = 0.9986) to the scene temperatures within the FOV (Fig. 4). Download : Download

    radiometric calibration developed for an image at 25 °C air temperature, 45% relative
    humidity, and steady-state operating camera temperature. A unique RT radiometric
    conversion was applied to each image to convert DV into temperature values as
    defined by Eq. (5). The radiometric calibration method enabled the uncooled TIR
    camera core to use the sensitivity of the thermal detector, as shown Fig. 4, to
    quantify corn canopy temperatures. Initial tests were conducted to determine the
    TIR camera’s ability to measure temperatures within a strict laboratory environment.
    The absolute difference between actual (thermistor) and measured temperature (TIR
    camera) revealed that the maximum measurement error was 0.62 °C (α = 0.05) with
    camera temperature resolution of 0.08 °C (Fig. 5). Additional preliminary tests
    were conducted to assess the RT radiometric calibration method’s ability to compensate
    for varying VPD and the results indicated that TIR camera core maintained the
    measurement accuracy (Fig. 6). Therefore, the RT radiometric calibration method
    was implemented to minimize the potential influence of environmental conditions
    on the measurement accuracy within a greenhouse. (5) where Download : Download

    (e.g., N = 8 for 8-bit images), and Tspan = span of temperature captured in the
    image. 2.4. Automated thermal imaging and processing An Image Processing VI (LabVIEW™,
    National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX) using Vision Assistant module was
    developed to process the image data and environmental data (Fig. 7) captured every
    2.5 min. During analysis, the Image Processing VI would reference the greenhouse
    environmental data for the specific image. The image was uploaded from the file
    storage and corrected for lens distortion and a filtered to reduce analog signal
    noise that was caused by the uncooled TIR camera sensor and transmission of analog
    video signal. A variance filter within LabVIEW, which uses classical statistical
    technique called interclass variance, was found to reduce analog noise that could
    cause inconsistent temperature measurement. Within each image, the stem and leaf
    vegetation was identified using multiple ROIs on each plant sample that were manually
    set based on a plant’s location within the image. Between the multiple ROIs, an
    average temperature was calculated for the stem and leaf vegetation for each plant
    sample. Throughout the four isolated growth periods, ROIs were manually re-designated
    to account for vegetation growth in height and leaf development to capture the
    upper canopy (representing the last and previous to last developed leaf) leaf
    temperatures of plants in each irrigation regime. Download : Download high-res

    (shown in green) and reference panels (shown in orange). Automated TIRIS segmented
    individual corn foliage from background soil, cement, and pot containers. Black
    pixels indicate a cold surface while white pixels indicate hot surface. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) During the growth stages, the plants’ pots were
    repositioned and oriented to reduce leaf overlap and keep each plant’s canopy
    visible and limit overlap. ROIs were also designated on each reference panels
    in order to extract reference panel pixel intensities. In addition, ROIs were
    used to look at spatial temperatures differences from the stem and leaf. This
    allowed comparisons between the predicted stem and air temperature deficit versus
    VPD and the predicted canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD. 2.5. Crop
    water stress monitoring Because previous studies have found crop stress to be
    highest at periods following solar noon, vegetation temperature measurements from
    12:00 to 17:00 h were utilized for peak canopy temperatures (Cohen et al., 2014,
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013, Idso et al., 1977). Relative humidity, air temperature,
    solar radiance, and crop temperatures were combined to calculate instantaneous
    crop water stress corresponding to each image. In all measurements, the VPD (Eq.
    (6)) was calculated from the air temperature and relative humidity (Monteith and
    Unsworth, 2013) and VPD was used to deduce a non-water stressed baseline (NWSB)
    leaf canopy and air temperature deficit from VPD for solar radiation greater than
    100 W/m2 as defined in Eq. (7). (6) where Tair = measured air temperature (°C),
    RH = relative humidity (%), and VPD = vapor pressure deficit (kPa). (7) where
    Tww canopy = well-watered canopy temperature (°C), a = crop specific intercept
    for NWSB, and b = crop specific slope for NWSB. NWSB coefficients were empirically
    measured from RT canopy temperatures of the well-watered irrigation regime (Tww
    canopy) over the full growing season starting with the germination and seedling
    stage (growth period 1), rapid growth stage (growth period 2), reproductive stage
    (growth period 3), and maturity stage (growth period 4). Previous studies have
    suggested that empirically determined NWSBs and WSBs that directly account for
    present net radiation, aerodynamic resistance, and the particular crop’s microclimate
    is a robust technique for determining CWSI (Ballester et al., 2013, Blonquist
    and Bugbee, xxxx, El-Shikha et al., 2007, Erdem et al., 2010, Fitzgerald et al.,
    2007, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008, Grant et al., 2007). With the addition of upper
    and lower baselines for predicted leaf temperature, the CWSI approach has been
    the most used index aboard all thermal sensing platforms in various climate regions
    because of the inclusion of VPD, solar radiation, and wind speed (Maes and Steppe,
    2012, Rodriguez et al., 2005). The RT CWSI was calculated as depicted in Eq. (8)
    (Idso et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson, 1982): (8) where ΔTpredicted
    = (Tww canopy − Tair), ΔTdry = (Tdry − Tair), and ΔT1 = (Tcanopy temperature −
    Tair). For example, water stressed leaf (Tdry) and non-water stress leaf (Tww
    canopy) boundary temperatures were 25 °C and 20 °C, respectively. Air temperature
    was 23 °C and actual leaf temperature was 22 °C. In this example, CWSI is 0.4.
    For comparison, daily CWSI values were calculated for each plant. An instantaneous
    CWSI was derived using air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiance
    for each thermal image. Because wet and dry leaves are not practical within a
    prolonged monitoring study, wet reference temperatures were empirically found
    using well-watered plants in the WW regime. Similarly, standardized dry reference
    temperature of 5 °C above air temperature was utilized to respresent the WSBs
    (upper leaf temperature bounds) as suggested in previous studies (Alves and Pereira,
    2000, Cohen et al., 2005, Erdem et al., 2010, Moller et al., 2007, Moran et al.,
    1994, Wanjura et al., 2006). Empirical NWSBs (lower leaf temperatures) were determined
    using WW regime leaf temperatures in order to develop RT CWSI values. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Radiometric measurement accuracy The TIRIS was designed to
    quantify absolute surface temperature with RT radiometric calibration, thereby
    maintaining measurement accuracy by compensating for environmental influences
    from air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiance, and temperature of the
    uncooled TIR camera. RT radiometric calibration to implement environmental correction
    with temperature reference panels provided temperature measurement accuracy of
    0.62 °C in the semi-controlled greenhouse environment (Fig. 8). RT temperature
    measurement accuracy at the 95% confidence was found to less than 0.62 °C between
    noon and 18:00 hrs (Fig. 9) which has shown to be a better time to capture water
    stress (Colaizzi et al., 2012). As a result, the TIRIS has shown to be able to
    repeatedly measure the absolute temperature of the target surfaces. In application,
    this enables the ability of users to spatially monitor crop vegetation temperatures
    throughout the day without a loss of measurement accuracy. The reference panels
    provided adequate means to develop and utilize thermometric calibration curves
    to assign quantitative temperature values to relative pixel intensities. Similar
    system to calibrate TIRIS in the field could be utilized when implementing this
    system for mapping whole field canopy temperatures. However, further research
    needs to be conducted to understand feasibility of one-time calibration as RT
    calibration would not be feasible, and the dynamic accuracy of TIRIS under diverse
    ambient conditions during field operation. Download : Download high-res image

    air temperature deficit versus VPD were plotted for the four growth stages (Fig.
    10). Regression curves were fitted for data on each of the four stages to derive
    a (intercept) and b (slope) coefficients (Table 2) and develop non-water stressed
    base lines (Fig. 11) to calculate CWSI. The R2 values of the plots in Fig. 10
    shows that a correlation existed between the VPD and the predicted leaf canopy
    temperature. Lower plot R2 values during the last three growth stages could be
    attributed to the increased number of data samples from a VPD of 0 to 2 kPa. The
    WW vegetation temperatures calculated from the canopy and air temperature deficit
    versus VPD linear regression curves were also utilized to calculate CWSI illustrated
    in Fig. 13, Fig. 14. The VPD value concentrations may not be as prevalent during
    actual field applications and could provide stronger correlations as were observed
    during this study (Fig. 10). These results demonstrated that the canopy and air
    temperature deficit regression curve only slightly changed from the first growth
    period (GP1) to the second growth period (GP2). As suggested in Table 1, the recommended
    daily water use showed a peak followed by a decline in water use during the third
    growth stage. Similarly, during the third growth period (GP3), predicted leaf
    temperatures were warmer, suggesting that corn uses less energy for transpiration
    as the plant utilized more energy to grow fruit during the reproductive growth
    stage. Finally, reduced water uptake resulted in warmer leaf canopy temperatures
    during the final growth stage (GP4) closely resembling characteristic water use
    specified in Table 1. As a result, future studies using high spatial and temporal
    resolution TIRIS should be investigated in order to observe the full-season leaf
    canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPDs of corn in actual field conditions
    for more accurate non-water stressed base lines and predict CWSI. Download : Download

    image Fig. 11. Predicted canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD through
    four growth stages. Aside from segmenting soil and background temperatures from
    vegetation, the stem and leaf temperatures were isolated from within the FOV using
    location based ROIs. The canopy and air temperature deficit was compared to the
    stem-to-air temperature deficit versus VPD, as shown in Fig. 12. These values
    were collected throughout the full-season and represent the WW plant sample average.
    The canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD produced a stronger correlation
    (R2 = 0.7364) versus the stem-to-air temperature deficit versus VPD (R2 = 0.6592).
    This observation supports the use of the VPD to better predict the NWSB canopy
    temperature. The results suggested that plant canopy is a better indicator of
    leaf transpiration and would be beneficial for future studies. For practical adoption
    purposes, measuring the canopy temperature aboard different sensing platforms
    would be less of a challenge because the canopy typically has a large surface
    area and is the uppermost point on the plant. At the same time, being the uppermost
    portion of the plant, the canopy is more exposed to environmental conditions,
    thereby is susceptible to larger diurnal temperature changes. As a result, temporal
    environmental monitoring that is capable of measuring subtle changes in the crop
    microclimate will limit error in crop-based water stress assessment. Download

    the soil moisture versus CWSI from a CWSI value of 0.6 to 1.0 and no significant
    correlation from a CWSI value of 0 to 0.6. 3.3. Spatial and temporal crop water
    stress The high spatial monitoring capability of the TIRIS provided a real-time
    CWSI to be applied to each image (Fig. 13). As the water stress progressed in
    the WS plants, the spatial CWSI analysis showed that crop water stress vary depending
    on the location within the corn plant structure. In Fig. 13c, a majority of the
    WS canopy have a CWSI value of 1 whereas the lower leaves have a CWSI near 0.5.
    In comparison, the WW plants have leaf tips with a CWSI value of 1; yet, the lower
    leaves have a CWSI near 0. ROI segmentation for each plant extracted the upper
    and lower leaf CWSI to calculate an average CWSI within each treatment. In the
    greenhouse the plants were positioned to limit overlap and error as they grew
    with the nadir camera view. Therefore, predefined ROIs were practical in the fixed
    imaging system. In field applications, plants would grow and move in/out of ROIs
    during the growing season which could cause measurement error. As a result, real-time
    ROIs could serve for better temperature extraction if only vegetation could be
    segmented from the background by accurately defining ROIs. To capture real-time
    ROIs, a combination of visible and thermal camera systems could provide image
    segmentation of only green vegetation. The inclusion of background or non-leaf
    portion of thermal image could cause deviation in actual canopy temperature as
    the background temperature around solar noon would be much higher. This would
    cause false high CWSI values. In addition to extracting only green vegetation,
    the critical spatial resolution (on-target pixel resolution) is important when
    considering the accuracy of the pixel segmentation in order to limit inaccurate
    temperature measurement with edge pixels that are a combination of green vegetation
    and background. This could also include to segment sunlit versus shaded vegetation
    by creating a visible image mask in order to extract only green, sunlit leaf temperatures
    for advanced image analysis to map canopy temperatures. The daily peak CWSI and
    soil moisture of the WS and WW irrigation regimes in the critical time period
    between 12:00 and 18:00 h is presented in Fig. 14a. The daily soil moisture measurements
    revealed a soil moisture deficit occurred from day 15 through day 50 in the WS
    regime. On day 50, the WS plants were watered in order to preserve them and to
    observe the WS plants’ response to irrigation following severe water stress. Peak
    CWSI of the WS corn did not, however, decrease until day 52. This observation
    is important when interpreting and utilizing CWSI values for irrigation decisions
    because, immediately after watering, plants may have received an ample amount
    of water but did not have sufficient time to absorb water and transpire, thereby
    still reflecting a high CWSI. The level of crop water stress prior to irrigation
    seems to influence the amount of time required for the plants to absorb and transpire
    thus decreasing their CWSI. Further temporal studies should be considered in order
    to quantify this time response. As shown in Fig. 13, the variability within the
    canopy geometry and architecture adds complexity to measuring CWSI. The spatial
    and temporal CWSI monitoring ability of the TIRIS showed that the time of day
    and spatial location can produce differing level of measured crop stress. Results
    from this study exhibited that the daily peak crop water stress occurred between
    13:30 and 15:00 h. In actual field conditions, peak crop water stress could occur
    at different times depending on current environmental conditions. As shown in
    Fig. 14b, soil moisture content at or above 72% (y1 linear regression curve intercept)
    maintained a CWSI value below 0.6 whereas soil moisture content below 72% negatively
    correlated with CWSI values above 0.6. Results from the 80-day study revealed
    that 82% (R2 = 0.8152 of the y2 linear regression curve) of soil moisture variation
    was explained by a CWSI above 0.6. This was also evident from the data showing
    the relationship between the daily peak CWSI and soil moisture of the WS and WW
    irrigation regimes. This relationship demonstrated the use of non-contact thermal
    sensing to indirectly measure soil moisture. The results also suggested that CWSI
    values could be further studied in order to quantify spatial soil moisture deficits
    as an alternative irrigation scheduling method instead of soil moisture probes.
    4. Conclusion Thermography provided an unprecedented opportunity to study crop
    vegetation with both high spatial (i.e., sub-centimeter) and temporal (minute-to-minute)
    resolution for new and advanced relationships. As observed from this study, thermal
    imaging systems could be considered for measuring crop water stress at high spatial
    and temporal resolutions required for managing irrigation water within large agricultural
    production systems. Simplification of image acquisition systems in order to capture
    full-season crop stress could allow producers, agricultural service providers,
    and researchers to have thermal sensing technology sensitive to crop water requirements
    for management decisions, leading to more efficient allocation of available resources
    for precision agriculture. Future studies using TIRIS needs to be conducted to
    assess in-season crop water status on field scale level. Due to thermography’s
    particular use in non-agricultural roles such as industrial maintenance and limited
    agricultural research studies, this study was conducted to prove the utility of
    small, lightweight uncooled TIR cameras for prolonged agricultural applications.
    A TIRIS was developed for high spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of corn
    in order to observe crop stress from water deficits with concurrent soil moisture
    measurements in a greenhouse. The lightweight, low cost, and small size of the
    uncooled TIR camera used in this study maintained a measurement accuracy below
    ±0.62 °C (α = 0.05) within a greenhouse. In addition, a stronger relationship
    was found regarding the predicted canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD
    (R2 = 0.7364) compared to the predicted stem-to-air temperature deficit versus
    VPD (R2 = 0.6592). Empirical NWSBs revealed that crop canopy temperature changed
    slightly throughout growth stages. Results indicated that canopy water deficit
    regression curves closely follow the characteristic water use throughout corn
    growth stages. Results from the 80-day study (Fig. 14b) revealed that a significant
    decrease in soil moisture was measured only when the CWSI value increased past
    0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI. As observed, the
    CWSI was negatively correlated to soil moisture supporting the use of the CWSI
    as an alternate irrigation scheduling method in order to quantify spatial soil
    moisture by remotely measuring canopy temperature. Acknowledgements This project

  analysis: 'The paper titled "Directional Link Scheduling for Real-Time Data Processing
    in Smart Manufacturing System" by Woongsoo Na et al. focuses on scheduling directional
    links for efficient routing of real-time data in a smart manufacturing system.
    The paper presents a link scheduling algorithm based on the maximum weight independent
    set (MWIS) problem to optimize transmission delay, throughput, and fairness among
    directional links.


    The paper makes the following contributions to addressing the specific point of
    data types most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources:


    1. **Identification of data types relevant to irrigation management:** The paper
    does not explicitly discuss data types applicable to irrigation management, as
    its focus is on developing a link scheduling algorithm for real-time data processing
    in smart manufacturing systems. However, it is reasonable to assume that similar
    data types would be relevant in both contexts, such as sensor data (e.g., temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture), control signals, and actuator commands.


    2. **Mention of typical sources for these data types:** The paper does not provide
    information on typical sources of data for irrigation management. However, in
    a smart irrigation system, data can be collected from various sources, including
    sensors installed in the field, weather stations, and historical records.


    The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through simulation
    results, showing that it outperforms existing mmWave routing schemes in terms
    of throughput, delay, packet loss rate, and transmission fairness. However, it
    is important to note that the paper focuses on a specific application scenario
    in smart manufacturing and may not be directly applicable to the broader context
    of irrigation management.


    **Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into real-time data processing
    and link scheduling in a smart manufacturing context, but it does not directly
    address the specific point of data types most applicable to irrigation management
    and their typical sources.**'

    of Things (IoT) technology has accelerated various industries through digital
    transformation. In an edge computing-based smart factory, a significant number
    of IoT devices generate large volumes of real-time data. This big data requires
    efficient routing among edge gateways (EGs) and an edge server for real-time data
    processing. Existing industrial wireless communication systems provide relatively
    low data rates and network capacity for real-time sensor data and control information
    over a wireless channel. This calls for the use of the very large bandwidth available
    at the mmWave spectrum for real-time data transmission. Existing data routing
    techniques for the mmWave band are based on traditional mobile ad hoc routing
    techniques and do not reduce the transmission delay for real-time sensory data
    in smart manufacturing systems. Therefore, to alleviate the real-time data processing
    requirement, we propose a new directional routing and link scheduling algorithm
    based on maximum weight independent set (MWIS). The proposed algorithm solves
    complicated MWIS problems efficiently and computes backhaul link scheduling results
    in a relatively short time by lowering the deafness problem among EGs. For transmission
    fairness, we used a Jain''s fairness index method with numerical analysis of the
    transmission fairness constraint. We measured the efficiency of our proposed scheme
    in terms of throughput, delay, packet loss rate, and transmission fairness. Our
    simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing mmWave routing
    techniques. Moreover, we investigated the performance difference between the proposed
    algorithm and the optimal solution. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction New business requirements and an emerging
    set of autonomous technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), are shifting
    manufacturing companies’ legacy environment toward smart manufacturing [1]. In
    a smart manufacturing system, various IoT-based manufacturing equipment (ME) generate,
    process, and exchange large-scale sensory information and control data over the
    industrial IoT network with context awareness [2]–[4]. This accumulated data requires
    a larger bandwidth and efficiently reconfigurable routing protocols to link the
    networked IoT devices for real-time processing [5]. Currently, there are a number
    of standards for wireless industrial communications, such as WirelessHart, ZigBee,
    ISA 100, and WiFi. The existing industrial wireless systems provide relatively
    low data rates for sensor information and traffic control [6]. This type of technology
    can be used in the last mile of a wireless sensor network, especially for mobile
    ME in a smart manufacturing system. Although wireline counterparts generally support
    higher rates, they typically suffer from prohibitive wiring costs in large manufacturing
    sites. As a solution to this problem, massive amounts of bandwidth, available
    at the mmWave 60 GHz spectrum, can open the way for large-scale data capacity
    and high data rate capabilities as a wireless backhaul in smart manufacturing.
    At the mmWave band around 60 GHz, gigabit-per-second transmissions are known to
    be achievable owing to the huge available bandwidth [7]–[10]. Due to the high
    signal attenuation in the mmWave band, directional antennas (with high antenna
    gain) are mainly used in this band, as they allow a better spatial reuse while
    lowering the chances of interference. In EdgeX Foundry-based smart manufacturing
    (see Fig. 1), edge gateways (EGs) aggregate local IoT traffic, which can then
    be routed over directionally connected links (directional links in Table I) between
    EGs and between an EG and an edge server (ES) [11]. As shown in Fig. 1, an EdgeX
    Foundry layer architecture comprises of four service layers, and each service
    layer is composed of several embedded micro-services modules. In particular, the
    scheduling microservice in the supporting services layer performs backhaul routing,
    whereas the mmWave microservice in the device services layer can be utilized to
    support communication using directional antenna (directional communication in
    Table I) over an industrial IoT network. The locally aggregated real-time traffic
    requires an efficient scheduling algorithm for backhaul links in order to reduce
    the total average end-to-end transmission delay. Moreover, routing with the use
    of a directional antenna improves network throughput and consumes the minimum
    total energy [12]. TABLE I Combination Terminologies Used in This Paper Fig. 1.
    mmWave-based smart manufacturing system network based on EdgeX Foundry [11]. Show
    All A large variety of routing protocols based on directional antennas (directional
    routing in Table I) have been reported in [13]–[22] and [26]. They can be traditionally
    classified into: 1) proactive or 2) reactive approaches. The former establishes
    routing paths in a local routing table to reduce the routing delay [13], [21],
    [26]. The latter tries to find a routing path when needed [14]–[20], [22]. However,
    both of the above techniques are limited by end-to-end transmission delay, since
    they are based on traditional mobile ad hoc routing (MANET) and do not effectively
    rectify the deafness problem. The deafness problem occurs when a node does not
    answer a communication request frame addressed to it and consequently the originator
    transmits more request frames, thus increasing the contention window [27]. The
    limitations are exacerbated in a smart manufacturing system since real-time control
    information or sensory data can be lost or does not arrive in time at the destination
    EG. Therefore, a technique to improve real-time data delivery is necessary for
    smart manufacturing systems. In this paper, we have proposed a new directional
    routing link scheduling algorithm for smart mobile edge in a smart manufacturing
    system based on maximum weight independent set (MWIS). This algorithm is designed
    to explicitly reduce transmission delay by lowering the chances of deafness problem
    among EGs by using a conflict/deafness graph. In a smart manufacturing system,
    all the EGs operate under the control of an ES. Therefore, in our scheme, the
    ES maintains a conflict-deafness graph and determines whether the directional
    links among the EGs interfere with one another or create a deafness problem when
    scheduled simultaneously. The link scheduling results are computed by the ES and
    are delivered to all the EGs via a control channel.1 The proposed algorithm solves
    a complicated MWIS problem in real-time by considering EGs in the order of their
    maximum number of independent sets and assigning time slots to the links with
    maximum traffic loads. Considering the characteristics of both large-scale real-time
    backhaul traffic and mmWave technology, the use of a directional antenna reduces
    radio interference among EGs and improves packet throughput greatly. In the scheduling
    process, our algorithm discovers and assigns time slots that maximizes spatial
    reuse among the links. However, links with a poor channel condition are not scheduled
    in this policy, and therefore, some links may not be scheduled. To guarantee fair
    scheduling, once directional links are scheduled, the algorithm measures the fairness
    constraint between links in order to ensure fair sharing of transmission resources
    among the EGs. The transmission fairness is ensured using Jain’s fairness index,
    which eventually maximizes the end-to-end throughput while minimizing the energy
    consumption. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm was measured by evaluating
    the performance metrics that include throughput, delay, packet loss rate, and
    transmission fairness. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperformed
    existing mmWave routing schemes; however, it gave suboptimal results when compared
    to the optimal solution. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section II summarizes the related works on directional routing protocols. Section
    III explains the system model for our proposed scheme, and Section IV presents
    the details of our proposed link scheduling algorithm based on transmission fairness
    in relation to the centralized approach. In Section V, we describe the performance
    of the proposed directional routing scheme. Finally, we conclude this paper in
    Section VI and discuss the future work. SECTION II. Related Work Scheduling and
    directional routing techniques for ad hoc networks have been addressed as a major
    research problem. Traditionally, these routing techniques have been classified
    into two categories: 1) proactive routing schemes and 2) reactive (on-demand)
    routing schemes. The former establishes a routing path in a local routing table
    to reduce the routing delay. On the other hand, the latter comprises of a node
    that attempts to find a routing path when required. Gharavi and Hu [14] proposed
    a directional dynamic source routing (DSR)-based multipath routing protocol for
    mobile wireless ad hoc networks. This protocol is based on DSR, which is a source-initiated
    on-demand routing protocol [15], and uses existing ad hoc routing protocols to
    set up routes. They consider some metrics, such as hop count, overlap count, and
    number of joint nodes, to select multiple routes. In this paper, it was important
    to minimize the overlap count between the source and destination, because the
    proposed protocol was able to select multipath routes, which could minimize the
    overlap count. Ueda et al. [26] proposed a slightly revised version of zone-disjoint
    path routing [17], or priority-based quality of service routing. When data communication
    occurs along one path and it does not interfere with other data communication
    paths, the path can be called a zone disjoint. This protocol avoids coupling between
    routes used by high and low priority traffic by reserving a high priority zone
    of communication. Low priority flows will try to avoid this zone by selecting
    routes that are maximally zone-disjoint with respect to the high priority reserved
    zone and will consequently reduce the contention between high and low priority
    flows in that reserved zone. However, this does not ensure that the low priority
    flows will be able to avoid the high priority zone completely. Cheng et al. [13]
    proposed an orthogonal rendezvous routing protocol for a wireless mesh network.
    This protocol has increased scalability and reduced geographic information issues.
    In this scheme, each node has a local sense of direction. A pair of orthogonal
    lines from each node will intersect at two points at a minimum. Rendezvous points
    can be formed to forward a packet. To achieve this, they need both a proactive
    element and a reactive element. The proactive element constructs the rendezvous-to-destination
    path. Each node then sends announcement packets to its neighbors in all four orthogonal
    directions. When the neighbors receive announcement packets, they put them into
    a routing table as a destination-next-hop pair and forward that packet out in
    the opposite direction from which it was received. The reactive element builds
    the source-to-rendezvous path. In order to build the path from a source to a rendezvous
    node on-demand, a reactive element is needed. When the routing request packet
    arrives at a rendezvous node, the node replies with that packet. When the source
    node receives the reply packet, it generates a destination-next hop routing entry.
    After making a destination-next-hop routing entry, the source node can forward
    a packet. Dai et al. [29] proposed a novel routing protocol based on the traditional
    source routing protocol in a cognitive radio network with directional antennas.
    To resolve the channel availability problem, they use boundary nodes, which are
    located at the boundary of the primary user (PU) that has a higher priority or
    legacy rights on the usage of a specific channel. The protocol’s scheme chooses
    the route with the minimum weighted length, which is measured by using counts.
    The number of channels on a link can show that the that link is inside the PU
    area. However, when boundaries are not detected, it can significantly affect the
    weighted length calculations of different routes. To overcome the missing boundary
    detection problem, this paper proposes the virtual boundary node scheme, which
    slightly increases the communication cost. Several papers have proposed the link
    scheduling scheme to resolve the problems of interference and transmission delays
    in multihop routing using directional antenna. Qiao et al. [30] proposed transmission
    scheduling for multihop transmission in 60 GHz wireless networks. A multihop concurrent
    transmission is capable of improving time slot utilization. He et al. [31] proposed
    a link scheduling scheme to address the issues of blockage and interference in
    60 GHz ad hoc networks. To consider both single-hop and multihop cases, the authors
    proposed scheduling algorithms that include a greedy algorithm and a column generation-based
    algorithm to resolve binary integer programming problems. Recently, there were
    some research works that adopted mmWave backhaul network in 5G networks [31],
    [18]–[23], [31]. They focus on link and channel scheduling to maximize spatial
    reuse, minimize the interference among relay nodes, and optimize flow control
    by adjusting the data rate. However, there is a limitation that the transmission
    delay between the end-to-end nodes is high since their technologies are simply
    aimed at optimizing link scheduling between one-hop links. Therefore, they are
    not applicable for multihop smart manufacturing system where real-time backhaul
    traffic requires efficient data delivery among backhaul IoT devices. In addition,
    it may result in high energy consumption at a specific EG, because traffic is
    concentrated at a link with a good channel environment. Owing to the merits of
    mmWave and directional routing, the backhaul routing scheme for smart manufacturing
    networks, which is proposed in this paper, has the following advantages. The proposed
    scheme provides suboptimal link scheduling results in real-time based on complex
    MWIS problem. The proposed scheme reduces the energy load consumed by EGs, thus
    ensuring transmission fairness between them. The proposed scheme minimizes the
    end-to-end transmission delay by assigning weights to heavy traffic links. As
    a result, the edge obtains a high priority by being allocated to a time slot.
    SECTION III. Preliminary Assumptions and System Model In this section, we introduce
    preliminary assumptions and our system model. Additionally, an interference model
    and the concept of the conflict-deafness graph are discussed. A. Wireless Backhaul
    Networks System Models In the proposed scheme, we consider that our wireless backhaul
    system model supports multihop communication among EGs, ES, and a backhaul network
    in a smart manufacturing environment. We also assume that all the EGs and the
    ES are equipped with switched beam directional antennas. An ME communicates to
    an EG by transmitting a communication request frame to the EG, which is located
    near the ME. Each EG collects the wireless backhaul traffic from MEs and forwards
    this traffic to the ES utilizing its directional antenna. As the backhaul traffic
    reaches the ES, it forwards this traffic to the core network. We further assume
    that the wireless backhaul network supports multihop communication between EGs.
    Therefore, each EG can build a mesh topology and perform multihop communication
    with other EGs except the ES. As shown in Fig. 1, each ME is associated to an
    EG. All EGs are also linked to their neighboring EG. The ES is connected to the
    cloud network via wired backhaul and forwards the backhaul traffic to the EGs
    by utilizing its directional antenna. Commonly, directional antennas are classified
    into two types based on the technique they employ: 1) switched beam antenna [24]
    and 2) phase array antenna [25]. In this paper, we chose to use a switched beam
    antenna, which has been adopted widely in various researches as a wireless backhaul
    network. We assume that all the EGs consist of the same number of antenna beams,
    denoted by M . All the beams are nonoverlapping in order to cover all directions
    and have the same transmission coverage area and transmitted power. However, when
    an EG transmits wireless traffic, only one beam operates at that time to direct
    the transmitted traffic to the intended recipient while the other beams are blocked
    due to the utilization of a single channel. The recipient EG that receives the
    wireless backhaul traffic adjusts its directional beam toward the EG that has
    requested to communicate. In order to transmit wireless backhaul traffic, an EG
    requires information about its neighboring EGs including the beam ID, beam direction,
    and channel weight. Information about the neighboring EGs is periodically collected
    through a cooperation channel (e.g., ISM bands) via a hello message and the obtained
    information is saved in the EG’s beam table [34]. We modeled our wireless backhaul
    network by a directed graph G=(N,E) , where N represents the set of all EGs and
    E is the set of all directional edges. The wireless backhaul network consists
    of a set F of data flows and a set K of orthogonal channels. When an EG ( n 1
    ) sends wireless backhaul traffic to another EG ( n 2 ), it is denoted by a directed
    edge e=( n 1 , n 2 ) in G . The set of EGs is represented by N={ n 1 , n 2 ,…,
    n α } , where α denotes the number of EGs in a wireless backhaul, and each n i
    have some edges, denoted by e . The set of edges is represented by E={ e 1 , e
    2 ,…, e β } , where β denotes the number of edges on the wireless backhaul. We
    also defined N(n) as a set of neighboring nodes of node n , which are located
    within the transmission range of node n . In addition, we were able to derive
    the channel capacity r e of edge e as follows [30]:  r e =W log 2 ⎛ ⎝ 1+ P T G
    T G R ( λ 4πd ) 2 N 0 W+I ⎞ ⎠ (1) View Source where W is the channel bandwidth
    of the wireless backhaul, N 0 is the noise power spectral density, I is the wireless
    backhaul interference, P T is the EG’s transmitted power, and G T and G R are
    the directional beam gains of the transmitter EG and receiver EG, respectively,
    λ is the wavelength of the directional beam, and d denotes the distance between
    the transmitter EG and receiver EG. B. Interference Model In our proposed scheme,
    the ES and all the EGs are equipped with directional antennas. As shown in Fig.
    2, there is an ES along with five EGs, denoted by n 0 through n i , respectively.
    The sets N={ n 1 , n 2 ,…, n 5 } and E={ e 1 , e 2 ,…, e 10 } demonstrate the
    number of EGs ( α ) being five and the number of edges ( β ) being ten. The EGs
    are equipped with a directional antenna that consists of four indices. If n 1
    wants to send traffic to n 5 , n 2 , and n 4 cannot communicate because its target
    beam is blocked. However, when n 1 sends wireless backhaul traffic to n 5 , one
    of the other EGs can attempt to communicate through e 1 and e 6 . Consequently,
    some EGs can simultaneously transmit traffic using the directional antenna while
    all the beams are not blocked. For example, e 1 and e 4 can simultaneously execute
    their communication without interference. As the EG and its edge depend on a near
    beam environment, beam and channel scheduling is necessary for fair communication.
    Fig. 2. Example of smart manufacturing system backhaul network. Show All C. Conflict/Deafness
    Graphs In the proposed scheme, all of the EGs in the wireless backhaul are fixed
    and periodically exchange their own information using a hello message to build
    a mesh network topology. The hello messages include information such as EG location,
    data rate, and beam index, and they are delivered through an omni-directional
    antenna. After receiving the latest hello message, an EG updates itself with the
    provided information. The ES can obtain information of all the EGs because all
    the EGs send wireless backhaul traffic to the ES in order to access the core network.
    Therefore, the ES maintains a conflict/deafness graph that determines whether
    different links interfere/deafness to each other. As shown in Table II, some of
    the edges cannot be scheduled simultaneously. For example, when e 6 , which is
    connected between n 3 and n 4 , is scheduled, e 1 or e 4 can be scheduled at the
    same time. However, e 2 cannot be scheduled simultaneously with any other edges
    because e 2 causes interference to the other EGs, except for e 8 and e 10 . This
    conflict graph ( C ) is defined as c j i = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 1, 0, −1,  if  e i  and  e j  cannot
    be scheduled simultaneously  if  e i  and  e j  can be scheduled simultaneously  otherwise.
    (2) View Source TABLE II Example of Conflict and Deafness Graphs Integration Similar
    to the conflict graph, the ES maintains a deafness graph, which determines whether
    the deafness problem arises when different links are scheduled simultaneously.
    The deafness graph ( F ) is defined as f j i = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 1, 0, −1,  if the deafness
    problem occurs  if the deafness problem does not occur  otherwise. (3) View Source
    SECTION IV. Link Scheduling Algorithm Based on Transmission Fairness In this section,
    we formulate the objective function for wireless backhaul networks in the form
    of an MWIS problem and propose our link scheduling algorithm to solve the MWIS
    problem. A. Problem Formulation In the proposed scheme, we assume that the ES
    is responsible for scheduling the wireless backhaul network links because it has
    information of all the EGs and all the EGs communicate with one another under
    the control of the ES [32]. Preferentially, we denoted the set of edges’ weights
    by W={ w 1 , w 2 ,…, w β } , where β is the number of edges on a wireless backhaul.
    Then, the weight of edge e at the time slot t , w e (t) , is given by w e (t)=
    r e (t)⋅ Q e (t) (4) View Source where Q e (t) is the sum of the backlog size
    at edge e , and r e (t) denotes the achievable rate of link e at time slot t defined
    by (1). The definition of weights is associated with the instantaneous queue backlog
    sizes that vary over time t . Therefore, this definition is different from that
    of the transmission throughput, which is by definition a time-averaged quantity.
    The queue backlog size at edge e , evolves according to Q e (t)=max[0, Q e (t)−
    μ e (t)]+ λ e (t) (5) View Source where μ e (t) and λ e (t) denote the number
    of bits leaving the queue of e and the number of bits added to the queue of e
    , respectively. Additionally, we assume that all time slots t∈T that occupy a
    channel have the same length, where T is the set of time slots. Conceptually,
    the objective of our proposed scheduling algorithm is to find the set of links,
    channel, data rate, and routing flow that maximize the sum of weights over all
    possible independent sets. Therefore, the objective function was designed to find
    a set of links that maximizes the weight as follows: maximize ∑ f∈F ∑ k∈K ∑ t∈T
    w k e (t)⋅ t k e (6) View Source where t k e is an indicator variable and it can
    be expressed in two cases t k e ={ 1, 0, if  e i  can be scheduled on time slot
    t otherwise. (7) View Source However, the problem of finding a link set that simply
    maximizes the weight is not feasible in a smart manufacturing system; therefore,
    we can consider the following constraints: deafness management, collision management,
    and flow conservation. The following are the constraints for backhaul routing.
    1) Flow Conservation Constraint: Each flow f is transmitted at a particular data
    rate on link e during timeslot t along multiple paths from a source node, s(f)
    , to a destination node d(f) . We denote a directional link from node n to node
    m as → mn . Then, the following flow conservation constraint is given by: ∑ m∈N(n)
    d f → nm − ∑ m∈N(n) d f → mn = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ d f , − d f , 0, if n=s(f) if n=d(f) otherwise
    (8) View Source where d f denotes the average data rate of flow f . 2) Link Capacity
    Constraint: Since the average data rate over each directional link cannot exceed
    the average capacity over the directional link, we have the following constraint:
    ∑ f∈F d f → nm ≤ ∑ k∈K ∑ t∈T t k → nm ⋅ r k → nm T . (9) View Source 3) Channel
    Match Constraint: The two nodes n and m must communicate over the same channel.
    Therefore, we define a k → nm as a channel assignment indicator that indicates
    whether channel k is assigned to the directional link → nm or not, i.e., a k →
    nm ={ 1, 0, if channel k is assigned to link  → nm otherwise. (10) View Source
    From (10), we were able to derive a k → nm = a k → mn ∀n∈N;m∈N;∀k∈K. (11) View
    Source 4) Channel Constraint: In the case of multiple allocations of different
    pairs of directional links over the same channel, multiple channels can be assigned
    to the link. However, if the same channel is assigned to more than two pairs of
    directional antennas onto a single link, interference occurs between transmissions
    from other pairs of directional antennas. To solve this problem, different orthogonal
    channels should be assigned to the pairs of directional antennas allocated onto
    the same link. Therefore, the number of channels assigned to a directional link
    must be equal to the number of pairs of directional antennas allocated to the
    directional link ∑ m∈N(n) ∑ k∈K a k → nm ≤M∀n∈N;∀m∈N;∀k∈K (12) View Source where
    M denotes the number of antennas. In addition, if a node n either transmits data
    to node m through its outgoing directional link on channel k or receives data
    from node m through its incoming directional link on channel k , then channel
    k should be allocated to link → nm . Hence, we define the following constraint:
    a k → nm ≥ ∑ t∈T ( t k → nm + t k → mn ) T ∀n∈N;∀m∈N;∀k∈K. (13) View Source 5)
    Transmission Interference Constraint: A node cannot receive data simultaneously
    through multiple incoming directional links on the same channel. Therefore, in
    order to avoid collision/deafness among transmission nodes and ensure a feasible
    link scheduling scheme, we define the following feasible scheduling constraint:

    edges for e . If c e ′ e + f e ′ e ≥1 , e ′ is included in N(e) . 6) Transmission
    Fairness Constraint: Each node consumes energy whenever it receives/transmits
    data. In a smart manufacturing environment, the amount of remaining energy in
    each EG is important for efficient communication and to send real-time data back
    and forth. Therefore, a fairness constraint ascertains a chance for every EG to
    transmit evenly and equalizes energy consumption among EGs fairly [33]. We used
    the Jain’s Fairness Index to set the following constraint: ( ∑ t∈T ∑ e∈E w k e
    (t)⋅ t k e ) 2 β⋅ ∑ t∈T ∑ e∈E ( w k e (t)⋅ t k e ) 2 ≥τ∀t∈T (15) View Source where
    τ denotes fairness threshold. 7) Objective Function: From (8) to (15), we can
    design an objective function, the details of which are provided in the Appendix.
    B. Centralized Link Scheduling Problem The objective function (16) is complex
    and requires a considerable amount of time to be solved, using various solvers.
    Therefore, to reduce the scale of the problem, we assumed a single channel environment
    and the amount of data transmitted in a time slot cannot exceed the channel capacity.
    Thus, we were able to eliminate flow conservation, link capacity, and channel
    match constraints and obtain a reduced objective function as a pure MWIS problem.
    For solving an MWIS problem, various heuristic and approximation algorithms have
    been proposed, since MWIS is a well known nondeterministic polynomial-time hardness
    problem. In this section, we describe our proposed heuristic algorithm. In the
    proposed scheme, scheduling links are computed in real-time by the ES and delivered
    to all EGs via a control channel. In addition, each EG reports its queue backlog
    size to the ES at regular intervals through the control channel. In this paper,
    we assume an underlay control channel that uses some of the frequencies of each
    channel [28]. Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo code of our proposed routing scheme.
    First, the EG with the largest number of neighbor EGs is found (line 5). If there
    are more than two EGs found, the algorithm selects the EG with a lower number
    of connected links of EGs; otherwise, it selects the EG randomly (lines 6–11).
    The edge with the highest weight connected to the selected EG is scheduled first
    and all the edges are assigned a time slot in this way (lines 14–22). When all
    the edges of the selected EG are scheduled, the corresponding EG is removed from
    the candidates list and the process continues until the edges of all the EGs are
    scheduled. In particular, in the process of scheduling other edges, the algorithm
    finds the time slot that maximizes spatial reuse and allocates it. Once all edges
    are scheduled, we measure the fairness between EGs using Jain’s fairness index.
    If constraint (27) is not satisfied, we find the edge with the lowest weight and
    continue scheduling (lines 24–27). The proposed heuristic algorithm handles complicated
    MWIS problems efficiently and provides backhaul routing link scheduling results
    in a short amount of time. This is well suited for a smart manufacturing network
    system to process commands and to monitor the state of the ME in real-time. Algorithm

    while To assess the performance of the heuristic algorithm in terms of complexity,
    the computational complexity of each phase was analyzed as follows: for the phase
    of scheduling, target EG searching is used in this paper, and it requires \mathbf
    {N} comparisons for the finding target EG that has the maximum number of neighboring
    nodes. However, in the worst case, \mathbf {N} nodes can have the same number
    of neighboring nodes. Therefore, it requires additional \mathbf {N} comparisons
    for lines 6–10, and the scheduling algorithm is quadratic with regard to the size
    of \mathbf {N} . Finally, the entire algorithm takes the computational complexity
    as O(\mathbf {N}^{2}) . SECTION V. Performance Evaluation In this section, we
    discuss the simulation results to verify our link scheduling algorithm based on
    a greedy approach. The proposed algorithm was implemented by using an OPNET simulator.
    In our simulation, we focused on the result of the aggregate network throughput,
    delay, packet loss rate, and fairness. In order to perform the simulation, we
    assumed that the wireless backhaul network topology was built according to Fig.
    2. The detailed configuration of the simulation parameters is shown in Table III.
    In addition, we have used the simulation parameters in [35] in terms of path loss
    model, radiation pattern, and modulation. Moreover, in our simulation we assumed
    that all the EGs have already obtained their routing information and set the scheduling
    delay to 10 ms. In addition, the routing information was implemented by a matrix
    in our simulator. TABLE III Simulation Parameters for Directional Routing To measure
    the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we evaluated the following performance
    metrics. Total Backhaul Network Throughput (Gb/s): Total data traffic transferred
    successfully from all EGs to the ES divided by time. Average Delay (ms): Average
    delay time between source and destination. Packet Loss Rate (%): The number of
    lost packets divided by the total number of transferred packet. Jain’s Fairness
    Index [36]: The square of the average of x_{i} divided by the average of x_{i}^{2}
    , where N denotes the number of EGs and x_{i} is the number of times that EG i
    (or gateway i ) has been assigned time slots (15)\begin{equation*} J\left ({x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{N}}\right)
    = \frac {\left ({\sum _{i=1}^{N} x_{i} }\right)^{2}}{N \sum _{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}}.\end{equation*}
    View Source Fig. 3 shows the graph of backhaul network throughput versus normalized
    traffic load. For example, a traffic load of two means that the incoming traffic
    requires an aggregate rate at each EG in the backhaul system to have twice the
    average capacity of a single link. The throughput of all the employed schemes
    grew rapidly with an increase in traffic load. In particular, the brute-force
    approach had the highest increase amongst all the schemes; it achieved more than
    27% of that achieved by the proposed scheme (\tau = 0.9 ) at a heavy traffic load.
    However, the brute-force approach is not scalable when a large number of nodes
    are deployed. The DSR-based backhaul routing scheme showed the lowest performance
    due to the overhead required for setting the routing path. Although the spatial
    division multiple access (SDMA)-based resource management scheme for 5G [23] optimizes
    the link scheduling, the aggregate throughput is lower than that of our proposed
    scheme. This is because, SDMA-based resource management scheme optimizes the link
    scheduling that only considers the one-hop link. Thus, the frame may be lost at
    the intermediate GW and the end-to-end delay may increase. Interestingly, we found
    that the best performance of our proposed algorithm was at higher \tau . This
    means that the fairness of transmission between high links increases end-to-end
    throughput. Fig. 3. Backhaul network throughput versus normalized traffic load.
    Show All In Fig. 4, the average delay of the proposed scheme and the DSR-based
    scheme increases rapidly at traffic loads of 2 and 0.5, respectively. We conducted
    further explorations of the delay performance at higher traffic loads and found
    that the delay of the proposed scheme (\tau =0.9 ) increased slowly when the traffic
    load was 3.5. In the proposed schemes with low fairness constraint (\tau =0.5
    and \tau =0.7 ), the average delay increases when the traffic load = 2. This is
    because of unbalanced link scheduling, which causes packets to be discarded. In
    the DSR-based scheme, the node suffers from signaling overhead as it must find
    the routing path. As a result, the network delay increases. In addition, since
    the radio resource management scheme for 5G performs link scheduling for one hop,
    a bottleneck occurs in the intermediate GW, thereby exhibiting a high delay. Fig.
    4. Average delay versus normalized traffic load. Show All The trend of the curves
    of the packet loss rate performance, shown in Fig. 5, is similar to that of the
    delay performance. It should be noted that the proposed scheme (\tau =0.9 ) achieved
    almost zero packet loss even at a heavy traffic load of four, whereas more than
    63% and 30% of packets were discarded for the DSR-based scheme and the proposed
    schemes with low fairness constraint (\tau =0.5 and \tau =0.7 ), respectively.
    Fig. 5. Packet loss rate versus normalized traffic load. Show All Table IV shows
    the Jain’s fairness index when the traffic load is 5. As can be seen from the
    table, all of the proposed schemes almost satisfy the requirement of the fairness
    constraint. The brute-force approach achieves the highest score of 0.9341. This
    result means that the optimal value for \tau is 0.9341 in this scenario. TABLE
    IV Jain’s Fairness Index (Traffic Load = 5; EG = 5; ES = 1) Figs. 6 and 7 show
    the throughput and delay results when 100 GWs are deployed on a 1 km \times 1
    km topology (more stressful environment), respectively. As shown in the figure,
    the network throughput is similar to that of the previous result, and it can be
    confirmed that the throughput is saturated as the traffic increases for all of
    the schemes. In the case of delay, it can be confirmed that it has increased overall.
    However, we observed that delay of the proposed scheme is within 300 ms, which
    is the target end-to-end delay time proposed by EdgeX Foundry [11]. Therefore,
    the proposed scheme is suitable for real-time data processing in smart manufacturing
    systems. Fig. 6. Backhaul network throughput versus normalized traffic load in
    large scale networks. Show All Fig. 7. Average delay versus normalized traffic
    load in large scale networks. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In an edge computing-based
    smart manufacturing system, various IoT devices generate, process, and exchange
    large volumes of real-time sensory information and control data over an industrial
    IoT network. This real-time large-scale data needs to be efficiently routed over
    a smart industrial IoT network in order to be processed at the destination in
    real-time. In this paper, we have proposed a directional routing link scheduling
    scheme that efficiently schedules backhaul traffic over directional links established
    between EGs. The proposed directional routing scheme is based on the MWIS principle
    and tries to reduce transmission delay and energy consumption through transmission
    fairness among EGs. The proposed algorithm calculates suboptimal link scheduling
    results in real-time and reduces the end-to-end delay by ensuring transmission
    fairness and throughput among the directional links. Simulation results showed
    that our proposed scheme outperformed existing mmWave routing schemes in terms
    of throughput, delay, packet loss rate, and transmission fairness. However, the
    algorithm gave suboptimal results in a small-scale smart manufacturing system
    (less than 10 EGs). As the network grows, the results are still questionable.
    Therefore, in our future research, we intend to validate our proposed solution
    in a real industrial environment, analyze how many devices are acceptable in smart
    manufacturing system, and obtain an optimal link scheduling algorithm by applying
    the message passing technique, which can solve the MWIS problem effectively in
    a short time. In addition, since the proposed method is operated in a centralized
    manner, its scalability is low. Therefore, we intend to design a routing protocol
    that operates in a fully distributed manner by applying the concept of game theory.

  title: Directional Link Scheduling for Real-Time Data Processing in Smart Manufacturing
    System
  verbatim_quote1: In a smart manufacturing system, various IoT-based manufacturing
    equipment (ME) generate, process, and exchange large-scale sensory information
    and control data over the industrial IoT network with context awareness [2]–[4].
    This accumulated data requires a larger bandwidth and efficiently reconfigurable
    routing protocols to link the networked IoT devices for real-time processing [5].
  verbatim_quote2: Currently, there are a number of standards for wireless industrial
    communications, such as WirelessHart, ZigBee, ISA 100, and WiFi. The existing
    industrial wireless systems provide relatively low data rates for sensor information
    and traffic control [6].
  verbatim_quote3: This type of technology can be used in the last mile of a wireless
    sensor network, especially for mobile ME in a smart manufacturing system.

    \ in the mode of living with a transition from rural\nliving to a growing urban\
    \ population [1]. In 1800, approximately 3% of the world’s human population\n\
    lived in urban areas. However, by 1900, the urban proportion rose to approximately\
    \ 14% and by\n2008 the urban proportion was approximately 50% [1]. The United\
    \ Nations predict that on a global\nbasis the urban population will reach 61%\
    \ by 2030 and will eventually reach a “dynamic equilibrium\nof approximately 80%\
    \ urban to 20% rural dwellers that will persist for the foreseeable future” [1].\n\
    This transition presents a number of challenges which include many socio-economic,\
    \ demographic,\neconomic, cultural, and environmental considerations [1].\nThe\
    \ literature provides abundant examples of research into these challenges; however,\
    \ the growth\nof urban environments presents signiﬁcant problems for authorities\
    \ in the effective provision\nof emergency services.\nSuch services range from\
    \ the ability of police, fire, and healthcare\n(e.g., an ambulance) to reach emergencies\
    \ promptly to the provision of rescue and recovery in disaster\n(environmental\
    \ and terrorist) scenarios. A primary concern for authorities tasked with the\
    \ provision of\nemergency services is the ability to travel in urban areas efﬁciently,\
    \ this is an area that has received\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910; doi:10.3390/app9183910\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n2 of 23\nless attention\
    \ in the literature. In considering the disasters scenarios human intervention\
    \ may be\nimpractical or even dangerous. In such cases robotic systems may be\
    \ employed; rescue robotics are\ndesigned to enable emergency responders [and\
    \ other stakeholders] to “sense and act at a distance from\nthe site of a disaster\
    \ or extreme incident” [2].\nTraversing a dynamic urban environment for emergency\
    \ service provision demands the\nidentiﬁcation of potential paths (routes) and\
    \ the selection of the optimal routes. Such routes will\nbe characterised by a\
    \ number of factors including: (a) congestion on the road network, to (b) blocked\n\
    routes in emergency disaster scenarios. In this paper introduce a novel approach\
    \ which is designed\nto achieve autonomous emergency service vehicle (or robotic\
    \ systems) control; the aim is to match\nthe control with emergency response strategies\
    \ using group decision making implemented in smart\ndynamic urban environments.\n\
    The proposed model utilises a novel path planning method using a self-organizing\
    \ map\n(SOM) in an integrated Spiral STC algorithm termed the: Hybrid SOM-Spiral\
    \ STC (HSSTC) model.\nThe model enables autonomous vehicle control using hedge\
    \ algebras and Kansei evaluation in group\ndecision-support. The proposed model\
    \ is designed to quantify qualitative factors using sensor data\nprocessed with\
    \ human sensibilities and preferences [using linguistics and semantics] in emergency\n\
    scenario decision support. The experimental results show that the proposed model\
    \ achieves a\nsigniﬁcant improvement in group decision-support under dynamic uncertainty.\
    \ We posit that our\nnovel approach holds the prospect of improvements in the\
    \ provision of emergency services.\nThe remainder paper is structured as follows:\
    \ Section 2 provides an overview of the problem\nwith the proposed contribution.\
    \ A review of related research is set out with a summary in Section 3.\nWe consider\
    \ situational awareness and pervasive conciousness in Section 4 with smart environments\n\
    addressed in Section 4.1. The fog computing paradigm is introduced in Section\
    \ 4.2. In Section 5 we\nconsider materials and methods where we address the problem\
    \ formation in Section 5.1 with the\nproposed system set out in Section 6 and\
    \ emergency strategies quantiﬁed using self organising maps\nintroduced in Section\
    \ 6. Section 9 presents the results with a discussion with consideration of future\n\
    directions for research. The paper closes with Section 10 where we set out concluding\
    \ observations.\n2. Problem Statement\nIn Section 1 we have introduced the paradigm\
    \ shift in urban living which has resulted in\nenlargement of urban centres with\
    \ vastly increased congestion which is an important element in\nthe provision\
    \ of efﬁcient and timely emergency response. Emergency response systems require\n\
    effective route planning (in robotics this may be viewed from the perspective\
    \ of “path planning” [3–5])\nwhich must implement avoidance of obstacles (static\
    \ and moving) to achieve the optimal path in\ntraversing the deﬁned operational\
    \ environment (DOE).\nAn emergency may be manifested as: (a) a disaster (e.g.,\
    \ an environmental or terrorist) scenario\nin which an autonomous robot (or an\
    \ autonomous service vehicle) must navigate the DOE, or (b)\nan emergency response\
    \ scenario (e.g., a ﬁre of health emergency) scenario in which emergency\nresponse\
    \ vehicles must be capable of identifying the optimal (i.e., quickest) route to\
    \ the emergency.\nBoth scenarios require intelligent decision-support systems\
    \ (DSS) to plan the optimal (or available)\nroutes to the scene of the emergency\
    \ incident.\nFor DSS in uncertain environments, the focus must be on knowledge-based\
    \ decisions using both\ntacit and explicit knowledge. Decisions are generally\
    \ made using a ‘qualitative approach’ to express\nparameters and preferences [of\
    \ decision makers] with the aim of determining the optimal decision from\na range\
    \ of alternative options. Decision makers’ preferences in emergency and disaster\
    \ management\nmay be realised using linguistics and semantics (using Kansei evaluation\
    \ with hedge algebras) in\ntarget-oriented decision making in ‘real time’.\nIn\
    \ this paper we propose an approach designed to quantify qualitative factors using\

    \ in emergency.\nThis addresses a disaster recovery and planning for disaster\
    \ management.\nOur contribution lies in the development of an intelligent decision-support\
    \ system for autonomic\npath-planning under dynamic uncertainty.\n3. Related Research\n\
    There is a large body of research addressing disaster recovery and planning for\
    \ disaster\nmanagement, for example see [8–12].\nComfort in [8] considers risk\
    \ and security as it relates to disaster management. DSS have presented\ninformation\
    \ and knowledge in many differing formats to stakeholders to enable effective\
    \ decisions in\ndisaster scenarios [13]. In [12] Comfort addresses crisis management;\
    \ with hindsight she considers\ncognition, communication, coordination, and control.\
    \ Going further, in [10] Comfort investigates\ncomplex systems in crisis situations\
    \ and considers anticipation and resilience in dynamic environments.\nEiser et\
    \ al. in [9] proposes a conceptual framework for response to natural hazards and\
    \ considers\nthe framework in the light of risk interpretation and action. Kwan\
    \ et al. in [11] discusses a practical\napplication of ‘real-time’ disaster recovery\
    \ in presenting an analysis of the emergency response\nfollowing the New York\
    \ 9/11 disaster. Kwan et al. investigate the potential of real-time disaster.\n\
    Jooho et al. [14] have proposed a framework for geographic information systems\
    \ (GIS) with\nan investigation into their capability to implement a rapid emergency\
    \ response in micro-spatial\nenvironments. Khan et al. in [15] proposed a warning\
    \ ﬁre detection system using Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) surveillance\
    \ for effective disaster management using cameras based on\ncognitive radio networks\
    \ to enable reliable data dissemination.\nSummary\nIn considering the related\
    \ research, the studies identiﬁed are limited in terms of ‘real-time’\ndisaster\
    \ service response.\nAn analysis of the studies clearly identifies the need for\
    \ a rapid,\nand importantly, a planned and organised approach to enable effective\
    \ and timely decisions to\nbe made in ‘real-time’. However, all the research identiﬁed\
    \ all approach disaster management and\nresponse from a different perspective.\n\
    A survey of data management and analysis in disaster situations [16] has identiﬁed\
    \ that\ndisaster management has received increasing attention by computer scientists\
    \ from multiple research\ndisciplines. The focus of such research has been the\
    \ drive to devise ways to manage and analyse the data\nproduced in disaster management\
    \ situations. A limitation in the current methods considered include:\n(a) they\
    \ are applied in speciﬁc disaster scenarios with no optimal route identiﬁcation\
    \ or coordination\nwith control services, (b) the methods have failed to consider\
    \ or aggregate expert [human] sensibilities\nand preferences, weather inﬂuences,\
    \ environmental phenomena, and real-time data sets.\nIn this paper we attempt\
    \ to address these limitation by introducing our novel approach which\nimplements\
    \ intelligent autonomous decision-support using hedge algebras integrated with\
    \ Kansei\nengineering evaluation. The proposed approach has been conceived to\
    \ implement autonomous path\nplanning and control of robotic systems applied in\
    \ emergency scenarios.\n4. Pervasive Conciousness and Smart Environments\nIn considering\
    \ autonomous resources (e.g., robotics and emergency service vehicles) such\n\
    resources must be aware of their ‘world’ (the DOE). As such, autonomous resources\
    \ may be analogous\nto humans. When navigating their ‘world’ [17] humans are context-aware\
    \ [18] and possess pervasive\nconciousness (PC), this manifests itself in terms\
    \ of an awareness of their surroundings including the\nconstant (dynamic) change\
    \ and its affect on their choices and decisions [19]. The goal of intelligent\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n4 of 23\nautonomic DSS is to model the human ability\
    \ to perceive their world [the DOE] and act according to\nthe dynamic change;\
    \ this manifests itself as machine conciousness.\nPaul Weiser in the seminal paper\
    \ [20] argued that: “The most profound technologies are those\nthat disappear.\
    \ They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable\
    \ from it”.\nThe vision espoused by Weiser arguably forms the foundation for context-awareness\
    \ which is generally\nimplemented in pervasive systems; autonomous resource operation\
    \ will operate in pervasive systems\noften in smart environments (SE) (we defer\
    \ consideration of SE to Section 4.1). SE are characterised by\nnetworked sensor-based\
    \ systems which are, by their very nature, invisible to the general public and\n\
    are therefore pervasive systems.\nPC is closely related to situational awareness\
    \ (SA). In considering the nature of PC and SA,\nan interesting model of SA is\
    \ proposed by Endsley in [21]. Endsley and Garland in [22] have observed\nthat\
    \ SA may be viewed as: “knowing what is going on around you”. Going further, Endsley\
    \ notes that SA\n(and therefore PC):\n“requires a much more advanced level of\
    \ situation understanding and a projection of future system\nstates in the light\
    \ of the operator’s pertinent goals. As such, situational awareness presents a\
    \ level of\nfocus that goes beyond traditional information processing approaches\
    \ in attempting to explain human\nbehaviour in operating complex systems”\nWhile\
    \ this deﬁnition relates to humans, there is a clear correlation with computerised\
    \ systems\n[including autonomous path planning for autonomous context-aware DSS]\
    \ which include machine\nconciousness. To realise shared goals, agents (both human\
    \ and computer) must share a common\nconceptual model [23] which is a shared understanding\
    \ of the relevant task related processes and goals.\nFor an excellent discussion\
    \ on conceptual models as they relate to product design see [24].\nEndsley and\
    \ Garland in [22] refer to such models as mental (or cognitive) models. For computer\n\
    systems, we may view mental models in terms of computer modelling, however in\
    \ practice both\nmental and computer models are types of cognitive model [18,23,25].\n\
    PC, as it relates to the topic considered in this paper, addresses the requirement\
    \ for awareness\nof the multi-faceted sources of information [which may include\
    \ raw sensor data and social media\nsources] that describe the dynamically changing\
    \ context that exists in ‘real-world’ environments [21,22].\nFor example, the\
    \ monitoring of social media may provide early warning of a major incident to\
    \ warn\nthe emergency services of the need for implementation of a ‘major incident’\
    \ plan [26].\nAutonomous computerised systems (including robotic systems and emergency\
    \ service vehicles)\nmust possess PC in order to correctly perceive their ‘world’\
    \ (the DOE) which may be a SE as discussed\nin the following section.\n4.1. Smart\
    \ Environments\nWe have introduced PC which function on the basis of ‘relevant’\
    \ contextual information [27].\nThe important aspect of contextual information\
    \ is ‘relevance’ and the avoidance of ‘irrelevant’\ninformation which merely increases\
    \ complexity. n considering Information Systems (IS) and Information\nSystem Design\
    \ Checkland and Holwell [28] introduced the concept of “CAPTA’ which is a concept\
    \ in\nwhich a range of data which will be processed into useful information (or\
    \ CAPTA).\nThe CAPTA process introduces an intermediate stage data processing\
    \ where relevant data is\nselected and processed into information useful to meet\
    \ domain speciﬁc requirements. We have\ninvestigated the relationships between\
    \ data, relevance, and information as it relates to contextual\ninformation in\
    \ [17]; Figure 1 presents a conceptual model illustrating the progression of data\
    \ processing\nfrom the raw data to wisdom (rational decision-support). Shown is\
    \ the intermediate stage where an\ninitial selection of relevant and useful raw\
    \ data (termed CAPTA is used.\nIn this section we consider the nature of ‘smart-environments’\
    \ which generally refer to two types\nof environment: (a) ‘smart-homes’, and (b)\
    \ ‘smart cities’. In this paper the focus is on ‘smart-cities’.\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 3910\n5 of 23\nFigure 1. A conceptual model illustrating the progression\
    \ of data processing from the raw data to\nwisdom (rational decision-support)\
    \ (source: [17]).\nSmart-Cities\nThe concept of a ‘smart-city’ is difﬁcult to\
    \ deﬁne as there are many interpretations with no\ncommon generally agreed deﬁnition.\
    \ Deakin and Al Wear [29] deﬁne the smart city as: “one that\nutilises information\
    \ and communication technologies (ICT) to meet the demands of the market\n(i.e.,\
    \ the stakeholders in a city environment)” and “implements ICT to positively impact\
    \ the local\ncommunity”. From this deﬁnition we may conclude that, while a commonly\
    \ agreed deﬁnition remains\nelusive, the overall goal of improving the environment\
    \ to the beneﬁt of the [usually urban] population\nis generally agreed.\nWhat\
    \ is generally agreed on are the constituent parts that combine to create a ‘smart-city’,\
    \ these\nbeing: an urban environment, the use and integration of ICT, and the\
    \ use of networked sensor-based\ntechnologies (including the Internet-of-things\
    \ (IoT) implemented using fog computing technologies)\nin complex networks to\
    \ extract raw data for processing. Moreover, a ‘smart-city’ provides a basis upon\n\
    which managers may interact with infrastructure systems to monitor, manage and\
    \ control a broad\nrange of urban systems which may range from trafﬁc management\
    \ to environmental monitoring and\nlaw enforcement. These monitoring functions\
    \ are implemented in ‘real-time’ with latent data analytics\nproviding reports\
    \ with historical information and future projections.\nIntelligent autonomous\
    \ computerised systems as considered in this paper, the goal is to enable\n(for\
    \ example a robot or emergency service vehicle to efﬁciently traverse a DOE by\
    \ the optimal route.\nEffective navigation of an urban environment requires the\
    \ processing of dynamic environmental\nknowledge. For humans this is generally\
    \ intuitive, but for machines this requires machine conciousness\nwhich may be\
    \ modelled on human cognitive processes. Achieving this requires the conceptualising\n\
    of ‘smart-environments’ with data, information, and knowledge and the related\
    \ processing in a\ndecision-support system. A feature of a PC is the prevalence\
    \ of sensors [30,31] which may be\nconsidered in terms of the IoT implemented\
    \ in the fog computing paradigm (also often termed\n‘edge’ computing) [32]. While\
    \ the terms ‘fog’ and ‘edge’ are often used interchangeably, there is a\nsubtle\
    \ difference as discussed in [32].\n4.2. The Fog Computing Paradigm\nIn practice\
    \ autonomous systems operate on selected sensor derived data processed into\n\
    information and knowledge [17]. The data will always be generated from a network\
    \ of sensors\nincluding the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and transmitted wirelessly,\
    \ the data being processed using the\nfog computing paradigm [32].\nFog computing\
    \ is closely related to cloud computing [32,33]. Cloud computing is a\nmultidisciplinary\
    \ ﬁeld which features the convergence of several independent computing technologies\n\
    and trends including: Internet and internet delivery, pay-as-you-go services,\
    \ utility computing,\nelasticity, virtualisation, grid computing, distributed\
    \ computing, storage, content outsourcing, security,\nand Web 2.0/Web 3.0 [34].\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n6 of 23\nThe multidisciplinary nature of cloud computing\
    \ has raised many open research questions\ndue to the modes(s) of implementation\
    \ given that the cloud computing paradigm incorporates\n“almost everything that\
    \ existing technologies already do” [34]. However, the cloud computing paradigm\n\
    was “not designed for very large volume, variety, and velocity of data generated\
    \ by the IoT” [32]. Accordingly,\nthere are signiﬁcant issues related to latency\
    \ [35] and “by the time the data reaches our cloud for analysis,\nthe opportunity\
    \ to make decisions may be lost” [32].\nThis issue represents a signiﬁcant problem\
    \ for ‘real-time’ data processing in DSS, low-latency\n‘real-time’ data processing\
    \ requiring the processing of data close to the source of the data [35].\nThe\
    \ investigation of fog computing paradigm provides a basis upon which this may\
    \ be realised;\nfor a detailed discussion see [35]. In considering the focus of\
    \ this paper, the fog computing paradigm as\nexpressed in our fog computing model\
    \ provides an effective controlled latency approach to provision\nof low-latency,\
    \ task speciﬁc, ‘real-time’ data processing in an emergency scenario.\n5. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nWe have considered the background to the study; we now turn to\
    \ the problem formulation,\nconsider Kansei words and hedge algebras with the\
    \ matrix construction for an emergency environment,\nconsider the Sufﬁx Tree Clustering\
    \ (STC) algorithm, and introduce the proposed integrated Spiral STC\nalgorithm\
    \ termed the: HSSTC algorithm.\n5.1. Problem Formulation and Matrix Construction\n\
    The principal issue in emergency response are the identiﬁcation of the optimal\
    \ path(s) (or route(s)\nto the location of the emergency; in extreme emergencies\
    \ the issue may extend to identifying available\npaths. Emergency response management\
    \ centres must be aware of the DOE and the current situation\nrelating to emergency\
    \ service resources. Additionally, emergency management centres must apply\nstrategic\
    \ management to manage dynamic ‘real-time’ emergency situations; such strategies\
    \ will involve\nthe deployment of resources and the optimal routing of the resources\
    \ matching the resources to the\nprevailing emergency as it develops ‘on-the-ground’.\n\
    We may formulate a conceptual emergency domain as follows:\n1.\nThe Hedge-Emergency-DSS:\
    \ the objective function is designed to maximise the operational efficiency\n\
    of the emergency management decision making when dealing with multiple emergencies;\n\
    2.\nLet XS = {XS\n1, XS\n2, . . . , XS\nm} be a set of adjectives called Kansei\
    \ words to consider available\nalternatives in evaluating an emergency situation\
    \ where m is the number of Kansei words;\n3.\nAssume that quantiﬁcation of human\
    \ sensibilities using in decision making can be presented in\nan emergency situation\
    \ domain S; Optimized Kansei words in XS are used to evaluate alternatives\nwhich\
    \ belong to the criteria and factors S;\n4.\nLet WS\nm = {W−\nm , W+\nm } be adjective\
    \ pairs of Kansei words belonging to XS\nm;\n5.\nLet P be decision makers’ input\
    \ the proposed system in S;\n6.\nIn evaluation of alternative XS\nj , its Kansei\
    \ weight wt\nij can be represented by the i-th Kansei word of\nthe j-th alternative\
    \ considered by the t-th decision maker.\n7.\nLet VS = {VS\n1 , VS\n2 , . . .\
    \ , VS\nh } be a set of transportation vehicles S, where h is the number of\n\
    emergency vehicles.\n8.\nLet quantitative semantics work in the mapping of (HA),\
    \ presented in linguistic values for\n\0wj\n\x01\nfall in the range [0,1].\n9.\n\
    Let a decision maker calculate an objective function value for\n\0Qj (X)\n\x01\
    \nin the emergency domain\n10.\nGroup Decision Making (GDM) is a solution for\
    \ two or more decision makers to aggregate their\npreferences. Let ES = {eS\n\
    1, eS\n2, . . . , eS\nq} be a set of experts for a selection of disaster strategies,\n\
    where q is the number of experts. Let GS = {gS\n1, gS\n2, . . . , gS\nc } be a\
    \ set of expert groups, where c is\nthe number of expert groups. Let pS\nt |(t\
    \ = 1, . . . , c) represent disaster strategies determined by an\nexpert eS\n\
    j .\n11.\nIn an emergency domain S, each expert may determine an approach that\
    \ matches the appropriate\nemergency management strategies based on the results\
    \ of Kansei evaluation.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n7 of 23\n12.\nTor identify\
    \ disaster strategies pS\nt , an expert eS\ni provides his/her preference in a\
    \ ﬁve-point scale\ndeﬁnition (0: oppose, 0.25: almost oppose, 0.5: have no preference,\
    \ 0.75: almost agree, 1: agree) to\nevaluate companies. We construct a Decision\
    \ matrix AS\nq×k = (aS\nij)(q×k), where k = l + m + g is the\ntotal number of\
    \ Kansei words, disaster quantitative and qualitative factors, and q is the number\n\
    of experts.\n5.2. Kansei words and Hedge Algebras in an Emergency Environment\n\
    In this section we address the use of Kansei words with hedge algebras and the\
    \ Kansei emergency\nmatrix. Consider ’real-world’ emergency response: when decision\
    \ makers evaluate alternative\napproaches (which are qualitative in nature) the\
    \ evaluation is generally expressed in linguistic\n(semantic) terms such as: “satisﬁed”,\
    \ “acceptable”, or “good”. These methodologies have been shown\nto solve the challenges\
    \ in the manipulation of linguistic information in decision-making problems.\n\
    However, these studies have failed to determined adjective pairs such as: Synonym–Antonym\
    \ and\nSynonym–Not Synonym. For example, pairs of adjectives such as: good-bad\
    \ and successful–unsuccessful\nare essential when used in decision making under\
    \ uncertain dynamic environments. Research has\nidentiﬁed situations in disaster\
    \ responses where quantiﬁcation of human sensibilities and perceptions\ntogether\
    \ with decision supports is systemic requirement.\nDecision makers’ preferences\
    \ on Kansei attributes in target-oriented decision analysis provides\na good description\
    \ of individual preferences. Additionally, the target-oriented decision analysis\
    \ has\nbeen used to quantify factors in terms of evaluating alternatives. Kansei\
    \ evaluation (KE) [7] is a\nsystematic determination of the signiﬁcance of decision\
    \ makers’ preferences when measured using\ncriteria and measured against a set\
    \ of Kansei attributes. Kansei evaluation is a commonly used method\nfor evaluation\
    \ to enable quantiﬁcation of impressions. Kansei is given by adjectives describing\
    \ human\nemotion, sensibility and impression [7].\nRepresentations of a linguistic\
    \ valued qualitative aggregation and human reasoning for\nmulti-criteria decision\
    \ making is useful when applied in DSS; for example see: Chen et al. [36] and\n\
    Liu et al. [37]. These studies have investigated linguistic valued logic based\
    \ approximate reasoning\nmethods for use in DSS; Chen et al. [36] and Liu et al.\
    \ [37] have reported success in resolving challenges\nand problems in perception-based\
    \ decision making.\nThe approach presented in this paper proposes an approach\
    \ which uses hedge algebra [6]\nintegrated with Kansei evaluation [7] to enable\
    \ context-matching [27,38] and address the limitations\nidentiﬁed in Chen et al.\
    \ [36] and Liu et al. [37]. Linguistic information involved in multi-criteria\n\
    decision problems in an emergency domain with a logic-based approximate reasoning\
    \ method has\nbeen developed by Chen et al. [36] to provide decision-support based\
    \ on information provided.\nTo evaluate potential factors and alternatives (inputs)\
    \ and Kansei words): we have used the range\n[0, .. . , 1] which is poset of a\
    \ Hedge algebra. For example, we can consider the set of all possible truth\n\
    values: where T = true, false, very true, very false, approximately true, possibly\
    \ true, approximately true\nor possibly true, approximately true and possibly\
    \ true, ... These scales are used in the logic reasoning\nbased decision making\
    \ that is capable of handling both totally ordered and partially ordered linguistic\n\
    information directly without numerical approximation.\nThe purpose of Kansei emergency\
    \ matrix construction is to quantify Kansei, emergency (disaster)\ndata sets,\
    \ together with expert preferences for emergency response, represented as fuzzy\
    \ weight\nvalues [0, 1]. The matrix is visualized by a SOM for training to ﬁnd\
    \ emergency vehicles, together with\nexpert’s sensibilities and preferences applied\
    \ in matching resource allocation and path planning with\nappropriate emergency\
    \ management strategies.\n5.3. The Spiral STC Algorithm in an Emergency Environment\n\
    In the Spiral STC (STC) on-line algorithm, a vehicle applies using coverage path\
    \ algorithm relating\nto information in an emergency domain.\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 3910\n8 of 23\nSTC on-line Algorithm:\nSensors: Vehicle position and direction\
    \ sensors, detect using sensors.\nInput: Location of start mega-cell S and no\
    \ information about the environment.\nRecursive function: STC (w, x), where x\
    \ is the current node, w is the parent node in spanning tree.\nInitialization:\
    \ STC (null, S).\nAlgorithm STC:\nSpiral-STC(w,x):\n1. Mark the current a root\
    \ cell x as “visited”\n2. While x still has an “unvisited” adjacent that is not\
    \ completely occupied by an obstacle\nor vehicle.\n2.1. Search for new neighbours\
    \ of x in an anti-clockwise direction. Call y the ﬁrst\nneighbor of x.\n2.2. Build\
    \ a connection edge between x and y.\n2.3. If y is completely free:\nFrom x move\
    \ to a sub-cell of y along the output edge of x.\n2.4. If y is partially occupied\
    \ by an obstacle or vehicle:\n2.4.1. Build C-Space space at y.\n2.4.2. From x\
    \ just moving along the new contour of C-Space at y has just\nfollowed the access\
    \ edge of y to return to x.\n2.5. Call STC (x, y)\n3. End the loop.\n4. If x differs\
    \ from S, move back to x.\n5. Returns results (STC(w, x) stops).\n6. The Proposed\
    \ System\nIn uncertain (dynamic) emergency environments, disaster response decisions\
    \ are by their very\nnature very urgent. A time consuming simulation process to\
    \ search for optimal solution(s) for\nservice vehicles supporting an developing\
    \ emergency is neither realistic or desirable. A robust IT\ncommunication infrastructure\
    \ of vehicles in will enhance safety and provide information in ‘real-time’\n\
    which can result in a quick response time to potentially fatal situations. A conceptual\
    \ view of the\nproposed system to implement emergency response is shown in Figure\
    \ 2.\nQualitative decision making under uncertain environments, while including\
    \ explicit and tacit\nknowledge [39], is also signiﬁcantly impacted by sensor\
    \ signals, experience, and human sensibilities.\nIn such circumstances, decision\
    \ making may be transformed by the use of approximate reasoning.\nHuman decisions\
    \ are driven by reasoning and inference; natural language giving meaning and\n\
    context to the factors that combine to inform decisions. Identifying linguistically\
    \ (semantically) and\nevaluating the factors to be considered in reaching a decision\
    \ or conclusion provides a basis upon\nwhich emergency situations may be (at least\
    \ partly) controlled. For example, in the case of a disaster\nemergency [in a\
    \ disaster zone] the the optimal method for the human may be identiﬁed from range\n\
    of potential alternatives. In reaching such decisions, quantifying human reasoning,\
    \ perception, and\nlinguistic (semantic) information performs a signiﬁcant role\
    \ in decision making under uncertain\ndisaster environments.\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 3910\n9 of 23\nFigure 2. Overview of the proposed system using the Internet-of-Things\
    \ (IoT). A conceptual view of\nthe proposed system to implement emergency response.\n\
    For humans, language and human sensibility in the decision-making process for\
    \ emergency\nresponse situations in particular] where language and communication\
    \ form an essential component;\nKansei evaluation represents human sensibilities\
    \ taken together with decision making in ‘ranking’\nof ﬁnal decisions. In natural\
    \ language, human reasoning can be presented in linguistic (semantic)\nterms to\
    \ describe alternatives based on the contextual properties [6]. The proposed system\
    \ describing\n(pre emergency, an actual emergency, and post emergency scenarios)\
    \ is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3 presents a conceptual model of our proposed\
    \ system and shows the components that\ncombine to implement our proposed method.\
    \ The system components that create our proposed\ndecision-support system are\
    \ introduced below in points 1 to 5:\n1.\nThe Application Interface: provides\
    \ an effective basis upon which decision makers can reach\ndecisions based on\
    \ expert preferences.\n2.\nA SOM: is a software tool designed to implement an\
    \ unsupervised learning algorithm.\nDeveloped by Teuvo Kohonen [40], a SOM is\
    \ a computational method to achieve an orderly\nmapping of a high-dimensional\
    \ distribution onto a regular low-dimensional grid, for a detailed\nexposition\
    \ on SOM’s see [40]. The results from a SOM are the ability to convert complex\
    \ non-linear\nstatistical relationships between high-dimensional data into simple\
    \ geometric relationships in\na low-dimensional display [40]. Given that a SOM\
    \ compresses information while retaining the\nmost important “topological and\
    \ metric relationships of the primary data items on the display”\nin can also\
    \ be considered in terms of “some kind of abstractions” [40]. The two results\
    \ for a\nSOM (visualisation and abstraction) may be used in a number of ways in\
    \ complex tasks such as\n“process, analysis, machine perception, control, and\
    \ communication” [40].\n3.\nA SOM is usually constructed using a two-dimensional\
    \ (regular) grid of nodes; Figure 3 shows\nthe use of the Kohonen SOM in the context\
    \ of our proposed model. Our proposed model has been\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n\
    10 of 23\nmodiﬁed to utilise clustering based on a Kohonen SOM to quantify qualitative\
    \ and quantitative\nfactors together with collaborative decision preferences and\
    \ sensibilities.\n4.\nDSS Database: The DSS database as knowledge based in the\
    \ proposed model consists of sensor\ndata, Kansei data set, which responds to\
    \ decision makers based on their preference in dynamic\ndisaster environments.\
    \ Most processes of training data sets and fuzzy rules in reasoning are\nexecuted\
    \ in the DSS database.\n5.\nDisaster map: The proposed model is embedded with\
    \ GIS map using Google map connected\nthrough API. The vehicles in tracking GPS\
    \ via GIS map are identiﬁed by the locations on the map.\nFigure 3.\nThe proposed\

    \ ES = {eS\n1, eS\n2, . . . , eS\nq} be\na set of experts for a selection of emergency\
    \ strategies, where q is the number of experts that select one\nor several emergency\
    \ strategies QS\nt |(t = 1, . . . , c) with its data normalization in fuzzy weights\

    \ scale (0: oppose, 0.25: almost oppose,\n0.5: have no preference, 0.75: almost\
    \ agree, 1: agree).\nStep 2. Construction of Kansei emergency matrix: Kansei emergency\
    \ matrix MS\nn×p is constructed\nusing fuzzy weight values in the range [0, 1]\
    \ for the results of the Kansei evaluation and the fuzzy\nevaluation model for\
    \ emergency strategies as described in Section 5.1. Let VS = {VS\n1 , VS\n2 ,\

    \ matrix MS\nn×p in an emergency domain S,\nwhere h is the number of emergency\
    \ resources (vehicles) with rules considered by experts and data\nset(s) are expressed\
    \ and updated in the DSS database.\nStep 3. Visualisation of Kansei disaster matrix\
    \ by SOM: to ﬁnd either emergency strategy matching\nwith expert preferences or\
    \ emergency domains.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n11 of 23\nStep 3.1. Deﬁnition\
    \ of Kansei disaster distance: in the training process to evaluate differences\n\
    among Kansei emergency attributes of emergency vectors by a SOM, the Kansei emergency\
    \ attribute\ndistance dS\nCi→Cj between two vectors DS\nCi and dS\nCj represents\
    \ attributes of emergency vectors CS\ni and\nCS\nj respectively as deﬁned by Euclidean\

    \ Visualising Kansei disaster matrix by the SOM: the Kansei disaster matrix DS\n\
    n×p is visualized\nby a SOM in order to ﬁnd emergency management strategy matching\
    \ with expert preferences.\nTo calculate the weights of decision maker preference\
    \ distances together with a selected emergency\nstrategy pS\nt |(t = 1, . . .\
    \ , c), the decision maker preference distance dS\nei→ej is represented by mt\n\
    ij calculated\nfrom the Kansei emergency attribute distance vt\nij evaluated by\
    \ a decision maker eS\ni of his/her group\nat iteration t and the Kansei disaster\
    \ weight wt\nij of the decision maker group. The weight of mt\nij is\nexpressed\

    \ = 1, ..., q, j = 1, ..., k) and p is the number of decision makers in each group.\n\
    Step 3.4. Updating Kansei disaster weights: a Decision matrix DS\nq×k is updated\
    \ by its weights given\nby Equation (3). Then, the Decision matrix DS\nq×k is\
    \ combined with the Kansei emergency matrix MS\nn×p\nand its weights are updated\
    \ in the matrix as shown in Equation (3)\nmt+1\nij\n= mt\nij + βS\nj (∥ 1\nP\n\
    m\n∑\nj=1\nwt\nij − vt\nij ∥)\n(3)\nwhere βS\nj is a set of decision maker preferences\
    \ as deﬁned in a ﬁve-point scale (0: oppose, 0.25:\nalmost oppose, 0.5: have no\
    \ preference, 0.75: almost agree, 1: agree). To select c emergency strategies\n\
    (pS\n1, pS\n2, . . . , pS\nc ), steps 3.1 to 3.4 are repeated until c decision\
    \ maker groups with updated weights in\nthe emergency matrix are complete. The\
    \ appropriate emergency strategies are matched with decision\nmaker preferences.\n\
    Step 4. Selection of vehicles matching with disaster strategies: following the\
    \ updating of the weights\nin the emergency matrix of Kansei matrix MS\nn×p, in\
    \ Step 4.2 the Kansei matrix MS\nn×p is continuously\nvisualised by the SOM. The\
    \ process from Step 3.2 to Step 4.2 is and repeated until the compromised and\n\
    aggregated expert preferences in closed grouping points. Based on Kansei emergency\
    \ distance among\nexpert preferences with the closest emergency resource (vehicle)\
    \ having similar attributes, the ﬁnal\nresult on a SOM is shown in the selected\
    \ emergency resources (vehicles) VS∗ = {VS\n1 , VS\n2 , . . . , VS\nh } in\nemergency\
    \ domain S where h is the number of vehicles matched with appropriate emergency\
    \ strategies.\nStep 5.\nSelect priority of vehicle routes in disaster environments:\
    \ quantiﬁcation of algebraic\nlinguistics is an interpretation of an algebra.\
    \ In the formula: AX\n=\n(X; G; H; ≤) where (X; ≤)\nis a poset. Let (G) be a set\
    \ of the primary generators and (H) be a set of unary operations that present\n\
    in terms of linguistic hedges [6]. Linguistic variables can be presented in values\
    \ Truth such as: True,\nVeryTrue; alternatively, values False can be presented\
    \ such as: Probably False, Mostly False, Very Probably\nFalse, Probably False\
    \ and so on. The values given in a set of generators can be deﬁned as follows:\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n12 of 23\n(G) = {False , True} using hedges belonging\

    \ in mainly process of the proposed model is depicted as follows:\nStep 5.1. Identify\
    \ the objectives of multiple decision making for emergency for support vehicles:\n\
    the proposed model for the Hedge-Emergency-DSS is proposed while identifying multiple\

    \ coverage path planning: to ﬁnd the shortest path (route),\na decision maker\
    \ can apply Dijkstra’s algorithm for a vehicle to ﬁnd the best route to an emergency\n\
    destination [for a vehicle] using the disaster map. To cover all paths identiﬁed\
    \ in monitoring emergency\nlocations a decision maker can apply the STC algorithm\
    \ to coverage path in disaster areas shown on\na map.\nStep 5.6. Consider rule\
    \ and update its weight to DSS database: for each node of\n\0VS\ni\n\x01\nvisited,\n\
    consider Rule(j) represented by\n\0Rj\n\x01\nand apply\n\0VS\ni\n\x01\nas follows.\
    \ In fuzzy rule-based reasoning,\nthe fuzzy rules are generally expressed for\
    \ two input variables and one output as a decision variable,\nas given by Equation\
    \ (5):\n\n\n\n\n\nRi : if x1 is ConditionAi1 and x2 is Ai2 then y is Vi\n\
    ...\nRn : if x1 is ConditionAn1 and x2 is An2 then y is Vn\n(5)\nwhere x1 and\
    \ x2 represent input-quantitative variables (x1 ∈ X1, x2 ∈ X2) to a fuzzy system\
    \ and\ny represents output-decision variable (y ∈ Y). Ai1, Ai2 and Bi are fuzzy\
    \ subsets of X1, X2 and Y,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n13 of 23\nrespectively.\
    \ When the non-fuzzy input data “x1 is x∗\n1 and x2 is x∗\n2” is given, the matched\

    \ considered by experts and applied these weights and rules in\nKnowledge Base\
    \ (KB): IF a checking rule is existent in the KB THEN do an action in the considered\n\
    rule ELSE a new rule matched in the proposed model that can be added to the KB.\n\
    All repeated steps are complete and the vehicle path is identiﬁed with its multiple\
    \ decision-making\nobjectives complete the action(s). The ﬁnal group decision\
    \ making is to show ranking list Vi > Vj >\nVk > Vt > Vp . . . for a priority\
    \ vehicle in the optimal route for emergency response.\n7. Evaluation\nIn this\
    \ section we set out a relevant example with experimental testing to evaluate\
    \ the proposed\napproach using a case study predicated on an emergency response\
    \ scenario.\nExample Illustration\nAn illustrated example is presented to show\
    \ how Input data sets obtained from the DOE sensors\nand expert preferences are\
    \ used in the matching of emergency strategies with located emergency\nlocations\
    \ on a map. Let decision maker belonging to ES = {eS\n1, eS\n2, . . . , eS\n5}\
    \ be a set of experts for\na selection of emergency strategies where q =5 is the\
    \ number of experts that select one or several\nemergency strategies QS\nt |(t\
    \ = 1, . . . , 5) with data normalization in fuzzy weights [0, 1] and his/her\n\
    preference βS\nj deﬁned in a ﬁve-point scale (0: oppose, 0.25: almost oppose,\
    \ 0.5: have no preference, 0.75:\nalmost agree, 1: agree).\nIn many decision problems\
    \ related to the prioritisation of emergency service vehicles in emergency\nresponse\
    \ scenarios an emergency service resource (i.e., a robot or vehicle) will identify\
    \ potential targets,\nlocations, and tasks; this requires multiple decision-making\
    \ objectives.\n\0Qj (X)\n\x01\nis an objective\nfunction for ﬁve disaster strategies\
    \ indicated for multiple objectives updated in the decision maker’s\nknowledge-base.\
    \ In steps 1 to 4 [of the proposed system—see Section 6] a decision maker can\
    \ instruct\nan on-line emergency DSS on the automatic selection of the emergency\
    \ management strategies in\nmultiple decision-making objectives as follows: V1\
    \ (Ambulance), V2 (helicopter), V3 (ﬁre engine),\nV4 (police car), and V5 (rapid\
    \ ﬁre truck).\nAssume that the objective function aims to minimise the impact\
    \ of a ﬁre in ‘real-time’ emergency\nresponse to meet the ﬁve disaster strategies\
    \ following objectives:\n1.\n(Q (1)): To rescue people in advance of a ﬁre;\n\
    2.\n(Q (2)): To rescue people and move items to a place of safety;\n3.\n(Q (3)):\
    \ To protect items and infrastructure and maintain safety;\n4.\n(Q (4)): To move\
    \ items into safe storage;\n5.\n(Q (5)): To rescue people in medical centres and\
    \ hospitals together with emergency support.\nFor instance, the value\n\0Qj (X)\n\
    \x01\nis considered by using the linguistic variables as follows: very\nhigh,\
    \ high, very very low, very little low, medium high, very low, roundly high, ...\
    \ In the preliminary\nexperiment as shown in Step 5 [steps 5.1–5.7 of the proposed\
    \ system—see Section 6] Kansei evaluation\nmodels human sensibilities in the decision-support\
    \ function. We have collected 10 Kansei words\nbelonging to an objective function\
    \ as shown in in Table 1.\nA Kansei disaster matrix is constructed using Kansei\
    \ words as shown in in Table 2.\nIn Kansei evaluation we us a semantic differential\
    \ (SD) method with a ﬁve-point scale deﬁnition:\n(0: little low, 0.25: low, 0.5:\
    \ little high, 0.75: high, 1: very high). The values for the preferences of decision\n\
    makers to evaluate the objective function is depicted in Table 3. From steps in\
    \ the calculations as\ndiscussed above, the degree of the objective function corresponding\

    \ Hedge–Emergency–DSS model, multiple decision-making processes [for service\n\
    resources (vehicles)] will ﬁnd the optimal path (route) in the emergency zone\
    \ (the DOE) based on\nvehicle priorities. As calculated by the formulas above,\
    \ the illustration example the order of vehicles\nis expressed by: (V4 > V1 >\
    \ V5 > V2 > V3). The relevant example demonstrates that vehicles can\nﬁnd the\
    \ optimal path (route) while maximising the coverage (of the DOE) and monitoring\
    \ the priority\nof the emergency service vehicles in emergency response.\nAppl.\

    \ been implemented using Java, the maps are rendered using the\nJXMapViewer library\
    \ embedded with Google maps using an API. The disaster zone can viewed\nusing\
    \ a Smart phone or desktop application, the view showing the location and extent\
    \ of the disaster\nzone along with the location of the emergency service vehicles.\n\
    8.1. Emergency Case study in Vietnam\nTo begin the evaluation of the proposed\
    \ approach to group decision making using the Google\nmaps we conducted an experiment\
    \ based on a ‘real-world’ emergency in Vietnam. In this experiment,\nexperts using\
    \ smart phones or smart devices are embedded in vehicles loaded Kansei data sets\
    \ for\nthe proposed system. The Kansei matrix was constructed with dynamic dimensions\
    \ [Kansei words,\nquantitative, and qualitative factors] represent vehicles from\
    \ the DSS database of the Vietnam–Japan\nproject disaster centre. In the proposed\
    \ system, the SOM model uses a Gaussian neighborhood function\nwith an adaptive\
    \ variance and learning rate.\nThe parameters are set in the Kansei SOM application\
    \ (SOM sizes = 30 × 30, Sigma max = 12,\nSigma min = 3, Iteration set = 30 and\
    \ learning rates from 0.05 to 0.01). To consider decision maker\npreferences in\
    \ the proposed system, the experts were divided into three groups based on emergency\n\
    management strategies as objectives in group decision making. The proposed system\
    \ describing\npre-emergency situation, the situation during the emergency, and\
    \ the post-disaster situation is shown\nin Figure 4.\nFigure 4. The SOM map results\
    \ in matching emergency strategies for emergency case study in Japan.\nIn simulations,\
    \ the map result showed the Kansei distance of potential emergency response\n\
    vehicles from the location of the emergency. As observed from Figure 5, decision\
    \ makers selected these\nvehicles, matched with appropriate emergency management\
    \ strategies, by reducing the maximum\nKansei disaster distance of the disaster\
    \ vectors and eliminating those that have a greater distance.\nFigure 5 illustrates\
    \ potential vehicles going to the route in disaster domain, aggregated by expert\n\
    preferences on the map.\nIn this case study, a human agent (the decision maker)\
    \ can freely select a strategy [from a range of\nsuggested strategies] in a disaster\
    \ response scenario. For example, in disaster strategy (1), the decision\nmaker\
    \ can select the most appropriate strategy to maximise the response (the rescue\
    \ of individuals\nusing a range of potential implementation options which may\
    \ include: ambulances, emergency vehicles\nsuch as police and emergency service\
    \ vehicles, ﬁre engines, and helicopters) in a ﬁre disaster situation.\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n16 of 23\nHowever, in considering disaster strategy (2)\
    \ (as shown in Figure 5), the identiﬁcation and\nselection of the optimal strategy\
    \ to maximise the rescue of individuals trapped in a ﬁre must consider\ncurrent\
    \ ‘real-time’ trafﬁc congestion within a city and the optimal solution must select\
    \ the quickest\nroute (which may not be the shortest route). For instance, in\
    \ the case of disaster 3 the optimal\nsolution [as identiﬁed by a number of experts]\
    \ has been achieved by implementing control limited to\nambulances and ﬁre engines\
    \ deployed to react to the disaster.\nTo identify warnings and emergency response\
    \ notiﬁcations, decision maker(s) can input\npreferences with single or multiple\
    \ locations and objectives. Let us assume that the emergency\nservice vehicles\
    \ are shown on Google map belonging to the disaster strategy (2) as shown in Figure\
    \ 5.\nFigure 5. The SOM map results in viewed vehicles in emergency strategies.\n\
    Following entering the decision maker(s) preferences, the experimental results\
    \ are shown on the\nmap by the combination of transportation and priority. He/she\
    \ can ﬁnd the optimal route(s) while the\nvehicles moved to the location of the\
    \ ﬁre in ‘real-time’. In the process of multiple decision-making,\ndecision makers\
    \ can consult a simulation of the vehicles and their movement with locations on\
    \ the\nGoogle map, as shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Initial vehicles with the\
    \ proposed ﬁre disaster appear on the Google map.\nPrioritisation of service vehicles\
    \ [to respond to an emergency] can enable the optimal path\n(including available\
    \ path(s) plus the distance(s) from the current location of service vehicle(s)\
    \ to the\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n17 of 23\nemergency to be identiﬁed using\
    \ connected data from humans and DOE sensors is shown in Figure 7.\nThe shortest\
    \ path ﬁnding ‘Dijkstra algorithm’ is used to ﬁnd the shortest route from the\
    \ location of the\nservice vehicle from the current location to the location of\
    \ the emergency. In the event of there being\nmultiple available service vehicles,\
    \ the STC algorithm will ﬁnd the distance between service vehicle(s)\nand the\
    \ optimal service vehicle can respond to the emergency while other service vehicles\
    \ will not\nrespond. Prioritisation of service response vehicles is achieved by\
    \ identifying the shortest available\npath(s) (route(s)) derived using connected\
    \ data from humans and sensors as shown in Figure 8.\nFigure 7. Priority service\
    \ vehicles moved as they appear on the Google map.\nFigure 8. The route of service\
    \ vehicles was appeared on the Google map.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n18 of 23\n\
    8.2. Emergency Case Study in Japan\nTo further evaluate the proposed approach\
    \ to group decision makings using the Google maps,\nwe conducted a further case\
    \ study based on a ‘real-world’ disaster a decision maker can eliminate\nSOM visualisation\
    \ if he has a disaster strategy in minds. He freely selects a location disaster\
    \ matrix\nfor visualisation appeared on the disaster map the available options\
    \ together with sensible decisions.\nMost of the world’s earthquakes, tsunamis,\
    \ landslides, and volcanic eruptions are caused by the\ncontinuous motions in\
    \ a disaster. Figure 9 illustrates the emergency location in Sendai, Japan on\n\
    the Google map. Decision makers decided to adjust the map on Google for the study\
    \ as shown in\nFigure 10.\nFigure 9. SOM map results in the emergency location.\n\
    Figure 10. Identiﬁcation of emergency locations in Japan on the Google map.\n\
    To ensure that comprehensive coverage [of the DOE] with all available paths identiﬁed\
    \ in the\nemergency location(s), a decision maker can apply the STC algorithm.\
    \ For example, an earthquake\nhappened in Japan and there were emergency support\
    \ vehicles available within the disaster zone\n(the DOE). To consider decision\
    \ maker preferences in the proposed system, the experts were given in\ndisaster\
    \ strategies as objectives in group decision making to arrive at the optimal path(s)\
    \ (route(s))\nto expedite emergency support vehicles and provide assistance. The\
    \ available options are shown in\nFigure 11.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n19 of\
    \ 23\nIn further simulation results, we show that a decision maker can decide\
    \ the shortest route to\ncombine all emergency service vehicles to enable emergency\
    \ support as shown in Figure 12. As can be\nseen from Figure 12, the experimental\
    \ results show the location of all the emergency service vehicles in\nthe earthquake\
    \ zone. Using Hedge Algebra and Kansei evaluation based on the expert’s sensibilities\n\
    about disaster conditions, good decision making is promoted.\nFigure 11. Priority\
    \ vehicles in order to identify emergency locations in Japan on the Google map.\n\

    9. Results and Discussion\nIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed\
    \ system in simulation of disaster response,\nthe performance of the proposed\
    \ model is calculated from: (a) the average of ratings between times,\nand (b)\
    \ the number of objectives involved in selection of the appropriate service vehicle(s)\
    \ based on\nthe available routes in the emergency zone (the DOE). In this Section\
    \ we set out the methodology with\nresults and a discussion.\nTo evaluate the\
    \ overall performance of the proposed model with random [dynamic] obstacles\n\
    (bicycles, cars, and other vehicles moving on the map (the DOE)), the performance\
    \ of the proposed\nmodel was compared with a conventional method and Hed-DSS model\
    \ as discussed in [41].\nThe proposed model, [including Hedge Algebra and Kansei\
    \ evaluation] are also used to quantify\ndecision makers’ sensibilities in emergency\
    \ response.\nThe approaches considered have performed well in evaluation and testing\
    \ in the similar conditions\n(nodes) using the same data sets in the same map.\
    \ The performance average of all cases (60 nodes)\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n\
    20 of 23\nin simulations) was calculated for variety of cases. The proposed model\
    \ far outperforms the other\nconventional approach in short time for the evaluation\
    \ of disaster response, as shown in Figure 13.\nIn further evaluation and testing\
    \ in simulations [the same number of 9 objectives with a variety of\nobjectives],\
    \ the experimental results show that the proposed model achieved increased computational\n\
    efﬁciency (reduced computing time). Moreover, the results consistently show that\
    \ the proposed\napproach in a comparative analysis [SOM integrated with the Hedge\
    \ Algebra integrated Kansei\nevaluation approach] demonstrates a consistent improvement\
    \ of response time for the proposed model\nresults achieved, as shown in Figure\
    \ 14.\nExperimental results demonstrate that identifying linguistically (semantically)\
    \ and evaluating\nthe factors to be considered in a decision enables support emergency\
    \ response (in an emergency zone,\nthe DOE) to decide on the optimal routes for\
    \ support and emergency service vehicles to provide an\neffective and efﬁcient\
    \ response. Quantifying decision maker’s reasoning, perception, and linguistic\n\
    (semantic) information performs a signiﬁcant role in decision making under uncertain\
    \ environments.\nThe evaluation based on experimental testing has been presented\
    \ to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of\nour proposed model. The results of the simulation\
    \ show that the proposed model provides an effective\nbasis for resource allocation\
    \ and deployment in emergency response scenarios. Moreover, our proposed\nmethod\
    \ may be used to provide decision-support in both emergency and disaster planning\
    \ and in\n‘real-time’ adaptable management of emergency response in dynamic uncertain\
    \ environments.\nFigure 13. The Evaluation of time in 5 decision-making objects\
    \ with a variety of nodes.\nFigure 14. Evaluation of time in 5 decision-making\
    \ objects with a variety of nodes.\nFuture Directions For Research\nEvery research\
    \ study will resolve many questions. However, such studies will also identify\n\
    ‘open-research questions’. In our study such a question relates to collaborative\
    \ group-based\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 3910\n21 of 23\ndecision-support under dynamic\
    \ uncertainty.\nIn such group collaborative disaster recovery an\ninteractive\
    \ intelligent decision-support system is required. Investigating this question\
    \ forms the\nbasis for a future research direction.\nThe evaluation and experimental\
    \ testing has employed a simulation which has achieved promising\nresults. Current\
    \ research is evaluating our proposed method in a ‘real-world’ and ‘real-time’\
    \ trafﬁc\nmanagement environment; Figure 15 shows a practical ‘real-world’ cloud-based\
    \ implementation\nof the proposed system in a vehicle control information system\
    \ with the output displayed in the\nin-car information system panel. The in-car\
    \ application represents ongoing research with promising\npreliminary results;\
    \ when the research is complete the results will be published in a later article.\n\
    The results of the evaluation based on the simulation and the test implementation\
    \ in a ‘real-world’\nvehicle system show that our reported results are promising\
    \ and our novel approach has the potential\nto operate effectively in ‘real-world’\
    \ emergency management systems.\nFigure 15. The demonstration of the proposed\
    \ system with the output sent to a vehicle control\ninformation system panel.\n\
    10. Concluding Observations\nIn this paper we have presented a novel approach\
    \ which is designed to achieve autonomous\nemergency emergency service vehicle\
    \ control achieved by matching resources [service vehicles] with\ndisaster strategies\
    \ using group decision making in urban disaster zones.\nThe posited approach employs\
    \ hedge algebras and Kansei evaluation to realise intelligent\ndecision-support\
    \ with improved levels of control for disaster recovery service vehicles. The\
    \ proposed\napproach is designed to quantify qualitative factors; this method,\
    \ when implemented with the\nmodelling of human sensibilities and semantically\
    \ driven reasoning and inference, has shown a\nsigniﬁcant improvement for optimal\
    \ decision making in ‘real-time’ emergency service vehicle control\nin disaster\
    \ recovery scenarios.\nDisaster recovery forms a central function in urban planning,\
    \ we posit that our novel approach\nto the provision of autonomous decision-support\
    \ holds the prospect of improvements in disaster\nrecovery. Moreover, we posit\
    \ that our proposed method will generalise to other trafﬁc and vehicle\nmanagement\
    \ scenarios in urban environments.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.V.P.\

  limitations: The paper claims that the proposed HSSTC model achieves significant
    improvements in group decision-support under dynamic uncertainty. While the paper
    demonstrates the efficacy of the HSSTC model through simulation and a test implementation
    in a 'real-world' vehicle system, it lacks a detailed error analysis and quantitative
    evaluation of the model's performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.
    Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential limitations and challenges
    of implementing the HSSTC model in practical emergency response scenarios, such
    as scalability, real-time constraints, and integration with existing emergency
    management systems.

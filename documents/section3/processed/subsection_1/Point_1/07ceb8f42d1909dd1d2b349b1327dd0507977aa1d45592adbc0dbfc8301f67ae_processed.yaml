    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and small drones are nowadays being widely used\n\
    in heterogeneous use cases: aerial photography, precise agriculture, inspections,\
    \ environmental data\ncollection, search-and-rescue operations, surveillance applications,\
    \ and more. When designing UAV\nswarm-based applications, a key “ingredient” to\
    \ make them effective is the communication system\n(possible involving multiple\
    \ protocols) shared by ﬂying drones and terrestrial base stations. When\ncompared\
    \ to ground communication systems for swarms of terrestrial vehicles, one of the\
    \ main\nadvantages of UAV-based communications is the presence of direct Line-of-Sight\
    \ (LOS) links be-\ntween ﬂying UAVs operating at an altitude of tens of meters,\
    \ often ensuring direct visibility among\nthemselves and even with some ground\
    \ Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs). Therefore, the adoption\nof proper networking\
    \ strategies for UAV swarms allows users to exchange data at distances (sig-\n\
    niﬁcantly) longer than in ground applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\
    \ communication\narchitecture for UAV swarms, leveraging heterogeneous radio mesh\
    \ networking based on long-range\ncommunication protocols—such as LoRa and LoRaWAN—and\
    \ IEEE 802.11s protocols. We then\ndiscuss its strengths, constraints, viable\
    \ implementation, and relevant reference use cases.\nKeywords: UAV swarm; mesh\

    \ and wide adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has grown\nin a signiﬁcant\
    \ way in the last years due to the availability of inexpensive and “smarter”\n\
    Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products by both world-leading UAV manufacturers\n\
    (e.g., DJI [1]) and other small companies, which develop ad hoc solutions for\
    \ speciﬁc\nscenarios. In the last ﬁve years, the price of a Ready-to-Fly (RTF)\
    \ solution equipped\nwith (i) a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), (ii)\
    \ a 4K resolution camera ﬁxed on\na gimbal (namely, a device for keeping an instrument\
    \ stable and aligned with horizon, typi-\ncally consisting of rings pivoted at\
    \ right angles), (iii) on-board advanced sensing elements\n(e.g., obstacle detection\
    \ and anti-collision systems), and (iv) a reliable communication\nsystem between\
    \ the UAV and the terrestrial pilot (able to provide a real-time high-quality\n\
    video stream) reduced from more than 1000 USD (e.g., in 2015, the DJI Phantom\
    \ 3 Pro\nUAV [2] had an initial price of 1259 USD) to 400–500 USD (e.g., the new\
    \ DJI Mini 2 [3]\nreleased in 2020 had a price of 449 USD). Moreover, this cost\
    \ reduction boosted an im-\npressive market growth of the commercial drones sector,\
    \ further enhanced by the current\nCOVID-19 pandemic situation, in which the adoption\
    \ of UAVs for remote monitoring and\nenhanced services provisioning exponentially\
    \ increased [4]. While the commercial use of\nUAVs for aerial photography and\
    \ remote monitoring can rely on consolidated and reliable\nsolutions (e.g., wireless\
    \ communication systems among the drone and the pilot for Visual\nLine-of-Sight\
    \ (VLOS) operations), there are still several technical difﬁculties to overcome\n\
    when dealing with long-range UAV swarm applications, namely Beyond VLOS (BVLOS)\n\
    operations, where a multitude of UAVs may simultaneously be ﬂying over a wide\
    \ area and\nmust be connected to each other in order to coordinate and perform\
    \ complex operations.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26. https://doi.org/10.3390/drones5020026\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n2 of 32\nFocusing on\
    \ these heterogeneous scenarios, in this paper, we propose a hybrid oppor-\ntunistic\
    \ mesh networking approach based on Long Range (LoRa) [5] and IEEE 802.11s [6]\n\
    protocols for ﬂying UAV swarms, involving both UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-ground com-\n\
    munications. This architecture allows multiple ﬂying drones to exchange essential\
    \ data—\ne.g., telemetry information—with each other or toward one or more ground\
    \ control centers,\nthus opening new possibilities for UAV-based applications\
    \ over wide operational areas.\nLong Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN [7] at a\
    \ Medium Access Control (MAC)\nlayer) as well as LoRa (at the physical (PHY) layer)\
    \ are attractive as they allow users to\nreach long distances (on the order of\
    \ several kilometers) in Line-of-Sight (LOS) applica-\ntions [8,9], e.g., inside\
    \ the swarm. On the other end, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) [10] is widely\nadopted in\
    \ a multitude of applications and is often used for UAV-to-pilot real-time video\n\
    broadcasting, given its direct visibility-operating distance ranging from a few\
    \ hundreds\nof meters up to one or more kilometers. Nevertheless, in a complete\
    \ LOS environment\n(such as that between ﬂying UAVs), the selection of an appropriate\
    \ Wi-Fi implementation\ncan allow for high bandwidth data stream between multiple\
    \ nearby UAVs, thus opening\nadditional possibilities given its proper features.\
    \ Therefore, the use of IEEE 802.11s, which\nbuilds upon IEEE 802.11, is very\
    \ attractive.\nIn order to exploit the strengths of two communication protocols\
    \ of interest and to\nlimit the impact of their constraints in the adoption of\
    \ UAV swarms, a “meshiﬁcation” of\nLoRa- and IEEE 802.11s-based communication\
    \ patterns (through opportunistic switching,\nhandling, and management mechanisms)\
    \ may allow us to cover several use cases based\non the use of UAV swarms as well\
    \ as to provide a good tradeoff between operational\nrange and available bandwidth.\
    \ Then, combining different heterogeneous wireless com-\nmunication networks—namely,\
    \ a LoRa-based communication layer for long distances and\nconstrained payload\
    \ communications, and an IEEE 802.11s-based communication layer for\nmid-range\
    \ and unconstrained payload applications—will allow them to coexist. Hence,\n\
    being on two separate layers, a smart switching mechanism must be deﬁned to choose\n\
    the most suitable network to be used in a certain time instant, also based on\
    \ the task’s re-\nquirements and network quality conditions (e.g., based on Received\
    \ Signal Strength Index\n(RSSI) and localization of ﬂying neighbor UAVs or ground\
    \ control stations). Therefore,\nthe proposed switching mechanism takes into account\
    \ the capabilities and constraints of\neach available communication protocol in\
    \ terms of both operational range and admitted\npayload, optimizing the performances\
    \ in the considered application scenarios.\nIn order to avoid confusion, we preliminarily\
    \ comment on how the term UAV will be\nused in the remainder of this paper. In\
    \ general terms, UAV is used to indicate various types\nof remotely or autonomously\
    \ piloted aerial vehicles, ranging from small quad-copters—also\ndenoted as drones\
    \ and with a weight from hundreds of grams up to tens of kilograms—to\nlarge-size\
    \ aerial vehicles involved in military operations—with a weight up to thousands\n\
    of kilograms. In the following, the term UAV will refer to commonly and widely\
    \ adopted\ncommercial drones having a Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) of 25 kg and\
    \ ﬂying at\na maximum Above Ground Level (AGL) of 120 m, given the aerospace regulation\
    \ rules\napplied in both Europe (by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency\
    \ (EASA) [11]) and\nthe US (by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [12]).\n\
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a literature\
    \ overview\non UAV-oriented communication solutions and relevant research projects\
    \ is presented,\nanalyzing their advantages and disadvantages. In Section 3, the\
    \ communication protocols\nadopted in the proposed hybrid architecture are detailed\
    \ and analyzed, discussing their\nstrengths and limitations. Section 4 presents\
    \ the proposed hybrid LoRa-IEEE 802.11s\nopportunistic mesh networking approach,\
    \ while in Section 5, the opportunistic network\ninterfaces switching mechanism\
    \ is discussed. In Section 6, the theoretical and experimental\nperformance results\
    \ are shown, while Section 7 discusses a few relevant use cases and\nscenarios.\
    \ Finally, in Section 8, we draw our conclusions and possible improvements for\n\
    the proposed system architecture.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n3 of 32\n2. State-of-the-Art\n\
    Commercial UAVs actually use different wireless communication protocols to transmit\n\
    or receive essential data—e.g., a real-time First Point of View (FPV) video stream\
    \ from\nthe drone—in order to provide an advanced ﬂying experience to the pilot.\
    \ Other data\ntransmitted wirelessly include drone’s telemetry data and video\
    \ streams (downlink) and,\nof course, the drone’s input commands sent from the\
    \ Radio Controller (RC) handled by\nthe pilot (uplink).\nNowadays, modern commercial\
    \ solutions often adopt the Wi-Fi protocol (in the 2.4 GHz\nand 5.8 GHz frequency\
    \ bands) as the communication protocol between the UAV and the RC,\nthus providing\
    \ a bidirectional communication channel sufﬁciently reliable to allow the pilot\n\
    to ﬂy in an obstacle-free environment for hundreds of meters. To this end, it\
    \ is possible\nthat advanced UAVs use proprietary communication protocols or Wi-Fi\
    \ broadcast-based\nenhanced protocols, such as OcuSync [13] and LightBridge [14]\
    \ transmission protocols\n(both deﬁned by DJI), able to guarantee a LOS operational\
    \ range of several kilometers.\nInstead, some high-end products are already working\
    \ on Long-Term Evolution (LTE)\ncellular networks for high-deﬁnition real-time\
    \ FPV video feeds, while telemetry and RC\ndata are exchanged using different\
    \ protocols (depending on the transmitter and receiver\nmanufacturer [15]) based\
    \ on different signal modulations (e.g., Spektrum [16], FrSky\nACCST [17], and\
    \ Futaba [18]) but typically working on well-known carrier frequencies—\ni.e.,\
    \ 2.4 GHz or other free Industrial, Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) bands (e.g., 868\
    \ MHz\nin Europe). Unfortunately, most of these solutions are suitable only for\
    \ UAV-to-pilot mono-\ndirectional communications (with bidirectionality applying\
    \ only to a limited number of\nprotocols), with different data sent depending\
    \ the type of communication protocol and\nconsidered applications.\nConsidering\
    \ ﬂying communications between UAVs, nowadays, they could rely on\n(i) Wi-Fi-oriented\
    \ protocols (at different carrier frequencies) for LOS short/mid-range\ncommunication\
    \ links; (ii) long-range protocols (e.g., LoRa) for communications over a large\n\
    area, still with LOS communication links; and (iii) cellular networks for Non-LOS\
    \ (NLOS)\nlink-based applications, where a third-party cellular network is needed\
    \ to establish a com-\nmunication between multiple ﬂying UAVs.\nSeveral studies\
    \ have shown the possible adoption of LoRa-based protocols (e.g., Lo-\nRaWAN)\
    \ for UAV communications, with different long-range applications, implementa-\n\
    tions, and use cases. A preliminary use of LoRaWAN is discussed in [19], where\
    \ multiple\nUAVs are used as ﬂying LoRaWAN gateways (GWs) to provide a network\
    \ coverage to\nground LoRaWAN-based end nodes and to exploit LoRaWAN only for\
    \ ground-to-UAV\napplications in emergency-like situations while the backbone\
    \ network relies on Wi-Fi\n(assuming LOS links). A similar approach is presented\
    \ in [20], where multiple ﬂying\nUAVs, each one equipped with a LoRaWAN GW, cooperate\
    \ to form a complex LoRaWAN-\noriented urban surveillance system to provide efﬁcient\
    \ and selective network coverage.\nHowever, in all the cited works, LoRa-based\
    \ communications are almost always used\nfor ground-to-UAV interactions among\
    \ on-ﬁeld end nodes and the LoRaWAN network\n(composed of both ﬂying UAVs, acting\
    \ as GWs, and ground GWs) in order to efﬁciently\nextend the coverage of the whole\
    \ network for speciﬁc use cases in some operational re-\ngions. Another UAV-enabled\
    \ ﬂying LoRaWAN networking approach was discussed in [21],\nwith a focus on disaster\
    \ management applications, combining ﬂying LoRaWAN GWs\nwith Wi-Fi communications\
    \ from a UAV-to-ground Access Point (AP) and LoRaWAN end\nnodes, with the goal\
    \ to follow the emergency operators to collect data and positions. Even\nin this\
    \ scenario, LoRa-based communications are used for data collection from ground\
    \ end\nnodes, aiming at following the moving ground devices to guarantee a reliable\
    \ network for\nemergency applications.\nA different scenario with UAV-to-ground\
    \ LoRaWAN communications, in particular\nas a secondary telemetry system, given\
    \ the strength of LoRa modulation and LoRaWAN\nprotocol implementation, is presented\
    \ in [22]. In detail, the authors showed that LoRaWAN\ncould be employed for communications\
    \ among ﬂying UAVs and the existing LoRaWAN\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n4 of 32\nground\
    \ network, in particular to transmit essential telemetry data (such as GNSS lati-\n\
    tude/longitude/altitude, drone speed, and heading direction) needed to safely\
    \ handle\na UAV in the presence of a RC–UAV link failure. Moreover, the possible\
    \ operational ranges\nof this implementation are shown, investigating and simulating\
    \ the behavior of LoRa RF\nsignals at different UAV speeds and distances among\
    \ the UAV and the GW in an urban en-\nvironment. Unfortunately, the authors of\
    \ [22] do not consider the use of LoRa for multiple\nﬂying UAVs communications—to\
    \ let the farthest drones using nearby ﬂying UAVs as relays\nbroadcast their telemetry\
    \ data to the LoRaWAN ground network—thus limiting the pos-\nsible use cases and\
    \ effective operational ranges of the system. Another UAV-to-ground\nLoRaWAN-based\
    \ communication application has been proposed in [23], in which the use\nof multiple\
    \ UAVs with on-board sensors for air quality monitoring applications is discussed,\n\
    further providing additional system operational results. Even in this case, LoRa-based\n\
    communications are still used for UAV-to-ground communications without exploiting\n\
    the potential use of ﬂying long-range communications for some speciﬁc scenarios.\n\
    Considering the adoption of Wi-Fi in UAV swarms, in [24], an integrated solution\n\
    for an autonomous ﬂying Wireless Mesh Network (WMN), involving swarms of small\n\
    UAVs, was presented. In detail, UAVs build an IEEE 802.11s-based network to let\
    \ two end\nsystems interact through intermediate airborne relays. These relays\
    \ correspond to UAVs of\nthe swarm, and all UAVs act as APs. However, this solution\
    \ is not applicable to scenarios\nwhere the distance among the nodes will become\
    \ larger than the maximum allowed to\nkeep an IEEE 802.11s connection active.\n\
    The concept of Flying Ad hoc NETworks (FANETs) was discussed in [25], where\n\
    additional link quality routing metrics were introduced and a network simulator-based\n\
    performance analysis was discussed. Algorithmic and theoretical aspects for autonomous\n\
    placement of relay nodes in a mesh network were investigated in [26]. In detail,\
    \ the authors\naimed to maximize the network throughput, but mainly using ﬂying\
    \ UAVs as coverage\nextenders for ground nodes and requiring knowledge of the\
    \ three-dimensional morpholog-\nical conditions of the environment. Because of\
    \ this, UAVs only act as relays for data to be\nshared among ground stations instead\
    \ of building a ﬂying network for ﬂying data routing.\nA similar approach was\
    \ presented in [27], where a WMN-based mobile Cloud system for\nrelay of intelligent\
    \ information, based on Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and caching\ncapabilities,\
    \ was presented. However, even in this case, the mesh network was composed\nby\
    \ ground nodes instead of ﬂying drones.\nA UAV-based emergency communication network\
    \ for post-disaster management\nwas discussed in [28], where smartphones on the\
    \ ground were used as relays through\nan Android mobile App in turn handling UDP\
    \ packets. Moreover, the authors equipped\ntheir UAVs with a Raspberry Pi (RPi)\
    \ as an on-board Wi-Fi-enabled device, thus organizing\nthe ﬂying network not\
    \ as a mesh one but as a chain of Wi-Fi nodes. In [29], the challenges\nof a decentralized\
    \ UAV swarm deployment in resource-constrained farming environments\nwere discussed.\
    \ For similar works, the presented network does not cope with a real mesh\none\
    \ but requires the election of a “central” drone, in charge of performing some\
    \ additional\n(and more complex) tasks with respect to the other UAVs composing\
    \ the swarm.\nIn [30], a dynamic mesh network needed for data transfer among high\
    \ mobility nodes\n(i.e., RP runs a Better Approach To Mobile Ad Hoc Network advanced,\
    \ B.A.T.M.A.N.\nadv [31]) is presented. In detail, the authors discussed their\
    \ experimental results in a range\nbetween 0 m and 60 m, with a maximum effective\
    \ 1-hop range of approximately 130 m.\nNevertheless, their architecture requires\
    \ multiple GWs connected with a ground control\ncenter, thus remaining a ground\
    \ mesh network with no aerial part. A simulated double-\nlayer mesh network, designed\
    \ and evaluated for disaster recovery scenarios, was proposed\nin [19], where\
    \ UAVs act as GWs in a Wi-Fi ad hoc network for the trafﬁc generated between\n\
    mobile LoRaWAN nodes and a remote ground station. Similar to other works, even\n\
    in this case, the only available network among the ﬂying drones is based on the\
    \ Wi-Fi\nprotocol, thus limiting the maximum distance between ﬂying drones. In\
    \ [32], a solution for\norchestrating and synchronizing a swarm of drones is proposed.\
    \ In detail, their network\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n5 of 32\nfocuses on a leader node\
    \ (piloted by a human) that is followed by the remaining drones\ncomposing the\
    \ swarm, on the basis of the leader’s Wi-Fi signal strength. The authors\nproposed\
    \ operating a swarm of UAVs without relying on any existing infrastructure but\n\
    only on ad hoc communications. This approach is attractive if the drones need\
    \ to strictly\nfollow their leader; at the opposite, it needs to be improved in\
    \ the case when UAVs need\nto ﬂy independently from each other. Moreover, in order\
    \ to relay data from the point of\ninterest to the ground control center, a certain\
    \ number of intermediate UAVs (depending\non the distance) will be required rather\
    \ than adopting long-range communication protocols.\nFinally, the application\
    \ of TempoSpatial-Software Deﬁned Networking (TS-SDN) to\nUAV networks, in order\
    \ to extend their network coverage, was described in [33]. In order\nto reach\
    \ this goal, a network of stratospheric balloons can be used to extend network\n\
    access as well as involving ground stations and UAVs equipped with mechanically\
    \ or\nelectronically steered beams to establish highly directional links, even\
    \ to nearby peers.\nMoreover, the authors simulate a scenario composed of more\
    \ than 500 nodes to verify\nthe behavior of different routing protocols.\n3. Disjoint\
    \ IEEE 802.11s and LoRa-Based Wireless Mesh Networking\nAs introduced in Section\
    \ 1, our goal is to combine LoRa and IEEE 802.11s protocols to\ndevelop an innovative\
    \ hybrid mesh architecture. For the sake of completeness, we provide\nan overview\
    \ of IEEE 802.11s and LoRa/LoRaWAN in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.\n3.1.\
    \ IEEE 802.11s Mesh Protocol\nThe growing interest in mesh networking in the last\
    \ decade from both industrial and\nacademic entities has led to the definition\
    \ of the IEEE 802.11s protocol [6,34], an IEEE 802.11\nstandard amendment [10]\
    \ specifically addressed to mesh networks. In particular: (i) the PHY\nlayers\
    \ of both IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.11s are the same; (ii) new routing procedures\
    \ are\nintroduced at the MAC layer rather than at the network layer; and (iii)\
    \ in order to make\nrouting efﬁcient, wireless nodes must have accurate knowledge\
    \ of the links connecting them\nto their 1-hop neighbors. In detail, an IEEE 802.11s\
    \ mesh network, also denoted as Mesh\nBasic Service Set (MBSS), is composed of\
    \ different logical components [35], as highlighted\nin Figure 1: (i) mesh stations\
    \ (mesh STAs), participating in the creation of the MBSS (with\nno hierarchical\
    \ structure), having the same computational capabilities, and being involved\n\
    into path selection and packet forwarding (thus leading to a very simple self-organizing\n\
    network); (ii) Mesh Access Points (MAPs), required to integrate a MBSS with other\
    \ types of\nnetworks and to provide access to external networks; and (iii) mesh\
    \ gates, corresponding\nto logical components enabling the integration between\
    \ MBSS and infrastructure BSS (thus\nenabling the communication between mesh STAs\
    \ and non-mesh STAs). Finally, in order\nto enable the communication with non-IEEE\
    \ 802.11 Local Area Networks (LANs), other\nlogical components, denoted as Mesh\
    \ Portal Points (MPPs), should be used to enable\ninteractions with external entities.\n\
    Comparing a traditional IEEE 802.11 network with an IEEE 802.11s-based mesh\n\
    network, the latter has some advantages: (i) it enables low-cost and rapid deployment,\n\
    providing coverage in scenarios where wired networking is difﬁcult; (ii) it is\
    \ scalable and\nself-organizing, since, thanks to the routing algorithm adopted\
    \ inside the mesh, the network\ncan quickly adapt to the presence of a new joining\
    \ node; and (iii) it can provide greater\ncoverage, exploiting multi-hop forwarding.\
    \ However, there are also some drawbacks:\n(i) the wireless medium is, in general,\
    \ less reliable than the wired medium, and (ii) the data\nrate is a decreasing\
    \ function of the number of hops.\nIn an IEEE 802.11s-based network, the topology\
    \ formation phase is based on the trans-\nmission of messages, denoted as beacons,\
    \ carrying information about the network itself.\nThen, the ﬁrst phase of the\
    \ mesh network’s creation is the discovery phase, which could\nfollow either a\
    \ passive approach (scanning to receive on-the-air beacon frames) or an active\n\
    approach (transmitting probe frames). In this phase, each mesh STA transmits beacon\n\
    frames (used also for topology maintenance and synchronization) and responds with\
    \ probe\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n6 of 32\nresponse frames when a probe request frame\
    \ is received, thus advertising its presence to its\nneighbors. As a side note,\
    \ we highlight how one of the most important values exchanged\nwithin beacons\
    \ and probe response frames is the Mesh ID, used to identify a speciﬁc MBSS.\n\
    Then, once a mesh STA identiﬁes the correct wireless node, the link is established\
    \ and\nmaintained through the Mesh Peer (Link) Management (MPM) protocol [10],\
    \ until mesh\nSTAs share a common proﬁle.\nNon-IEEE 802 LAN\nMPP\nMesh Gate\n\

    \ mesh gates, and MPPs,\nas designed in the IEEE 802.11s standard [10].\nFinally,\
    \ IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networks can cope with different routing algorithms.\n\
    The default routing protocol for this kind of networks is the Hybrid Wireless\
    \ Mesh Proto-\ncol (HWMP) [36], providing both proactive and reactive path selection\
    \ and being based\non the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) [37] routing\
    \ protocol. To be precise,\nthe AODV protocol is properly adapted to supporting\
    \ MAC layer routing and giving\na tree-oriented mechanism, where a mesh STA (generally\
    \ working as an MPP) forwards\ncontrol messages to other mesh STAs. Nevertheless,\
    \ other solutions, based on AODV and\nthe Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR)\
    \ protocol [38], can be adopted. Among them,\nthe most relevant are B.A.T.M.A.N.\
    \ [31] and Babel [39,40].\nOne of the motivations for the use of IEEE 802.11s-based\
    \ mesh networking inside UAV\nswarms is direct visibility among ﬂying UAVs, especially\
    \ if ﬂying at high altitude (namely,\nat an altitude over 50 m). This allows Wi-Fi\
    \ radio signals to propagate without any physical\nobstacle (e.g., trees, buildings,\
    \ walls, etc.) and almost abiding by the Free Space Path Loss\n(FSPL) law (i.e.,\
    \ Friis formula) for radio signal propagation in LOS environments [41,42].\nNote\
    \ also that, when ﬂying over urban areas, residential Wi-Fi APs may interfere.\
    \ Hence,\nincreasing the UAV’s ﬂight altitude could further limit the detrimental\
    \ effect of urban\n(terrestrial) Wi-Fi networks on the IEEE 802.11s mesh-based\
    \ networking in the UAV swarm\nand could increase the operational range, given\
    \ a limited noise ﬂoor on the Wi-Fi car-\nrier frequency spectrum. In any case,\
    \ the adoption of mesh networking in UAV-centric\nscenarios should either consider\
    \ the inner features of these mobile environments—e.g.,\ntheir volatility because\
    \ of limited battery energy, frequent topological changes, etc.—and\nthus consider\
    \ how mesh-oriented protocols perform in situations where, for limited time\n\
    intervals, loops and non-optimal paths among the drones may appear. Even if this\
    \ may\nbe seen as a limitation, it still represents an interesting research ﬁeld\
    \ due to the current\nadoption of UAVs in heterogeneous scenarios and their increasing\
    \ involvement in various\nproduction sectors.\nAdditionally, as UAV environments\
    \ are volatile because of several issues such as\nbattery limitations, topological\
    \ changes are frequent. When using the protocols mentioned\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n\
    7 of 32\nabove (AODV or OLSR, for instance), loops and nonoptimal paths between\
    \ UAVs may\noccur for a given time. I think this potential limitation (or others\
    \ thought by the authors)\ncan be included in the description.\nIn such an IEEE\
    \ 802.11s mesh network, ﬂying drones close to each other (within a cer-\ntain\
    \ distance, ranging from a few hundreds of meters up to one or more kilometers)\
    \ can\ndirectly communicate with each other using the IEEE 802.11s protocol. With\
    \ reference\nto Figure 2, an IEEE 802.11s-based mesh network may involve different\
    \ types of communi-\ncation nodes and may be structured by the following logical\
    \ layers Lx (note that nodes at\nL0 may be either terrestrial or aerial but higher\
    \ layers, such as L1, L2, etc., are associated\nwith aerial nodes, i.e., UAVs):\n\
    •\none (or more) root nodes at L0 and connected to the Internet (e.g., through\
    \ a terrestrial\nWi-Fi AP, a LoRaWAN network interface, or a UAV with an on-board\
    \ LTE cellular\nnetwork connection);\n•\none (or more) intermediate nodes connected\
    \ to an upper-layer node (e.g., at L1,\nan upper layer is one of the available\
    \ root nodes located at L0) and, in turn, providing\nconnectivity to lower-layer\
    \ intermediate nodes, also denoted as “leaf” nodes;\n•\none (or more) leaf nodes,\
    \ exploiting the network connectivity offered by upper-layer\nintermediate nodes\
    \ and not acting as relays for any other UAV.\nFigure 2. IEEE 802.11s mesh network-enabled\
    \ UAV swarm with a single “root node” connected to\nthe Internet, involving nodes\
    \ located at different layers and with different roles.\nWith reference to the\
    \ layered mesh network shown in Figure 2, a structured mesh\nnetwork could be\
    \ considered to have at least one root node that, in the case of a UAV\nswarm,\
    \ resides at L0 and may be connected to a ground IEEE 802.11s AP, thus providing\n\
    an Internet connectivity to the other swarm ﬂying UAVs. Hence, given the operational\n\
    range of the IEEE 802.11s protocol, which can be increased and extended toward\
    \ a certain\narea through the adoption of directional antennas, it is possible\
    \ to use the IEEE 802.11s\nprotocol also to connect ﬂying UAVs with the ground\
    \ station, thus establishing a high-\nspeed bidirectional connection among these\
    \ entities and providing an Internet connectivity\nto the whole UAV swarm.\n3.2.\
    \ LoRa and LoRaWAN Protocols\nLoRaWAN is a long-range communication protocol [43]\
    \ often used to create Low\nPower Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) with a transmission\
    \ range from about 300 m up to\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n8 of 32\nabout 15 km. In Figure\
    \ 3, we map LoRa and LoRaWAN on the ISO/OSI layered model:\nLoRa is a proprietary\
    \ modulation (patented by Semtech Corporation [5], the only LoRa\ntransceiver\
    \ chip manufacturer) based on Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) and associated\nwith\
    \ the PHY layer, while LoRaWAN is a MAC layer protocol, which relies on LoRa\n\
    at the PHY layer and implements an open network architecture regulated by the\
    \ LoRa\nAlliance. Moreover, LoRaWAN deﬁnes the network media access layer rules,\
    \ authentication\nmethod, device proﬁle, and data encryption.\nFigure 3. LoRaWAN\
    \ and LoRa ISO/OSI model layers.\n3.2.1. LoRa Protocol\nLoRa modems modulate symbols\
    \ into increasing and decreasing frequency chirps, de-\nnoted as up-chirps and\
    \ down-chirps, respectively. Then, each LoRa transmission has a Pream-\nble and\
    \ a Start-of-Frame-Delimiter (SFD), which precede the payload data in order to\
    \ allow\nthe LoRa receiver to correctly decode the incoming transmission. In turn,\
    \ Preamble and\nSFD have different polarities [44,45], so they use up-chirps and\
    \ down-chirps, respectively,\ndepending on these polarity settings (further details\
    \ are provided in Section 4.2).\nDepending on the geographical region of the system\
    \ [46] and the PHY protocol deﬁni-\ntion, it is possible to partially manually\
    \ tune the following LoRa modulation parameters:\n•\nCarrier Frequency (CF), used\
    \ for both transmission and listening operations and de-\npending on the operational\
    \ region: in Europe, the LoRa operational CF is the EU\n863–870 MHz ISM band,\
    \ while in US, the 902–928 MHz ISM band is used.\n•\nBandwidth (BW), representing\
    \ the width of the power spectrum density of LoRa RF\nsignal. It is typically\
    \ set to 125 kHz, but can be increased up to 250 kHz or even\n500 kHz in some\
    \ regions by setting speciﬁc modulations parameters.\n•\nCoding Rate (CR), deﬁning\
    \ the Forward Error Correction (FEC) rate of the channel\ncode used at the PHY\
    \ layer in order to limit the detrimental impact of RF interference.\nIn particular,\
    \ it affects the symbol airtime: decreasing the CR increases the symbol\noverhead\
    \ (the control redundancy increases) and extends the transmission airtime.\nThe\
    \ default value of the CR is equal to 4/5.\n•\nSpreading Factor (SF), representing\
    \ the chirp spreading parameter and defining how many\nchirps are sent per second.\
    \ It ranges from SF7 and SF12. In detail, a large SF increases\nthe symbol airtime\
    \ and the energy consumption, thus improving the communication\nrange but reducing\
    \ the available data rate and the messages’ payload size [47].\n•\nTransmission\
    \ Power (TP), identifying the energy irradiated by the LoRa node’s antenna.\n\
    It can range from −4 dBm to +20 dBm, but different regions could have different\
    \ power\nlimits (for example, in Europe, the upper bound is +14 dBm).\n•\nChirp\
    \ Polarity (IQ), deﬁning the polarity of the transmitted chirps. In detail, the\
    \ polarity\nis often deﬁned by the speciﬁc protocol implementation (e.g., LoRaWAN\
    \ GWs transmit\npackets to end nodes using an inverted polarity modulation, so\
    \ that these messages are\ndiscarded by neighbor GWs, while end devices transmit\
    \ packets using non-inverted\npolarity in order to be received by multiple GWs).\n\
    •\nSync Word, a 1-byte value parameter deﬁned by the last two up-chirps of the\
    \ LoRa’s\nPreamble and used to differentiate LoRa networks using the same frequency\
    \ bands [48].\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n9 of 32\nTherefore, any device conﬁgured with\
    \ a given Sync Word will discard any incoming\ntransmission if the Sync Word does\
    \ not match its own. More precisely, default values\nassumed by the Sync Word\
    \ byte value for private LoRa networks are 0x12 for Semtech\nSX127x devices and\
    \ 0x1424 for SX126x devices; instead, public LoRa networks (such\nas LoRaWAN or\
    \ The Things Network, TTN [7]) will be represented by values equal to\n0x34 for\
    \ Semtech SX127x devices and to 0x3444 for SX126x devices [49].\nTherefore, the\
    \ choice of LoRa modulation parameters heavily affects its operational\nranges,\
    \ power consumption, message payload sizes, and medium utilization, thus limiting\n\
    the number of active devices in the operational area. Proper selection of the\
    \ values of\nthe LoRa modulation parameters is crucial.\n3.2.2. LoRaWAN Protocol\n\
    In addition to the concepts discussed in Section 3.2, LoRaWAN deﬁnes different\
    \ rules\nneeded to create a multi-star network topology composed by several LoRaWAN\
    \ end nodes\nand GWs, while its MAC layer is based on the ALOHA protocol [50].\
    \ The GWs, in turn,\nact as bridges between on-ﬁeld LoRaWAN devices and upper-layer\
    \ components, such as\nLoRaWAN Network Servers (NSs) and Application Servers (ASs),\
    \ thus being connected\nwith IP-based networks and delivering data from end nodes\
    \ to high layer systems and\nvice-versa.\nLoRaWAN end devices can be separated\
    \ in three different classes—namely Classes A,\nB, and C—according to the behavior\
    \ of the end node in terms of downlink/uplink trans-\nmission schedule from a\
    \ GW to the end node itself. All LoRaWAN end nodes must possess\nClass A features,\
    \ whereas Class B and Class C devices extend these features. We now\nprovide a\
    \ few details about each class.\n•\nClass A devices should support bidirectional\
    \ communication but with a speciﬁc\nlimitation: uplink (transmit) messages can\
    \ be sent at any time by the end device,\nwhile downlink (receive) messages can\
    \ be received only during two speciﬁc reception\nwindows at speciﬁc time instants\
    \ (just after an uplink transmission) before going\nback to sleep, as shown at\
    \ the top of Figure 4. More in detail, after a ﬁrst time\ninterval RXdelay−1 after\
    \ the end of the uplink transmission interval TX, a Class A\ndevice will open\
    \ a short receive window RX1 listening to the same frequency band\nused to transmit\
    \ (uplink) the previous message. Then, if no downlink message is\nreceived during\
    \ this interval, the end device opens a second receive window (RX2)\nafter a second\
    \ ﬁxed time interval RXdelay−2 (calculated from the end of TX) on\na speciﬁc frequency\
    \ band known by the end devices and gateways [51]. However,\nit is noteworthy\
    \ to highlight that, despite RXdelay−1 and RXdelay−2 being generally\nset to 1\
    \ s and 2 s, respectively, they may assume region-speciﬁc values and can be\n\
    conﬁgured by the LoRaWAN network operator [52]. Class A end devices guarantee\n\
    the lowest energy consumption.\n•\nClass B devices are suitable for more downlink-demanding\
    \ activities, since addi-\ntional regularly scheduled, ﬁxed-time receive windows\
    \ are deﬁned in the LoRaWAN\nnetwork in addition to those of Class A, as shown\
    \ in the middle of Figure 4. More\nin detail, a time-synchronized beacon BCN is\
    \ broadcast periodically by the network\nvia the LoRaWAN GWs, and Class B end\
    \ devices must periodically receive one of\nthese BCNs in order to align their\
    \ internal clock with the LoRaWAN NS—beacons\nare transmitted by LoRaWAN GWs every\
    \ Tbeacon = 128 s, with this beaconing period\nrepresenting a tradeoff between\
    \ GW transmit duty cycle’s minimization and end de-\nvice’s power consumption\
    \ [53]. Therefore, on the basis of the beacon timing reference,\nClass B devices\
    \ can periodically open additional receive windows deﬁned as ping\nslots (PNGs),\
    \ any of which may be used by the LoRaWAN NS to initiate a downlink\ncommunication\
    \ and with a ping slot periodicity Tping ∈ [1, 128] s.\n•\nClass C devices are\
    \ appropriate for downlink-intensive scenarios, keeping their recep-\ntion windows\
    \ open unless they are transmitting—this strongly increases their power\nconsumption\
    \ but offers the lowest latency for communication between LoRaWAN NS\nDrones 2021,\
    \ 5, 26\n10 of 32\nand end devices. As a side effect, the use of portable batteries\
    \ for Class C devices is\ntypically unfeasible. We remark that a LoRaWAN end device\
    \ cannot simultaneously\nbelong to Class B and Class C [54]. More in detail, Class\
    \ C end devices perform as\nClass A ones—implementing the same receive windows\
    \ RX1 and RX2—keeping,\nhowever, their RX2 window open until their next TX uplink\
    \ window: this allows\nClass C devices to receive downlink messages during their\
    \ RX2 window at almost\nany time. Finally, between the end of TX and the beginning\
    \ of RX1, an additional\nshort receive window RXadd (at the RX2 frequency and\
    \ data rate) is also opened.\nFigure 4. LoRaWAN class behaviors.\nIn order to\
    \ transmit and receive data over LoRAWAN networks, LoRaWAN end\nnodes must be\
    \ registered and enabled on the AS of the LoRaWAN network provider,\nwhich manages\
    \ the LoRaWAN GWs. A LoRaWAN-enabled device can join the network\nin two ways:\
    \ with the Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) method or with the Activation-\nBy-Personalization\
    \ (ABP) method. While both approaches are effective, OTAA is more\nsecure, since\
    \ each time the end node sends a join-request packet; it receives a join-accept\n\
    with (i) the network identiﬁer (NetID), (ii) a 32-bit identiﬁer of the end device\
    \ within the net-\nwork (DevAddr), and (ii) a security nonce value (AppNonce),\
    \ which will be used by the device\nto generate a network’s session key (NwkSKey)\
    \ and an application session key (AppSKey)\nin a secure way. Oppositely, an ABP-activated\
    \ device is internally equipped with DevAddr,\nAppSkey, and NwkSkey, which will\
    \ be sent over the LoRaWAN network at each transmission,\nin order to identify\
    \ the transmitting node itself.\nAs discussed in Section 3.2.1, each LoRa transmission\
    \ is associated with a speciﬁc\nSF deﬁning the airtime duration of the symbols\
    \ and other signal features. Focusing\non the LoRa EU 868 MHz band, SF7 allows\
    \ for higher data rates and the shortest symbol\nairtime while SF12 guarantees\
    \ the highest sensitivity (the weakest signal that a receiver\nis able to identify\
    \ and process) and longest transmission range at the cost of lowest data\nrate\
    \ and highest energy consumption. One of the main aspects to be taken into account\
    \ is\nthe maximum packet payload allowed for each SF. The LoRaWAN Network layer\
    \ (NET)\ntypically uses a 13-byte packet header for the protocol operation: this\
    \ is a nonnegligible\nvalue that, at high SFs, signiﬁcantly affects the maximum\
    \ available payload. More precisely,\nthe maximum payload size is reached with\
    \ SF7, which allows for a maximum of 222 bytes\nof data inside a single LoRa packet.\
    \ The minimum, instead, is reached with SF12, with\na maximum of 51 bytes for\
    \ user data. In Table 1, we summarized the values of payload\nlimit, data rate,\
    \ bitrate, receiver sensitivity, and typical operational range associated with\n\
    each SF. In all cases, a bandwidth of 125 kHz at a CF equal to 868 MHz is considered.\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 26\n11 of 32\nTable 1. LoRaWAN transmission parameters on the\

    \ protocol in Europe uses 8 uplink channels (from end nodes to GWs)\ndeﬁned inside\
    \ the EU 863–870 MHz free ISM band. These uplink channels can also\nbe used as\
    \ downlink channels on the ﬁrst receiving window. There exists also a ninth\n\
    uplink channel, deﬁned at 868.8 MHz frequency and using a Frequency-Shift Keying\
    \ (FSK)\nmodulation, and a ninth downlink channel, deﬁned at 869.525 MHz frequency\
    \ and used\nonly for the second receiving window. In order to better highlight\
    \ the frequency availability\nin Europe, in Figure 5, we show a graphical representation\
    \ of uplink and downlink channels\ndeﬁned in the EU 863–870 MHz free ISM band.\n\
    Figure 5. Available LoRaWAN uplink and downlink channels deﬁned in the EU 863-870\
    \ MHz frequency spectrum.\nIn terms of network utilization, LoRaWAN abides by\
    \ the following policy rules to be\nstrictly followed to guarantee fair utilization:\n\
    •\nany LoRaWAN-enabled device has a daily maximum cumulative airtime of 30 s for\n\
    uplink messages;\n•\nany LoRaWAN-enabled device has a maximum of 10 daily downlink\
    \ messages (in-\ncluding also acknowledgment (ACK) messages).\nMoreover, the transmission\
    \ airtime strictly depends on both SF and messages pay-\nload [56]: as an example,\
    \ a ﬁxed 10-byte payload translates to up to 20 daily uplink\nmessages with SF12\
    \ or around 500 daily uplink messages with SF7. Additionally, Lo-\nRaWAN devices\
    \ must abide by the band duty cycle [57], which depends on the regional\narea\
    \ of use and is deﬁned as the maximum time percentage usage of a channel [58].\
    \ For the\nEU 868 MHz free band, the duty cycle goes from 0.1% to 10%, depending\
    \ on the used\nchannel. This means that, every time a device transmits over a\
    \ LoRaWAN channel, it cannot\ntransmit on the channel for a certain amount of\
    \ time, which depends on the performed\ntransmission airtime. Finally, another\
    \ constraint that LoRaWAN devices must satisfy is\nrelated to the maximum transmit\
    \ power, which, for the EU868 band, is set to +14 dBm,\nas deﬁned by the European\
    \ Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n12 of 32\n\
    Given the discussed features of LoRa and LoRaWAN protocols (especially the long\n\
    -ange transmissions in direct LOS conditions), these protocols become attractive\
    \ in scenar-\nios involving UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-ground communications, especially\
    \ in all those\nscenarios where a Wi-Fi AP is not available or the operational\
    \ area is too large (and cannot\nbe covered) for a mesh network among ﬂying UAVs\
    \ based on IEEE 802.11s.\n4. Proposed Hybrid Mesh Network\nThe hybrid network\
    \ architecture proposed in this work is based on two overlaid mesh\nlayers based\
    \ on different communication protocols, namely IEEE 802.11s and a novel LoRa-\n\
    based mesh protocol. The switching mechanism between the two layers and their\
    \ hybrid\nuse are detailed in Section 5, with a description of the various network\
    \ conﬁgurations that\ncan be implemented. In the current section, the proposed\
    \ architectures of IEEE 802.11s and\nLoRa-based layers are discussed, highlighting\
    \ suitable implementations.\n4.1. IEEE 802.11s Mesh Network Layer Implementation\n\
    The deployment of an IEEE 802.11s mesh network based on the concepts discussed\n\
    in Section 3.1 could be based on the adoption of the IEEE 802.11s protocol, where\
    \ multi-\nple network entities are combined together in order to create a structured\
    \ IEEE 802.11s\nmesh network.\nIn order to associate IEEE 802.11s entities with\
    \ ﬂying UAVs, one can map the root node\nwith the IEEE 802.11s MPP, in turn connected\
    \ to the ground through an IEEE 802.11s GW\nAP. Then, intermediate and leaf nodes\
    \ can be seen as MPs, able to connect and reconﬁgure\ntheir links towards close\
    \ MPs in order to keep the mesh network active. Alternatively,\nin order to include\
    \ in the IEEE 802.11s mesh network other inexpensive IEEE 802.11-enabled\nUAV\
    \ nodes (as STAs), some MPs could act as MAPs, thus providing network connectivity\n\
    to particular types, of leaf nodes. In order to better clarify this association,\
    \ in Figure 6\na reference scenario is shown.\nFigure 6. UAV IEEE 802.11s-enabled\
    \ mesh nodes roles.\nTherefore, adopting this approach, it is possible to let\
    \ the swarm dynamically adapt to\nmoving nodes (i.e., UAVs) joining the mesh network\
    \ and looking for the “best” neighbor\nnode with which to connect, in turn evaluated\
    \ and elected through an opportunistic\nselection mechanism based on heterogeneous\
    \ parameters and indicators and described\nin Section 5.1.\n4.2. Proposed LoRa-Based\
    \ Access and Mesh Networking\nWe assume that data exchange exploits: (i) LoRa\
    \ communications, operating at SF7,\n125 kHz bandwidth, and inverted polarity,\
    \ in order to mitigate the interference between\nraw LoRa messages among UAVs\
    \ and terrestrial LoRaWAN networks and (ii) LoRaWAN\nmessages between end nodes\
    \ and GWs. Based on the discussion for signal polarity\nin Section 3.2.1 and owing\
    \ to the fact that most of the trafﬁc in LoRaWAN networks is given\nDrones 2021,\
    \ 5, 26\n13 of 32\nby uplink packets, in the proposed raw LoRa implementation,\
    \ polarity inversion is adopted\nin order to minimize packet collisions between\
    \ raw LoRa packets and LoRaWAN messages.\nAs an additional discussion point, the\
    \ decision to adopt SF7 may be motivated by\nthe following several reasons.\n\
    •\nSF7 allows us to maximize the payload size: 222 bytes for LoRaWAN and 240 bytes\n\
    for LoRa communications.\n•\nSF7 guarantees the highest bitrate and the shortest\
    \ symbol airtime, thus minimizing\neffective channel utilization rate and packet\
    \ collisions and maximizing the number of\noperating devices and, therefore, exchanged\
    \ messages.\n•\nSF7 is particularly suited for mobile devices equipped with LoRa-enabled\
    \ radio\ntransceivers, such as ﬂying UAVs (typically ﬂying in a speed range between\
    \ 20 km/h\nand 70 km/h, and is less affected by the Doppler shift effect [59]).\
    \ Oppositely,\nhigher SFs (e.g., SF12) are more affected by the Doppler shift\
    \ effect, in particular\nat speeds higher than 40 km/h, where the higher packet\
    \ loss makes the communica-\ntion unreliable.\n•\nSF7 represents the best choice\
    \ even considering that the duty cycle policy deﬁned\nfor the EU 863–870 MHz band\
    \ [57] requires that each transmission act is followed\nby an off-period without\
    \ any new transmission. Given that this off-period heavily\ndepends on the transmission\
    \ airtime, then the chosen SF has an important role: SF7\nhas the lowest off-period\
    \ between consecutive messages, given the lower symbol time.\nAnother key characteristic\
    \ of LoRa—and, thus, of LoRaWAN—that could be exploited\nis related to the fact\
    \ that no speciﬁc association is needed between an end node and a GW,\nor among\
    \ two end nodes, since each LoRa-enabled device listens for incoming messages\n\
    sent by neighbor devices (forwarding LoRa-modulated packets) using the same frequency\n\
    and modulation parameters. This highlights how LoRa could be useful for and is\
    \ applicable\nto long-range broadcasting applications, in which one or more nodes\
    \ send their messages\nin-air and nearby devices can hear them. In other words,\
    \ this corresponds to a point-to-\nmultipoint communication. Moreover, if compared\
    \ with typical cellular networks, it is\nclear how LoRa uplink and downlink operations\
    \ have almost the same link budget. Hence,\nif a device can receive a LoRa message\
    \ from a nearby device, it can also send a LoRa\nmessage that can be heard by\
    \ the originator node. In the end, this feature paves the way\nfor the use of\
    \ LoRa for the deﬁnition of enhanced broadcasting mechanisms between ﬂying\nUAVs\
    \ over a very wide area.\nFocusing on the broadcasting mechanism, we propose a\
    \ Time Division Multiple Access\n(TDMA) scheduling of the LoRa PHY Access layer\
    \ through consecutive “slots”. In turn,\neach slot is characterized by a transmission\
    \ window structured as follows: (i) a Listen-\nBefore-Talk (LBT) mechanism, associated\
    \ with a random delay interval Tdelay (if needed),\nand (ii) the LoRa message’s\
    \ transmission time TXLoRa, depending on the adopted SF\n(e.g., SF7) and on the\
    \ amount of symbols (thus, the amount of bytes) to be transmitted.\nThen, the\
    \ transmission window is followed by a listening window RXLoRa, during which\n\
    the node listens to the LoRa channel for incoming messages broadcast by other\
    \ UAVs\nwithinthe transmission range. For the sake of clarity, in Figure 7, a\
    \ graphical representation\nof the proposed TMDA-oriented LoRa-based broadcasting\
    \ mechanism is shown.\nActually, the time duration has been deﬁned neither for\
    \ the receiver window RXLoRa\nnor for the initial random delay TXdelay. However,\
    \ RXLoRa should be at least longer than\nthe duty cycle transmission off-period,\
    \ which depends on the transmitted message’s length,\nairtime, and ETSI band duty\
    \ cycle policy [60]. Moreover, the receiver window duration\nshould also depend\
    \ on the amount of active UAVs in the swarm and on the number of\nmessages: it\
    \ should be optimized in order to minimize the possible packets collisions of\n\
    the LoRa PHY layer. Again, these parameters have an impact on the system payload’s\n\
    capabilities, since the interval between messages deﬁnes the available output\
    \ messages\nand, therefore, the aggregated payload capacity of the system.\nDrones\

    \ mechanism to be applied in UAV-to-\nUAV communications. In detail, Tdelay is\
    \ the initial random delay introduced in order to minimize\nthe possible packet\
    \ collision on the LoRa PHY layer, TXLoRa is the packet’s transmission time,\n\
    and RXLoRa is the listening window on the medium.\nIn general, the SF could be\
    \ properly tuned in order to improve the overall performance.\nOn the basis of\
    \ a preliminary experimental performance evaluation on the LoRa communi-\ncation\
    \ range for UAV application, discussed in Section 6, it is possible to anticipate\
    \ that SF7\nrepresents a viable choice for many application scenarios—this is\
    \ also why SF7 has been\nselected at the beginning of this subsection.\n4.2.1.\
    \ LoRa-Based UAV-to-UAV Mesh Communication\nAs highlighted before, while LoRa\
    \ can be used for point-to-point communication\nand LoRaWAN for star topology\
    \ networks with many end nodes and at least one central\nGW, there is not a well-deﬁned\
    \ LoRa-based mesh network standard. This is likely due to\nthe constraints of\
    \ LoRa, making it unsuitable for mesh networking with multi-hop com-\nmunications.\
    \ This has been conﬁrmed both theoretically and experimentally. An example\nis\
    \ given in [61], where a hybrid LoRaWAN-LoRa mesh network with LoRa relay nodes\
    \ is\nproposed, aiming to extend the operating range of the LoRaWAN star topology.\
    \ However,\nthis study does not consider mobile nodes and interfering signals,\
    \ such as in the UAV-\nto-UAV application scenario of interest to us, in which\
    \ a large amount of LoRa nodes is\ninvolved. Another research activity is deﬁned\
    \ in [62], where a network testbed composed\nof a larger (with respect to the\
    \ study shown in [61]) amount of nodes is considered and\nthe current limitations\
    \ of a possible LoRa-based mesh network are investigated. Moreover,\nin [62],\
    \ the authors observed a strong performance degradation—in terms of latency with\n\
    respect to a traditional LoRaWAN star topology network. A last reference work\
    \ is [63],\nwhere a LoRaWAN alternative implementation supporting mesh networking\
    \ was pro-\nposed, suggesting an alternative GW implementation, in order to support\
    \ multi-channels\nLoRa RF signal communications, to limit packets collisions,\
    \ and to increase the number\nof supported nodes. Despite this high-level description,\
    \ no theoretical or experimental\nresults of the proposed modiﬁed LoRaWAN-mesh\
    \ protocol were discussed, thus limiting\nits applicability for a LoRa-based UAV\
    \ mesh network.\nIn order to overcome some of the limitations highlighted in the\
    \ above cited works\nand to provide additional functionalities to let LoRa and\
    \ IEEE 802.11s protocols coex-\nist on mobile nodes (i.e., UAVs), our proposed\
    \ hybrid approach tries also to cope with\nthe high latency and low data rate\
    \ of LoRa (playing a critical role in the whole system\ndeﬁnition), adopting a\
    \ SF equal to SF7. Moreover, in order to minimize the air time of\nthe transmitted\
    \ messages through the LoRa network interface and to maximize the pay-\nload capacity\
    \ of the network, our solution adopts the TDMA-oriented access mechanism\npresented\
    \ in Figure 7, with alternating transmitting and listening windows with different\n\
    lengths, taking also into account the number of active UAVs in the swarm. As discussed\n\
    in Section 4.2, each node implements a LBT mechanism in which, ﬁrst, if an activity\
    \ is\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n15 of 32\ndetected on the channel, a node randomly delays\
    \ its transmission; then, at the end of\nthe random delay, it transmits; and,\
    \ ﬁnally, it establishes a receiving window, which has to\nbe set on the basis\
    \ of the number of ﬂying UAVs.\nMore in detail, each packet transmitted on the\
    \ LoRa-based broadcast mesh network\nhas a two-fold goal.\n1.\nBroadcast the UAV’s\
    \ position data (GNSS) and ground connection status (if any): these\ndata are\
    \ needed to create a robust mesh network (both with IEEE 802.11s and LoRa)\nand\
    \ to evaluate the position of nearby moving UAVs and their ground connections\n\
    (if available) in order to establish which will be the next node in the case of\
    \ link failure\nor out-of-range position.\n2.\nTransmit content data and LoRa\
    \ mesh conﬁguration data: the ﬁrst are data sent from\na UAV toward another UAV\
    \ in the swarm—thus an addressing mechanism is needed\ninside the swarm—or to\
    \ the ground control center, while the second are essential data\nfor mesh conﬁguration\
    \ (e.g., nearby nodes for each UAV, paths, etc.) that should be\nupdated upon\
    \ a change in the surrounding environment (given the mobile nature of\nthe system).\n\
    Given LoRa constraints, in order to avoid packet collisions, the above data must\n\
    be aggregated in the same packet, thus requiring the deﬁnition of a proper encoding\n\
    mechanism to easily allow UAVs in the swarm to evaluate the data and to minimize\n\
    channel use. As can be easily understood, this may require us to use the maximum\
    \ payload\ninside each packet in order to avoid using the channel for multiple\
    \ messages, thus reducing\npacket collisions and resource utilization.\nA graphical\
    \ representation of the proposed packet structure is shown in Figure 8,\nwhile\
    \ the single ﬁelds composing the packet are detailed in the following:\n•\nIDtxnode:\
    \ a 1-byte unique identiﬁer of the UAV, able to identify up to 256 entities.\n\
    In our proposed solution, only 254 identiﬁers can be used, since values 0 and\
    \ 255 are\nreserved for speciﬁc uses.\n•\nCONtype: a 1-byte identiﬁer indicating\
    \ the ground connection of the node, if available.\nIn detail, it can assume the\
    \ following values:\n–\n0 (default value), if the node is not connected to the\
    \ ground;\n–\n1, if the node is connected to the ground through an IEEE 802.11s\
    \ AP;\n–\n2, if the node is connected to the ground through a LoRaWAN link; and\n\
    –\n3, if the node is connected to the ground through an intermediate IEEE 802.11s\n\
    AP on-board a nearby UAV.\n•\nGNSSdata: a 10-byte ﬁeld, in detail containing the\
    \ latitude (GNSSlat, 4 bytes), the lon-\ngitude (GNSSlng, 4 bytes), and the auxiliary\
    \ altitude (GNSSalt, 2 bytes), encoded as\nfloat and short int.\n•\nIDrxnode:\
    \ similarly to the IDtxnode ﬁeld, it is a 1-byte unique identiﬁer representing\n\
    a preliminary ﬁeld needed for data transmissions between ﬂying UAVs (both unicast\n\
    and broadcast) and to the ground center and able to assume only 254 values (0\
    \ refers\nto the ground control center, while 255 refers to a broadcast communication\
    \ between\nall ﬂying UAVs).\n•\nMESHconﬁgdata: a variable-size ﬁeld (2 ÷ 6 bytes)\
    \ containing different information,\nsuch as (i) the number of hops crossed by\
    \ the messages, (ii) the last hop identiﬁer,\nand (iii) other parameters needed\
    \ to update the created LoRa mesh network.\n•\nPAYLOAD: a variable-size ﬁeld (0\
    \ ÷ 200 bytes, given the LoRaWAN constraints at\nSF7) representing the actual\
    \ data payload that a UAV needs to transmit to other UAVs.\nFigure 8. LoRa mesh\
    \ packet structure, data, and ﬁeld sizes.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n16 of 32\nThe packet\
    \ structure shown in Figure 8 is used both (i) for the mesh initial setup,\nwhere\
    \ the PAYLOAD ﬁeld can be used to broadcast the initial conﬁguration data together\n\
    with CONtype and MESHconﬁgdata ﬁelds, and (ii) for the LoRa mesh network’s update\
    \ and\ndata communication between UAVs.\n4.2.2. UAV-to-Ground Communications through\
    \ LoRaWAN\nWhile raw LoRa protocol can be used for UAV-to-UAV communications,\
    \ as discussed\nin Section 4.2.1, LoRaWAN could instead be used for UAV-to-ground\
    \ communications\nin order to exploit already existing LoRaWAN networks, such\
    \ as The Things Network\n(TTN) [7]. The wide coverage of such networks, together\
    \ with the achievable operational\nrange, guarantees a UAV-to-ground communication\
    \ alternative to an IEEE 802.11s link for\nessential data exchange, useful in\
    \ all those cases where IEEE 802.11s is not effective or out\nof range. However,\
    \ this LoRaWAN-oriented solution has drawbacks, especially because its\nconstraints\
    \ discussed in Section 3.2.2, namely (i) the strict downlink policy, (ii) the\
    \ limited\ndata rate, and (iii) the duty cycle, almost neglect any real-time communication\
    \ among\nLoRaWAN devices, thus limiting this use case only to essential data transmission.\n\
    4.2.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN Communications Deployment\nIn order to support the data\
    \ transmission patterns detailed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2,\ntwo approaches\
    \ can be followed:\n•\n(i) use of a single COTS board, equipped with two distinct\
    \ LoRa modems, or (ii) the adop-\ntion of two distinct boards, each one equipped\
    \ with a single LoRa modem, in order\nto reserve one modem for UAV-to-UAV raw\
    \ LoRa-based broadcasting and the other\nmodem for UAV-to-ground communications\
    \ via LoRaWAN;\n•\nuse of a single COTS board with a single LoRa modem, used,\
    \ according to a time\ndivision strategy, by switching between LoRa-based broadcasting\
    \ (UAV-to-UAV) and\nLoRaWAN (UAV-to-Ground).\nMore in detail, the ﬁrst approach\
    \ is more expensive, in terms of price, since a complex\nboard with two LoRa modems\
    \ or two single modem boards are needed, and in terms of\nhardware’s weight and\
    \ physical space, which are limited on a typical-sized UAV. However,\nthis approach\
    \ can guarantee the best performance, since there is no off-period due to\nthe\
    \ network switch (as with a single modem) and thus any software re-initialization\
    \ phases\namong the interfaces. Additionally, since each modem is dedicated to\
    \ one network, they\ncan be used in parallel at the same time. Oppositely, in\
    \ the second approach, only one\nof the two networks is active at a time and switching\
    \ time must be taken into account,\nthus reducing the effective operational time\
    \ and the total system capacity. A graphical\ncomparison between these approaches\
    \ is shown in Figure 9.\nFigure 9. Single modem-based (top) and dual modem-based\
    \ (bottom) approaches for joint LoRa (UAV-to-UAV) and\nLoRaWAN (UAV-to-ground)\
    \ connections.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n17 of 32\nWe remark that root nodes—acting\
    \ as coordinators in the LoRa mesh network and being\nthe only UAVs connected\
    \ to the ground control center though LoRaWAN—are the only\nones that need to\
    \ switch between LoRa and LoRaWAN connectivity. Therefore, only\nthese root nodes\
    \ would face the performance limits with a single-modem implementation.\nTo this\
    \ end, a possible solution to reduce performance degradation can be the predeﬁnition\n\
    of the LoRa mesh network’s root nodes, thus deploying a dual modem-based solution\n\
    on them to both communicate to the ground (through LoRaWAN) and between UAVs\n\
    (through the LoRa mesh network layer), as shown in Figure 10.\nFigure 10. Dual\
    \ LoRa modem-based implementation for root nodes.\n5. Combined Opportunistic Mesh\
    \ Networking\nAs highlighted in Section 4, the use of two different network layers\
    \ allows for the cre-\nation of a hybrid network involving multiple possible conﬁgurations,\
    \ with heterogeneous\nuse of IEEE 802.11s links and LoRa-based communications.\
    \ To this end, the key element\nenabling the deﬁnition of such a hybrid multi-protocol\
    \ mesh network is the selection mech-\nanism between them, which should properly\
    \ select the appropriate network by evaluating\nseveral parameters representative\
    \ of the requirements of a UAV swarm. In the following,\nthe proposed selection\
    \ mechanism is described in Section 5.1, while Sections 5.2 and 5.3\nfocus on\
    \ possible UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-ground network conﬁgurations, respectively.\n\
    5.1. Network Selection Mechanism\nOne of the main advantages of ﬂying communications,\
    \ as discussed in Section 1, is\nthe almost direct LOS between UAVs, which allows\
    \ for a wide operating range even with\nprotocols typically used for short-range\
    \ communications. Behind the IEEE 802.11s mesh\nbuilt-in link creation mechanism\
    \ [64], often based on link quality and path-based cost\nfunctions, when dealing\
    \ with a mobile mesh network (as a UAV swarm), there are several\nparameters to\
    \ take care of in order to establish reliable communications and ensure seamless\n\
    connectivity. In the following, the parameters considered in our proposed opportunistic\n\
    hybrid architecture are detailed.\n5.1.1. Network Communication Interface Type\n\
    As detailed in Section 4, each ﬂying UAV broadcasts the data packets described\n\
    in Section 4.2.1 through the LoRa network interface, advertising its established\
    \ connection\ntype (if any). On the basis of the best performance, in terms of\
    \ data rate and reliability, each\nUAV always puts a ﬁrst priority to the IEEE\
    \ 802.11s connectivity for both UAV-to-UAV and\nUAV-to-ground communications.\
    \ Then, if the current node cannot join the IEEE 802.11s\nmesh network (e.g.,\
    \ it is too far from either ground or UAV-transported APs), it considers\nthe\
    \ use of its LoRaWAN interface to communicate with the ground. If even LoRaWAN\n\
    communications are not possible, then a raw LoRa communication with other close\
    \ UAVs\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n18 of 32\nis considered, using the mesh networking\
    \ approach presented in Section 4.2 for both UAV-\nto-UAV and UAV-to-ground communications.\n\
    5.1.2. GNSS Position of the APs\nSince a UAV can freely move inside the swarm\
    \ (if not otherwise for some reason)\nand one of the parameters broadcast in the\
    \ packet shown in Figure 8 is its GNSS position,\na useful selection parameter\
    \ to be considered in evaluating which node to connect to\nis the GNSS position\
    \ of nearby mesh points, either being ground or UAV-based MPPs.\nTherefore, a\
    \ ﬂying UAV can choose which ground AP to connect to on the basis of (i) its\n\
    knowledge of AP positions and (ii) its ﬂight direction in order to preliminarily\
    \ prepare to\nswitch to a different AP, thus limiting the network off-period due\
    \ to AP outage. Moreover,\nGNSS positions are also useful for ﬂying communication,\
    \ since a UAV always chooses as\nﬁrst priority its nearest AP-equipped UAV, thus\
    \ prioritizing an IEEE 802.11s connection\nwith respect to a LoRa one. Again,\
    \ given the continuous broadcasting of UAV positions,\nin an advanced implementation\
    \ of the proposed opportunistic mechanism, the ﬂying\ndirections of nearby UAVs\
    \ could also be evaluated in order to optimize and prepare\nthe handover. Finally,\
    \ in the GNSS information, even nearby UAV altitudes could be used\nas a decision\
    \ parameter, since UAVs ﬂying higher have a higher probability to have direct\n\
    LOS with both ground APs and nearby UAV-transported APs, thus minimizing the number\n\
    of hops to reach an AP.\n5.1.3. RSSI of Nearby Nodes\nAn alternative to GNSS data\
    \ for all those scenarios where GNSS is unreliable or\nnot available—e.g., in\
    \ indoor environments as well as with UAVs ﬂying between high\nbuildings—could\
    \ be the RSSI retrieved by each network interface actively listening for\ntransmissions\
    \ from nearby nodes. Therefore, the RSSI might be expected to choose the best\n\
    node among the neighbors, thus representing a good link quality’s selection mechanism.\n\
    5.1.4. Network’s Hierarchical Value of Nearby Nodes\nAnother parameter that is\
    \ broadcasted together with the other mesh parameters is\nthe network layer of\
    \ the UAV. More precisely, it represents the depth of the UAV inside\nthe mesh\
    \ network, as shown in Figure 2, and it may thus be considered a “must” indicator.\n\
    As an example, among different IEEE 802.11s mesh point UAVs with almost the same\n\
    RSSI and located at almost the same distance, the current UAV, looking for nearby\
    \ nodes,\nchooses the one with the best hierarchical indicator (i.e., smallest\
    \ depth) inside the hybrid\nmesh network, thus minimizing the overall path cost\
    \ depending on the number of hops\nthat the data transmission will traverse.\n\
    5.1.5. Amount and Type of Data to Be Transmitted\nThe last parameter that can\
    \ be considered is related to the type and amount of data to\nbe forwarded from\
    \ the source UAV to the destination node (UAV or terrestrial). Since LoRa\nand\
    \ LoRaWAN can be used only for low data rates and very high latency communications,\n\
    it is natural to assume that particular applications not complying with these\
    \ constraints\n(e.g., real-time video transmission) cannot rely on these long-range\
    \ protocols. In these cases,\nthe creation of mesh networks with nearby nodes\
    \ can be made only via the IEEE 802.11s\nnetwork layer.\n5.1.6. Summary\nAs a\
    \ general summary on the selection parameters outlined above, a reference sce-\n\
    nario involving the best neighboring AP selection mechanism is shown in Figure\
    \ 11, where\na ﬂying drone is “sensing” multiple possible mesh points and is estimating\
    \ which is\nthe best one to establish a connection with. Besides link quality/availability,\
    \ the deci-\nsion needs to take into account the ﬂight plan of the UAV and the\
    \ parameters described\nin Sections 5.1.1–5.1.5.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n19 of 32\n\

    \ connection.\n5.2. UAV-to-UAV Communications\nIn the proposed hybrid mesh architecture,\
    \ UAV-to-UAV communications occur through\ntwo layers: (i) an IEEE 802.11s mesh\
    \ network layer and (ii) a LoRa-based mesh layer.\nHowever, multi-hop communications\
    \ between UAVs can occur in a third way, based on\nboth IEEE 802.11s and LoRa\
    \ links between UAVs. In the following, IEEE 802.11s- and LoRa-\nbased UAV-to-UAV\
    \ communications are discussed in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, respectively,\nwhile\
    \ a hybrid approach is detailed in Section 5.2.3.\n5.2.1. IEEE 802.11s-Enabled\
    \ UAV-to-UAV Communications\nCommunications between multiple ﬂying UAVs achieve\
    \ the highest performance\nthrough the use of the IEEE 802.11s mesh networking\
    \ that, depending on the adopted\nequipment, can support data rates on the order\
    \ of several Megabit per second (Mbps).\nIn detail, the IEEE 802.11s mesh network’s\
    \ setup and conﬁguration are carried out fol-\nlowing the protocol deﬁnition;\
    \ then activating the path selection mechanism described\nin Section 5.1; and\
    \ ﬁnally considering routing between multiples UAVs acting as MPs or,\nin case\
    \ of the root node, as a MPP, as discussed in Section 4.1. Therefore, routing\
    \ is based\non the network interface’s MAC address of each device—as deﬁned in\
    \ the IEEE 802.11s\nspeciﬁcation—jointly used together with the assigned drone\
    \ ID, which can be used as inter-\nnal parameter for routing data between both\
    \ LoRa and IEEE 802.11s layers. An example\nof a ﬂying IEEE 802.11s mesh network\
    \ among UAVs is shown in Figure 12. In this ﬁgure,\nthe IDs of the UAVs are explicitly\
    \ indicated, together with the cost of each link, deﬁned\non the basis of (i)\
    \ the number of hops needed to reach the root node, (ii) the link’s data rate,\n\
    and (iii) the link’s signal RSSI.\nFigure 12. IEEE 802.11s-enabled communications\
    \ between UAVs.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n20 of 32\n5.2.2. LoRa-Enabled UAV-to-UAV\
    \ Communications\nIn order to complement the IEEE 802.11s mesh network, proposed\
    \ in Section 5.2.1,\nused for UAV-to-UAV short-range high data rate communications,\
    \ our proposed LoRa-\nbased broadcast mesh network can be used for long-range\
    \ communications (up to several\ntens of kilometers in direct LOS) as well as\
    \ for essential data communications (e.g., UAVs\ntelemetry) in urban environments,\
    \ where IEEE 802.11s signals, despite LOS visibility\nbetween UAVs, could be affected\
    \ by interference and signal shadowing, thus limiting their\noperational ranges.\
    \ Therefore, essential data could still be retrieved using the LoRa-based\nmeshed\
    \ network, where nearby UAVs act as LoRa relays inside the network, allowing long-\n\
    range communications between swarm nodes, as deﬁned in Section 4.2. An illustrative\n\
    representation of such a LoRa-based mesh network conﬁguration is shown in Figure\
    \ 13.\nFigure 13. LoRa-enabled communications between UAVs.\n5.2.3. Hybrid Conﬁguration-enabled\
    \ UAV-to-UAV Communications\nWith reference to Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, it is\
    \ clear how IEEE 802.11s and LoRa have\ntheir own advantages and disadvantages:\
    \ IEEE 802.11s suits low latency, high data rate,\nand short-to-mid range communications,\
    \ while LoRa supports very long transmission\nranges but with a very limited data\
    \ rate and high latency. Therefore, an effective combi-\nnation of these technologies\
    \ should guarantee an optimized tradeoff between operational\nranges and data\
    \ rates.\nGiven the two layers discussed and detailed in Section 4, a hybrid adoption\
    \ of these\nnetwork layers by the UAVs in a swarm could involve multiple IEEE\
    \ 802.11s “local” mesh\nnetworks between close UAVs, in turn connecting together\
    \ with disjoint (far) IEEE 802.11s\nmeshed networks through the LoRa layer. This\
    \ leads to the implementation of a wide area\nhybrid mesh network where all the\
    \ UAVs can forward at least a minimum amount of data\nto each other without the\
    \ need for a ground infrastructure. An illustrative representation\nof the overall\
    \ architecture is shown in Figure 14.\nFigure 14. Hybrid-meshed network for communications\
    \ between UAVs.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n21 of 32\n5.3. UAV-to-Ground Communications\n\
    Considering UAV-to-ground communications, in our proposed infrastructure two\n\
    different solutions can be identiﬁed: (i) an IEEE 802.11s-based UAV-to-ground\
    \ connection,\ndiscussed in Section 5.3.1, and (ii) a LoRaWAN-based one, detailed\
    \ in Section 5.3.2. Both\nof these solutions involve ﬂying UAV mesh root nodes,\
    \ in charge of collecting data from\nthe remaining ﬂying UAVs of the swarm and\
    \ transmitting it to the ground control center.\n5.3.1. IEEE 802.11s-Enabled Ground-Connected\
    \ UAV Swarms\nGiven a reference scenario in which at least one UAV ﬂies within\
    \ the communication\nrange of a ground control station’s Wi-Fi AP, such an UAV\
    \ could establish a bidirectional\nconnection with the AP itself using (i) a traditional\
    \ STA-AP IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi connection\nor (ii) an advanced IEEE 802.11s connection\
    \ (in case multiple APs are available). Therefore,\nthe UAV connected to the ground\
    \ via Wi-Fi ﬁrst broadcasts to all nearby swarm nodes its\nconnection status and\
    \ then assumes the root node role inside the ﬂying mesh conﬁguration,\nthus providing\
    \ a bidirectional connectivity among the ground center and the other UAVs.\nTo\
    \ this end, such a network conﬁguration could be represented as in Figure 15,\
    \ where two\nroot nodes act as ﬂying GWs for the intermediate UAVs (with reference\
    \ to Figure 2).\nFigure 15. Wi-Fi-enabled ground connected UAV swarm.\n5.3.2.\
    \ LoRaWAN-Enabled Ground-Connected UAV Swarm\nA second approach to provide ground\
    \ connectivity to the swarm’s UAVs is through\nthe LoRaWAN protocol. If compared\
    \ with the IEEE 802.11s-based approach described\nin Section 5.3.1, a LoRaWAN-based\
    \ approach will be characterized by an increased com-\nmunication range of at\
    \ least one order of magnitude, thus supporting new operational\nscenarios, which\
    \ will be discussed in more detail in Section 7. On a practical side, a UAV\n\
    swarm could use LoRaWAN both to interact with the ground control center and to\
    \ simply\nsend essential data (e.g., UAVs telemetry) to a LoRaWAN AS, joining\
    \ an existing open\nLoRaWAN network (e.g., TTN). This is possible even in the\
    \ presence of more than one UAV\nacting as a root node inside the swarm, thus\
    \ providing a bidirectional connectivity between\nthe ground center and the ﬂying\
    \ UAVs composing the hybrid mesh network. To better\nclarify this long-range approach,\
    \ in Figure 16, an illustrative scenario is shown, with two\nroot nodes acting\
    \ as ﬂying GWs for all the other UAVs that cannot directly communicate\nwith the\
    \ ground.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n22 of 32\nFigure 16. LoRaWAN-enabled ground connected\
    \ UAV swarm.\n6. Theoretical and Experimental Performance Evaluation\nIn order\
    \ to further motivate our proposed hybrid approach, in Section 6.1, we evalu-\n\
    ate the theoretical performance (in terms of operational range) of the network\
    \ protocols\ndiscussed in Section 3 in a comparative way with respect to literature\
    \ works: more pre-\ncisely, in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, we focus on LoRa and\
    \ IEEE 802.11s, respectively. Then,\nin Section 6.2, we detailed our experimental\
    \ campaign on LoRa-based communications,\nusing a commercial UAV and an on-board\
    \ LoRaWAN transceiver to identify the UAV-to-\nground communication range—we do\
    \ not report any experimental result on IEEE 802.11-\nbased communications as\
    \ these have been extensively investigated in the literature; for this\nreason,\
    \ we focused on LoRa-based communications.\n6.1. Theoretical Performance Analysis\n\
    6.1.1. LoRa Communication Operating Range Estimation\nGiven the mobile nature\
    \ of the proposed hybrid architecture and the interest in the use\nof the LoRa\
    \ protocol for inter-UAV communications in a networking range between 5 km\nand\
    \ 15 km, a preliminary performance estimation initially focused on the reliability\
    \ and\nthe communication range of LoRa-based communications with at least one\
    \ node moving\nin the considered environment. In detail, in [59], various scenarios\
    \ (i.e., urban, suburban,\nand an almost obstacle-free environment) were considered,\
    \ highlighting how SF12 allows\na user to achieve a packet delivery ratio equal\
    \ to 85% in both urban and suburban scenarios\n(within a range of 5 km) and then\
    \ decreasing to about 70% when increasing the range from\n5 km up to 15 km (and\
    \ depending on the environment). In [65], the authors focused on\nLOS LoRa communication\
    \ range evaluation, achieving a point-to-point (between a hill\nand a nearby ﬂat-land)\
    \ range of more than 12 km with a small packet loss ratio. Moreover,\nanother\
    \ range estimation was given by TTN Mapper [66], that allows users to monitor,\n\
    evaluate, and analyze all the data provided by the community, thus highlighting\
    \ which\nare the real capabilities of a LoRa-based communication in various real-world\
    \ scenarios.\nTo this end, among the plethora of data, the most interesting ones\
    \ are those related to\nextreme LOS conditions, with the transmitting node mounted\
    \ over a helium-ﬁlled balloon\nand reaching a propagation range up to hundreds\
    \ of kilometers, achieving an astonishing\nLoRa communication range of about 832\
    \ km [67].\n6.1.2. IEEE 802.11s-Based Communication Operating Range\nWith regard\
    \ to in-air data transmission among drones through the IEEE 802.11s proto-\ncol,\
    \ in the literature, some investigations were conducted in order to estimate how\
    \ it could\nﬁt different coverage needs. The adoption of IEEE 802.11s networking\
    \ in a UAV swarm is\ninvestigated in [68], where an open area with no obstacle\
    \ and no interference is assumed.\nIn this context, the use of 2.4 GHz and 5.8\
    \ GHz Wi-Fi was able to provide a high data rate\nlink between the AP and the\
    \ UAV within a radius of several hundreds of meters (up to\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n\
    23 of 32\n200 m at 300 Mbps PHY data rate on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi link), also depending\
    \ on the adopted\nradio equipment and link direction (uplink or downlink). Additionally,\
    \ in [68], the authors\nshow that, using a lower PHY data rate, a longer communication\
    \ distance could be reached\n(up to 500 m at 54 Mbps PHY data rate), further expanding\
    \ the IEEE 802.11s operational\nranges of both UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-ground communications\
    \ proposed in our hybrid\nmesh network model. Another IEEE 802.11s-based UAV network,\
    \ where a UAV acts as AP\nfor ground STA nodes, is presented in [28], showing\
    \ a throughput of about 40 Mbps over\na 200 m2 area and considering multiple hops\
    \ inside the network.\nTaking into account the results in [68] and [28] and the\
    \ a typical home Wi-Fi network\noperational range, the application of this technology\
    \ for both UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-\nground communications should be possible for\
    \ short-to-mid range LOS communications.\n6.2. Experimental Performance Analysis:\
    \ LoRaWAN UAV-to-Ground Operating Range Evaluation\nWe ﬁrst investigated a LoRaWAN\
    \ communication link between a ﬂying UAV and\nthe ground control center, as discussed\
    \ in Section 4.2.2. To this end, a processing board\nwith a LoRaWAN interface\
    \ was placed over a drone, with the main task of collecting GNSS\nlatitude, longitude,\
    \ and altitude. Then, these messages were periodically sent through\nthe LoRaWAN\
    \ interface in order to observe and estimate which terrestrial LoRaWAN GWs\ncould\
    \ successfully receive these messages. Hence, these data transfers allow us to\
    \ further\ndetermine the in-air distance between each terrestrial GW and the originator\
    \ UAV. In detail,\na DJI Phantom 4 Professional [69] was adopted as a UAV platform,\
    \ as shown in Figure 17a,\nwhile a TTGO T-Beam [70], shown in Figure 17b, was\
    \ used as a LoRa-compliant commu-\nnication board. This board was chosen thanks\
    \ to the presence of a Semtech SX1276 LoRa\nmodem (suitable for EU 868 MHz LoRa\
    \ channels frequency) [71], a u-blox NEO-6M GNSS\nmodule [72], an ESP32 Wi-Fi\
    \ and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) System-on-Chip (SoC) [73],\nand the full support\
    \ to TTN [7]. Finally, the communication board was attached under\nthe drone’s\
    \ frame and powered using a standard 3.7 V 3500 mAh MR18650 Li-Ion battery.\n\
    (a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 17. Chosen UAV and LoRa board adopted for the experimental\
    \ performance evaluation campaigns. (a) DJI Phantom\n4 Professional. (b) TTGO\
    \ T-Beam LoRa board. (c) TTGO T-Beam LoRa development platform attached to the\
    \ DJI drone as\nits custom payload.\nThe experimental tests were performed in\
    \ a semi-urban environment in Sabbioneta,\nItaly, with multiple low buildings,\
    \ in the absence of mountains or hills. Then, the ﬂight was\ncarried out on 4\
    \ December 2020, during a cloudy day with almost no wind, an air humidity\nof\
    \ about 80%, and a temperature around 3 ◦C. More in detail, the UAV’s GNSS position\
    \ was\nﬁxed during the ascending, hovering, and descending phases; during the\
    \ ﬂight, the drone\nwas maintained in a hovering status at a ﬁxed altitude of\
    \ 100 m for 12 min, slowly rotating\nitself on the yaw axis. On the communication\
    \ side, the LoRa-enabled board was set to\nautomatically send a LoRaWAN message\
    \ with SF7 and message interval equal to 10 s,\ncontaining the current GNSS data\
    \ (longitude, latitude, altitude, and Horizontal Dilution\nOf Precision (HDOP)).\
    \ Finally, the endpoint applications attached to the TTN’s AS were\nintegrated\
    \ with the TTN Mapper component in order to decode the receive message\npayloads\
    \ and to plot the data over a map showing the LoRaWAN GWs that correctly\nDrones\
    \ 2021, 5, 26\n24 of 32\nreceived at least one message—allowing us to easily estimate\
    \ the distances among the UAV\nand the different GWs.\nThe used testbed allows\
    \ us to achieve interesting results, since the exchanged packets\nare received\
    \ from GWs far away from the ﬂying UAV. In total, 72 messages were sent from\n\
    the UAV-mounted LoRa-enabled board during the ascending, ﬂight, and descending\
    \ phases.\nThe messages were received by 14 LoRaWAN GWs registered (with known\
    \ positions) on\nTTN, consequently allowing us to estimate the distances between\
    \ these GWs and the UAV,\ntogether with the number of packets successfully received\
    \ by each GWs and the percentage\nof correctly received packets. The results of\
    \ this range evaluation are shown in Figure 18,\nwhere the messages received by\
    \ the TTN GWs are shown on top of a TTN Mapper’s map.\nMoreover, the messages\
    \ are listed in Table 2, where the GWs are classiﬁed by the number\nof packets\
    \ successfully received.\nFigure 18. TTN Mapper output.\nAnalyzing the experimental\
    \ results, the majority of the GWs that received messages\nsent from the originator\
    \ UAV are located, on the average, within a circular range with\nradius between\
    \ 30 km and 60 km, with a few GWs placed even more than 75 km away\nfrom the transmitter.\
    \ Unfortunately, the only known nearby GW (identiﬁed as 6), located\nat about\
    \ 4 km from the UAV, is an indoor GW located at the ﬁfth ﬂoor of a building:\n\
    this could explain the relatively low packet reception rate of the GW 6 achieved\
    \ during\nthe performance evaluation. Despite the absence of statistical meaning\
    \ of the obtained\nresults—due to the very small number of messages sent from\
    \ the UAV—this preliminary\nevaluation highlights the applicability of LoRaWAN\
    \ to UAV swarms, since the resulting\ncommunication range turned out to be much\
    \ longer than the expected 10–15 km range.\nMoreover, given that LoRaWAN-based\
    \ communications do not entail a speciﬁc association\nbetween the end node (the\
    \ UAV) and a GW, the transmitted messages can be received by\nany nearby GWs and,\
    \ thus, can be successfully processed, making the ﬁnal correct packet\ndelivery\
    \ ratio in our experimental evaluation equal to 95.83%, which is an acceptable\
    \ value.\nHence, with respect to the UAV-to-ground LoRaWAN-based communication\
    \ discussed\nin Section 4.2.2, the combined use of a LoRa-IEEE 802.11s-based mesh\
    \ network for multiple\nﬂying UAV communications, together with multiple root\
    \ nodes communicating though\nLoRaWAN to the ground, is feasible. This allows\
    \ us to limit multi-hop communications\nbetween ﬂying UAVs, which is a very limiting\
    \ factor for LoRa-based mesh networking.\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n25 of 32\nTable\

    \ evaluation was performed with the UAV placed\nat a quite high altitude but still\
    \ inside the legal height allowed by the EASA, which is\nlimited to a maximum\
    \ value equal to 120 m. Moreover, looking at the packets transmitted\nduring the\
    \ ascending and descending phases, all the packets transmitted at an altitude\n\
    higher than 35 m were received by at least one nearby GW, suggesting that the\
    \ same\npacket reception rate should be easily achieved for almost any ﬂying altitude\
    \ above 35 m,\nwith a more realistic ﬂying elevation set between 50 m and 60 m,\
    \ in order to obtain LOS\ncommunications in almost all directions.\nDuring the\
    \ experimental evaluation, two aspects were not analyzed: (i) the impact\nof the\
    \ mobility, in particular with a UAV linear speed between 20 km/h and 50 km/h,\n\
    and (ii) the impact of messages with maximum size payload. The mobility of the\
    \ UAV\nshould partially limit the reception rate given the studies discussed in\
    \ [59]. However, given\nthe typical speeds of a UAV, their effects on LoRa communications\
    \ should be negligible for\npayload sizes smaller than the maximum value (which\
    \ corresponds to the longest message\nairtime). Moreover, taking into account\
    \ other researches in [59], given that SF is set to SF7,\nthe possible effects\
    \ on communication should be negligible.\nAs a ﬁnal note, only UAV-to-ground evaluations\
    \ have been performed, integrating\na public LoRaWAN network (i.e., TTN) to investigate\
    \ LoRa RF signal transmission and\nthe corresponding reception distance. However,\
    \ the proposed hybrid mesh network\ninfrastructure should achieve a similar performance\
    \ for UAV-to-UAV communications, with\nthe only limitation due to the small LoRa\
    \ antennas mounted on top of UAVs. Nevertheless,\nthe considered setting should\
    \ allow us to cover an operational region with a radius between\n5 km and 15 km,\
    \ thus enabling a long-range communication useful for several scenarios\nand use\
    \ cases.\n7. Use Cases\nIn order to motivate the design and implementation of\
    \ the opportunistic mesh net-\nworking approach discussed in Section 5, the following\
    \ relevant use cases for the proposed\nhybrid mesh architecture are discussed.\n\
    7.1. Border Surveillance\nConsider a border surveillance scenario with an extensive\
    \ perimeter (e.g., tens of\nkilometers) to be monitored. Multiple drones would\
    \ then be required, each one assigned\nto a speciﬁc zone to be monitored and in\
    \ charge of executing different tasks [74]. Among\nthese tasks, recording (as\
    \ a video stream) inside the drone’s on-board memory is a relevant\none. When\
    \ a critical situation appears (e.g., in a smart city context or for citizens\
    \ safety [75])\nand cannot be managed by a single drone, then a subset of the\
    \ swarm needs to reach\nDrones 2021, 5, 26\n26 of 32\nthe critical situation area\
    \ [76]. This “rescue operation” can be performed thanks to the fact\nthat the\
    \ localization of each UAV is precisely identiﬁed through GNSS information, which\n\
    is in turn broadcast by each drone through the LoRa-based mesh network at certain\
    \ time\ninstants (given the duty cycle of the LoRa protocol) [77]. On the basis\
    \ of this knowledge,\nthe swarm’s subset can reach the on-site drone while recording\
    \ the ﬂight operations. Once\non the critical area, the UAVs can coordinate with\
    \ each other by relying on the high-\nspeed IEEE 802.11s mesh network. For example,\
    \ they could transfer all their (recorded)\nvideo streams to a “sherpa” UAV—elected\
    \ statically or dynamically—which, in turn,\nwill be in charge of reaching a terrestrial\
    \ Wi-Fi AP to download all the video streams\nto the ground control center [78,79].\
    \ Hence, in scenarios such as this one, long-range\nlow-data-rate protocols can\
    \ be suitable only for position information broadcasting while\nresource-demanding\
    \ services (e.g., video streams) should be left to faster communication\ninterfaces\
    \ possibly equipping the swarm’s UAVs—e.g., IEEE 802.11s, as well as 4G/5G\ncellular\
    \ networks.\n7.2. Smart Agriculture\nAn alternative use case corresponds to a\
    \ smart agricultural scenario, with spread lots\n(far from each other) to be periodically\
    \ monitored in an unobtrusive way [80,81]. This can\noccur through ﬂying drones\
    \ that collect data from on-ﬁeld sensors (through wireless data\ntransmission\
    \ from sensors to UAVs) and through on-board sensors (e.g., hyper-spectral\ncameras).\
    \ Then, in order to avoid drones ﬂying for long distances (between their assigned\n\
    agricultural lot and the the farmer’s house), the swarm can self-organize (in\
    \ an oppor-\ntunistic way and based on the data format to be collected and reported\
    \ to the farmer’s\nhouse) intermediate mesh networks [82,83]. Therefore, small\
    \ data can be transmitted\nthrough a LoRa-based mesh network while large data\
    \ to be transferred in a short time\ncan rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network.\
    \ This opens to innovative trajectory and task\nplanning, aiming at maximizing\
    \ the data collection rate and at minimizing the “redundant”\ntime wasted while\
    \ in static ﬂight waiting for information transfer. For example, this can\nrely\
    \ on the adoption of Mission Management Tools (MMTs) [84] and Decision Support\n\
    Systems (DSSs) [85], thus opening up to the possibility of processing data both\
    \ locally or\nin the cloud [86].\n7.3. BVLOS Instrumental Flight Backup Telemetry\n\
    Nowadays, BVLOS ﬂights often rely on direct communication between the UAV\nand\
    \ the pilot (on the ground), using the protocol described in Section 2. However,\
    \ this\ncommunication scheme is often disturbed when ﬂying in the presence of\
    \ obstacles (e.g.,\nbuildings, trees, hills, etc.) [87]. To overcome these limitations,\
    \ manufacturers equip their\nUAVs with LTE modems to enable cellular connectivity\
    \ and to provide FPV real-time\nvideo feeds and telemetry data to the pilots [88,89].\
    \ Nevertheless, some BVLOS ﬂights\ndo not require a real-time video stream but\
    \ simply the UAV’s telemetry data (e.g., GNSS\ncoordinates, altitude, speed, orientation,\
    \ batteries status, etc.) in order to (i) monitor\nthe UAV on different map layers\
    \ (e.g., satellite or topographic maps, to know where\nbuildings or structures\
    \ are located) and (ii) to perform complex operations without a UAV’s\nLOS visibility.\
    \ Therefore, the use of M (M ≥ 1) intermediate UAVs connecting indirectly\n(through\
    \ IEEE 802.11s or LoRa intermediate links) the BVLOS UAV and its pilot can\nrepresent\
    \ a valid alternative in those cases in which, for example, cellular connectivity\
    \ is\nnot fully available or reliable, thus providing a robust backup tool to\
    \ keep track of ﬂying\nUAVs performing partially automated BVLOS operations in\
    \ difﬁcult environments [90].\nTherefore, despite LTE-based downlink (between\
    \ the pilot and the UAV) and uplink\n(from the UAV to the pilot) communications\
    \ should abide by certain requirements on\ndata rate, reliability, and latency\
    \ [91,92] for different types of data (i.e., command and\ncontrol data, and application\
    \ data), in a use case such as the current one, the constraints\naffecting the\
    \ uplink telemetry data transmission would be more “relaxed.” In particular,\n\
    this information forwarding can be performed occasionally or if the default communication\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 26\n27 of 32\nmechanism fails, thus acting as a backup solution\
    \ for the adopted low rate and long-range\ncommunication protocols.\n7.4. Long-Range\
    \ UAV Swarms Coordination and Communications\nThe proposed hybrid mesh network\
    \ opens new possibilities for long-range UAV\nswarm coordination and communications,\
    \ letting many UAVs communicate together\nand with one or more ground control\
    \ centers placed over a wide operating region [93].\nGround-connected UAVs could\
    \ act as swarm coordinators, communicating with the other\nswarm UAV new-mission\
    \ instructions (e.g., new positions to reach or be maintained).\nMoreover, the\
    \ proposed mesh networking scheme could simply be used to keep track of\nthe UAV’s\
    \ positions in order to provide the control center with an updated overview of\n\
    the swarm topology [94]. The control center, in turn, could send to the coordinators—and,\n\
    then, to speciﬁc UAVs—the information needed to restore the desired swarm formation.\n\
    However, given the constraint of LoRa-based communications, the amount of data\
    \ that\ncan be transmitted between in-ﬂight UAVs located over a large area is\
    \ limited to essential\ninformation, such as positions to be reached, mission\
    \ tasks, and other limited swarm-related\ninformation.\n8. Conclusions\nIn this\
    \ paper, we proposed a hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking\narchitecture\
    \ to be adopted in UAV swarms to enable data transmission among the drones\nand\
    \ ground control centers. The proposed architecture aims to exploit the strengths\n\
    of the component protocols, namely IEEE 802.11s, LoRa, and LoRaWAN. An effective\n\
    network protocol selection mechanism is then needed to select the right interface.\
    \ In detail,\nprotocol selection is based on multiple parameters, both available\
    \ internally in the ﬂying\nnode as well as periodically exchanged by the swarm\
    \ nodes, including signal indicators\nand the nature of the type to be transferred.\
    \ Our considerations indicate a combined\noperational range between 5 km and 15\
    \ km, using LoRa (for long-range communications)\nand IEEE 802.11s (for short-range\
    \ LOS communications). As a consequence, the proposed\nhybrid architecture allows\
    \ us to reach different data rates based on the environmental\nconditions and\
    \ the scenario to be targeted. Among the system constraints, the effective\ntransmission\
    \ capabilities of the architecture are limited by the adopted protocols constraints,\n\
    which, in the case of LoRa/LoRaWAN communications, signiﬁcantly limit the possible\n\
    use cases to low-data-rate applications. Moreover, given the mobile nature of\
    \ UAVs,\nwhich also have a limited battery energy, such a hybrid network could\
    \ often incur topology\nchanges and, thus, network reconﬁgurations, which could\
    \ cause temporary network outage.\nFinally, we considered performance evaluation\
    \ and we discussed a few representative\nuse cases, highlighting how the combined\
    \ use of heterogeneous communication protocols\nis effective in various scenarios.\
    \ The proposed architecture can be further enhanced,\nespecially in the context\
    \ of the interface selection mechanism, which could be improved\nwith an Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI)-based approach. This is the subject of current ongoing\nresearch\
    \ activities.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.D., E.P., and G.F.;\

  title: Hybrid LoRa-IEEE 802.11s Opportunistic Mesh Networking for Flexible UAV Swarming
  verbatim_quote1: We propose a hybrid LoRa-IEEE 802.11s opportunistic mesh networking
    approach based on Long Range (LoRa) [5] and IEEE 802.11s [6] protocols for flying
    UAV swarms, involving both UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-ground communications.
  verbatim_quote2: This architecture allows multiple flying drones to exchange essential
    data— e.g., telemetry information—with each other or toward one or more ground
    control centers, thus opening new possibilities for UAV-based applications over
    wide operational areas.

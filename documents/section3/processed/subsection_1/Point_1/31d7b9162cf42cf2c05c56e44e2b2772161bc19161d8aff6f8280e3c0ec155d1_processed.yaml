- analysis: 'The paper proposes a distributed coordination protocol (DCP-CCC) for
    common control channel selection in cognitive radio ad hoc networks to ensure
    efficient and stable communication in a dynamic spectrum environment. The protocol
    considers primary system activities and network connectivity to determine the
    optimal common control channel for each cluster, minimizing channel disruptions
    and maximizing node connectivity.


    The most important contributions of the paper are:


    1. **Distributed and adaptive common control channel selection**: The protocol
    operates in a distributed manner, allowing nodes to autonomously form clusters
    and select a common control channel based on local spectrum sensing and connectivity
    information, without the need for a centralized coordinator.


    2. **Primary system activity and connectivity considerations:** The protocol takes
    into account the appearance patterns of primary systems (licensed users) and the
    connectivity among nodes to determine the optimal common control channel. This
    ensures that the selected channel has minimal interference from primary users
    and can support reliable communication within the cluster.


    3. **Primary detection and adaptive control channel recovery**: The protocol includes
    a primary detection notification procedure that allows nodes to efficiently change
    the common control channel if a primary user is detected on the current channel.
    This helps to maintain reliable communication and minimize disruptions caused
    by primary user activity.


    4. **Reduced number of clusters and improved connectivity**: Compared to existing
    methods, the proposed protocol results in a smaller number of clusters, allowing
    more nodes to communicate on the same control channel. Additionally, it enhances
    network connectivity by reducing the number of gateway nodes required for inter-cluster
    communication.


    5. **More reliable and stable control channel**: The protocol considers primary
    system activities in the control channel selection process, leading to a more
    reliable and stable control channel that is less susceptible to interference and
    disruptions.


    6. **Reduced frequency of control channel changes and cluster re-formation**:
    The protocol minimizes the need for frequent control channel changes and cluster
    re-formation, which can significantly improve network efficiency and reduce communication
    overhead.'

  description: The exponential growth in wireless services has resulted in an overly
    crowded spectrum. The current state of spectrum allocation indicates that most
    usable frequencies have already been occupied. This makes one pessimistic about
    the feasibility of integrating emerging wireless services such as large-scale
    sensor networks into the existing communication infrastructure. Cognitive radio
    is an emerging dynamic spectrum access technology that can be used for flexibly
    and efficiently achieving open spectrum sharing. Cognitive radio is an intelligent
    wireless communication system that is aware of its radio environment and that
    is capable of adapting its operation to statistical variations of the radio frequency.
    In ad hoc cognitive radio networks, a common control channel (CCC) is usually
    used for supporting transmission coordination and spectrum-related information
    exchange. Determining a CCC in distributed networks is a challenging research
    issue because the spectrum availability at each ad hoc node is quite different
    and dynamic due to the interference between and coexistence of primary users.
    In this paper, we propose a novel CCC selection protocol that is implemented in
    a distributed way according to the appearance patterns of primary systems and
    connectivity among nodes. The proposed protocol minimizes the possibility of CCC
    disruption by primary user activities and maximizes node connectivity when the
    control channel is set up. It also facilitates adaptive recovery of the control
    channel when the primary user is detected on that channel. © 2012 KICS.

    Publisher: KICS SECTION I. Introduction Wireless spectrum licensing on a long-term
    basis is currently under way over vast geographical regions. In order to address
    the critical problem of spectrum scarcity, the federal communications commission
    (FCC) has recently approved the use of unlicensed devices in licensed bands [1].
    The report published by the spectrum policy task force of the FCC in 2002 [2],
    which was aimed at improving the way of utilizing the spectrum resource, catalyzed
    intensive research activities in this new field of open spectrum sharing. Consequently,
    dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques have been proposed to solve spectrum
    inefficiency problems. Cognitive radio (CR), a term first coined by J. Mitola
    III in 1999 [3], is a promising approach for flexibly and efficiently achieving
    open spectrum sharing [4], [5]. A CR system is an intelligent wireless communication
    system that is aware of its radio environment and is capable of adapting its operation
    to statistical variations of the radio freqeuncy of incoming signals. IEEE 802.22
    [6] is the first standard based on CR. IEEE 802.16h [7] is expected to implement
    CR functions in worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) networks
    for facilitating the coexistence of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. A
    number of cognitive radio test-beds based on different architectures and radio
    technologies have been developed [8], [9]. Since most of the useful spectrum is
    already assigned to primary systems (licensed systems), to utilize the spectrum
    holes of the licensed bands, CR devices should be capable of detecting primary
    user signals on the licensed primary channels and not lead to harmful interference
    to the primary system users. Research on CR covers a wide range of areas, including
    spectrum analysis, channel estimation, spectrum sharing, medium access control
    (MAC), and routing. However, CR networks pose unique challenges owing to high
    fluctuations in the available spectrum as well as the diverse quality of service
    (QoS) requirements [5]. Specifically, in ad hoc networks based on CR, the distributed
    multi-hop architecture, the dynamic network topology, and the variation of the
    spectrum availability with time and location are key distinguishing factors. CR
    networks are different from traditional ad hoc networks in the sense that the
    CR networks can opportunistically utilize various spectral holes for smooth peer-to-peer
    communications by virtue of the unique CR functionalities [10]. The ad hoc cognitive
    radio network requires reliable control and spectrum management message exchanges
    between neighbor nodes to communicate local sensing results, set up data channels,
    immediately notify incumbent detection events, announce spectrum handover, and
    so on. These message exchanges are usually assumed to be carried out on a dedicated
    control channel, the so-called common control channel (CCC) [5]. However, in many
    cases, we cannot guarantee that dedicated CCCs can be set up for all different
    cognitive radio networks, and further, dedicated control channels are wasteful
    of channel resources when there is no CR user. Therefore, a dynamic and distributed
    method is required for CCC selection in ad hoc CR networks. In this paper, we
    propose a novel CCC selection protocol (distributed coordination protocol for
    a CCC (DCP-CCC)) in a distributed way, based on the appearance patterns of the
    primary system (PS) and network connectivity. The proposed protocol provides a
    decentralized cluster-based architecture to form a large-scale network, and it
    provides mechanisms to adapt the network topology to network and radio environment
    changes. Preliminary results of the proposed protocol were presented in [11].
    In this paper, we have extended the cluster management methods (cluster merge,
    cluster interconnection, and common channel change schemes) and have intensively
    studied the performance of the proposed protocol for various network conditions.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Related work is discussed in Section
    II. The proposed DCP-CCC protocol is presented in detail in Section III. Cluster
    management is presented in Section IV. The performance of the proposed protocol
    is studied in Section V. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section VI. SECTION
    II. Related Work Most of the existing distributed CR network protocols for MAC
    and routing assume that there exists a dedicated CCC. However, such protocols
    are in conflict with the opportunistic nature of cognitive radio, and moreover,
    most of the available spectrum has already been allocated to existing communication
    systems. Therefore, it may not be feasible to assign dedicated CCCs to all possible
    types of CR networks in the future. Some CR systems use an unlicensed band, such
    as industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, or ultra-wide bands (UWBs)
    for the control channel. In this case, the unlicensed band is already overcrowded
    and suffers strong interference from existing unlicensed band users; therefore,
    reliability, which is one of the most important features of the control channel,
    cannot be guaranteed [12]. In the absence of a dedicated CCC, a distributed and
    dynamic self-configurable procedure is required for setting up a common channel.
    A CCC can be classified as an in-band CCC or out-of-band CCC, depending on whether
    the control channel shares the data channel or uses a dedicated spectrum, respectively
    [13]. In the in-band CCC, the current data transmission channel is also used for
    exchanging control messages. Since each node pair may use a different channel
    for communication, the CCC is generally limited to the corresponding communication
    pair (i.e., local coverage). Therefore, the out-of-band CCC is widely considered
    for ad hoc CR networks. Some studies assume that there exists a common channel
    with global coverage available for all nodes in ad hoc CR networks. The network
    nodes also have the capability determine and use an alternate global control channel
    if the original control channel is jammed [14]–[16]. Two neighboring nodes can
    exchange available channel information or negotiate channel assignments of a link
    via the control channel. In [16] and [17], the authors propose a global control
    channel to carry out the MAC-layer control mechanisms in the open spectrum sharing
    paradigm which is so popular so that it is not required to be explained further.
    The C-MAC protocol presented in [18] is based on the dynamic channel assignment
    protocol [19]. These protocols use the packet-based channel assignment approach.
    However, it is difficult to find a globally common channel in a network, and there
    are frequent individual spectrum changes even if a CCC covering the entire network
    is found. Changing the CCC frequently leads to drastic communication overhead.
    There is high possibility that the global CCC can suffer denial of service (DoS)
    attacks [20]. Therefore, global CCC approaches are unlikely to be applicable to
    real CR network scenarios. Since the probability that a global CCC is available
    to every node in the network is small, CR users can be grouped into clusters and
    a CCC may be used for the nodes in the same cluster. In this case, the selected
    CCC has only group coverage. In [14], Zhao et al. proposed a distributed coordination
    scheme for spectrum allocations that addresses the spectrum variability problem
    without using a global control channel. Zhao et al.''s scheme uses a group coordination
    channel instead. In [21], a close group of users form a sub ad hoc network and
    select a channel for communicating control information. If the primary user of
    the channel returns, then a different channel that is available to everyone in
    the available sub-group channels is chosen. It is assumed that one of the members
    of the group has the capability to connect to the neighboring groups. In CogMesh
    [10], a cluster-based framework is used to form a wireless mesh network in the
    context of open spectrum sharing. The study in [10] investigates the issues involved
    in setting up an ad hoc open spectrum sharing network that coexists with primary
    users of the spectrums and proposes a decentralized cluster-based architecture
    to form a large-scale network. The basic unit of the network is a cluster, which
    is a sub-network formed by a group of neighbor nodes sharing common channels and
    coordinated by a selected node (called cluster head) in the cluster. On the other
    hand, some proposed MAC protocols do not require separate control channels for
    the purpose of control signal exchange. Using a single CCC may introduce control
    channel saturation that degrades the overall performance of the network. In [22],
    SYN-MAC was proposed for avoiding the use of the CCC. The main idea is to divide
    the total time into fixed-time intervals, each corresponding to one of the available
    channels. At the beginning of each time slot, all nodes in the network listen
    to a channel whose time slot is equal to the time required for the exchange of
    control messages. However, this scheme requires global time synchronization. Synchronization
    in an ad hoc network is a challenge owing to the absence of centralized coordination.
    SECTION III. Dcp-Ccc: Distributed Coordination Protocol for Common Control Channel
    Selection A. Network Architecture and Design Requirements Fig. 1 shows the network
    environments of cognitive radio ad hoc networks. We assume that there is no fixed
    dedicated CCC and that the average spectrum idle time of the PSs is much longer
    than the packet transmission time. As shown in Fig. 1, each node may have a different
    set of available channels after local spectrum sensing. In the proposed common
    channel selection and maintenance protocol, we form clusters with desired sizes,
    and within the cluster range, an optimal CCC is selected. In order to choose a
    CCC, the DCP-CCC takes into account not only the locally available spectrum bands
    of each node, but also the temporal and spatial variations in the primary user
    spectrum activities. In Fig. 1, the cluster head (CH) is a node that initiates
    cluster formation for selecting the CCC. The actual cluster nodes that share the
    same CCC are determined by the initially desired cluster size and each node''s
    available channel set. Multiple clusters can be merged or interconnected by using
    gateway nodes. Fig. 1. Proposed ad hoc CR network architecture. Show All The proposed
    DCP-CCC has the following unique design features. No global time synchronization:
    Achieving time synchronization in ad hoc networks is not a trivial task and generally
    requires complex device implementation or synchronization protocols. Therefore,
    we assume that time synchronization is not provided in the proposed method. Configurable
    cluster size: A cluster is a set of nodes that use the same control channel. To
    increase the network connectivity, a cluster should include as many CR nodes as
    possible. If the cluster size is too small, then an entire CR network can be partitioned
    into many small clusters, and they may not be connected to exchange the control
    messages of the MAC and of the routing operations. Even if some of them can be
    interconnected by gateway nodes, the control channel switching overheads of the
    interconnected clusters, which use different CCCs, increase the packet delivery
    time and decrease the throughput. In this paper, the cluster size is adaptively
    configurable when the CH initiates the control channel setup procedure. The actual
    cluster size can be smaller than the desired size when the optimal channel in
    terms of the proposed performance criteria (average primary system appearance
    probability and idle time) is not available for all nodes in the desired cluster.
    Fast common channel setup: In CCC-based MAC operations of ad hoc CR networks,
    before the CCC is setup, each node cannot send data packets to or receive data
    packets from neighbor nodes. Exchanges pertaining to the data channel negotiation
    and transmission time schedule are performed on the control channel. Therefore,
    the control channel setup time should be minimized. Since nodes may have different
    sets of available channels and since they can tune into different channels at
    a given time, ensuring fast message delivery for setting up a common channel is
    not a trivial task. New CCC selection criteria: A single cluster should include
    as many nodes as possible while having a size less than the desired cluster size,
    and the selected channel should have low PS activities. Common channel change
    mechanism upon the primary signal detection: When some of the cluster nodes have
    detected the primary signals of the current CCC, then this information should
    be delivered to the neighbor nodes in the cluster to make them perform local sensing.
    By considering the number of interfering CR nodes, the cluster should decide whether
    all cluster nodes should reselect the control channel or whether the interfering
    nodes should be isolated. Cluster merge and interconnection: For control message
    exchange or packet delivery between any nodes in the entire ad hoc network, the
    clusters should be able to communicate through CCCs. Clusters with the same CCC
    are merged, and the clusters with different CCCs are interconnected by gateway
    nodes in the proposed protocol. The proposed DCP-CCC can set up a wide-area CCC
    that can reach many CR nodes with a single control channel without channel switching.
    In CogMesh [10], which is also a cluster-based common channel CR network, a CH
    constructs a cluster only with single-hop neighbors, and therefore, many gateway
    nodes are required to interconnect other neighboring clusters. Since gateway nodes
    should manage the data transmission schedule for multiple clusters and frequently
    switch channels, their use results in a decrease in the channel throughput. In
    DCP-CCC, the CH selects an optimum control channel on the basis of primary signal
    activities and the number of possibly covered nodes, unlike CogMesh. B. Common
    Control Channel Setup Procedure To set up a CCC, CR nodes follow six steps: 1)
    Local sensing and scanning, 2) common channel invitation, 3) cluster tree construction,
    4) common channel reporting, 5) CCC decision, and 6) common channel advertisement.
    In the following subsections, the operations are explained in detail. 1. Local
    Sensing and Scanning Each node i in a ad hoc CR network periodically or aperiodically
    performs local sensing to determine the available channel set ( C a (i)) and primary
    channels. If a node needs to find an existing cluster to share the common channel,
    then it should scan all channels to possibly receive a common channel beacon (CC_BC)
    message from a neighbor node; CC_BC is periodically broadcast by a CH. A node
    should listen to one channel for a duration of at least T p to receive CC_BC.
    T p is the time interval taken for beacon transmission from the CH. The CC_BC
    includes the CCC information. Therefore, once a node receives the message, it
    can immediately tune to the indicated CCC and start exchanging control messages.
    In this case, there is no explicit procedure for connecting to the CH. The local
    sensing and scanning of each channel may be done simultaneously. 2. Common Channel
    Invitation If a node does not receive any CC_BC during the scanning procedure,
    then it can be inferred that there is no CCC or that the existing CCCs are not
    available for the node. In this case, the CR node initiates the cluster construction
    process by broadcasting a common channel invite (CC_IVT) message to its neighbor
    nodes using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).
    The CC_IVT message format is defined as in Fig. 2. The CC_IVT can be rebroadcast
    until the desired cluster size is reached. Transmitting node ID: ID of the node
    that transmits the CC_IVT. CH node ID (cluster head node ID): ID of the node that
    initially generated the CC_IVT. When a CH sends the CC_IVT at first, “Transmitting
    node ID” and “CH node ID” are the same. SEQ number (sequence number): Whenever
    a CH sends a CC_IVT to find a new CCC, it increases the SEQ number by 1. This
    number is for uniquely identifying CC_IVT messages; periodic CC_IVT repetitions
    have the same SEQ number. Hop count: The desired maximum hop counts (cluster size)
    from the CH to retain the same CCC. When a node receives a CC_IVT, it decreases
    the hop count by 1, and it broadcasts it again only if the count is not zero.
    Candidate channel list (CCL): This list contains the candidate channels that can
    possibly be used as the CCC. Whenever a node rebroadcasts a CC_IVT, the CCL can
    be updated. Fig. 2. CC_IVT message format. Show All If a CH node broadcasts the
    CC_IVT message only on a single channel, then some neighbor nodes cannot receive
    the message when the channel used to broadcast the CC_IVT is not available to
    these neighbor nodes. Further, because each CR node tunes into one of the available
    channels at a given time, the neighbor nodes may not be able to receive the message
    even though the channel is available to the neighbor nodes. Therefore, a CH sequentially
    broadcasts a CC_IVT on each available channel using a single transceiver, as is
    shown in Fig. 3. If the CH has multiple transceivers, then the available channels
    are subdivided among the different transceivers. After a duration of T p , the
    CH rebroadcasts the CC_IVT with the same SEQ number. Each neighbor node should
    wait at least for a duration of T p for each of its available channels. If a neighbor
    node does not receive the CC_IVT, then it switches to the next channel on its
    local available channel list. Fig. 3. Broadcasting CC_IVT via the CH. Show All
    3. Common Channel Cluster Tree Construction After a node receives a CC_IVT from
    its neighbor node, it stores the candidate channel list of the CC_IVT and the
    node ID of the transmitting node. When node i receives a CC_IVT from neighbor
    node j , it determines the overlapping common channel set C ^ c (i,j) from its
    local available channel list C a (i) and the CCL of the received CC_IVT, C IVT
    c (j) , from node j . C ^ c (i,j)= C a (i)∩ C IVT c (j). (1) View Source If node
    i first receives a CC_IVT message from node j and C ^ c (i,j)≠Φ , then node i
    records node j as a parent node. Note that within a cluster, each node can reach
    the CH through its parent node using one of the overlapping common channels. Then,
    node i rebroadcasts the CC_IVT with an updated CCL as indicated in (2). C IVT
    c (i)= C c (i,j)= C ^ c (i,j)= C a (i)∩ C IVT c (j) (2) View Source where C c
    (i,j) is the set of channels in the CCL field rebroadcast by nodc i after receiving
    a CC_IVT from node j . After decreasing the hop count of the received CC_IVT,
    unless the hop count is zero, node i sequentially and periodically rebroadcasts
    the CC_IVT message on all available channels. If there are no overlapping channels
    between its locally available channels and the received CCL from node j , then
    it indicates that node i and node j do not have any common channels; therefore,
    they are not able to setup a CCC. In this case, node i simply discards the CC_IVT.
    If node i receives additional CC_IVT messages satisfying the following three conditions
    from any other neighbor node k , then it simply discards them. The same CH node
    ID with the previously received CC_IVT from node j . The same SEQ number. C ^
    c (i,k)⊂ ∪ of node i for all parent nodes j C c (i,j). (3) View Source If some
    channels of C ^ c (i,k) were not included in the previous CC_INV forwarded, then
    it indicates that node i can have new channels that can be used as a CCC; these
    new channels are not selected on the basis of CC_IVTs sent by the previous parent
    nodes. Therefore, if the condition in (4) is satisfied despite the CH node ID
    and SEQ number of the CC_IVT from node i being the same as those in the CC_IVT
    from the previous parent nodes, then node k becomes a new parent node of node
    i and node i rebroadcasts the CC_IVT from node k to its neighbor nodes with the
    CCL in (5). C IVT c (i)= = C ^ c (i,k)⊄ ∪ of node i for all parent nodes j C
    c (i,j), C c (i,k) { C a (i)∩ C IVT c (k)}− ∪ of node i for all parent nodes j
    C c (i,j). (4) (5) View Source Fig. 4 explains the CC_IVT message transmissions
    and presents an example of tree construction. As shown in the figure, the CC_IVT
    message is propagated until the desired cluster size is reached, and the common
    channel cluster tree is constructed accordingly. When there is no neighbor node
    to rebroadcast the CC_IVT or when the neighbor nodes cannot receive the CC_IVT,
    the message cannot be propagated further even if the desired cluster size is not
    reached. It should be noted that unlike the conventional multicasting tree, a
    node can be involved in multiple tree paths because the common control tree is
    built according to channel availability. The numbers in brackets for each node
    are the available channels of that node. Assume that node A is the CH that generated
    the CC_IVT message. Node B receives the CC_IVT message from node A on one of its
    available channels (channel 1 or channel 2) and computes the candidate channel
    list, which consists of the overlapping available channels between node A and
    node B, as indicated in (2). Then, node B rebroadcasts the CC_IVT message (in
    Fig. 4, CC_IVT (3) message). For channel 1 and channel 2, node B records node
    A as a parent node. On the other hand, node D cannot receive the CC_IVT from node
    A because it does not have any available channels overlapping with node A. When
    node B receives CC_IVT (2) from node C, since node B has already set up a common
    channel tree for the channel set {1, 2}, node B simply ignores the message. Fig.
    4. CC_IVT transmission and tree construction. Show All As shown in Fig. 4, node
    H receives two CC_IVT messages. We assume that the CC_IVT from node F arrives
    later than the CC_IVT from E. Node H discovers that the CH node ID and the SEQ
    number of each of the CC_IVTs are the same, but the CCLs are different. At node
    H, first, the candidate channel list with parent node E is derived as {1, 2} using
    (2), and when node H receives the list a little later in the CC_IVT from F, the
    CCL with parent node F is newly derived as {3} using (5). Therefore, node H has
    two parent nodes: Node E for channel set {1, 2} and node F for {3}. When node
    K finally receives the CC_IVT, the hop count reaches 0, and therefore, node K
    stops CC_IVT broadcasting. 4. Common Channel Reporting Common channel report (CC_RPT)
    message is used to deliver CCC information on the path through which the CC_IVT
    is delivered, to the CH to help in deciding the final common channel. For the
    following two cases, a node stops broadcasting a CC_IVT and periodically sends
    back a CC_RPT message to its parent nodes. A node receives a CC_IVT and the hop
    count reaches zero. A node has broadcast a CC_IVT, but has not received any CC_RPT
    message during a certain time T R T R =(R_Hop_Count) T W (6) View Source where
    R_Hop_Count is the hop count at the node when it has broadcast the CC_IVT and
    T W indicates the maximum waiting time to receive a CC_RPT from one hop neighbor
    node. The CC_RPT message format is illustrated in Fig. 5. Transmitting node ID:
    ID of the node that transmits the CC_RPT. CH node ID: ID of the CH node that initially
    generated CC_IVT. SEQ number: The same SEQ number as that of the received CC_IVT.
    Tuple {Ch, P p , T pi , NUM C } : For each candidate common channel on the path
    to the CH, the following definitions hold. Ch : Candidate CCC P p : Accumulated
    PS appearance probability on the channel “ Ch ” T pi : Accumulated average PS
    idle time on the channel “ Ch ” NUM C : Accumulated number of connected nodes
    that can use the channel “ Ch ” as a CCC Fig. 5. CC_RPT message format. Show All
    Each node in ad hoc CR networks senses the channels and maintains a channel status
    table that contains the PS appearance probability ( P p ) and the average PS idle
    time ( T pi ) of each channel. In this paper, we utilize the PS appearance probability
    and idle time statistics for the CCC decision. As we mentioned in the subsection
    on design requirements, to ensure that the common channel in a cluster is used
    by as many nodes of the cluster as possible, information on the number of nodes
    on the channel tree to the cluster head is included in the CC_RPT message. Fig.
    6 shows an example of a CC_RPT delivery procedure. When nodes I and K receive
    CC_IVT messages, the hop count reaches zero, so nodes I and K cease to broadcast
    the CC_IVT and respond with CC_RPT messages to their parent nodes. After node
    C sends a CC_IVT, it does not receive any CC_RPT during a certain time (i.e.,
    2 T W ). Therefore, node C initiates a CC_RPT response message. The CC_PRT message
    is delivered to the parent node on the channel cluster tree to the CH. Note that
    the tree formation from the CH to nodes with a hop count within a predetermined
    value is already performed upon the delivery of the CC_IVT message, so that nodes
    can send a CC_RPT to only their stored parent nodes on available channels. Each
    node on the common channel cluster tree adds the PS appearance probability and
    the average primary idle time of each channel to the received CC_RPT message.
    In Fig. 6, node B adds its local measurement information on channel 1 to that
    of CC_RPT (2) from node G, so that the tuple of channel 1 of CC_RPT (3) is {1,
    0.8, 25, 3}. Node H has two different parent nodes, E and F, for the candidate
    channel sets {1, 2} and {3}, respectively. Therefore, the channel information
    on {1, 2} and {3} is delivered to the CH through node E and node F, respectively.
    In the proposed mechanism, the channel and connectivity information of each node
    inside the desired cluster size is delivered to the CH through a unique path so
    that each node''s information is not counted as duplicate content. Fig. 7 shows
    the pseudocode for our proposed CC_RPT transmission scheme. Fig. 6. CC_RPT transmission
    example. Show All Fig. 7. Pseudocode for the common channel reporting procedure.
    Show All 5. Common Control Channel Decision A CH maintains a candidate CCC status
    table. Whenever the CH receives CC_RPT messages, it updates the table. For each
    channel in the received CC_RPT messages, P p , T pi , and the connected nodes
    are accumulated. Finally, the CH divides P p and T pi by the number of connected
    nodes for each channel after the CH has received a sufficient number of CC_RPT
    messages, or after the maximum waiting time has expired. The cluster head can
    estimate the average PS appearance probability, average PS idle time, and the
    total number of possibly connected nodes including CH itself for each candidate
    CCC. Therefore, the CH can identify a CCC based on the PS activities and determine
    the number of nodes that can be connected together via a common channel. Table
    1 shows the status of each candidate channel for the example scenario in Fig.
    6. Table 1. Candidate CCC status for a scenario corresponding to the table in
    Fig. 6. Depending on the importance of each parameter, the CH can determine the
    optimal CCC. Various decision rules can be applied (e.g., a cost function with
    different weights for three parameters). In this paper, the purpose of determining
    a CCC is that as many CR nodes as possible should be able to share the same CCC
    as long as the primary activity values are less than the pre-defined thresholds.
    As shown in Fig. 8, in step 1, the channel set CS P is determined by considering
    the PS appearance probability, and the average PS idle time is considered in step
    2. From the channel set CS T , the channel with the largest number of connected
    nodes is finally selected for use as the CCC. After step 1 or step 2, if the number
    of channels determined is less than 2, then the channel with the minimum P p (in
    step 1) or maximum T pi (in step 2) is selected. Fig. 8. Procedure for the CCC
    decision. Show All 6. Common Control Advertisement After the CH determines the
    optimal CCC, information on the selected CCC is sequentially broadcast with a
    common channel advertisement (CC_ADV) message to the nodes in the cluster hop
    count on all available channels. After a sufficient number of CC_ADV transmissions
    have been completed, the CH switches to the CCC and periodically broadcasts CC_BC.
    The CC_BC is a message to indicate activation of the new CCC. The neighbor nodes
    that receive CC_ADV sequentially rebroadcast the CC_ADV along with their available
    channels and then switch to the CCC. Therefore, switching to the new CCC is performed
    sequentially in the cluster. When a node receives a CC_ADV message, the selected
    CCC may not be available to the node. In this case, the node discards the CC_ADV
    and tries to find or construct a new cluster by starting from procedure A (scanning).
    It should be noted that since ad hoc nodes can move without notifications, the
    CH should periodically reinitiate the common channel setup procedure. In this
    paper, the proposed CCC selection algorithm relies on many broadcast messages.
    Since radio signals are likely to overlap with other signals in a geographical
    area, straightforward broadcasting usually results in serious redundancy and collision,
    which is referred to as the broadcast storm problem. To reduce the number of broadcast
    packets and possible packet losses resulting from collisions, several mechanisms
    have been proposed in the literature, such as a probabilistic scheme, a counter-based
    scheme, and spanning tree clustering [23], [24]. Any broadcast storm avoidance
    mechanism can be used with the proposed method. SECTION IV. Cluster Management
    A. Cluster Merge and Interconnection Multiple CCC clusters organized in the network
    can be merged or interconnected by gateway nodes. Cluster merge and interconnection
    mechanisms facilitate seamless data exchanges between any pair of nodes in the
    network by enhancing the network connectivity. A node that already uses a CCC
    of a certain cluster may overhear another cluster''s CC_ADV or CC_BC messages
    through one of the available channels during its normal operation. When both clusters
    use the same control channel, the overhearing node can be a gateway node to merge
    two clusters, as shown in Fig. 9(a). In this case, all ad hoc nodes in the two
    clusters can exchange control messages by using a single common channel. If the
    CCC in the overheard messages is different but one available to the node, then
    the node can interconnect the two clusters via control channel switching, as shown
    in Fig. 9(b). Fig. 9. Cluster merge and interconnection: (a) Cluster merge and
    (b) cluster interconnection. Show All In the case of cluster interconnection,
    if a single transceiver is used to access a common control channel, the gateway
    node needs to divide its resources between both clusters, as shown in Fig. 9(b),
    so the neighbor nodes (nodes B and G) of the gateway node should know the exact
    time schedule of the gateway node. The time schedule indicates when the gateway
    node switches to the neighbor cluster''s CCC. Therefore, the greater the number
    of gateway nodes in the network, the higher the cluster connection overheads and
    the lower the control channel throughput. In the proposed procedure for CCC selection,
    a CH selects a CCC that can reach many nodes without gateway nodes. When the CH
    selects a new control channel, it considers the number of nodes connected to each
    candidate CCC, which is obtained from NUM c in the CC_RPT message. Another method
    to reduce the gateway nodes in this paper is to broadcast a gateway node announcement
    to its neighbors. If there are many overlapping nodes between two clusters, we
    may have multiple candidate gateway nodes. Once any node assumes the gateway role,
    it broadcasts a gateway advertisement (GATE_ADV) message to its neighbor nodes,
    and any neighbor node that receives the message will not be a gateway node. The
    GATE_ADV message includes the CH IDs of both clusters. B. Common Channel Change
    Even though the CH selects the CCC after proper consideration of the average PS
    appearance probability and idle time, the PS may suddenly use the CCC. Since the
    cognitive radio network should avoid harmful interference with PSs, when nodes
    detect the primary signal on the current CCC, the detection information should
    be conveyed to the neighbors. In addition, the detecting nodes should stop using
    the CCC, to protect the PSs. In the proposed mechanism, the primary system detection
    information is delivered to the CH, and the CH decides whether the common channel
    should be changed. This decision will be made on the basis of the cost of changing
    the CCC (i.e., message exchange overhead and delay) and the number of detecting
    nodes in the cluster. If the CCC is not changed, then the detecting nodes simply
    leave the cluster without exchanging messages. As mentioned in Section III, the
    detecting nodes may try to form a new cluster or join one of the other existing
    clusters. 1. Primary Detection Notification When a node detects a primary signal
    on the current CCC, it sends a common channel detection (CC_DET) message to the
    CH on the present CCC and immediately returns to listen mode. In this mode, a
    node can listen to a common channel signal, but it is prohibited from sending
    messages on the channel. Even though it is not on the routing path to the CH,
    any neighbor node that overhears the CC_DET message performs local sensing to
    determine whether it is inside the primary signal area. The CC_DET message includes
    the CH node ID, the SEQ number (the same as the SEQ in CC_ADV), information on
    the primary detected CCC, and NUM d . NUM d is the number of detecting nodes on
    the routing path. At the first detecting node, NUM d is set to 1. 2. Forwarding
    CC_DET Message When a node receives a CC_DET message, if it is the next node on
    the routing path, then it forwards the message to the CH node. If it is not on
    the routing path and has simply overheard the message, then it performs local
    sensing. If the node detects a primary signal on the CCC as a result of local
    sensing, then it initiates the primary detection notification procedure by sending
    a CC_DET message. If the node is on the path and has also detected a primary signal
    and if it has not previously forwarded any CC_DET message with the same SEQ and
    CH node ID, then it increases NUM d by 1 and forwards the CC_DET to the CH. If
    the node has already transmitted the CC_DET with the same SEQ and CH node ID to
    the same CH node or if it does not detect a primary signal on the CCC, then it
    simply forwards the message to the CH without increasing NUM d . Fig. 10 shows
    the CC_DET forwarding procedure. Nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G belong to the cluster
    using channel 1 as the CCC; node A is the CH of that cluster. As soon as node
    F detects the primary signal of channel 1, it transmits a CC_DET to its neighbor
    node E that is on the routing path to node A. Since node E is also within the
    range of the primary signal, it increases NUM d by 1. Node B is not influenced
    by the primary signal, and therefore, it forwards the CC_DET to node A without
    increasing NUM d . Fig. 10. Forwarding CC_DET. Show All 3. Common Channel Change
    On the basis of the received CC_DETs, the CH decides whether it should change
    the cost CCC. To change the current CCC, the CH should take into account of CCC
    in terms of the number of control message exchanges and the delay in forming a
    new cluster. The percentage of NUM d in the total number of nodes in the cluster
    can be used to determine CCC change criteria. If the CH decides to change the
    current CCC, then it broadcasts a common channel change (CC_CNG) message in all
    available channels, including the new CCC. The new channel is selected from the
    candidate common channel set shown in Table 1. If there is no candidate channel
    for the new CCC, then the CH initiates a new common channel construction procedure
    by sending a CC_IVT. When a node receives a CC_CNG, it decreases the hop count
    and checks whether the hop count is zero. If it is not zero, the node rebroadcasts
    the CC_CNG on all available channels. Then, the node switches to the new CCC.
    4. Cluster Division If a node in the listen mode is not able to hear the CC_CNG
    message from the CH until the CC_CNG waiting time has expired or if the new CCC
    of the received CC_CNG is not available to the node, then the node starts a new
    CCC setup procedure as discussed in Section III. Before it initiates a new cluster,
    it should wait to check whether it receives any CC_BCs from neighboring clusters
    for joining one of the existing clusters. If there is no CC_BC matching the available
    channels, then it starts to create a new cluster by sending a CC_IVT message.
    In this case, cluster division can occur. SECTION V. Simulation Results In this
    section, simulation experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
    algorithm are discussed. For the simulation study, we implemented a CR network
    simulator completely in object-oriented C++, and the simulator includes a multi-channel
    system environment, channel sensing, and CSMA/CA based data transmission. We employ
    the common channel selection algorithm of CogMesh [10], [25] for performance comparison.
    CR network devices are randomly placed in a two-dimensional area 600 m×600 m ,
    and the maximum transmission range of a CR node is set to 40 m. We use the ON-OFF
    model for the PS appearance pattern. The CSMA/CA back-off mechanism is used when
    each node sends control messages. The entire area is subdivided into 36 grids
    ( 6×6 grids), as shown in Fig. 11. PSs are located at the cross points of the
    grids, and they affect the 4 neighboring grids. The channels used by the PSs are
    randomly selected from the channel pool (CP). The specific simulation parameters
    are shown in Table 2. Fig. 11 shows an example of a topology (300 CR nodes in
    the entire network and 5 channels in the CP) considered in our simulation study.
    Fig. 12 shows the corresponding PS appearances on grids G1, G15, and G25. From
    the ON-OFF model, the activation and idle time of the PSs are found to follow
    an exponential distribution with λ and μ . We set λ as 0.2 and μ as 0.4. Fig.
    11. Example of a simulation topology. Show All Fig. 12. PS appearances according
    to the ON-OFF model. Show All Table 2. Simulation parameters. In the first experiment,
    we observe the average number of clusters for different numbers of nodes. As shown
    in Fig. 13, when the cluster size (CS) is set to 1, the proposed scheme shows
    performance similar to that of CogMesh. However, as we increase the cluster size,
    the number of generated clusters decreases in the proposed method. Therefore,
    many CR nodes can have the same common channel. The number of channels in the
    CP is fixed at 5 in Figs. 13 and 14. Fig. 13. Number of clusters. Show All Fig.
    14. Number of isolated nodes. Show All The number of single-node clusters is compared
    for the different methods in Fig. 14. A single-node cluster has only a single-node
    that is acting as a CH. It can be considered as an isolated node, and it cannot
    exchange control messages with neighbor nodes. Therefore, a smaller percentage
    of single-node clusters indicates better network connectivity. As shown in Fig.
    14, the proposed method results in a lesser number of isolated nodes. In the CCC
    selection, it is desirable that the selected CCC should be stable for the longest
    time possible. This stability can be measured by determining the average PS appearance
    probability and the average idle time of the PS of the chosen CCC. For different
    CP sizes, ranging from 1 to 20 channels, the stability factors are compared (Figs.
    15 and 16). The number of nodes in the network is set to 150. Regardless of the
    total number of channels, PS appearance probabilities determined by using CogMesh
    do not show a specific trend with increasing CP for the selected CCC because it
    is not aware of the PS statistics. When the network has a single channel, the
    two algorithms show similar performances in selecting the CCC. However, as the
    number of channels in the CP increases, the proposed protocol shows outstanding
    performance with regard to not only the PS appearance probability but also the
    CCC idle time. In other words, the proposed method needs less frequent CCC changes
    compared to the conventional method. Fig. 15. Average PS appearance probability
    for the selected CCC. Show All Fig. 16. Average primary system idle time for the
    selected CCC. Show All Fig. 17 presents the number of clusters for different CP
    sizes. When the size of the CP is one, the network is reduced to a single-channel
    network. Upon increasing the CP size, CogMesh retains a similar number of clusters.
    On the other hand, the number of clusters is significantly reduced as the CPs
    are increased in the proposed protocol because if the number of channels increases,
    then each cluster can find a CCC that can cover many CR nodes with high possibility.
    Fig. 17. The number of clusters in different CPs: (a) CogMesh and (b) proposed.
    Show All In Fig. 18, we show the average delay of cluster formation. To successfully
    set up a CCC for a cluster, some control message exchanges (CC_IVT, CC_RPT, and
    CC_ADV) are required in the proposed method. When the cluster size is 1, the required
    time is relatively short and similar to that of CogMesh. However, as the cluster
    size increases, the path from a CH to the last node on the cluster boundary also
    increases, so the average delay increases. However, the larger the cluster size,
    the more the nodes that can use the CCC and the lesser the number of gateway nodes
    required. Fig. 18. Average delay for cluster formation. Show All Figs. 19 and
    20 show the number of gateway nodes for cluster merging and cluster interconnection,
    respectively. As the number of nodes in the network increases, we can observe
    that the number of gateway nodes also increases. In the proposed method, as the
    CS increased, the required number of gateway nodes for a given number of nodes
    in the network decreases since each cluster contains more member nodes. The gateway
    node should perform common channel switching, resource sharing between multiple
    clusters, and frequent control message exchanges. Therefore, a small number of
    gateway nodes are required if reliable network connectivity is supported. The
    proposed method (with CS≥2 ) always shows a lesser number of gateway nodes than
    CogMesh, as can be observed in Figs. 19 and 20, and the network connectivity is
    also superior to that of CogMesh, as shown in Fig. 14. Fig. 19. Number of gateway
    nodes that perform cluster merging. Show All Fig. 20. Number of gateway nodes
    that perform cluster interconnection. Show All Fig. 21 explains the CCC change
    trials performed by the CH when the nodes detect PS appearances. In this experiment,
    the number of nodes is 300, and if the number of detected nodes in a certain cluster
    is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% of the total number of nodes in the cluster, then
    the CH tries to change the existing CCC. In the proposed method, upon detecting
    PS appearances, the detecting node in a certain cluster sends a CC_DET message
    to its CH. After the CH receives several CC_DETs, it should decide on the basis
    of the number of detected nodes whether the cluster should change the current
    CCC. If a large number of nodes detect the PS, then the CH selects a new CCC using
    the aforementioned CCC selection algorithm. The x-axis of Fig. 21 represents the
    threshold percentage of detecting nodes required to effect a CCC change. As expected,
    a lower threshold percentage results in more CCC change trials. In fact, a CCC
    change involves high cost in terms of convergence time, cluster re-formation,
    and message exchanges. Therefore, if the area of the primary detected signal is
    relatively small, then local CCC repair is preferred. In local CCC repair, if
    the nodes that transmitted CC_DET do not receive any CCC change message within
    a predetermined time, then they simply join one of the neighbor clusters or start
    a new cluster formation process. Fig. 21. CCC change trials performed by the CH
    upon detecting the PS. Show All Fig. 22 shows the CCC switching delay. When a
    CH decides to change the current CCC, it transmits a CC_CNG message and the message
    is sent to all the nodes in the cluster. In this experiment, we measured the delay
    up to the instant at which a node successfully changed the control channel after
    the CH announced a CCC change. As can be observed in Fig. 22, as the cluster size
    increases, the average delay also increases. Since the CC_CNG is sent from the
    CH, a node that is closer to the CH can switch to the new control channel much
    faster than cluster boundary nodes. Fig. 22. Common control channel switching
    delay. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed an efficient
    common control channel selection protocol for ad hoc networks in the context of
    CR. The control channel for CR operation is constructed in a distributed way.
    To determine an optimal common control channel, we have defined a channel-based
    tree from the cluster head to the nodes within a predetermined number of hops.
    The proposed distributed coordination protocol takes into account the primary
    system activities of each channel and node connectivity for common channel selection.
    We have also proposed a primary detection notification procedure to efficiently
    change the common control channel. In a simulation study, we have evaluated the
    protocol performance under various network conditions. Compared with the conventional
    CogMesh CR clustering method, the proposed DCP-CCC requires a smaller number of
    clusters, and therefore, many CR nodes can communicate with the same control link.
    Further, the proposed DCP-CCC enhances the control channel connectivity at the
    cost of an increase in the delay in cluster formation. The most important contribution
    of this paper is that the common control channel selected by using the proposed
    protocol is more reliable and stable since it is selected by considering channel
    activities of the primary systems. The proposed protocol also reduces the frequency
    with which control channels are changed and cluster re-formation. Authors Figures

  title: Distributed coordination protocol for ad hoc cognitive radio networks
  verbatim_quote1: In ad hoc cognitive radio networks, a common control channel (CCC)
    is usually used for supporting transmission coordination and spectrum-related
    information exchange. Determining a CCC in distributed networks is a challenging
    research issue because the spectrum availability at each ad hoc node is quite
    different and dynamic due to the interference between and coexistence of primary
    users. In this paper, we propose a novel CCC selection protocol that is implemented
    in a distributed way according to the appearance patterns of primary systems and
    connectivity among nodes.
  verbatim_quote2: The proposed protocol minimizes the possibility of CCC disruption
    by primary user activities and maximizes node connectivity when the control channel
    is set up. It also facilitates adaptive recovery of the control channel when the
    primary user is detected on that channel.

    Abstract: For high-data-rate wireless communication systems, two major issues
    are the underutilization of limited available radio spectrum and the effect of
    channel fading. Using dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radio can improve spectrum
    utilization. Almost all proposed CR systems are based on multicarrier modulation
    since multiple users can access the MCM systems by allocating subcarriers. Generally,
    MCM mainly includes two different schemes, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
    and filtered multitone modulation. Considering mutual interference elimination,
    synchronization, and transmission efficiency, we conclude that FMT is better than

    cognitive model, and the hybrid model. Additionally, radio resources can be extended
    from time-frequency dimensions to space-time-frequency dimensions in the proposed

    Introduction The authors combine CR with the cooperative diversity technique,
    and construct three cooperative diversity cognitive models: the collaborative
    spectrum sensing model, the cooperative communication cognitive model, and the
    hybrid model. As we know, almost all existing wireless communication networks
    are allocated a fixed spectrum, resulting in a large portion of the assigned spectrum
    being used sporadically [1]–[3]. According to a report by the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC), the percentage of the assigned spectrum that is occupied ranges
    only from 15 to 85 percent, varying widely in time and geographical position [2].
    Hence, the limitation and underutilization of available spectrum resource accelerates
    new research. Ultra-wideband (UWB) and cognitive radio (CR) are candidate techniques
    to improve utilization of the assigned spectrum. Under the power spectral density
    emission limit of Part 15, which is −41.3 dBm/MHz or significantly lower (as low
    as −75 dBm/MHz), UWB can share wideband spectrum with other existing wireless
    systems. However, the application of UWB is limited because of its ultra-wideband
    frequency range, poor agility, and high complexity. The term cognitive radio was
    first introduced by Joseph Mitola. As a promising candidate, CR has the ability
    to share or reuse spectrum in an opportunistic manner by employing spectrum overlay
    and/or spectrum underlay approaches, which results in an increase of spectrum
    utilization [1]–[3]. In [1], the authors defined CR as an intelligent wireless
    communication technology that is aware of its surrounding environment, uses the
    methodology of understanding-by-building to learn from the environment, and then
    adapts its internal states to statistical variations in the incoming radio frequency
    stimuli by making corresponding changes in certain operating parameters (e.g.,
    transmit power, carrier frequency, and modulation strategy) in real time. Moreover,
    high-data-rate wireless communication systems are limited not only by the limited
    spectrum, but often more significantly by the fading effects due to multipath
    propagation, the Doppler effect, and the angle spread of the wireless channel.
    Diversity is one of the most effectual methods to resist the fading effect. As
    we know, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), multicarrier modulation (MCM)
    and code-division multiple access (CDMA) are commonly considered as candidates.
    The MCM schemes, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and
    filtered multitone (FMT) modulation [4], are approaches to overcome the intersymbol
    interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation. CDMA can suppress narrowband
    noise and interference by spreading the signal bandwidth to a wideband spectrum.
    Hence, MCM such as OFDM and multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) are hailed as promising
    candidates for realizing spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay CR applications
    [2], [5], respectively. In MC-CDMA-based CR (MC-CDMA-CR) systems, it is possible
    to abandon distributed sensing in a way that the transmitting secondary user (SU)
    can spread its signal across the entire band, including that occupied by the primary
    user (PU), which results in a base station and/or signaling channel not being
    needed. Furthermore, MC-CDMA allows narrowband PU interferers to be excluded locally
    at the SU receiver, hence improving its performance. In other words, MC-CDMA technology
    is more suitable for spectrum underlay CR applications. However, we mainly focus
    on spectrum overlay CR systems in this article. Therefore, MC-CDMA-CR is not discussed
    below. Additionally, MIMO can improve the channel capacity and performance of
    wireless communication systems by using space and time resources. However, it
    is not sufficient that only one antenna be built in the mobile station due to
    the limitations of its cost, size, and complexity. Moreover, the MIMO technique
    does not work well when the fading is large-scale. Consequently, cooperative diversity
    [6], also called virtual MIMO, has been proposed, in which users can transmit
    data by sharing antennas of other users surrounding them. Similarly, a cooperative
    communication system can obtain the space diversity gain and improve reliability.
    The basic ideas behind cooperative communication can be traced back to the groundbreaking
    work of Cover and EI Gamal on the information theoretic properties of the relay
    channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). However, the aim of relays
    is only to help the source transmit infor-mation, whereas the users in cooperative
    communication systems can act as both information sources and relays. Nosratinia
    et al. have proven that even though the interuser channel is noisy, cooperation
    can still lead not only to an increase in capacity for both users, but also to
    a more robust system [6]. In this case, the achievable rates of users are less
    susceptible to channel variations. There are three main cooperative signaling
    protocols: amplify-and-forward (AF), detect-and-forward (DF), and coded cooperation
    (CC) methods [6]. In this field, the key techniques mainly include power allocation,
    cooperative partner selection, performance evaluation, and so forth. In fact,
    CR and cooperative communication have developed rapidly in their own fields. However,
    there is little advantage in improving spectrum utilization when only cooperative
    communication is used, whereas CR is not good for improving the symbol error rate
    performance of each user. Consequently, combining CR with cooperative communication
    may be a good solution to both problems. Ghasemi [7] and Ganesan [8] first proposed
    the collaborative (exchanging spectrum hole vectors with each other) and cooperative
    communication scheme to improve the detection probability of spectrum sensing
    in CR systems. Nevertheless, both of them are only based on AF and do not take
    the locations of SUs into consideration. After that, Devroye introduced cooperative
    communication to data transmission, and obtained fundamental limits of achievable
    rates in CR systems. Obviously, this model is ideal and needs cooperative communications
    among SUs. Finally, Simeone et al. studied the cognitive relaying scheme between
    PUs and SUs [9], which is of course a simple and elementary discussion. Con-sequently,
    in this article we expand the models of Ghasemi and Devroye, and give an overview
    of the cooperative diversity cognitive models, which combine MCM, cooperative
    diversity, and CR techniques together. The longer the delay spread of the channel
    is, the longer the length of the CP is, and thus the less the efficiency is. Obviously,
    these methods conflict with the concept of improving the spectrum utilization
    of the CR technique. This article is organized as follows. In the next section
    we discuss MCM techniques in the multihop CR system. Then three cooperative diversity
    cognitive models are proposed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the
    proposed models in the following section. Conclusions are drawn in the final section.
    Multicarrier Modulation Techniques in Multihop CR Networks Recently, some work
    has been reported on multihop CR networks [10], in which each node has a list
    of available frequency bands and must work adaptively among these frequency bands
    because of dynamic spectrum access. It is well known that two nodes cannot communicate
    if they work on different frequency bands. Hence, routing in multihop CR networks
    becomes a critical and challenging issue. In general, solutions of this problem
    mainly focus on the methods in the network layer, whose processing delay is on
    the order of milliseconds. However, the high-speed wireless channel in multihop
    CR networks varies on the order of microseconds due to multipath fading, the Doppler
    effect, and dynamic occupancy of the subchannel by PUs. Therefore, the solutions
    proposed in the network layer may cause heavy interference to PUs. To this end,
    adopting MCM to intersection nodes (i.e., RUs) of multihop CR networks may be
    a good solution in the physical layer. Because of the usage of MCM, the intersection
    node can allocate some unused subcarriers to different information flows; thus,
    all flows can be transmitted simultaneously. In fact, considering that the access
    of multiple users can be implemented by the allocation of subcarriers in an MCM
    system, almost all of the proposed spectrum overlay CR systems are based on MCM
    technology, specifically the MCM-CR system. Moreover, almost all proposed MCM-CR
    systems are based on OFDM [2], such as IEEE 802.22, the spectrum pooling system
    proposed by Timo A. Weiss, and the Next Generation (xG) communication networks
    proposed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [2]. Recently,
    cosine modulated multitone (CMT)-based CR (CMT-CR) and FMT-based CR (FMT-CR) systems
    have also been proposed [3]. In an MCM-CR system, a maximum likelihood detection
    (MLD) model is deduced under the constraint of the interference temperature [3].
    Moreover, the optimal detection region, and the probability of detection and false
    alarm are obtained in [3]. Spectrum allocation and access algorithms are well
    studied in [2], [3]. Based on the MLD scheme and Markovian chain prediction (MCP)
    model, an efficient SU access algorithm based on spectrum hole vector (SHV) is
    proposed to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the SUs in a centralized
    MCM-CR system in [3]. However, one issue of the MCM-CR system is that it requires
    a large size inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT)/DFT operation due to the
    varying locations of each subcarrier in a wide spectrum, resulting in a heavy
    implementation complexity and serious delay. To this end, a scheme combining Cooley-Tukey''s
    recursive algorithm with pruning algorithm can be adopted. Now, the main issue
    becomes: which technique is better in an MCM-CR system, OFDM or FMT? We discuss
    more detail in the following. Recently, some challenges in the physical layer
    of OFDM-CR systems have been analyzed (e.g., mutual interference and synchronization)
    [2]. In OFDM-CR systems, spectrum partitioning is realized in the form of overlapping
    sub-bands, in which adjacent subcarriers are at the nulls of the sinc(f) function.
    Therefore, spectrum efficiency is high. However, the requirement of synchronization
    is also very strict, especially for frequency synchronization. If the subcarriers
    are not orthogonal, the sidelobes of the sine-shaped spectrum on each subcarrier
    may fully interfere with PUs even if the parameter of the OFDM system used by
    PUs and SUs is the same. More-over, the worse case is that OFDM is not adopted
    by PUs, or the parameters of OFDM for both PUs and SUs are different even though
    OFDM is used by PUs. To decrease the interference, the received OFDM signal is
    windowed in the time domain before it is fed into the operation of Fourier. Another
    method is to leave some virtual subcarriers (VCs) free. Furthermore, in an OFDM-CR
    system, the cyclic prefix (CP) or socalled guard interval is added to each transmitted
    symbol to avoid ISI, which occurs in multipath channels and destroys orthogonality.
    Unfortunately, like VCs, CP leads to a loss of transmission efficiency. The longer
    the delay spread of the channel, the longer the length of the CP, and thus the
    lesser the efficiency. Obviously, these methods conflict with the concept of improving
    the spectrum utilization of the CR technique. Compared with OFDM-CR systems, an
    FMT-CR system does not require CP between several continuous transmitted symbols
    [4]. Instead, the bandwidth of each subcarrier is chosen to be quasi-orthogonal
    in the frequency domain, which is also called subcarrier spectral containment,
    and it can be achieved by the use of steep rolloff bandpass filters (i.e., filter
    bank). As a result, the time domain response of these filters may overlap in several
    successive transmitted symbol peri-ods. Therefore, it is necessary for equalization
    per subchannel to reduce any remaining ISI, even if the channel is in an ideal
    state. A high level of subcarrier spectral containment is good for CR systems
    because the leakage of signal energy between adjacent subchannels may be neglected
    since it is as low as −70 dB where the subcarriers are closely spaced, as shown
    in Fig. 1. Figure 1 illustrates the frequency response of the first five subcarriers
    in an MCM system, where the solid and dashed lines denote FMT and OFDM, respectively.
    Due to the tight spectral containment achieved by the prototype filter in FMT,
    negligible power leaks into adjacent banks. Hence, fewer VCs are needed to comply
    with the regulatory power spectral mask than in an OFDM system. Figure 1. Frequency
    response of the first five subcarriers in MCM system with N c =64 (solid: FMT,
    dashed: OFDM). Show All Therefore, it is obvious that only a few VCs are needed
    since the CP is not necessary for FMT systems; thus, the transmission efficiency
    of FMT systems is better than that of OFDM systems. Without loss of generality,
    we define the transmission efficiency as η= N c N c + L CP N c − N vc N c = N
    c − N vc N c + L CP ×100%, (1) View Source where N c , N vc , and L CP denote
    the number of subcarriers, the number of VCs, and the length of the CP, respectively.
    For example, when the bandwidth of occupied spectrum equals 20 MHz, N c =64, L
    CP =16 , and N vc =12 in an OFDM system based on the standard of HIPERLAN/2 or
    IEEE 802.11a, while L CP =0 and N vc =2∼4 in an FMT system. Accordingly, the efficiency
    of OFDM and FMT is η OFDM =65 percent and η FMT ≈94 percent, respectively. Moreover,
    synchronization among different users is not serious in an FMT system because
    of its tight spectral containment. The disadvantage of the FMT is its complexity
    due to the filter bank and equalization per subchannel. However, it may not be
    a serious issue in the future due to the fast development of digital signal processing
    techniques. In summary, taking mutual interference suppression, synchronization,
    and transmission efficiency into consideration, it is much better to adopt FMT
    than OFDM in MCM-CR systems. Proposed Cooperative Diversity Cognitive Models in
    an MCM-CR System When the idea of CR is taken into account in the cooperative
    communication system, the cooperative communication system with cognitive relay
    can be proposed to further improve the spectrum efficiency. On the other hand,
    cooperative diversity CR systems can also be proposed when the idea of cooperative
    diversity is considered in a CR system. Thus, based on Chasemi and Devroye''s
    model, combining MCM, cooperative diversity, and CR techniques, we propose three
    cooperative diversity cognitive models, including the collaborative spectrum sensing
    model, the cooperative communication cognitive model, and the hybrid model, as
    shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Solid and dashed ellipses denote PUs
    in the primary network and SUs in the secondary network, respectively. Furthermore,
    dash-dotted lines denote the link to transmit the control data, including signaling
    and spectrum hole vector information. The solid and dashed lines denote the transmissions
    of the users'' self data and the partners'' data for cooperative retransmission,
    respectively. Figure 2. Proposed collaborative spectrum sensing model. Show All
    Figure 3. Proposed cooperative communication cognitive model. Show All Figure
    4. Proposed hybrid model. Show All The disadvantage of FMT is its complexity due
    to the filter bank and equalization per subchannel. However, it may not be a serious
    issue in the future due to the fast development of digital signal processing techniques.
    Collaborative Spectrum Sensing Model In the process of spectrum sensing, the fading
    effect, noise, and interference may cause some errors (result in false alarm detection
    and false dismissal detection), which are very harmful because they may introduce
    serious interference to PUs, resulting in a decrease of the spectrum utilization
    ratio. The left model in Fig. 2, which is one of the proposed collaborative spectrum
    sensing models between PUs and SUs, means that a PU leaves or broadcasts the spectrum
    hole information to SUs over the air or through a wired channel. Obviously, the
    PU is the licensed user, who would not do this. However, if a PU would like to
    allow SUs access to his/her licensed spectrum when he/she was not using them,
    he/she should offer the spectrum hole information to help SUs. Certainly, this
    proposed collaborative spectrum sensing model is simple and introduces no any
    interferences to PU because spectrum hole information is very accurate in this
    case. Nevertheless, the disadvantage of this model is that it needs an additional
    specialized channel to transmit the spectrum hole information from PU to SUs,
    as well as the permission and authorization of the PU. The proposed collaborative
    spectrum sensing model among SUs is shown in the right part of Fig. 2. Collaborative
    means that SUs can exchange or cooperatively retransmit their SHV information
    with each other. For some reasons, such as deep fading or distance from PUs, some
    SUs (e.g., SU t2 ) may not detect the used spectrum successfully, which will cause
    a false dismissal detection. However, their neighbors (e.g., SU t1 ) can do them
    a favor. Therefore, the detection probability of SU t2 can be improved by cooperatively
    communicating with its adjacent SUs (e.g., SU t1 ) or exchanging SHV information
    with each other. SHV exchange and cooperative communication were first proposed
    by Chasemi [7] and Ganesan [8], respectively. However, only AF was considered
    in [8]. Obviously, there are still many key techniques of the proposed collaborative
    spectrum sensing model that need to be further studied, such as the spectrum sensing
    algorithm, the influence of the detection probability and locations of SUs, the
    choice of cooperative partner, and so forth. In the proposed hybrid model, which
    may be close to the systems easily to carry out, there are two steps needed: collaborative
    spectrum sensing and cooperative communication. Certainly, they can also be implemented
    simultaneously. Cooperative Communication Cognitive Model In this proposed model,
    we assume that the SHV has been detected successfully by SUs. The top part of
    Fig. 3 shows the cooperative communication between PUs and SUs. PUs (e.g., PU
    t and PU r ) are source/receiver, and SUs (e.g., SU t1 or SU t2 ) act as relays
    to retransmit PUs'' data. The rationale of this choice is that helping the PU
    to increase its throughput entails (for a fixed demand of rate by the PU) a diminished
    transmission time for the PU, which leads to more transmission opportunities for
    the SUs. That is to say, the PUs'' data can be transmitted quickly, and some seconds
    are then saved for SUs to access the idle spectrum. The bottom part of Fig. 3
    shows the cooperative cognitive model among SUs, where the SUs act as cooperative
    partners with each other. In such a case, SUs can work in either half-duplex (left
    bottom) or full-duplex (right bottom) mode. When it is in half-duplex mode, time-division
    multiple access (TDMA) is often adopted by SUs, and SUs as relays (e.g., SU t2
    in the left bottom of Fig. 3) do not transmit data themselves. For full-duplex
    mode, CDMA is always selected by SUs, and SUs act as both source and relay (e.g.,
    SU t1 and SU t2 in the right bottom of Fig. 3). Similar to the proposed collaborative
    spectrum sensing, there are also many key techniques that need to be studied,
    such as the transmitter scheme of cooperative communication, capacity and diversity
    gain analysis, power allocation algorithm, receiver designing, partner selection
    algorithm, and so on. Hybrid Model As aforementioned, the proposed model of collaborative
    spectrum sensing is helpful for spectrum detection, while the proposed model of
    cooperative cognitive communication is mainly for data communication. However,
    spectrum detection and data communication will be as a whole in future practical
    CR systems. Therefore, the combination of the aforementioned two models (i.e.,
    a hybrid model) is proposed in this subsection, which is shown in Fig. 4. Obviously,
    in the proposed hybrid model, there are two steps needed: collaborative spectrum
    sensing and cooperative communication. Certainly, they can also be implemented
    simultaneously. Both collaborative spectrum sensing and cooperative communication
    are between PUs and SUs on the left of Fig. 4, while they are both among SUs on
    the right. Apparently, the same collaborative partners are not needed during the
    different steps. For example, collaborative spectrum sensing occurs between PUs
    and SUs during the first step, while cooperative communication is among SUs during
    the second step. Therefore, the probability of spectrum detection is very important.
    In the future, further research is needed on the hybrid model, including spectrum
    sensing, the influence of probability of spectrum detection, the selection of
    cooperative users, the synchronization and channel estimation algorithm, and so
    forth. Note that we need to point out that the MCM technology can be used in any
    of the three proposed models. Moreover, the space diversity gain can be obtained
    by adopting cooperative communication technology. Therefore, the introduction
    of cooperative diversity expands CR research from two dimensions (time-frequency)
    to three dimensions (space-time-frequency). In summary, all resources can be fully
    and effectively utilized to improve the performance of MCM-CR systems. Finally,
    it is necessary to point out that the PU''s model to occupy the channel is no
    limitation in this article. This is because we mainly focus on the model description
    and performance analysis, which results in the detection probability of the spectrum
    being the chief factor considered in the three proposed models, regardless of
    the PU''s model to occupy the channel. Simulation Results To get insight into
    the effectiveness of the proposed models and validate some related analytical
    results, extensive computer simulations have been conducted in which M -phase
    shift keying (MPSK) modulation is used, and channel coefficients h i,j (i∈{s,r},j∈{r,d})
    are independent samples of zero mean complex Gaussian random variables with variance
    σ 2 i,j , where s,r , and d denote the source, relay, and destination, respectively.
    Moreover, we assume σ 2 s,d =1, σ 2 s,r =1 , σ 2 r,d =10 , and the total transmitted
    power P= P s + P r , where P s and P r represent the power allocated to source
    and relay, respectively. Performance Loss with Probability of Spectrum Detection
    Here, we adopt the half-duplex model seen in the right part of Fig. 4, in which
    SHV information is exchanged for collaborative spectrum sensing and cooperative
    communication among SUs. We assume that there is only one communication link between
    PU t and PU r , and several links among SUs. Obviously, the collaborative probability
    of spectrum detection P d =1−(1− P ds ) n , where P ds (we have assumed that it
    is the same for all SUs) is the probability of spectrum detection by each SU without
    any help, and n is the number of SUs selected to join in SHV exchange for collaborative
    spectrum sensing. Then we further assume that only one SU (e.g., SU t2 ) is randomly
    selected to be a relay partner for cooperative communication after collaborative
    spectrum sensing. Based on these assumptions, the unconditional symbol error rate
    (SER) performance in an AF cooperation communication system is illustrated in
    Fig. 5, in which P ds =0.9 , and equal power allocation (EPA) is used. In Fig.
    5, for comparison, the curve with perfect spectrum sensing ( P d =1) is also plotted.
    Obviously, it can be concluded from Fig. 5 that there is about 4.0 dB loss without
    cooperation ( n=1 and P d = P ds =0.9 ) when SER is 10−3, and the SER performance
    is very close to the results with perfect sensing information when the number
    of collaborative SUs equals 3 ( n=3 and P d =0.99 ). That is to say, there is
    about 4.0 dB gain when two more SUs join for collaborative spectrum sensing. Obviously,
    the complexity of the system increases because of the cooperative partners'' joining.
    Figure 5. SER performance using the half-duplex model in Fig. 4 with P ds =0.9
    . Show All Power Control Scheme of Sus Under the Constraint of Interference Temperature
    In this subsection, under the constraint of the interference temperature, we discuss
    a CR system based on the cooperative cognitive half-duplex model on the bottom
    left of Fig. 3 in which SU t1 , SU t2 , and SU r are source, relay, and destination,
    respectively, and PU t is the PU. Without loss of generality, Q denotes the interference
    temperature level. Hence, the problem becomes how to obtain the optimal performance
    of the SUs'' network under constraint Q . It is well known that power control
    is one simple solutions. In order to obtain the maximal ergodic capacity, the
    approximate optimal power allocation scheme (OPAE) is proposed in the conducted
    simulations, and an AF cooperative communication protocol is selected among SUs.
    Furthermore, cooperative communication is obviously not adopted when the source-to-destination
    channel is better than the relay-to-destination one. Figure 6 illustrates the
    ergodic capacity with the changing of Q and the channel variances of the source-to-PU
    ( σ 2 s,p ) , respectively, where σ 2 s,p =0.1 in the upper part and Q=−1 dB in
    the lower part. Obviously, it can be seen from Fig. 6 that the capacity performance
    of the proposed OPAE scheme outperforms that of the existing EPA, and the capacity
    performance monotonically increases with increasing Q and monotonically decreases
    with increasing σ 2 s,p Figure 6. Ergodic capacity with different Q (top) and
    σ 2 s,p (bottom), respectively. Show All Conclusions In this article, we have
    first studied the MCM techniques in a multihop MCM-CR system. Considering mutual
    interference elimination, synchronization, and transmission efficiency, we conclude
    that FMT is better than OFDM in an MCM-CR system. Second, we propose three cooperative
    diversity cognitive models: the collaborative spectrum sensing model, the cooperative
    communication cognitive model, and the hybrid model. The introduction of cooperative
    diversity expands CR research from time-fre-quency dimensions to space-time-frequency
    dimensions. Therefore, all resources can be fully and effectively utilized to
    improve the performance of an MCM-CR system. Finally, some simulations have been
    conducted to verify that the collaborative spectrum sensing can improve the probability
    of spectrum detection, resulting in enhancement of the performance of the MCM-CR
    system. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work presented in this article was supported in part

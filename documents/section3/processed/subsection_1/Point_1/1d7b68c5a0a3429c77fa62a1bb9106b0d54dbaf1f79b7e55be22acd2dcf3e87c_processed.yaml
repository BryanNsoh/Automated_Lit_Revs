    production of food to accommodate the large global population. Towards this goal,
    new technologies and solutions (Chen et al., 2015, Misra et al., 2015, Goumopoulos
    et al., 2014, Amaral et al., 2014, Ngo et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2014, Misra
    et al., 2014, Qu et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2013, Riquelme et al., 2009, Garcia-Sanchez
    et al., 2011, Camilli et al., 2007) are being applied in this domain to provide
    an optimal alternative to gather and process information (Behzadan et al., 2014,
    Dhurandher et al., 2014) to enhance productivity. Moreover, the alarming climate
    change and scarcity of water (Postel, 1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000,
    Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts, 2010, Mueller et al., 2012) demand new and
    improved methods for modern agricultural fields. Consequently, the need for automation
    and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to accomplish this
    mission (ur Rehman et al., 2014, Suprem et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Hart
    and Martinez, 2006). In this regard, technologies such as ubiquitous computing
    (Burrell et al., 2004), wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks (Diallo et al., 2015,
    Srbinovska et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013, Karim et al., 2013, Zhang et al.,
    2013, Krishna et al., 2012, Zhang and Zhang, 2012, Misra et al., 2011, Mirabella
    and Brischetto, 2011, Lloret et al., 2011, Garcia et al., 2010, Bri et al., 2009,
    Lloret et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2006), Radio Frequency Identifier
    (RFID) (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011), cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Misra
    et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2012), Internet of Things (IoT) (Atzori et al., 2010,
    Gubbi et al., 2013), satellite monitoring (Moghaddam et al., 2010), remote sensing
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013), context-aware
    computing (Moghaddam et al., 2010) are becoming increasingly popular. 1.1. Motivation
    Among all these technologies, the agriculture domain is mostly explored concerning
    the application of WSNs in improving the traditional methods of farming (ur Rehman
    et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz
    et al., 2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004, Yick et al., 2008, Ruiz-Garcia et
    al., 2009). The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has enabled
    the creation of small and cheap sensors. The ubiquitous nature of operation, together
    with self-organized small sized nodes, scalable and cost-effective technology,
    enables the WSNs as a potential tool towards the goal of automation in agriculture.
    In this regard, precision agriculture (Chen et al., 2015, Cambra et al., 2015,
    Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Baseca et al., 2013, Díaz et al., 2011, López et
    al., 2011, Park et al., 2011, Matese et al., 2009), automated irrigation scheduling
    (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Reche et al., 2015, Greenwood et al., 2010, Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010), optimization of plant growth (Hwang et
    al., 2010), farmland monitoring (Corke et al., 2010, Voulodimos et al., 2010),
    greenhouse gases monitoring (Malaver et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2013, Mao et al.,
    2012), agricultural production process management (Díaz et al., 2011, Dong et
    al., 2013), and security in crops (Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2011), are a few potential
    applications. However, WSNs have few limitations (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Yick
    et al., 2008) such as low battery power, limited computation capability and small
    memory of the sensor nodes. These limitations invite challenges in the design
    of WSN applications in agriculture. In agriculture, most of the WSN-based applications
    are targeted for various applications. For example, WSNs for environmental condition
    monitoring with information of soil nutrients is applied for predicting crop health
    and production quality over time. Irrigation scheduling is predicted with WSNs
    by monitoring the soil moisture and weather conditions. Being scalable, the performance
    of an existing WSN-based application can be improved to monitor more parameters
    by only including additional sensor nodes to the existing architecture. The issues
    present in such applications are the determination of optimal deployment strategy,
    measurement interval, energy-efficient medium access, and routing protocols. For
    example, a sparse deployment of nodes with a long data collection interval is
    helpful for enhancing the lifetime of a network. However, challenges may emerge
    from the choice of the deployment region. As an example, if the field area is
    separated by obstructions then it will lead to attenuation of signal, thereby
    affecting the inter-node communication. In the Indian scenario, the WSN-based
    farming solutions need to be of very low cost to be affordable by end users. However,
    with the increasing population, the demand of food-grain is also rising. Recent
    reports warns that the growth in food grain production is less than the growth
    in population (Shanwad et al., 2004). Also, India is one of the largest exporters
    of food grains, and thus, researchers (Shanwad et al., 2004, Mondal and Basu,
    2009) demand to boost production by incorporating advanced technologies. Consequently,
    new and modern technologies are being considered in many agricultural applications
    to achieve the target (Mondal et al., 2004). The current state of development
    in the Indian scenario comprises of technologies such as WSNs, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing, and Geographical
    Information System (GIS). 1.2. Contributions In this paper, we surveyed the variants
    of WSNs and their potential for the advancement of various agricultural application
    development. We highlight the main agricultural and farming applications, and
    discuss the applicability of WSNs towards improved performance and productivity.
    We also classify the network architecture, node architecture, and communication
    technology standards used in agricultural applications. The real-world wireless
    sensor nodes and various sensors such as soil, environment, pH, and plant-health
    are also listed in this paper. In Section 5, we study and review the existing
    WSN deployments both in the global as well as the Indian scenarios. In summary,
    the contributions of this paper are listed as follows. • We study the current
    state-of-the-art in WSNs and their applicability in agricultural and farming applications.
    • The existing WSNs are analyzed with respect to communication and networking
    technologies, standards, and hardware. • We analyze the prospects and problems
    of the existing agricultural applications with detailed case studies for global
    as well as the Indian scenarios. • Finally, we present the futuristic applications
    highlighting the factors for improvements for the existing scenarios. 1.3. Paper
    organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    the basics of WSNs, its requirements, potentials and different possible application
    in the agriculture domain. Design of a wireless sensor network for agricultural
    application is discussed in Section 3. The technologies and standards used in
    agricultural applications are analyzed in Section 4. We further discuss about
    the currently existing state-of-the-art and real-world applications in Section
    5, and analyze the prospects and problems of the existing solutions. In Section
    6, we provide few future direction of work pointing out the factors for improvement.
    Finally, the paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Wireless sensor networks and its
    potential for agricultural applications In this section, we discuss two widely
    used variants of WSNs—Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSN) and Wireless
    Underground Sensor Networks (WUSN), specifically used in agricultural applications.
    2.1. Terrestrial wireless sensor networks WSNs are a network of battery-powered
    sensors inter-connected through wireless medium and are typically deployed to
    serve a specific application purpose (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al.,
    2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the
    ground surface. The advancements in MEMS technology has enabled the creation of
    smart, small sized, although low cost sensors. These powerful sensors empower
    a sensor node or mote to accurately collect the surrounding data. Based on the
    sensed information, these nodes then network among themselves to perform the application
    requirements. For example, consider a precision agriculture environment where
    WSNs are deployed throughout the field to automate the irrigation system. All
    these sensors determine the moisture content of the soil, and further, collaboratively
    decide the time and duration of irrigation scheduling on that field. Then, using
    the same network, the decision is conveyed to the sensor node attached to a water
    pump. Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed one such automated irrigation system using
    a WSN and GPRS module. Fig. 1 depicts a typical wireless sensor network deployed
    on field for agricultural applications. The field consists of sensor nodes powered
    with application specific on-board sensors. The nodes in the on-field sensor network
    communicate among themselves using radio-frequency (RF) links of industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) radio bands (such as 902–928 MHz and 2.4–2.5 GHz). Typically,
    a gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection
    between the sensor network and the outer world. Thus, the gateway node is powered
    with both RF and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or GPRS. A remote
    user can monitor the state of the field, and control the on-field sensors and
    actuator devices. For example, a user can switch on/off a pump/valve when the
    water level applied to the field reaches some predefined threshold value. Users
    carrying mobile phone can also remotely monitor and control the on-field sensors.
    The mobile user is connected via GPRS or even through Short Message Service (SMS).
    Periodic information update from the sensors, and on-demand system control for
    both type of users can also be designed. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    Another variant of the WSNs is its underground counterpart—Wireless Underground
    Sensor Networks (WUSNs) (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Vuran and Akyildiz, 2008).
    In this version, the wireless sensors are planted inside soil. In this setting,
    higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation, and comparatively lower frequencies
    are able to penetrate through the soil (Silva and Vuran, 2010, Yu et al., 2013).
    Thus, communication radius gets limited and the network requires higher number
    of nodes to cover a large area. The application of wired sensors increases the
    network coverage by requiring relatively smaller number of sensors. However, in
    this design, the sensors and the wires may be vulnerable to farming activities.
    A typical agricultural application based on underground sensor networks is shown
    in Fig. 2. Unlike the TWSN-based applications shown in Fig. 1, in this figure,
    the sensor nodes are buried inside soil. One gateway node is also deployed to
    transmit the information collected by the underground sensor nodes to the surface
    sink placed over the ground. Thereafter, the information can be transmitted over
    the Internet to store in remote databases, and can be used for notifying a cell
    phone carrying user. However, due to comparatively shorter communication distance,
    more number of nodes are required to be deployed for use in WUSNs. Download :

    2.3. Differences between TWSNs and WUSNs We highlight the specific differences
    between the TWSNs and WUSNs in Table 1. Table 1. Differences between terrestrial
    and underground WSNs. Feature TWSNs WUSNs Deployment Placed over ground Buried
    under-ground Depth Anywhere over ground Topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (>30 cm)a
    Communication range ≈100 m ≈0.1–10 m Communication frequency Higher (868/915 MHz,
    2.4 GHz) Lower (433 MHz, 8–300 kHz) Antenna size Smaller Larger Energy consumption
    Lower Higher Cost Lower Higher a References Martinez et al., 2004, Vuran and Silva,
    2009 reported a glacier monitoring network where underground communications over
    30 m distance were possible. Further, using higher transmission power, 80 m distance
    under ice were also covered. 2.4. Usefulness of WSNs In the following, we highlight
    the salient features of WSNs that have enabled themselves as a potential tool
    for automation in the agricultural domain. (i) Intelligent decision making capability:
    WSNs are multi-hop in nature (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al., 2002b,
    Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In a large area, this feature enhances the energy-efficiency
    of the overall network, and hence, the network lifetime increases. Using this
    feature, multiple sensor nodes collaborate among themselves, and collectively
    take the final decision (Kulkarni et al., 2011, Bhattacharjee et al., 2012, Wu
    et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2013). (ii) Dynamic topology configuration: To conserve
    the in-node battery power, a sensor node keeps itself in the ‘sleep mode’ most
    of the time. Using topology management techniques (Ren and Meng, 2009, Chu and
    Sethu, 2012, Li et al., 2013), the sensor nodes can collaboratively take these
    decisions. To maximize the network lifetime, the network topology is configured
    such that the minimum number of nodes remain in the active mode. (iii) Fault-tolerance:
    One common challenge in deploying the WSNs is that the sensor nodes are fault-prone
    (Younis et al., 2014). Under such circumstances, unplanned deployment of nodes
    may lead to network partitioning, and in turn, the overall performance of the
    network is affected. However, in countermeasure, the sensor nodes can ‘self-organize’
    by dynamically configuring the network topology (Misra et al., 2011). (iv) Context-awareness:
    Based on the sensed information about the physical and environmental parameters,
    the sensor nodes gain knowledge about the surrounding context. The decisions that
    the sensor nodes take thereafter are context-aware (Vijay et al., 2011). (v) Scalability:
    Generally, the WSN protocols are designed to be implemented in any network irrespective
    of its size and node count. This feature undoubtedly widens the potential of WSNs
    for numerous applications. (vi) Node heterogeneity: WSNs are often assumed to
    be comprised of homogeneous sensor attached devices (Misra et al., 2015, Li and
    Hou, 2005, Ren and Meng, 2009). However, in many realistic scenarios, the devices
    are heterogeneous in respect of processing and computation power, memory, sensing
    capability, transceiver unit, and movement capability. (vii) Tolerance against
    communication failures in harsh environmental conditions: Due to the wide range
    of applications in open agricultural environments, WSNs suffer the effects of
    harsh environmental conditions (Misra et al., 2014). The WSN protocol stack includes
    techniques to withstand the effect of communication failures in the network arising
    due to environmental effects. (viii) Autonomous operating mode: An important feature
    of WSNs is their autonomous operating mode (Misra and Jain, 2011) and adaptiveness
    (Nicopolitidis et al., 2011). In agricultural applications, this feature certainly
    plays an important role, and enables an easy as well as advanced mode of operation.
    (ix) Information security: The WSNs carry raw information about on-field parameters.
    To ensure the security of sensed information, WSNs provides access control mechanisms
    (Misra and Vaish, 2011) and anomaly detection (Karapistoli et al., 2013) to restrict
    unauthenticated users. 2.5. Potential applications We list the possible agricultural
    and farming applications which can be implemented using WSNs. • Irrigation management
    system: Modern day agriculture requires an improved irrigation management system
    to optimize the water usage in farming (Adamala et al., 2014, Greenwood et al.,
    2010). The alarming reduction of ground water level is another motivation for
    the requirement of an advanced system. In this context, micro-irrigation techniques
    are cost-effective and water-usage efficient (Raina et al., 1998, Westarp et al.,
    2004). However, micro-irrigation efficiency can be further improved based on the
    environmental and soil information. In this regard, WSNs are applied as the coordinating
    technology (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Lorite et al., 2013,
    Moghaddam et al., 2010). • Farming systems monitoring: Currently, various improved
    systems and devices are used in farming. In this regard, an improved system to
    manage these devices eases the overall operation, and enable automation in faming
    (Kim et al., 2014). Also, such remote monitoring systems help towards enabling
    improved management in large agricultural fields. Further, with the input of additional
    information such as satellite images and weather forecasts, the system performance
    can be improved. • Pest and disease control: Controlled usage of pesticides and
    fertilizers helps increasing the crop quality as well as minimizing the farming
    cost. However, for controlling the usage of pesticides, we need to monitor the
    probability and occurrence of pests in crops. To predict this, we also need the
    surrounding climate information (Matese et al., 2009, Bhave et al., 2013) such
    as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A WSN can autonomously monitor and predict
    these events over a field of interest (Bhargava et al., 2014). • Controlled use
    of fertilizers: Plant growth and crop quality directly depend on the use of fertilizers.
    However, optimal supply of fertilizers to proper places in fields is a challenging
    task. The use of fertilizers for farming may be controlled by monitoring the variation
    in soil nutritions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), and pH.
    Consequently, soil nutrition balance may also be achieved, and hence, crop production
    quality is also maintained. Gonçalves et al. (2015) studied the effectiveness
    of mobile nodes to improve agricultural productivity in a smart system with Precision
    Sprays. • Cattle movement monitoring: A herd of cattle grazing a field can be
    monitored using WSN technology or Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) (Voulodimos
    et al., 2010, Kwong et al., 2012). Thus, real-time monitoring of any cattle is
    also achieved. This technology can be implemented further to monitor whether any
    cattle is moving near the vegetation fields or not. • Ground water quality monitoring:
    The increased use of fertilizers and pesticides lead to decrease in the quality
    of ground water. Placing sensor nodes empowered with wireless communication help
    in monitoring the water quality (Lin et al., 2008, Zia et al., 2013). • Greenhouse
    gases monitoring: Greenhouse gases and agriculture are closely related to each
    other. Greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing the climate temperature,
    and thus, has direct impact on agriculture. On the other hand, greenhouse gas
    emission comes from various agricultural sources. Malaver et al. (2015) presents
    the development of a system of solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and
    WSN to monitor greenhouse gases – CH4 and CO2. • Asset tracking: Wireless technology
    enabled farming equipments attract the possibility of remote tracking (Misra and
    Singh, 2012) of these assets. A farmer can track the position of the farming vehicles
    and irrigation systems from his home. • Remote control and diagnosis: With the
    advent of internet of things, remote control and diagnosis of farm equipments
    such as pumps, lights, heaters, valves in machinery are also possible (Fukatsu
    et al., 2011, Coates et al., 2013). 3. Design of a wireless sensor network for
    agricultural applications 3.1. Network architecture for agriculture applications
    In this section, we discuss the network architecture considered in various agricultural
    applications. We classify the architectures in various categories and highlight
    the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one. Fig. 3 provides
    a visual depiction of the architectures classified with respect to different parameters.

    Fig. 3. Classification of network architectures with respect to different parameters.
    Based on the movement of the networked devices and nodes, we classify the existing
    architectures in the following categories: • Stationary architecture: In the stationary
    architecture, the sensor nodes are deployed at a fixed position, and during the
    application duration, they do not change their position. Typically, applications
    such as irrigation management system, ground water quality monitoring, and controlling
    the use of fertilizers require stationary architectures. In such applications
    with TWSNs, the data logger (data collector) sensor nodes are typically placed
    over the field. However, in WUSNs, the data collector sensor nodes are placed
    under-ground. Also, as shown in Fig. 2, aggregator nodes may be placed under-ground
    to collect all the data of the underground sensors and communicate with the outside
    TWSNs. • Mobile architecture: Mobile architectures comprise of devices which change
    their position with time. An example of applications based on such architecture
    will be an autonomous network of tractors and cell phone carrying farmers serving
    the purpose of ubiquitous farming operations. • Hybrid architecture: In the hybrid
    architecture, both stationary and mobile nodes are present. For example, this
    type of architecture is applicable to farming applications consisting of stationary
    field sensors, mobile farming equipments, cell phones carrying users, and moving
    cattle. Based on the types of sensor nodes and associated devices, the existing
    architecture used in agriculture are classified as follows: • Homogeneous architecture:
    As the name suggests, homogeneous architecture comprises of sensor equipped devices
    of similar potential. This type of framework is typically used in applications
    based on the unplanned deployments. In such circumstances, the network is deployed
    mainly for in situ monitoring of the desired agricultural parameters. However,
    this type of architecture lacks variety in terms of communication hardware. Consequently,
    the schemes and communication protocols are designed keeping this limitation in
    mind. One example application of this type of architecture is agricultural data
    collection application on the use of pesticides and changing quantity of soil
    nutrients. • Heterogeneous architecture: In this type of architecture, various
    types of sensor nodes, and devices are present. These devices vary in terms of
    computation power, memory, sensing capability, and transceiver units. For example,
    in any irrigation management application, the on-field sensor nodes communicate
    their sensed information to a master or sink node, which again transfer the information
    to remote user. In this case, the sink node is capable of communicating in multiple
    modes—RF and GSM. Another possible application may be the farming systems monitoring
    and agricultural asset tracking. In this application, multiple heterogeneous devices
    are included with on-field sensors. The application model shown in Fig. 1 depicts
    a heterogeneous architecture. In Fig. 1, the field sensor and gateway nodes are
    of different configurations. The architectures are classified into various categories
    based on the hierarchy. • Single-tier architecture: This type of architecture
    is most common among the agricultural applications, specifically small-scale ones.
    In this type of architecture, the on-field devices and sensor nodes directly communicate
    their data to a sink node placed near the application area. This type of architecture
    is also referred to as the single clustered architecture. • Multi-tier architecture:
    In a multi-tier architecture, there are multiple levels in the overall application
    hierarchy. The on-field sensor nodes remain in the lower level of hierarchy, and
    form the basic clusters. Thereafter, the next levels of hierarchy include multiple
    clusters to reach the gateway nodes. Typically, multi-tier architectures consist
    of heterogeneous nodes. Fig. 4 shows a multi-tier architecture with three levels
    of gateways. The basic unit of the network is formed by a cluster comprised of
    sensor nodes and a cluster head, referred to as the 3rd tier gateway in the figure.
    These gateways again form a cluster with the 2nd tier gateways as the cluster
    head, and thus, the hierarchy is followed iteratively until the remote sink is
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (271KB) Download : Download full-size

    of sensor nodes 3.2.1. Embedded multi-chip sensor nodes The components of a typical
    multi-chip sensor node are shown in Fig. 5(a). Typically, a sensor node consists
    of an application-specific sensor array with a transceiver unit for communication.
    A processor or micro-controller unit is used as the “brain” of the node. Optionally,
    a sensor board includes memory units to store data. Depending on the application
    demand, the architecture of the sensor nodes varies to meet the demands. For example,
    the processing power and on-board memory size are increased to meet the requirements
    of more intense or intelligent processing. Download : Download high-res image

    multi-chip vs system-on-chip sensor nodes. In this respect, another important
    technology is System-in-Package (SiP), which is defined as any combination of
    multiple chips including passive components (such as resistors and capacitors)
    mounted together keeping provision to attach external components later. SiP reduces
    the product cost with optimized size and performance. Thus, the SiP technology
    has potential for applications in agricultural scenarios. SiP based agricultural
    systems can be applied in different applications simply by attaching different
    sensors with the main package. In the following, we discuss the associated factors
    in the selection of the components of a sensor node as per the requirement of
    agricultural applications. • Processor: The computation power of the sensor node
    solely depends on the choice of the processing unit. A micro-controller provides
    few advantages such as low cost, flexibility to communicate with other nodes,
    ease of programming, and low power consumption over the traditional processors.
    Mostly, these micro-controllers work on 3.5–5 V. However, power consumption is
    one of the most important factors in sensor nodes. Considering this fact, micro-controllers
    are preferred over general purpose processors. • Transceiver: Transmission and
    reception are the two major reasons of energy consumption in sensor nodes. In
    agricultural applications, the network planner chooses the deployment to ensure
    optimal power consumption of the sensor nodes. • Memory: The sensor nodes have
    two types of on-board memory—memory associated with processor and external memory.
    Depending on the application requirement, sensor nodes need to store historical
    data for intelligent decision making. In this regard, flash memories are used
    for additional storage. • Power: It is also an important factor for selecting
    the sensor nodes, as the battery power of the sensor nodes is limited. In many
    agricultural applications, the nodes possess alternate energy sources such as
    solar power. However, solar power is available during the day time only, and at
    other times, the nodes rely on battery power. Also, frequent change of battery
    increases the cost of maintenance. Thus, we need energy-efficient algorithms such
    that the energy consumption of the sensor nodes are reduced. • Cost: One very
    important selection factor of the sensor nodes is the total hardware cost. A low
    cost application design is always preferred for any application level, and consequently,
    it is the most important issue in terms of applications targeting the low and
    middle income country (LMIC) markets. 3.2.2. System on Chip (SoC) sensor nodes
    The System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, on the other hand, follows more application
    specific design targeting minimization of the power requirements and design cost.
    SoC provides an integration of multiple programmable processor cores, co-processors,
    hardware accelerators, memory units, input/output units, and custom blocks. Fig.
    5(b) shows the components of a typical SoC based sensor node. The envisioned applications
    for SoC is mainly in designing Network on Chips (NoCs) (Koch et al., 2006), systems
    for multimedia and streaming applications (Karim et al., 2003) which are computationally
    intensive. Currently, in agricultural applications, the use of SoCs are very rare.
    However, the advent of SoC has a lot of potential for the agriculture and farming
    domain. Firstly, the use of SoCs based sensor nodes instead of current day embedded
    multi-chip sensor nodes will increase the computation power, and decrease the
    energy-consumption. Also, the size of the nodes will be less and thereby, portability
    of the overall system increases. Compared to multiple silicon dies in SiP, SoC
    is single die based, and thus, SoCs result in lesser size, but, higher cost. Table
    2 briefly lists the differences between the embedded multi-chip nodes and SoCs.

    we discuss the details of the wireless communication technologies, and the standards
    used in various agricultural applications. Also, we study the different wireless
    sensor nodes available in the market for use in these applications. 4.1. Wireless
    communication • ZigBee: (ZigBee Specifications,, Baronti et al., 2007, Guo et
    al., 2012); technology defines the network and application layer protocols based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006)
    physical and MAC layer definitions required for designing a wireless personal
    area network (WPAN) using low power radio-enabled devices. Being energy-efficient,
    low cost, and reliable, the ZigBee technology is preferred for WSN-based applications
    in the agricultural and farming domains. ZigBee also supports short-distance (10–20
    m) data communication over multi-tier, decentralized, ad-hoc and mesh networks.
    The ZigBee-enabled devices have a low-duty cycle, and thus, are suitable for agricultural
    applications such as irrigation management, pesticide and fertilizer control,
    water quality management, where periodic information update is required. However,
    ZigBee applications yield low data rates of only 20–40 kbps and 250 kbps at 868/915
    MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies of ISM band, respectively. Typically, this standard
    requires low specification hardware (such as microprocessor with 50–60 kb memory)
    and includes security encryption techniques. • WiFi: WiFi is a wireless local
    area network (WLAN) standard for information exchange or connecting to the Internet
    wirelessly based on the IEEE 802.11 standards family (IEEE 802.11, 802.11a/b/g/n)
    (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2005, IEEE Standard for Information
    technology, 2012a). Currently, it is the most widely used wireless technology
    found in devices ranging from smart phones and tablets to desktops and laptops.
    WiFi provides a decent communication range in the order of 20 m (indoor) to 100
    m (outdoor) with data transmission rate in the order of 2–54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz frequency
    of ISM band. In agricultural applications, WiFi broadens the use of heterogeneous
    architectures connecting multiple type of devices over an ad-hoc network. • Bluetooth:
    Bluetooth (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2012b, Bluetooth Technology
    Special Interest Group,), which is based on the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, is a low
    power, low cost wireless technology used for communication between portable devices
    and desktops over a short range (8–10 m). The Bluetooth standard defines a personal
    area network (PAN) communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency of the ISM band.
    The data rate achieved in various versions of the Bluetooth ranges from 1 to 24
    Mbps. The advantages of this technology are its ubiquitous nature, and therefore,
    it is suitable for use in multi-tier agricultural applications. The ultra low
    power, low cost version of this standard is named as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    (Xhafa and Ho, 2013, Xhafa and Ho, 2015, Linde and Tucker, 2013), which was initially
    introduced by Nokia in 2006 as Wibree (Nokia, 2006). However, in 2010, BLE was
    merged with main Bluetooth standard version 4.0. BLE also uses the 2.4 GHz ISM
    frequency band with adaptive frequency hopping to reduce interference. Also, BLE
    includes 24 bit CRC and AES 128 bit encryption technique on all packets to guarantee
    robustness and authentication. BLE topology supports one-to-one as well as one-to-many
    connections between devices. • GPRS/3G/4G: GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
    is a packet data service for GSM based cellular phones. A data rate of 50–100
    kbps is achieved in the 2G systems. However, in GPRS, throughput and delay are
    variable, and they depend on the number of other users sharing the same resource.
    Although the biggest advantage that GPRS brings is in relieving the range limitation
    of wireless devices. Any two devices can communicate provided they both are in
    the GSM service area. However, it is better suited for the periodic monitoring
    applications than to the real-time tracking-type applications. The advanced version
    of GPRS is Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), which offers increased
    data rate with no hardware/software changes in the GSM core networks. 3G (Goodman
    and Myers, 2005) and 4G (Parkvall et al., 2008) are the third and fourth generations
    of mobile communication technology. The corresponding data transfer rate achieved
    in these technologies are 200 kbps and 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps in 3G and 4G, respectively.
    • WiMAX: WiMAX is the acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access,
    a wireless communication standard referring to the inter-operable implementations
    of the IEEE 802.16 standards (IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks,
    2011) family. WiMAX is targeted to achieve 0.4–1 Gbps data rate on fixed stations,
    and the maximum transmission range using this technology is 50 km. The Mobile
    WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e standard) provides data rates in the order of 50–100 Mbps.
    Also, WiMAX is stated to be energy-efficient over the pre-4G Long-Term Evaluation
    (LTE) and Evolved High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) (Deruyck et al., 2010, Louta
    et al., 2014). The long range support together with high speed communication features
    place WiMAX as the best suitable technology for agricultural applications involving
    asset monitoring such as farming system monitoring, crop-area border monitoring,
    and real-time diagnostics such as remote controlling of water pumps, lights, gates,
    remote diagnosis of farming systems. In Table 3, we compare the different communication
    technologies with respect to various parameters. We also mention the suitable
    agricultural applications of each technology. Table 3. Comparison of different
    communication technologies. Parameter ZigBee WiFi Bluetooth GPRS/3G/4G WiMAX Standard

    sensor platforms for use in the agricultural domain (ur Rehman et al., 2014).
    In Table 4, we analyze the existing wireless sensor nodes by classifying them
    according to different features and parameters. Table 4. Comparison of the existing

    the various application specific sensors which empower the wireless sensing platforms.
    For better classification, we divide these sensors in three main categories—soil,
    environment, and plant related. 4.3.1. Soil related In Table 5, we compare the
    sensors along with different soil-related measurement parameters—suitable for
    different potential agricultural applications. Table 5. Comparison of different

    sensors specific to the measurement of environmental parameters. Table 6. Comparison

    part of modern farming applications. The potential applications include controlled
    use of fertilizer, crop quality monitoring, pest control, and cattle movement
    monitoring. The plant related agricultural sensors are listed in Table 7. Table

    real-world applications In Section 5.1, we discuss the different categories of
    agricultural applications in detail, and also, bring on the real-world counterpart
    of the same application deployment as a case study. These applications are designed
    with both the TWSNs and the WUSNs. Also, we mention the developments in the Indian
    scenarios in Section 5.2. Although, the number of such developments is very small
    compared to the global scenario. In Section 5.3, we analyze the challenges, problems,
    and prospects of the existing solutions both in the global as well as the Indian
    scenarios. 5.1. Global scenario 5.1.1. Irrigation management The recent years
    have witnessed an upsurge in the deployment of WSNs, specifically in the irrigation
    management applications (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2011, Kim et al.,
    2009, Kim et al., 2008, Moghaddam et al., 2010, Erdem et al., 2010, Kim and Evans,
    2009, Pierce and Elliott, 2008, Vellidis et al., 2008, Nemali and Iersel, 2006).
    This is mainly because of the importance of water in crop production (Postel,
    1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000, Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts,
    2010, Mueller et al., 2012). In the following, we survey two such deployments
    as case studies. Case Study—San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico:
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) described the development and deployment of an automated
    irrigation system comprising of a distributed WSN, a gateway, and remote server.
    The project was dedicated to implement a WSN system capable of reducing water
    use. The WSN consists of soil moisture and temperature sensors buried in ground
    for taking measurement in different depths. The gateway node has on-board facilities
    supporting both ZigBee (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Guo et al., 2012) and GPRS communications. It is also empowered
    with intelligent decision making such as automated irrigation activation based
    on soil moisture and temperature values exceeding a certain predefined threshold
    value. The remote server is used for storing all the information, and displaying
    the information in a graphical user interface (GUI). The advantage of this application
    design is its real-time data analysis feature. The system components are explained
    in the following: • Wireless Sensor Units (WSUs): Each WSU, deployed on-field,
    has four different type of components—application specific sensors, processing
    unit, radio transceiver, and battery power. Table 8 lists the details of each
    of the components (sensors and actuator devices) used in reference (Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014). For energy saving, the micro-controller often remains in the sleep
    mode. A solar panel is attached with each of the WSUs to recharge their batteries.

    • Wireless Information Unit (WIU): The WIU acts as the master node, and collects
    information from the WSUs using the ZigBee technology. All the information received
    about soil moisture and temperature are compared with a predefined threshold values,
    and consequently, the pumps are activated for an estimated period. The received
    information and irrigation related data are saved in the attached solid state
    memory, and are transmitted to the remote server via GPRS using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The pumps are driven by two electronic relays of 40-A,
    12 V DC. The WIU can be commanded to changed the irrigation scheduling from the
    remote server, and is also equipped with a button to perform manual irrigation.
    Four different irrigation actions (IAs) are considered—manual irrigation, predefined
    irrigation, and automated irrigation with soil moisture of at least one sensor
    dropping below threshold, and automated irrigation with soil temperature of at
    least one sensor exceeding past the threshold. • Remote web server: The server
    shows a specific GUI, which visualizes the data from each WSU, total water consumption,
    and IA type. The web application also enables the user with direct programming
    facility of the scheduled irrigation schemes, and changing the threshold values
    based on the crop type and season. Case Study—Smart Sensor Web: The Smart Sensor
    Web (SSW) system proposed by Moghaddam et al. (2010) introduces a new technology
    for smart sensor web system measuring the surface-to-depth soil moisture profile
    of on-field sensors. The University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens in
    Ann Arbor, Michigan was chosen as the deployment region of the on-field sensors.
    The in situ sensors were deployed to model the spatio-temporal variations in soil
    moisture serving the future goal of enabling satellite observation of soil moisture.
    To minimize the overall cost and energy conservation, the authors plan to sparsely
    sample the sensor data. The Sensor Web, is guided by the intelligence of a control
    system envisioned to determine an optimal sensor selection strategy to decide
    sensor configurations over time, and an estimation strategy based on the information
    of 3-dimensional soil moisture values. The problem of finding an optimal strategy
    and estimating a parameter are modelled using Partially Observed Markov Decision
    Process (POMDP) (Lovejoy, 1991). In a real deployment, multiple actuator nodes
    are placed with multiple sensors placed at different depths. One central coordinator
    node is deployed to schedule the data transmission events of the actuators. Upon
    receiving the readings from the in situ actuators, the central coordinator estimates
    the spatial variation of soil moisture. Then, the coordinator decides the time
    schedule of future measurements. In this manner, the coordinator node leverages
    the spatio-temporal correlation of soil moisture, and optimally estimates with
    reduced number of measurements. The system description is presented in the following.
    • Ripple 1 system: The on-field sensor nodes, deployed at fixed locations, are
    equipped with 3–5 soil moisture probes. Communication between the nodes is done
    using the ZigBee technology built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The nodes are
    classified into three categories—coordinator, router, and end devices. The specific
    node level parameters and sensors are listed in Table 9. The sensor nodes are
    powered with on-board batteries, and solar panels are also installed to recharge
    them. The coordinate node is attached to the base station computer. Table 9. Deployment

    The 3G network card is installed on the base station. The server saves all the
    information, and any home/mobile user is able to visualize the information in
    real-time, thereby integrating the whole system from the in situ sensors to the
    remote user. Case Study—Alfalfa Crop Irrigation Cut-off System: Saha et al. (2011)
    presented a automatic irrigation cut-off system targeted for eliminating tail
    water drainage in alfalfa crop. The work is based on Yolo silt loam soil on the
    UC Davis campus, California, USA, where alfalfa is the largest water consuming
    crop. Earlier, the flood-irrigation method was used for this crop. However, the
    water runoff reduces the efficiency of this method. Motivated by this problem,
    Saha et al. designed a wireless sensor based system which provides the irrigation
    information from the tail-end of the field. The realization of the system is done
    by applying a water advance model to the field deployment of wetting-front sensors
    couple with cellular communication. The irrigator farmer receives a SMS notifying
    the time to shutdown the irrigation system. Fig. 6 depicts the application scenario
    showing the deployment. In the deployment area, 4 out of 48 alfalfa checks are
    selected for the experiment. Each check is of dimensions 220 m × 15 m with a slope
    of 0.01%. Wetting-front sensing system was placed at the tail-end of the field.

    field with vast area for irrigation. Case Study—AMI Turf Irrigation System (Aqua
    Management): This turf irrigation controller system designed by Aqua Management,
    Inc. is targeted for the turf irrigation industry to solve the problem of providing
    efficient water management solutions at an affordable price. It is a cloud-based
    control system, which considers various on-field parameters such as Evapotranspiration
    (ET), weather condition, water flow and leak. The application control can be accessed
    from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. The features of this system are cataloged
    in Table 10. The automated decision making framework relies on the following components
    – local weather value, local ET values from public/private systems, and soil moisture
    sensors. Alternatively, the AMI data logger (AMI LoggerTM) can also be used to
    automate irrigation. The AMI Q collects all data from the on-field sensors and
    flow meters, and upload the information to the cloud. Table 10. Features: AMI

    is based on the actual volume of water, rather than time. Based on the weather
    condition, irrigation can be stopped or started. The water management facility
    includes reporting of various analytics such as water budgeting on a daily, weekly,
    monthly, or annual basis. 5.1.2. Vineyard monitoring Applying pervasive and mobile
    computing technologies in vineyard monitoring to increase the quality of production
    and reduce the production cost and the effect of crop related diseases. We review
    one of the existing works (Burrell et al., 2004) as a case study. Case Study—Vineyard
    Production Monitoring (Díaz et al., 2011): Díaz et al. (2011) presented a design
    of a precision agricultural system for vineyard production monitoring. The deployment
    of WSNs help in estimate the variability in agricultural parameters throughout
    the field. Initially, in the first phase, the authors divide the subject terrain
    into few different zones (zone A, B, C) based on geographic, weather, and soil
    maps. In the network planning phase, the most suitable architecture is chosen
    based on the application requirement. The subject area dimension was 600 m × 450
    m, and different sensors were placed in different zones. For example, the authors
    assumed that zone C has temperature, humidity, soil moisture, luminosity, and
    pH level sensors deployed. In zones A and B, the environmental temperature, humidity
    and temperature, and luminosity sensors were deployed, respectively. The sensor
    nodes are assumed to have an transmission range of 75–100 m. The nodes in different
    zones form a virtual tree structure among themselves, and the sensed information
    reaches the gateway following a multi-hop path. The detailed deployment parameters
    are presented in Table 11. Table 11. Deployment parameters: Díaz et al. (2011).

    in the design—sensor, actuator, redundant nodes, and a gateway. The sensors can
    only collect data samples, and information is routed to gateway. The actuator
    nodes have provision for driving irrigation systems. The actuators can also respond
    to the given commands about scheduling irrigation. The redundant nodes, as the
    name suggests, help in information routing, and imitate the functionalities of
    faulty nodes. The gateway acts as the bridge between the in situ network and the
    base station. Information routing is done to select the best neighbor node. The
    routing scheme can also be executed in an energy conserving manner, and in such
    a condition, the diagonally placed nodes are not selected for the next hop. 5.1.3.
    Precision farming Precision farming is targeted to generate greater productivity
    with reduced costs. Wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks are utilized in precision
    farming to gather field data which can then be analyzed to find the best farming
    conditions. Case Study—Video Sensing in Precision Agriculture (Cambra et al.,
    2015): Cambra et al. proposed video sensing for controlling fertilizer use in
    agricultural field. Their work is motivated by the objective of maintaining energy-efficiency
    with reduction of fertilizers in productions as defined Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) 2014/2020.1 In this work, the AR drones are utilized to capture the video
    of the field. Based on the video input, a system identifies and geopositions the
    weeds present in the field. Finally, the fertilizer sprayer system is actuated
    based on the processed localized information of weeds in fields. In Fig. 7, we
    depict the system overview showing the interaction between the AR drones, the
    central system, and the fertilizer sprays. The AR drones maps the field area in
    2D/3D drag and drop waypoint maps. Here, the monitored field area was 17 m by
    15 m. These drones form ad-hoc network among themselves and the central system.
    In this work, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is applied to route
    the information from the field drones to the central system in real-time. Also,
    the drones and other devices are attached with on-board GPS, which enables updating
    the flight map and calculating the distance between the devices. Download : Download

    frames received from the flying drones are processed and geo-referenced in the
    central system. OpenCV2 based platform is used to recognize the weeds in the field.
    In the image processing framework, the authors consider Multilayer Perceptron
    learning algorithm (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008) with the green and brown color
    lines which are seen in maize crops. Finally, the locations of the weeds in the
    field are transmitted to the fertilizer sprayers, which precisely apply fertilizers
    to the weeds. Thus, using this framework, the overall production efficiency enhances
    while keeping the fertilizer use at lower levels. 5.2. Indian scenario 5.2.1.
    Water management Case Study—Project COMMON-Sense Net (Project Common Sense Net
    2.0,, Panchard et al., 2007): The COMMON-Sense Net project was a collaboration
    project with partners EPFL, Zurich (http://www.epfl.ch/) and the Centre for Electronic
    Design and Technology (CEDT) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (http://www.cedt.iisc.ernet.in/).
    The goal of this project was to develop emerging technologies suitable for developing
    countries. The region of interest was chosen at Chennakeshavapura (CKPura) in
    the Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. To focus on the specific problems of the
    chosen region, the targeted goal was to predict and mitigate the effect of adverse
    environmental changes (Panchard, 2008). The actual deployment consists of 9 on-field
    and 3 backward nodes measuring soil moisture at two different depths of 150 cm
    and 30 cm. These nodes transmit their data to the base station every 15 min. The
    base station then transmits the data to the remote server over a GPRS link. In
    addition to soil moisture, environmental data such as ambient temperature and
    relative humidity, were also collected. The design of a water management system
    for deficit irrigation includes the following (Panchard et al., 2006, Prabhakar
    et al., 2007): • Calibration: First, the soil moisture probes are calibrated using
    the standard gravimetric method (Reynolds, 1970, Schmugge et al., 1980, Dobriyal
    et al., 2012, Lekshmi et al., 2014). In the next normal mode, calibration is continued
    using a feedback loop based on the difference in measured and predicted values.
    • Alert: Nodes are programmed to issue an alert whenever soil moisture reaches
    a certain value. The sensed data and historical climate data, together, help in
    predicting the change of rain in future. • Soil moisture prediction: Real-time
    prediction of soil moisture is done using a learning method over the predicted
    and measured data. • Water requirements assessment: The system is also able to
    estimate the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    The design parameters related to the COMMON-Sense Net project are listed in Table

    at IIT Kharagpur, India: Recently, IIT Kharapur started working on development
    of low-cost irrigation management system targeted for India. The lab-scale deployment
    of sensor network was carried out inside IIT Kharagpur campus, a place in the
    Kangsabati basin. In this project, four Ko Pro wireless sensor nodes were deployed
    over an area of 1440 m2. Fig. 8 shows the real deployment in the lab-scale facility.
    Each on-field node embeds four EC-5 soil moisture sensors. In addition to the
    on-field nodes, another gateway node was placed in the vicinity of the field to
    receive all the on-field soil moisture data at an interval of 15 min. The gateway
    node is programmed to run Crossbow’s XServe network management operations, and
    provides web services for remote viewing of data and network health. The gateway
    node also estimates the irrigation requirement of the field, and sends a SMS to
    the farmer informing this. The system has provision to control the number and
    recipient of SMS. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    nodes in IIT Kharagpur lab facility. The different procedural components are described
    below. • Calibration: The soil moisture sensors are first calibrated using the
    standard gravimetric method. • Irrigation requirements assessment: The on-field
    system calculates the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    This estimation also depends on the duration between the last SMS update and current
    time. • Update to farmer: Nodes are programmed to send SMS to the farmers with
    preprogrammed time and recipient phone number. The design parameters are listed

    □ Case Study—Vineyards Precision Farming: One of the widely cultivated crops in
    India is the grapes. Precision farming is applied in this field to reduce the
    production cost and reach a high turnover. Also, the use of precision farming
    is justified by the economic value of grapes. Precision farming in vineyards has
    to deal with three main issues—optimal water use, disease prediction, and controlled
    use of pesticides. In this regard, the soil and environment related parameters
    such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, leaf wetness, relative humidity are
    most important parameters for measurement. Soil moisture is the controlling factor
    for the crop production, size and quality of grapes. The quality of grapes and
    the wine produced from them depend on their size. The area of deployment, i.e.,
    the Sula vineyards, Nashik, India, is limited in terms of water resources. Another
    problem in grapes is the use of pesticides to control diseases such as Downey
    mildew, Powdery mildew, Anthracnose (NRCG, 2007). Consequently, the overall cost
    increases, and the crop quality degrades due to the use of harmful chemicals.
    However, there is another way to reduce the use of pesticides—by predicting the
    disease. For this purpose, it is needed to integrate the measurement of leaf surface
    wetness and duration with the existing system of sensors. Motivated by the above
    issues, Shah et al. (2009) designed a precision agriculture framework in the Sula
    vineyards at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. Initially, the lab-based small-scale
    setup was tested in a greenhouse at IIT Bombay, India with dimensions of 6 m  ×  9
    m. On the other hand, the large-scale deployment at the Sula vineyards consists
    of wireless sensor nodes equipped with soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and leaf wetness sensors. Table 14 lists the various system parameters
    considered in this project. Based on the on-field sensor data, the Evapotranspiration
    (ET) and Infection Index were computed. Table 14. Deployment parameters: Sula

    5.2.3. Crop disease risk evaluation Crop diseases are the root causes of production
    and revenue losses. The prediction of crop disease, and taking countermeasures
    to help farmers ensure sustained revenue generation. □ Case Study—Sula vineyards
    (Das et al., 2009): Das et al. (2009) studied the forecasting of grapevine Downy
    Mildew disease (Francesca et al., 2006, Caffarra et al., 2012), one of the most
    common and important fungal diseases in grapes (Madden and Hughes, 1995, Rossi
    et al., 2010), by deploying a WSN powered with various agro-meteorological sensors.
    The Downy Mildew disease in grapes is caused by the Plasmapora Viticola virus,
    which is a weather-related disease. The prediction of such a disease benefits
    the grapevine industry tremendously—increased revenue with quality enriched food
    and beverage products. The deployed motes are equipped with ambient temperature,
    relative humidity, and leaf wetness duration (LWD) sensors. Two different existing
    models, i.e., the Logistic and Beta models, are adopted in the work (Das et al.,
    2009). The study was performed for over five months at the Sula Vineyards, Nashik,
    Maharashtra, India. Following the collected data, the “Infection Index” was computed
    in real-time using both the Logistic and Beta models. □ Case Study—AgriSense (Tripathy
    et al., 2013a, Tripathy et al., 2013b): The AgriSense distributed system comprises
    of wireless sensor nodes with environmental and soil-specific sensors – ambient
    temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, and soil moisture. The actual test-bed
    was chosen as one semi-arid tropic region located at the Agriculture Research
    Institute (ARI) of the ANGR Agricultural University, Hyderabad. The target mission
    was to predict the Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV) disease of groundnut crop. Experiments
    were executed using different settings of protected and weather-based protection
    plots with different dates of sowing treatments on three different replicas. The
    on-field deployment comprises of five MICAz motes with 25 m communication range,
    transmitting at an interval of 15 min. These nodes communicate among themselves
    using the ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol at the 2.4 GHz RF ISM band. One gateway
    node sends the collected data to a remote server using GPRS communication. The
    remote server converts the raw sensor data to a usable format and saves it in
    its database for displaying through the graphical user interface (GUI). Based
    on the data of soil and environmental parameters, various data mining models such
    as Expectation Maximization (EM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier were
    used to predict the pest/disease dynamics. The schematic view of the real-time
    decision support system (DSS) is illustrated in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res

    real-time decision support system (DSS) used in AgriSense (Tripathy et al., 2013a,

    The existing solutions invent smarter applications for solving multiple challenges
    existing in the agricultural domain. We discuss the prospects of these application
    in the following. However, there remains scope to further improve the solutions.
    We list few points to improve the existing innovations. • Cost-effective solutions
    for LMICs are required: The existing research and development efforts are targeted
    at the reduction of hardware and software costs, while maximizing the system output.
    The overall system cost increases due to the use of foreign imported devices to
    build the systems. However, for applications in LMICs, we need to reduce the system
    cost further. Thus, the challenge exist in bringing down the cost further. • Scalability
    of the deployments need to be tested: For LMICs, we need planned and scaled-up
    deployment of such agricultural systems. In this way, the average system cost
    can be reduced down keeping the performance intact. Also, with increased scalability,
    we need to have design. For a large scale deployment, hierarchical architecture
    would perform better than the flat single-tier network architecture, as discussed
    in Section 3.1. For example, in Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010,
    the on-field WSN deployment in a specific area mostly follows the two-tier hierarchical
    network architecture with WSUs as end devices and WIUs as the gateway. This type
    of network architecture can be scaled up by replicating to multiple fields. In
    this setting, to increase the number of WSUs over a large deployment area, we
    have to place multiple WIU to provide connectivity to all the WSUs. • Fault tolerance:
    Fault tolerance is a necessary feature of wireless sensor networks for achieving
    precision agriculture. Different types of faults (Baljak et al., 2012) that may
    occur in a WSN based precision agriculture system are – node failure due to depleted
    battery or any other reason, sensor hardware faults generating erroneous value,
    faulty sensor calibration, communication failure. In the existing literature,
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) presented an irrigation management system which is fault
    tolerant to nodes (WSUs) and communication failure. In case of any fault, the
    system follows the default irrigation schedule. To reduce the chances of node
    failure due to energy depletion, (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah
    et al., 2009) have used solar powered nodes. Also, the topology management and
    data aggregation schemes should be fault tolerant in a large scale deployment.
    • Energy management and energy harvesting: Energy management is an important issue
    in any WSN-based system. System components and algorithms should be designed keeping
    this issue in mind. Alternatively, the potential energy harvesting solutions such
    as solar power (Everlast Simjee and Chou, 2008), wind power (AmbiMax Park and
    Chou, 2006), biomass, and vibration should also be considered while designing
    WSN based precision agriculture systems. Among the existing works, solar powered
    WSNs (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah et al., 2009) are already
    in use. Therefore, the future works have scope of working on these non-conventional
    resource based WSNs. • Simplification of the existing solutions are needed: The
    end-user of most of the targeted agricultural applications are the farmers. Thus,
    the designed platforms and solutions are envisioned to be simplified in terms
    of usability. In this regard, the human–computer interaction issues such as accessibility
    and usability are required to be taken care of. • The present works may further
    be improved for different climatic conditions, crop and soil types: Most of the
    existing developments does not takes care of the real-time climate parameters.
    However, to enable precision, integration of the environmental parameters are
    necessary. 6. Future work direction There are many potential applications of WSNs
    in the agriculture and farming area. The current state-of-the-art includes most
    works on irrigation management, vineyard production monitoring, and crop disease
    prediction. 6.1. Factors for improvement The factors associated with WSNs that
    need further attention in the future are listed as follows. • Cost: A low cost
    solution is always desirable for increasing the scope and outreach of the applications.
    • Autonomous operation: The future solutions should include the provision for
    autonomous operations surviving for long time. • Intelligence: An inherent intelligence,
    which will enable the futuristic solutions to react dynamically to multiple challenges
    – from conserving energy to real-time response. • Portability: For easy of application,
    portability of the system is essential. Recent advances in embedded systems, such
    as System in package (SiP) and System on Chip (SoC) technologies will help in
    this regard. • Low maintenance: It is essential to design a system which require
    minimum maintenance effort. This will certainly minimize the average cost in the
    long run. • Energy-efficiency: To ensure extended lifetime with autonomous operation,
    the solutions need to be more energy-efficient by incorporating intelligent algorithms.
    • Robust architecture: A robust and fault-tolerant architecture for the emerging
    applications is required to ensure sustained operation. • Ease of operation: Typically,
    the end users of these applications are non-technical persons. Therefore, these
    applications need to be simple and easy to use. • Interoperability: Interoperability
    between different components and different communication technologies will enhance
    the overall functionality of the system. In addition to the global challenges,
    there are specific problems in Indian scenarios with respect to the agricultural
    WSN systems. We list few India specific challenges in the following. • Cost: The
    high cost of the sensors and associated systems is the major deterrent for these
    applications in the LMICs. • Variable climate & soil: The most challenging part
    in designing a WSN-based system for agriculture for India is the different temperature
    and soil types throughout the country. The application parameters are required
    to be tuned such as to function properly at different locations. • Segmented land
    structure: Unlike the USA, India has partitioned farming land, a specific challenge
    which demands suitable deployment architecture for WSN-based agricultural applications
    like irrigation management. • Average farmer requirement: In India, the average
    land holding per farmer is also lower than global scenario. Due to this, smaller
    and personalized systems are in demand. • Overall plan: An overall planning, considering
    the segmented land structure and farmer requirement, is required for attaining
    success in bringing automation in agriculture and farming domain. 6.2. Futuristic
    applications In recent times, with the advent of the new technical concepts such
    as sensor-cloud technology, big-data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), new
    applications are envisioned. We briefly describe such concepts, and enlist a few
    potential futuristic applications in the following. • Sensor-cloud computing:
    sensor-cloud computing refers to the on-field WSN applications empowered with
    cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Alamri et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2014). This
    integrated framework benefits the WSNs with improved processing power and storage
    capacity. Furthermore, sensor-cloud improves the data management and access control
    while increasing the resource utilization. Few potential application for the agricultural
    domain are, – A cloud-enabled storage of spatial variation of soil and environmental
    profile with respect to different seasons is need to be developed. – Crop health
    monitoring and yield prediction using mobile sensor-cloud services. – Designing
    a sensor-cloud controlled smart irrigation system for large fields. – To design
    a sensor-cloud operated environment control system for off-season production of
    vegetables and flowers in greenhouse farming. • Big-data analytics: Big-data analytics
    techniques are applied to find meaningful insight from large volume of data with
    various data types (Kim et al., 2014, Nabrzyski et al., 2014). Big-data analytics
    based techniques are helpful for finding hidden correlations, unknown patterns,
    business trends, customer preferences, detecting crimes and disasters, etc. We
    list few big-data application for the agricultural domain as, – Building crop
    growth and disease management models based on farm data. – Designing a web-enabled
    analytics service for the farmers to provide improved information on agriculture.
    – Easy farming equipment control system for large-scale agriculture field. – Decision
    support service to improve crop productivity with optimal cost considering a large-scale
    contextual agricultural and climatic information. – Optimal policy determination
    based on data analytics for government and industries. • Internet of things: IoT
    extends the ubiquitous computing concepts with heterogeneous smart devices or
    ‘things’ integrated with interoperable communication technologies (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Gubbi et al., 2013, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013, Al-Fuqaha et al.,
    2015). The IoT paradigm defines ‘things’ which are capable of identifying, communicating
    and interacting with their surrounding. Empowered by these pillars, IoT provides
    flexible control mechanism for on-field parameters in real-time. Due to this,
    IoT is a potential solution for various agricultural applications. Few potential
    IoT-based agricultural applications are, – Cost-effective agricultural supply
    chain management using RFID tags. – Remote monitoring of animal movement in open
    pastures. – Automated pest counting and remote reporting in farms. – Remote control
    and scheduling of pesticide sprays at an user-defined rate and time. – Leak detection
    and remote water flow control in large-scale agricultural field water supply.
    7. Conclusion The inclusion of WSNs is envisioned to be useful for advancing the
    agricultural and farming industries by introducing new dimensions. In this survey,
    we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in WSN deployment for
    advanced agricultural applications. First, we introduced the variants of WSNs—the
    terrestrial WSNs and underground WSNs. Then, we highlighted various applications
    of WSNs, and their potential to solve various farming problems. The consecutive
    sections of this paper presented the network and node architectures of WSNs, the
    associated factors, and classification according to different applications. We
    review the various available wireless sensor nodes, and the different communication
    techniques followed by these nodes. Then, using case studies, we discussed the
    existing WSN deployments for different farming applications, globally and in India.
    Finally, we presented the prospects and problems associated with the existing
    applications. Finally, we listed several directions for future research with associated
    factors for improvement. The survey of the existing works directs us in concluding
    few remarks. The current state-of-the-art offers WSN-based solutions for irrigation
    management, crop disease prediction, vineyard precision farming mostly. Simplified,
    low cost, and scalable systems are in demand, specifically for the LMICs. At the
    same time, with the advent of modern technologies, there exist a lot of scope
    for innovating new and efficient systems. Specifically, low cost solution with
    features like autonomous operation, low maintenance is in demand. Overall, futuristic
    pre-planning is required for the success of these applications specifically to
    overcome the problems in global as well as LMICs. Acknowledgement This work is

  analysis: "This paper's objective is to develop an IoT-based control system for\
    \ improved farming and agriculture in rural areas. The paper introduces WiLD (WiFi-based\
    \ Long Distance) networks and fog computing in existing WSN-based solutions for\
    \ covering a longer range with reduced delay. It also proposes a cross-layer-based\
    \ MAC and routing solution that adjusts to traffic nature and sets the duty cycle\
    \ accordingly to improve delay and throughput performances over multihop IoT.\
    \ \n\nThe paper contends that the proposed architecture is a practical and promising\
    \ solution for connecting rural farms using IoT with low cost and better QoS.\
    \ The solution combines multiple networks for scalability and a larger coverage\
    \ range. \n\n- The proposed 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor and actuator network\
    \ is used in the farm domain for sensing and actuating many operations.\n- The\
    \ proposed architecture uses a two-color scheduling 2C-MAC protocol, which reduces\
    \ the overall data frame into two slots by the slot reuse concept.\n- A prediction\
    \ by International Data Corporation found that the amount of data analyzed on\
    \ devices that are physically close to the IoT is approaching 40%. That is, analyzing\
    \ the data close to the sensor areas minimizes latency up to a large value."

    smart farming and agriculture domain. With the use of fog computing and WiFi-based
    long distance network in IoT, it is possible to connect the agriculture and farming
    bases situated in rural areas efficiently. To focus on the specific requirements,
    we propose a scalable network architecture for monitoring and controlling agriculture
    and farms in rural areas. Compared to the existing IoT-based agriculture and farming
    solutions, the proposed solution reduces network latency up to a certain extent.
    In this, a cross-layer-based channel access and routing solution for sensing and
    actuating is proposed. We analyze the network structure based on coverage range,
    throughput, and latency. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume:

    Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Farming and agriculture is the basis of human
    life which gives food, grains, and other raw materials. Technology holds a tremendous
    role in increasing production and decreasing extra manpower. Internet of Things
    (IoT) has opened up a suitable solution for smart farming and agriculture, however,
    it remains a dream till the connectivity is not reached to rural areas. The WiFi-based
    long distance (WiLD) network is successfully been used to connect the rural regions
    with low cost [1]–[3]. With the extended range, for better and efficient IoT in
    such region, fog computing, and cloud computing solutions can be incorporated
    in WiFi devices [4], [5]. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is proven to be an economically
    viable solution for the farming domain [6], [7]. Features like the integration
    of sensors/actuators, digital transmission, low power consumption, scalability,
    and security of WSN enable us to use in different IoT applications. Irrigation,
    farm monitoring, control use of fertilizer, soil monitoring, intruder detection,
    water quality monitoring, etc., operations can be supported using WSN [8]. To
    support efficient routing and auto-configuration in such network, 6LoWPAN is widely
    used [9]. The 6LoWPAN can be integrated into WSN-based IoT to uniquely identify
    a large number of devices [10]. It allows us to achieve interoperable communication
    among different technologies. 6LoWPAN border router (6LBR) is responsible for
    collecting the sensor information and forwarding to an IoT cloud server. At the
    same time, 6LBR also carry the available commands from a remote user or from an
    automation server. The agriculture and farm-related solutions and decisions are
    handled by a cloud-server. The WiLD network has revealed to be an affordable alternative
    to the other low cost and long distance solutions [1], [11]. The WiFi (IEEE 802.11)
    commodity hardware is available at low cost and it supports license-exempt operation
    in the ISM radio bands [12]. Replacing existing cloud, a local solution station
    in these devices is required for such long-range wireless network which saves
    bandwidth and reduces the delay. Fog computing has emerged as a solution to this
    problem. It can reduce the delay to milliseconds to subseconds of time by creating
    a local and collaborative solution system. In this paper, we propose a network
    solution in the domain of IoT connecting the rural region with various agricultural
    and farming applications. In summary, the primary contributions of this paper
    are as follows. We introduce WiLD network and fog computing in the existing WSN-based
    solutions for covering longer range with lesser delay. A cross-layer-based MAC
    and routing solution that adapts traffic nature and sets the duty cycle accordingly
    to improve delay and throughput performances over multihop IoT is proposed. We
    discuss the testbed evaluation processes and analyze the performance of the proposed
    architecture. Remaining of this paper is organized into four sections. The IoT
    and its potential for smart farming and agriculture are discussed in Section II.
    Section III presents the proposed IoT network solution for farms and agriculture
    in rural areas. Section IV gives the performance evaluation process of the proposed
    network. Finally, Section V concludes this paper. SECTION II. IoT and Its Potential
    for Smart Farming and Agriculture IoT monitoring and automation from anywhere
    in the world is replacing human being and hence yielding more benefits in agriculture.
    It is predicted that by the year 2050, the agriculture using IoT will increase
    the food production by 70% and provide foods up to 9.6 billion people, and 2 billion
    sensors will be used in 525 million farms. Due to this prediction, IoT-based agriculture
    and farming is becoming popular with the promise to deliver all-time visibility
    of soil and crop health, used machinery, storage conditions, fertilizer used,
    energy consumption, and animal behavior. IoT can help farmers in numerous ways.
    With the deployed sensors/actuators across farms and machinery, farmers can gain
    as an abundance of insightful data such as temperature, fertilizer used, water
    used, etc. Once an IoT-enabled smart system is in place, farmers can easily monitor
    a variety of environmental parameters and do analytics. Table I shows a list of
    IoT-based agricultural applications. From the table, it is clear that longer latency
    is intolerable for most of the applications. TABLE I Network Requirements of Different
    IoT Applications in Farm and Agriculture Gutiérrez et al. [14] proposed an IoT-based
    irrigation system comprising of a WSN connected by a gateway and a remote server.
    Other than the efficient use of water, this project also deployed soil moisture
    and temperature sensors. Smart sensor Web [16] was proposed to measure soil moisture
    with the deployed sensors and controlled them from a Web-based system. To monitor
    pH, temperature, humidity, etc., Cambra et al. [15] proposed a video sensing-based
    fertilizer controlling in agriculture production. An IoT-based smart security
    and monitoring system is developed in [17]. Security devices are kept in agricultural
    fields like rainstorms and cold stores to control and monitor from a remote location.
    A soil moisture monitoring system is developed in [13], which worked on an energy
    efficient algorithm. Dan et al. [18] monitored climate conditions using a greenhouse
    monitoring system with short-range ZigBee technology. Ojha et al. [8] discussed
    the deployment processes of WSN for agriculture and farming and analyzed the network
    with respect to technologies, standards, and hardware. However, these solutions
    mainly consider short-range technologies deployed in an area where Internet connectivity
    is available nearby. As farms and agriculture primarily available in rural areas,
    connecting the short-range WSN from long distance and solving the farm-related
    issues still challenging. Further, provisioning QoS for such application to fulfill
    different network requirements is very important. SECTION III. Proposed Network
    Architecture for Smart Farming and Agriculture The proposed architecture is a
    practical and promising solution for connecting rural farms using IoT with low
    cost and better QoS. The proposed network ( N ) is a combination of one WiLD network
    ( W ) and a set of 6LoWPAN enabled WSN networks ( w ). Network N , can be represented
    as a graph N ( A/ R i / g i / s i , E ), where A is the gateway, R i is any WiFi
    relay node, g i is any sensor gateway, s i is any sensor node, and E is the set
    of links between two nodes in the network. Fig. 1 shows the proposed IoT architecture.
    The architecture combines multiple networks for scalability and larger coverage
    range. Components of the proposed architecture are described below. Fig. 1. Proposed
    IoT network architecture connecting rural areas. Show All A. 6LoWPAN-Based Wireless
    Sensor/Actuator Network The 6LoWPAN-based wireless sensor and actuator network
    is used in the farm domain for sensing and actuating many operations. 6LoWPAN
    is a low power wireless personal area network with devices of IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    using IPv6. Definition 1 (6LoWPAN-Based Sensor Node):A sensor node is a tiny device
    accessible using IPv6 address having low storage capacity, capable of low computation
    and processing capability, and low power consuming. According to their functionalities,
    a sensor node s i can perform sensing, actuating, or both operations. Multiple
    on-field sensor nodes deployed across the farm areas which are accessible through
    a set of gateway nodes g i s available to their respective coverage range. 6LoWPAN-based
    network is widely used in IoT implementations. The considered network in this
    phase can be defined as follows. Definition 2 (6LoWPAN-Based WSN):A 6LoWPAN enabled
    WSN is a collection of sensor nodes ( s= s 1 , s 2 , s 3 ,…, s n ) which are identifiable
    by a compressed version IPv6 addresses and accessible through a gateway node g
    . A large number of IoT devices need larger address space and auto-configuration
    which is provided by IPv6. Characteristics of a 6LoWPAN network are small packet
    size, low bandwidth, lossy link, and mesh management. It uses the 6LoWPAN protocol
    stack (IPv6 and adaptation layer). The challenge of such combination is to adapt
    the packet sizes between the two layers, i.e., 1280 bytes in IPv6 and 127 bytes
    in LoWPANs. 6LBR fragments the packet in IPv6 layer and reassemble them in 802.15.4
    layer. As shown in Fig. 1, the nodes are enabled with IPv6 addresses for better
    scalability. The deployed sensor nodes communicate using 6LoWPAN-based network,
    monitors the environment to provide precision farming and agriculture management.
    To provide security, identifying, managing, and to collect and deliver data to
    the devices, a gateway is used. The gateway devices run 6LBR for interfacing between
    two different networks. It is coped with two different interfaces supporting IEEE
    802.15.4 network (6LoWPAN) and 802.11 networks (WiLD networks). The gateway device
    has more processing capability than deployed sensor devices. 1) MAC and Routing
    Solution for Internet of Things: Monitoring and taking actions over a large scale
    farm or agricultural area, a huge number of sensor and actuator nodes may need
    to be deployed. The traffic generated by the nodes are mostly periodic in nature
    which is transmitted over multiple hops till the gateway. On the other hand, bursty
    traffic may be generated toward downlink direction for controlling actuators.
    WSN-based MAC protocols [also called low power listening (LPL) protocol] such
    as X-MAC [19], B-MAC [20], ContikiMAC [21], and SpeckMAC [22] do not meet our
    goal to achieve lesser delay and energy consumption, and also the nodes of the
    network need to operate homogeneously. To adapt with heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
    MaxMAC [23] adjusted their duty cycle dynamically. However, switching its mode
    of operation causes more energy consumption. With the use of routing, AADCC [24]
    gathers neighborhood information and modifies the MAC duty cycle. However, there
    may high latency due to the wake-up interval, which can be extended to save energy.
    A traffic adaptive MAC protocol, T-AAD [25] uses senders queue length which reduces
    transmission delay but cannot eliminate/reduce channel contention and does not
    support burst transmission. Enabling burst transmission, a queue length-based
    dynamic duty cycle MAC protocol Q-BT [26] is proposed. Due to the fixed length
    of it, queue length-based approaches are not efficient. Further, these protocols
    cannot adjust duty cycle accurately among nodes that have periodic traffic and
    different child-parent links and nodes in a multihop IoT. Table II compares the
    proposed MAC solution with the related works. TABLE II Comparison of Different
    WSN MAC Protocols Enhancing ContikiMAC, a cross-layer and adaptive duty cycle
    (CLAD) protocol based on routing over low power and lossy networks (RPLs) is proposed
    to solve the above problem. The protocol uses a cross-layer approach and utilizes
    the destination oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) topology to know the number
    of children nodes. As shown in Fig. 2, sink and routing nodes keep the counts
    of their children nodes. For uplink traffic, a node keeps track of its number
    of child nodes and adjusts its duty cycle dynamically. If ( Q ) be the number
    of children nodes of any sensor node s i , then the duty cycle ( D dc ) varies
    as D dc ∝ 1 Q . (1) View Source Fig. 2. DODAG topology constructed by RPL routing
    protocol. Show All Although the uplink traffic is mostly periodic in nature, downlink
    traffics are bursty (as an action happens is informal). In the next step, to handle
    bursty traffic, the proposed protocol calculates the traffic load index as L i
    = r r + f r + c r C (2) View Source where L i is the load index at a particular
    routing node i and C is the link capacity. Also, r r represents the successful
    packet arrival rate, f r shows the successful packet forwarding rate, and c r
    represents the packet collision rate at the particular relay node. The higher
    value of L i means the higher is the congestion in the node. All nodes periodically
    send their load index to the sink node along with the number of child nodes (
    Q ). As the downlink traffics are mostly burst in nature, based on the received
    L i values, sink node uses less congested path for routing decision. The traditional
    RPL routing can create one or more DODAG, the sink node in the proposed protocol
    keeps records of them. The L i received from different intermediate nodes are
    compared with a threshold value L Th =([C/2]+ o r + a r )/C , where a r is the
    required data rate for alert/command and o r is the extra data rate due to packet
    and control overhead. The best downlink path is created comparing L Th and L i
    for all nodes. 2) Performance Analysis of the CLAD Protocol: In the proposed protocol,
    the sensor nodes periodically check in the adjusted D dc for any incoming packet.
    It uses two consecutive CCAs of duration, D cca with a short sleep gap, D s .
    Once the CCA can detects a packet from sender, the expected delay for one-hop
    can be calculated as D td = j. D dc +(2+i) D cca + D s + D data + D ack +2 D pt
    + D b (3) View Source where D data , D ack , D b , and D pt are data transmission
    (Tx) time, ACK Tx time, backoff time, and propagation time, respectively, and
    i∈{0,1,2,…,n} and j∈{0,1} . Delay may change with the changing value of i , j
    , D dc , and D b . The proposed protocol sets dynamic duty cycle according to
    the number of children nodes ( D dc ∝ Q −1 ). D b can be calculated from the probability
    of successful Tx ( p ). According to Bernoullis theorem [27], probability of random
    variable ( X ) can be given by P(X=y)=(1−p ) y−1 p∀y∈R. (4) View Source Average
    backoff window ( W b ) can be calculated from expected value of y as W b =[(2−p)/p]
    , which gives an average backoff time as D b = W b . t s , where t s is the slot
    time. Considering default value of Contiki-3, sending a packet of 100 bytes, D
    td is found to be ( ≈ ) 8.56 ms, assuming i=j=0 , W b =64 , and t s =50μs . Therefore,
    expected delay for h hops will be h× D td . Wasteful and unnecessary activities
    in the considered network may cost a huge energy consumption. A proper and application
    load aware duty cycling scheme can solve the issue. The proposed scheme uses traffic
    load and number of nodes to optimally utilizes the D dc for better delay performance.
    Energy consumption in the proposed protocol is primarily because of Tx, reception
    (Rx), backoff, and idle listening. Assuming packet interarrival time λ , energy
    consumption due to idle time ( E id ), transmission ( E tx ), reception ( E rx
    ), backoff time ( E b ), and ( E sl ) are calculated as E id = E tx = E rx = E
    bo = E sl = P id (λ−k.( D dc +2 D cca )+2 D cca + D data + D ack + D b + D tr
    ) P tx ( D data + D ack ) P rx (2 D pt + D tr ) P rx . D b P sl .( D dc + D s
    ) View Source where P id , P tx , P rx , P sl , and P bo are power required per
    unit time in idle, Tx, Rx, sleep, and backoff modes, respectively. D pt is the
    propagation delay, D tr is the transition delay for switching over from sleep
    to receive mode, and k=⌊(λ/ D dc )⌋ . For any collision, a subsequent re-transmission
    will consume extra E tx and E id energy. The operating voltage of CC2420 is 2.1–3.6
    V and it requires 17.4 mA, 18.8 mA, and 1 μA (max) in transmit, listen, and sleep
    mode, respectively. The value of D dc is not fixed in our case, so considering
    an average value of 200 ms ∈{150,250} , for 2.3 V, λ=500 ms, idle time ( D id
    ) is found to be 91.168 ms and hence E id =3.94 mW. Similarly, E rx ≈0.02 mW,
    E bo =0.138 mW, and E sl =0.00046 mW. Total energy consumption in one-hop transmission
    will be E total =4.1 mW. Further, other parameters like distance, weather and
    cross-layer complexity may consume additional energy. The simulation and testbed
    performance of the proposed protocol are extensively discussed in Section IV.
    3) Architectural Complexity and Communication Overhead in CLAD Protocol: The proposed
    cross-layer MAC protocol shares Q and L i value of routing which helps to decide
    appropriate sleep duration. The cross-layer decision enables the network for a
    distributed construction and reduces control overhead at the MAC layer. In network
    protocol stack of 6LoWPAN-based architecture like Contiki, there is an adaptation
    layer in between MAC and routing layer. The message propagation latency for multilayer
    (layer 1 to n ) can be calculated as D t 1→n = ∑ i=1 n ( D Ti + D Pi ) (5) View
    Source where D Ti is the message travel time between layer i interface and layer
    i+1 interface and D Pi is the processing time. However, direct signaling is used
    to exchange information between MAC and routing layer. For two nonadjacent layers
    l x and l y , direct propagation latency is calculated as [28] D d l x → l y =
    D t 1→n n−1 . (6) View Source This scheme of cross-layer signaling gives n−1 speedup
    factor. 4) Effects of Weather in the Proposed 6LoWPAN-Based Network: Weather-related
    parameters such as humidity, temperature, fog, cloud, and rain affect the signal
    strength in proposed IEEE 802.15.4-based 6LoWPAN. The received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI) is most widely used to estimate signal quality [29]. For a link
    of distance d , received signal power, P(d) is computed according to the following
    equation: P rssi (d)= P 0 −10ηlog( d d 0 )+ G σ (7) View Source where P 0 is the
    RSSI value at a mention distance d 0 , η is the attenuation factor, value of which
    depends upon the environmental factors around the receiver node, and G σ refers
    to Gaussian random variable at zero means and σ 2 variance. The ITU recommended
    a model for fog or cloud attenuation which is valid up to 200 GHz [29]. According
    to which specific attenuation due to fog/cloud is η c =φM (8) View Source where
    φ and M are specific attenuation coefficient and liquid water density, respectively.
    Value of M varies with changing air temperature as [30] M= ρ γ a T (1+ H c ) 1+
    H c γ w γ a (9) View Source where T is the absolute temperature of air, ρ is the
    pressure in humid air, γ a and γ w are the individual gas constants of air and
    water vapor, respectively, and H c is the specific humidity. Luomala and Hakala
    et al. [31] discussed the effect of temperature on different states of humidity.
    Other than attenuation due to rain, the increased size of water droplets may cause
    reflection, refraction, or scattering. A performance comparison of RSSI for cloudy
    and normal weather in hilly terrain areas is discussed in Section IV-B. B. WiLD
    Network Different LPWAN technologies such as LoRaWAN, SigFox, and NB-IoT are designed
    for long-range connection, but due to very low data-rates and processing capabilities,
    these are not suitable for carrying a huge amount of data and running fog computation.
    However, both of them can be supported by the use of the WiLD network with ease.
    The WiLD network is used to connect the rural regions from a remote location situated
    far away from the point of Internet connectivity. A WiLD network in our proposed
    system can be defined as follows. Definition 3 (WiLD Network):A WiLD network can
    be presented as a graph G(R,E) , where R is a set of WiLD nodes including a gateway,
    set of the relay nodes and a set of leaf nodes, and E is the set of long-distance
    point-to-point links. A WiLD network can be modeled as a tree with levels L c
    . For any level l i , position of i th node is R i,l . Similarly, any link between
    three levels l−1 , l , and l+1 for nodes i th, j th, and k th communicating in
    a multihop manner can be written as ( R i,l → R k,l+1 )∈E . The gateway node,
    A is responsible for handling the initialization, synchronization, and scheduling
    of channel access. As shown in Fig. 1, WiLD network consists of multiple P2P links
    forming a mesh scenario. The network connectivity from a gateway node situated
    at district headquarter extended till rural areas for last mile coverage. The
    TDMA-based MAC protocol is proven to be suitable. The proposed architecture uses
    a two-color scheduling 2C-MAC protocol [3], which reduces the overall data frame
    into two slots by slot reuse concept. C. Fog Computing A prediction by International
    Data Corporation found that the amount of data analyzed on devices that are physically
    close to the IoT is approaching 40% [32]. That is, analyzing the data close to
    the sensor areas minimizes latency up to a large value. Definition 4 (Fog):A virtualized
    platform which enables storage, computation, and networking services in between
    the sensor nodes and the existing cloud computing centers. It analyzes agricultural
    data close to the deployed field to reduce latency. It also increases greater
    business agility as developers can quickly develop fog application with less cost
    and deploy wherever needed [12]. All these computations can be carried out locally
    due to the support of a specific node or set of nodes called as fog node. Definition
    5 (Fog Node):A fog node is a part of connected network situated closer to “things”
    of IoT and extends services toward the cloud. The hierarchical fog nodes structure
    helps to provide distributed computing in the network and ensures QoS for the
    delay sensitive applications. In the proposed model, reception of sensory information
    is done using application layer protocol like MQTT or COAP. Further, real-time
    control, analytic with milliseconds response time, and sending only aggregated
    data calculated from periodic traffic generated by sensors are done by a fog node.
    D. Cloud Computing Definition 6 (Cloud):A cloud in IoT provides autonomous and
    on-demand access to a shared list of computing resources kept in the storage server.
    The services that an IoT application demands from a cloud are as follows: Supporting
    a huge number of devices to communicate. Available anytime for computation. Provisioning
    security and privacy to data. Available storage. Helps in analytic report generation.
    Low cost. E. Performance Model of the Proposed Framework The proposed framework
    is a union of multiple networks having multihop communication in each of the modules.
    Hence, a key concern of the proposed dense network topology is the end-to-end
    delay. The primary alternatives of delays are as follows: Transmission and processing
    delay, Δ , and if there are multiple hops, this delay will be multiplied, Propagation
    delay, which is dependent on the Euclidian distance [33] between two ends and
    speed of wireless signals. Let us consider the sensor network component for delay
    calculation. If d be the distance covered by a wireless signal travel per unit
    time and E i,j be the Euclidian distance between any pair of nodes i and j , then
    the discrete propagation delay in a one-hop link ( i , j ) will be [ E i,j /d]
    . So, delay over multihop is the sum of one-hop delay. If first hop delay is D
    1 and total delay is D total then for WSN D 1 = D w = [ E i,j d +Δ] ∑ hop=i j−1
    [ E i,j d +Δ]. (10) (11) View Source Similarly, for the WiLD network, from node
    j to gateway k , multihop delay ( D W ) can be given by D W = ∑ hop=j k−1 [ E
    j,k d +Δ]. (12) View Source Then the total delay would be D total = D w + D W
    . (13) View Source As the WSN gateway and WiFi nodes are fog nodes, the decision
    can be processed and action can be taken from these nodes. Any decision taken
    in j node (i.e., first fog node), total delay ( T 1 ) for complete sensing and
    actuation operation would be T 1 =2 D w + D p (14) View Source where D p is the
    decision processing delay in a fog node, which depends on the availability of
    sensor data and processing capabilities of the system. Again, for the first WiLD
    node, i.e., second fog node, j+1 T 2 =2( D w + D 2 )+ D p . (15) View Source Similarly,
    for remaining fog nodes j+2,j+3,… , and k , the total action time can be calculated
    and finally the time required, if the gateway node is used as fog is calculated
    as T k−1 =2( D w + D k−1 + D k−2 +⋯+ D j )+ D p (16) View Source where D k−1 +
    D k−2 +⋯+ D j = D W . From (15) and (16), it is clear that T 1 < T 2 <⋯< T k−1
    . Based on the critical nature of different agricultural applications and to share
    the processing of data, priority of choosing a fog node ranges from j to k . Similarly,
    fog computing in the system can save bandwidth of the network up to a huge amount.
    For sending a packet P in the WiLD network having capacity C , required bandwidth
    is B req =(P/δ) , where δ is the transmission time and B req ≤C . However, a fog
    node holding the responsibility to process the packet does not further forward
    the data to next hop saving bandwidth B req for the remaining of the network.
    SECTION IV. Performance Analysis We have analyzed the performance of the proposed
    system in simulation as well as testbed environment. A. Simulation Analysis The
    performance of proposed framework is analyzed in two phases. Individual performance
    of the proposed WSN and WiLD network. Performance of the overall framework using
    results achieved in the first phase. In Cooja simulator of Contiki, we used CC2420-based
    Skymote device for the simulation of 6LoWPAN. A network topology with 50 nodes
    are created, where the position of nodes from the sink is kept static to ensure
    multiple hops. A detailed tabular description of the test setup is given in Table
    III. TABLE III Different Parameters for WSN Simulation As shown in Fig. 3(a),
    with increasing number of nodes throughput, reduces. This is due to the high contention
    in the channel coped with the high frequency of channel check which results in
    a significant number of packet drops. While X-MAC relies on ACK for strobes before
    actual transmission of data packets, ContikiMAC directly sends the data packets.
    The strobes further generate unnecessary traffic in the network and thus the overall
    throughput of X-MAC goes down well below Contiki-MAC. The proposed MAC protocol
    achieved higher packet received ratio (PRR) than ContikiMAC and XMAC with increasing
    number of nodes. In CLAD, a node increases its duty cycle based on the child nodes,
    hence in multihop scenarios, chances of successful Tx/Rx in higher than the other
    relevant protocols. Our scheme maintains a traffic load-based solution which provides
    priority to the downlink traffic and hence PRR is higher. The proposed scheme
    chooses a less congested path for the downlink flows. To validate the congestion
    control mechanism in the proposed scheme, we have measured downlink PRR and end-to-end
    delay for the proposed and traditional routing decision. As shown in Fig. 4(a),
    PRR after saturation point shows worst as traditional RPL routing does not consider
    current load for event-driven downlink traffic. Fig. 3. Average (a) PRR over increasing
    number of hops, (b) end-to-end delay over increasing number of hops, and (c) energy
    consumption of multihop network. Show All Fig. 4. Average (a) PRR (%) with varying
    loads and (b) end-to-end delay with varying loads. Show All Similarly, we have
    calculated multihop end-to-end delay applying different RDC protocols. The average
    delay is calculated for traffic sending from end nodes to the sink node for XMAC,
    ContikiMAC, and CLAD. From Fig. 3(b), it is clear that the proposed protocol achieves
    superior performance than the others. As the intermediate nodes try to become
    available according to the hierarchy, waiting delay in the queue is reduced. Furthermore,
    downlink traffics are prioritized in the proposed protocol to reduce delay and
    hence shows the best performance among the compared schemes. Contiki’s energy
    module [34] is used to calculate the energy consumption of a node per second.
    We can observe from Fig. 3(c) that the LPL duration strongly affects power consumption
    in comparison with the fixed duty cycle-based MAC protocol. Changing the LPL value
    from 150 to 250 ms, energy consumption reduces by 40% in XMAC and ContikiMAC protocol.
    However, allowing dynamic LPL configurations based on traffic load and the number
    of nodes, the proposed scheme achieves better performance over the relevant protocols.
    In CLAD, with increasing hops, energy consumption increases due to the decreasing
    D dc . For one-hop with 200 ms, the simulation result shows 4.11 mW of energy
    consumption, which is almost the same with the theoretical result. Once the packet
    from WSN is received by the local gateway, the gateway forwards it to the WiLD
    network. To ensure QoS requirements over such long distance networks, fog computing
    is used. To simulate the proposed computation mechanism, we have used iFogSim
    simulator [35]. Detail simulation parameters are mentioned in Table IV. The simulation
    is carried out over tree-based WiLD network topology as shown in Fig. 5. To cover
    a larger area and to test the fog performance over a various size of the network,
    WiLD nodes (fog nodes) are increased from 1 to 19 in between the cloud and the
    sensor device. WiLD nodes are positioned in a hierarchical manner and the end
    nodes are responsible for connecting the sensor/actuator nodes. Based on the number
    of fog nodes across physical topology configurations scenarios 1–5 of nodes 1,
    5, 10, 15, and 19, respectively, are considered. Two placement strategies, viz.,
    cloud and fog are created. In the cloud-centric scenario, all the operators (for
    example, diseases detection, solutions, environment issues detection, etc.) are
    placed in the cloud. Whereas in fog scenario, these operations are pushed toward
    the fog devices. In this application scenario, the delay is calculated over the
    control loop Sensing→reading→problem detection→taking action , i.e., the cloud
    or fog module will first read the sensed data, then find current problems and
    action will be taken to the appropriate actuator. TABLE IV Simulation Parameters
    of the Fog Framework Fig. 5. Simulation topology for fog performance, where A
    and S are sensor and actuator, respectively. Long distance gateway fog (LDGF),
    long distance relay fog (LDRF), and local sensor gateway fog (LSGF) are the fog
    nodes. Show All As shown in Fig. 6, when there is no computation in the WiFi nodes,
    cloud placement do the operation creating a huge delay in the control loop. With
    the increasing number of WiFi nodes, latency also increases. The primary reasons
    for the delay are the multihop transmission, last-mile solution, periodicity of
    sensor data, computation complexity, etc. However, with fog placement, the delay
    has been reduced up to a huge margin. Rather than shifting all the operations
    to the cloud, fog nodes take the responsibility locally. For analytic purposes,
    fog nodes only send the aggregated data using some existing data aggregation algorithms
    on duplication. In cloud placement strategy, due to a large number of connected
    devices, load also increases significantly in contrast with fog placement. We
    can attribute to a fact in the fog-based computation that most of the critical
    and sensitive communication taken using low latency links. Therefore, modules
    like problem detection and decision are carried on the fog nodes which further
    reduces the data volume earlier sent to a cloud. Fig. 6. Average control loop
    latency for different physical topologies. Show All B. Testbed Evaluation Different
    components of the testbed setup are discussed as follows. 1) 6LoWPAN-Based WSN
    Setup: The 6LoWPAN-based WSN is interfaced with the WiLD network for long distance
    connectivity. A RaspberryPi device configured with 1-GB RAM, 1.2-GHz ARM processor,
    and CC2531 for 802.15.4 interface is used for the local gateway nodes. Similarly,
    software like Contiki-OS, Paho for MQTT broker, COAP client, Mysql, etc., are
    used. Detailed specification of CC2650 is shown in Table V. CC2650 provides longer
    battery life using a coin cell with ultralow power microcontroller. It further
    saves energy with built-in low powered microelectromechanical sensors. Along with
    the six built-in weather-related sensors, additionally, two GPIOs are programmed
    out from JTAG interfaces for adding a soil moisture sensor and a relay switch
    to add an actuator. Fig. 9 shows the programmed low powered smart mote named as
    SmartAgriMote for the proposed agriculture and farming application. TABLE V 6LoWPAN
    Node (CC2650) Specifications Fig. 7. Leaf/end node (right), where (1) is an omnidirectional
    antenna, which is closer (< 100 m) to 6LoWPAN gateway nodes, and (2) is a directional
    antenna connected to WiLD relay node for bridging connectivity, a relay node (middle),
    where (1) and (2) are two directional antennas for Tx/Rx operation and establishing
    multihop communication, a root node (left), where (1) is an omnidirectional antenna
    for local area connectivity, (2) and (3) are two directional antenna to enable
    communication between two sub-WiLD networks for extending connectivity, and (4)
    is the RouterBoard. Show All Fig. 8. Google map view of deployed testbed setup.
    Show All Fig. 9. Programmed smart mote for the proposed agriculture and farming
    application. Show All The proposed WSN-based MAC protocol is implemented over
    cc26xx-Web-demo module to see the PRR and Round-trip delay using upper layer protocols
    MQTT and COAP. To generate uplink traffic, sensor nodes are set to send a packet
    at every 5 s. Similarly, with the same duration, a command button from a Web interface
    was used to measure downlink traffic. We have used five motes along with the gateway
    for the performance test. As shown in Table VI, with increasing number of hops,
    delay increases, and PRR decreases. From RTT, end-to-end delay for one-hop would
    be (34/2 =)17 ms, which almost vary close to the simulation result. The same case
    can be applied for multihop scenarios too. In hilly terrain areas, cloud and fog
    are common for most of the time. We have analyzed the weather effect on RSSI for
    different distances. Unavailability of an external antenna in CC2650, it can cover
    maximum up to 40 m in a single hop scenario. However, as shown in Table VII, RSSI
    measured in cloudy weather condition is lesser than normal condition. Also, we
    have measured the downlink PRR for the proposed congestion aware solution and
    shows improvement over traditional routing. TABLE VI Performance Results of the
    Proposed 6LoWPAN-Based Sensor Network TABLE VII RSSI in Cloudy and Normal Weather
    Conditions 2) WiLD Network Setup: A shown in Fig. 7, three types of nodes are
    used for complete WiLD network setup. We have used two types of router boards:
    a) Mikrotik RB433AH and b) Mikrotik RB411 for the WiFi nodes. These boards are
    configured with 128-MB RAM and 680 MHz of nominal clock speed. The configuration
    of a P2P connection using these two boards is shown in Fig. 10. Google map view
    of the testbed is shown in Fig. 8. The main purposes of two relay nodes in the
    setup are: a) creating a multihop scenario covering longer distance and b) achieving
    a proper line of sight in hilly terrain. We have implemented the 2C-MAC protocol
    over Atheros-based Ath9k driver package of OpenWrt. Iperf and Ping are used to
    check the throughput and delay performance of the network. In 2C-MAC protocol,
    same slots are used by every two hops nodes, and hence throughput performance
    does not get reduced significantly over multiple hops (which can be seen in Table
    VIII). TABLE VIII Performance of the Proposed WiLD Network Fig. 10. Setting up
    WiLD links using high gain directional antennas. Show All After individual performance
    evaluations of both network components, we have analyzed the control system in
    two scenarios: Doing cloud computation at the Internet. Doing fog and cloud computation
    at WSN gateway and Internet. In the first approach, computations and report generation
    are done at the cloud. Whereas, in the second approach, except the report generation,
    other computations are carried out at the local gateway. The sensor network gateway
    only sends deflected data to the cloud to reduce bandwidth in the network. Calculating
    RTT at edge node (i.e., local gateway) we found the average value as 357 ms, whereas,
    at hosted cloud, it is 5032 ms. Fig. 11 shows a deployed on-field sensor node.
    A Web-based interface for visualizing the system is shown in Fig. 12. Based on
    the current requirements of agriculture fields, automation is also carried out.
    For example, based on the soil moisture values received, automatically water supply
    switches its mode to on. Fig. 11. Deployed on-field sensor node (SmartAgriMote).

    Show All SECTION V. Conclusion This paper has presented an IoT-based control system
    for advancement in agriculture and farming of rural areas. Different components
    and enhancements of the control system are discussed and analyzed in all aspects
    including testbed evaluation. The MAC and routing solution for IoT have achieved
    better energy, delay, and throughput performance. Combining the proposed solution
    with the WiLD network, it is possible to reduce delay and improve throughput for
    end mile connectivity. The proposed fog computing solution takes action with lesser
    delay and saves bandwidth in the network. The economy of a developing country
    mainly depends on agriculture and farms in rural areas and applying traditional
    approaches is not sufficient. Use of modern technologies like IoT with low cost
    and scalable solutions are very important. The proposed solution is also suitable
    for other applications like smart healthcare and smart grid in rural regions.
    To reduce congestion in the proposed large-scale network, along with the routing
    and fog computing solution, technologies like IEEE 802.11n/ac/ah having more physical
    data-rate capacity can be used. Moreover, dynamic bandwidth allocation-based configuration
    at existing relay WiLD node can further be installed. The chance of attacks like
    tampering and manipulation of data is high if we do not secure the long distance
    covering wireless network. Similarly, the privacy of individual devices is very
    important to autonomously communicate over different entities such as fog, cloud,
    and Internet. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

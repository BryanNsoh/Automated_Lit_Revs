    Massive and ubiquitous deployment of devices in networks of fifth generation (5G)
    and beyond wireless has necessitated the development of ultra-low-power wireless
    communication paradigms. Recently, wireless-powered networks with backscatter

    large-scale self-sustainable wireless networks with the capabilities of RF energy
    harvesting (EH) and of extreme low power consumption. Therefore, we provide a

    Pervasive application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and massive machine type communications
    to connect a large number of small computing devices (associated with people,
    vehicles, environment and other factors) embedded in the environment and implanted
    in bodies, have attracted tremendous attention in the 5G mobile communication
    networks. In order to keep a massive number of energy-constrained IoT sensors
    alive for tasks such as continuous monitoring and controlling, uninterrupted supply
    of energy is essential for the sensors and controlling/computing devices. This
    issue poses key design challenges for IoT, i.e., batteries increase the devices’
    form factors and their recharging and replacement cause high cost. Moreover, it
    is sometimes hazardous or even impossible to recharge/replace the batteries, since
    a large number of sensors may be hidden or deployed in a perilous environment
    [1]–[4]. To resolve these issues and also due to the size and the design constraints
    of sensors and devices, equipping nodes with distinct power sources is one promising
    solution. Thus, radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) methods have been
    proposed as a cost-effective solution to mitigate the energy issue in energy-constrained
    wireless networks by exploiting alternative forms of energy resources [5]. However,
    the power consumption of RF-powered active communication is relatively high and
    is challenging specially for large-scale IoT deployments. Tackling these major
    challenges has initiated increasing research interests on the design of large-scale
    self-sustainable wireless networks with the capabilities of EH and of extreme
    low power consumption. Recently, significant interest in backscatter communications
    systems (BCSs) for low-power wireless communications has emerged. BCSs are simply
    based on passive reflection and modulation of incident signals from external RF
    sources by adapting the level of antenna mismatch to vary the reflection coefficient
    and harvest energy from the signal for operating the circuit [2], [6]. A backscatter
    node has no active energy hungry RF components such as oscillators and analog-to-digital
    converters (ADCs) and hence it can be miniaturized with extremely low power consumption;
    a backscatter node consumes power orders-of-magnitude less than a conventional
    radio (in the order of 10μW ) [7]. Therefore, the integration of EH methods and
    low-power backscattering communication enables passive IoT deployment at a flexible
    location or even an in-body implantation [8]. A. Energy Harvesting To extend the
    lifetime of network devices, EH has attracted an upsurge of research interests
    due to its numerous new opportunities and promising features for energy-constrained
    wireless networks (e.g., wireless sensor networks (WSN) and IoT); no wire, no
    contacts, no batteries, genuine mobility and predictable, dedicated and reliable
    energy supply [9], [10]. As shown in Fig. 1, EH can be categorized into three
    different types: Wireless power transfer (WPT) In this scheme, a dedicated power
    transmitter transmits energy to the users and it does not transmit information
    simultaneously. Thus, the emphasis of the system design is to exclusively deliver
    energy over the wireless channel Fig. 1(a). Some practical applications of such
    designs include home electronics, medical implants and electric vehicles [11].
    Wireless-powered communication networks (WPCNs) In this scheme, energy is transferred
    in the downlink and information is transferred in the uplink – Fig. 1(b). A protocol
    to enable this process is named harvest-then-transmit (HTT) [12]; the low-power
    users harvest energy in the downlink from the power transmitter, and actively
    transmit data in the uplink using their harvested energy. With the help of this
    protocol, wireless devices can be developed for applications such as IoT and WSNs
    [13], [14]. Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) In this
    scheme, energy and information are transferred simultaneously via a common signal
    in the downlink to user devices [15], [16]–Fig. 1(c). The power transmitter transmits
    a modulated waveform, from which a target user device harvests energy and demodulates
    information bits. The energy receivers and the information receivers can be co-located
    or separated. In SWIPT with co-located receivers, each low-power user device receives
    information and energy, simultaneously. FIGURE 1. Paradigms for EH systems [7].
    Show All The integration of wireless power and information transfers, as a powerful
    means for powering energy-constrained wireless devices, spawn new challenges and
    opportunities. Extensive research efforts have thus been expended on various aspects
    of EH-enabled communication systems from both technical and theoretical perspectives
    including fundamental limits, design challenges, transmission techniques, network
    architecture, hardware impairments, scheduling and medium access control (MAC)
    [9], [16]–[18]. Despite its rapid advancement from both theoretical and technical
    perspectives and also its numerous and undeniable advantages, EH technology still
    faces many realization hurdles in large-scale low-cost and low-power networks,
    e.g., WSNs and IoT. For instance, with the HTT protocol, by wireless energy transfer
    in the downlink and wireless information transmission in the uplink, we find the
    doubly near-far problem; i.e., the user located near the hybrid access point (H-AP)
    can gain more energy than the far users, hence the far users suffer from less
    amount of harvested energy and uplink throughput degradation than near users due
    to doubly distance-dependent signal attenuation [19]. The problem of the double
    near-far phenomenon has been attacked in [12], [20], [21]. For instance, [12]
    proposes a common throughput maximization scheme, which allocates equal rates
    to all users regardless of their distances from the H-AP by allocating the transmission
    time to users inversely proportional to their distances to the H-AP. However,
    this scheme severely degrades the overall network performance in terms of fairness.
    Besides, the methods given in [20], [21], which study user cooperation to alleviate
    the doubly-near far problem, are not applicable for large-scale wireless networks
    due to their undue complexity. The doubly-near far problem also limits the far
    users when they want to send urgent data, as those users may require a long time
    to harvest enough energy to transmit data [22]. SWIPT enabled device-to-device
    (D2D) communication and its scheduling also need to be further addressed [17],
    [18]. Moreover, active RF transmission architecture contains power-hungry RF chain
    having oscillators, mixers, ADC, which results in non-compacts form factors and
    high power consumption. This issue is challenging specially for large-scale wireless
    networks, e.g., massive IoT devices. BCSs, low complexity and low-power devices
    without active RF component, is a promising solution to sustain massive IoT devices
    and to tackle the above challenges [7], [19]. Since BCSs operate in passive mode
    by reflecting the carrier signal rather than active transmission, it can resolve
    the doubly near-far problem in HTT by enabling a long-range communication with
    low power consumption. Moreover, since it depends on instantaneous excitation
    energy, it does not require a dedicated time for EH, thereby, making urgent transmission
    possible even for far users from the H-AP [8]. Therefore, backscatter communication
    is a key facilitator for low-rate, low-power and large-scale wireless communication
    systems with EH. B. Backscatter Communications In this system, a sending device
    - a backscatter transmitter - modulates and reflects received RF signals in order
    to transmit data instead of generating RF signals by itself [24]–[26]. The backscatter
    transmitter, also called a tag, maps a sequence of digital symbols on to the RF
    backscattered waveform. In particular, initiating their own RF transmissions as
    conventional wireless systems, a tag is a passive node that harvests energy from
    an incident RF signal to support its operation and send data to a backscatter
    receiver, i.e., reader, just by adjusting its antenna impedance to reflect the
    received RF signals. This process is known as load modulation [8], [23], [27],
    [28]. A diagram of a tag with binary load modulation is given in Fig. 2. The tag
    has two loads with the impedance intentionally matching and mismatching with the
    antenna impedance, respectively. The tag transmits its binary symbols to the reader
    through choosing whether to backscatter the RF incident signal or not by adjusting
    the load impedance of its antenna, where symbol “0” and “1” correspond to a non-backscattering
    (absorbing state) and a backscattering (reflecting state), respectively [29].
    The reader, with its own power supply and a full set of conventional RF components,
    will then decode tag’s transmit symbols. In the reflecting state, the reader will
    observe a superposition of the original RF incident signal and the tag backscattered
    signal. Whereas, in the absorbing state, the reader will only observe the original
    RF signal. These states are then interpreted as information bits. The diagram
    of a binary amplitude demodulation based on envelope detection at the receiver
    is given in Fig. 2. FIGURE 2. Paradigms for backscatter communications [23]. Show
    All In general, BCSs can be classified into monostatic backscatter communications
    systems (MBCSs), Bistatic backscatter Communication systems (BBCSs), and Ambient
    backscatter Communication systems (ABCSs) – Fig. 2. Among these, ABCSs have recently
    drawn much interest due to their ease of implementation. Monostatic Backscatter
    communications systems: An MBCS consists of a backscatter transmitter and a reader
    – Fig. 2 (a) [23], [30]. The reader has co-located an RF source and a backscatter
    receiver. The RF source generates RF signals to activate the tag. The backscatter
    transmitter (tag) modulates and reflects these RF signals to transmit its data
    to the backscatter receiver. As the RF source and the backscatter receiver are
    co-located (reader), the backscattered signals incur a round-trip path loss [31].
    Thus, MBCSs suffer from doubly near-far problem. That is, due to the signal loss
    from the RF source to the backscatter transmitter, and vice versa, if a backscatter
    transmitter is located far from the reader, it can experience a higher energy
    outage probability and a lower modulated backscatter signal strength [19]. However,
    MBCSs are mainly adopted for short-range applications, e.g., radio frequency identification
    (RFID) [32], [33], which is the prominent commercial application of backscatter
    radio. In a typical RFID system, an RFID reader interrogates the RFID tag for
    the desired information such as an identification number. Generally, RFID tags
    can be passive, active of semipassive. Of these, passive tags have received more
    emphasis due to their battery-less structure. They rely on the RF signal transmitted
    by the RFID reader and backscattering for EH and information transmission, respectively
    [32], [33]. This traditional setup however may not be suitable for massive IoT
    devices, since typical nodes are power-constrained and may fail to wirelessly
    power other nodes for communication over long distances [2]. Bistatic Backscatter
    Communications Systems: In a BBCS, proposed in [31], the RF source, i.e., the
    carrier emitter, and the backscatter receiver are separated - Fig. 2 (b). The
    carrier emitter generates the carrier signal which is detached from the reader
    to overcome the limited range of power-up link of a MBCS (e.g., RFID tag). This
    configuration can also avoid the round-trip path loss experienced in MBCSs. Additionally,
    the performance of the BBCS can be improved dramatically by placing carrier emitters
    at optimal locations. Specifically, one centralized backscatter receiver can be
    located in the field while multiple carrier emitters are well placed around backscatter
    transmitters. Consequently, the overall field coverage can be expanded. Moreover,
    the doubly near-far problem can be mitigated as backscatter transmitters can derive
    unmodulated RF signals sent from nearby carrier emitters to harvest energy and
    backscatter data [19]. Although bulky and deployment costly, carrier emitters
    and backscatter receivers of BBCSs can be cheaper than that of MBCSs due to the
    simple design of the components [23]. Ambient Backscatter Communications Systems:
    ABCS is an idea based on BBCSs philosophy which was developed to communicate with
    wireless devices nearby without using any energy supply or storage device [34],
    [35]. In an ABCS, the tag utilizes modulated ambient RF signals, e.g., signals
    from TV towers, cellular base stations (BSs), and Wi-Fi APs instead of using unmodulated
    dedicated RF signals (e.g., BBCSs) - Fig. 2 (c). Ambient RF sources can be classified
    into static and dynamic types [36], [37]. Static ambient RF sources constantly
    transmit high-power signals, e.g., TV towers and FM radio BSs, whereas, dynamic
    ambient RF sources such as Wi-Fi APs operate periodically or randomly with typically
    low transmit powers. The use of existing RF sources confers ABCSs with some advantages
    [35]. First, it eliminates the need to deploy and maintain dedicated RF sources,
    which inevitably reduces the cost and energy consumption. Second, it also means
    that ABCSs do not need new frequency spectrum allocation, and thus the spectrum
    resource utilization improves. However, the use of modulated ambient RF signals
    has some disadvantages. First, they are unpredictable and dynamic, and act as
    direct interference to backscatter receivers, which limits the performance of
    an ABCS, unlike unmodulated ones of the BBCS, which can easily be eliminated before
    backscattered signal detection. Second, since the parameters of ambient RF sources
    (e.g., transmission power and locations) are not controllable, the design and
    deployment of an ABCS to achieve optimal performance can be challenging. In particular,
    although static RF sources may provide predictable RF energy, long-term and short-term
    fluctuations due to service scheduling are possible [36]. On the other hand, dynamic
    ambient RF sources operate periodically and their power may change over time.
    Moreover, since an ABCS can not function when RF sources are far off, searching
    for available opportunities in a certain frequency range is required to utilize
    ambient RF sources [23]. Therefore, this setup is not scalable due to its dependence
    on other networks as energy resources and thus may fail to meet the requirements
    of massive IoT devices. ABCSs are mainly categorized into three types based on
    their configurations. The first category is the traditional ABCSs (TABCSs) with
    detached backscatter receiver and ambient transmitter (and its legacy receiver)
    [8], [29], [38]–[45]. Strong direct interference from the ambient transmitter
    received at the backscatter receiver is the most challenging issue in this setup.
    This direct-link interference can be avoided with the help of frequency shift
    methods to isolate the spectrum of the backscattered signal from the spectrum
    of the direct-link signal [38]. However, the frequency shift operation imposes
    higher requirements on device hardware. Maximum-likelihood (ML) based detection
    methods are also employed to detect the tag’s information and the direct-link
    interference is treated as a part of noise [29], [46]. These methods, however,
    works well when the backscattered signal strength is comparable to that of direct-link
    interference. Some studies also assume that the legacy system employs orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and mitigates the direct-link interference
    by exploiting some structural properties of the modulation format [39]. In [41],
    the noncoherent ML detection problem is formulated and solved for a general Q-ary
    backscatter signal over ambient OFDM modulation, where the direct-link interference
    is treated as an unwanted signal and modeled as a random process that is correlated
    to the useful backscatter signal. Furthermore, a multi-antenna receiver can mitigate
    the direct link-interference by employing receive beamforming and also by constellation
    learning based methods [40], [43]. The second category of ABCSs is the cooperative
    ABCSs (CABCSs) where the backscatter receiver and the legacy receiver are co-located
    [60]–[65]. In this setup, despite TABCSs, the signals from the ambient transmitter
    are recovered and decoded at the backscatter receiver. In [60], the achievable
    rate region of such setup is analyzed and it is shown that the rate region is
    strictly larger than that of the conventional time-division-multiple access (TDMA)
    scheme, i.e., in each time slot, either the information from the ambient transmitter
    or the tag is received. Moreover, the optimal ML detector, sub-optimal linear
    detectors and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) based detectors are
    derived in [61]. In [62], the sum rate of the backscatter communication and the
    legacy communication is investigated with perfect and imperfect channel knowledge,
    where a linear minimum mean square error receiver with SIC is utilized for joint
    decoding. In this configuration, the nodes are equipped with multiple antennas.
    In [63], the sum rate is analyzed for SIC based decoding, and a problem is formulated
    to maximize the sum rate by optimizing the beamforming vector at the multi-antenna
    ambient transmitter. In addition, in [64], upper bounds of the ergodic rates for
    both links, i.e., backscatter communication and the legacy communication, are
    derived considering a multi-antenna cooperative receiver which separately decodes
    the signals from a multi-antenna ambient transmitter and a single-antenna tag.
    Recently, [65] has investigated resource allocation for the CABCSs with a finite
    block-length backscatter link. The average achievable rate of the direct and backscatter
    links are derived and transmit power minimization and the energy efficiency maximization
    problems are formulated and solved to design the transmit beamforming vector.
    The third category of ABCS is full-duplex ABCSs (FABCSs) where the backscatter
    receiver and the ambient transmitter are co-located; therefore, the signals from
    the ambient transmitter can be cancelled out [3], [44], [66]–[68]. In [44], the
    capacity performances of both the backscatter communication and the legacy communication
    over OFDM carriers are investigated and the asymptotic capacity bounds are derived
    in closed-form for the case of sufficiently large number of subcarriers. Moreover,
    in [3], a FABCS is designed where a Wi-Fi AP can receive the backscattered signal
    while simultaneously transmitting Wi-Fi packets to its legacy client. A general
    FABCS is considered in [66], where unlike [3], [44], multiple tags backscatter
    information to the full-duplex AP. Specifically, the full-duplex AP transmits
    downlink signal which consists of not only information to the legacy user but
    also energy to multiple tags; while all the tags simultaneously backscatter information
    to the full-duplex AP using the TDMA protocol. Moreover, in [67], the throughput
    maximization of a full-duplex-enabled cognitive backscatter network is investigated
    via joint time scheduling, transmit power allocation, and reflection coefficient
    adjustment, such that the minimum rate requirements of the primary system is guaranteed.
    In this configuration, an ABCS underlays a primary cellular system, and the primary
    AP can transmit primary signals and receive backscatter signals simultaneously
    via full-duplex communications. The authors in [68] further focused on MAC-layer
    in addition to physical-layer and investigated cross-layer outage capacity for
    FABCSs where multiple full-duplex mobile users attempt to send packets to the
    AP according to the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    protocol while receiving the information from their respective associated backscatter
    devices. C. Contribution and Organization EH and backscatter communications enable
    self-sustainable, large-scale, low-power and low-cost wireless networks, e.g.,
    WSN and IoT. Although, each technology has its own pros and cons, neither of them
    can separately meet all the requirements of large-scale communication systems.
    The integration of these two technologies effectively inherits the advantages
    of both techniques and can actually be the solution to build up totally passive
    massive WSNs [69]. They complement each other to overcome the challenges of each
    technology, thereby leading to considerable improvements in the performance of
    large-scale dense IoT deployments, i.e., increased range and throughput, low-power
    design, scalability, reuse of ambient signals, low-cost, low-complexity and easy-to
    implement communications, as the key requirements of massive IoT devices. Wireless-powered
    networks with backscatter communications (WPN-BCs) have attracted tremendous attention
    from both academia and industry as the key facilitator for IoT deployment, an
    important part of the new generation of information technology. Significant research
    efforts have been expended on the field of WPN-BCs, with the discovery of practical
    advantages and solutions to many problems and research potentials. Along the way,
    there have been several outstanding surveys and tutorials that review wireless-powered
    networks and backscatter communications separately with very limited discussions
    on their integration [7], [13], [14]. To the best of our knowledge, no contributions
    have been reported in the direction of providing a comprehensive review of the
    integral aspects of wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications.
    Our survey thus aims to fill this gap and add to the current literature. Motivated
    by this aspect, unlike the existing surveys on backscatter communications, we
    will also thoroughly address the deployment issues, waveform and energy harvester
    design, distributed MAC protocols, artificial intelligence based approaches and
    security issues in the domain of WPN-BCs, as the key features aimed at fostering
    5G and beyond networks. Table 1 shows some of the literature reviews on the related
    domains of EH and backscatter communications. TABLE 1 Some of the Literature Reviews
    on the Related Domains of EH and Backscatter Communications This paper mainly
    focuses on the integral aspects of wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications
    with the emphasis on large-scale analysis. A comprehensive overview of the research
    and technological development on the architecture, protocols and applications
    of WPN-BCs is provided (Fig. 3). FIGURE 3. Outline of the main contributions of
    this survey. Show All Some of the contributions of this paper are as follows:
    The focus is not only given to wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications
    individually, but also emphasizes their integrated usages and applications. Basic
    principles and advanced design and communication techniques related to WPN-BCs
    are discussed with the emphasis on large-scale networks. Open issues, challenges,
    and future research directions for WPN-BCs are mentioned. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. We first discuss the fundamentals of WPN-BCs, including
    both backscatter communications and wireless-powered networks in Section II. It
    discusses signal processing aspects including modulation, signal detection schemes
    and channel coding. Network design issues, i.e., deployment of WPN-BCs and waveform
    and energy harvester design are also outlined. In Section III, a summary of the
    research works aiming to address the challenges of such networks and improve their
    performance is provided. Efficient communication techniques including performance
    optimization, scheduling and resource allocation along with multiple-antenna systems,
    multi-access, artificial intelligence techniques and security issues are explained
    and discussed. Emerging wireless-powered backscatter systems are reviewed in Section
    IV. Some applications of WPN-BCs are shown in Section V. Section VI addresses
    the open issues and future research directions of WPN-BCs. Finally, we conclude
    the paper in Section VII. The abbreviations used in this article are summarized
    in Table 2. TABLE 2 List of Abbreviations SECTION II. Principles of Wireless-Powered
    Backscatter Systems WPN-BCs inherit the fundamental and operational mechanisms
    of wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications. Comprehensive literature
    reviews on the fundamentals of these two emerging technologies can be found in
    [7]–[9], [13], [16], [36], [58]. In this section, we thus mainly focus on modulation
    and channel coding techniques, as the two important aspects of wireless communication
    systems, applicable to WPN-BCs. In addition, network design issues, i.e., deployment
    of WPN-BCs and waveform and energy harvester design are discussed in detail. The
    key features of designing large-scale WPN-BCs are also emphasized. A. Modulation
    and Demodulation For efficient data transmission in BCSs, different modulation
    techniques including amplitude modulation, i.e., amplitude shift keying (ASK)
    [31], [70], [71], differential modulation [72], quadrature amplitude modulation
    (QAM) [73]–[76], and frequency modulation, i.e., frequency shift keying (FSK)
    [31], [71], [77], Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) [79], minimum-shift keying
    (MSK) [78], have been used. Phase modulation, i.e., phase shift keying (PSK),
    has also been adopted in BCSs [3], [73], [80]. A good summary of these modulation
    schemes and their applications is provided in [7], [58]. Table 3 briefly summaries
    the advantages and disadvantages of popular modulation schemes in backscatter
    communications systems. In general, ASK provides continuous power to backscatter
    transmitters and the receiver design is simple [81]. However, it is sensitive
    to noise and interference [82]. On-off keying (OOK) is the simplest type of amplitude
    modulation based on ASK, which is used to increase the range in backscatter communications
    [31], [71]. Coherent demodulation of requires channel estimation, but it will
    add complexity to the receiver and also results in overheads in terms of pilot/
    training sequence transmissions. Thus, resources such as bandwidth and power can
    be consumed excessively in the process of demodulation. To mitigate these issues,
    differential modulation techniques conveys the information in the difference between
    two consecutive symbols. This assumes a quasi-static channel, which remains constant
    over two symbol periods. Thus, differential modulation is used to address the
    signal detection problem in ABCSs [72]. TABLE 3 Summary of Modulation Schemes
    In order to increase the spectral efficiency of data transmission, QAM can be
    used, which combines two amplitude-modulated signals to double the effective bandwidth
    [71], [73], [74]. It maintains data throughput equal to ASK or PSK by using a
    frequency equal to the symbol rate. However, QAM is susceptible to the noise which
    results in normalized power loss [3]. FSK is resilient to the noise and signal
    strength variation but the spectrum of this modulation type doubles that of the
    ASK modulation [7]. FSK modulation is mainly used for BBCSs to extend the communication
    range and coverage [31], [77]. Moreover, GFSK uses the Gaussian-shaped frequency
    shifting technique to convey information. It is used for modulation, in a monostatic
    full-duplex Bluetooth low energy compatible BCSs, for mobile devices [79]. MSK,
    i.e., a special case of FSK, is also used to minimize the interference at the
    backscatter receiver [78]. For PSK, higher data rate can be achieved, but its
    demodulation process is more complicated than that of the other schemes. PSK is
    mainly adopted in ABCSs [80]. Binary modulation formats result in low data rate
    due to their low spectral efficiency, e.g., up to 640 kbps for FM0 and Miller
    coding [23]. Higher-order modulation techniques have thus been used to increase
    the data rate, thereby leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended
    read range, i.e., M-array QAM, e.g., 16-QAM [75], 32-QAM [76], as well as N-PSK,
    e.g., 16-PSK [3]. Another open possibility is to use adaptive modulation [83].
    In conventional backscatter communication, the tag needs to harvest enough energy
    from the reader to activate and modulate data. The reader in turn must receive
    a strong backscattered signal to be able to recover data. Therefore, in order
    to obtain a fully passive system with the modulator, a combination of backscatter
    modulation with wireless power transfer is proposed for RFID-enabled sensors [69],
    [84]–[86]. In this scheme, a backscatter modulator and a dual band rectifier are
    designed such that two different frequencies are used for different purposes,
    one is used to continuously power the wireless sensor and the other to transfer
    data through suitable modulation techniques, e.g., ASK and QAM [84]–[86]. In [86],
    a 16-QAM backscatter modulator with wireless power transfer capabilities is developed
    with of a power consumption of 59μW and a data rate of 960 Mbps. Signal detection
    is the process of recovering the transmit data by using the received signal. This
    task must be done by the reader and is challenging for two reasons: (1) channel
    estimation is difficult due to the simple fact that ABCS networks exploit existing
    signals (e.g., LTE and WiFi), which are unknown to the reader. Such signals cannot
    be used as pilot or training sequences. Thus, the reader lacks the training symbols
    to estimate the channel parameters; (2) the difficulty of separating the backscattered
    signal from existing modulated signals (e.g., LTE and WiFi). Thus, in order to
    detect the modulated signals sent by the tag, different detection techniques have
    been proposed. Among these, non-coherent detection is commonly adopted due to
    its simplicity because it can be used without the knowledge of channel state information.
    It is suitable for ASK and FSK [28], [44], [87], [88]. A diagram of binary amplitude
    demodulation based on envelope detection is shown in Fig. 2 [34]. The envelope
    generator extracts the envelope of the instantaneous signal by smoothing the incoming
    waves at the antenna. The threshold calculator, then takes the mean of the long-term
    averaged envelope and generates a threshold. The threshold and the smoothed instantaneous
    envelope of the received modulated backscatter are then compared to decide the
    value of the information bits. However, this energy detector generally works well
    at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but produces high detection errors at the
    low SNR regime. A detection algorithm based on statistical covariances is suggested
    in [89] for ABCSs, which outperforms the energy detector at low SNR regions. Although
    it is simple, non-coherent detection offers low bit rates only and is not suitable
    for PSK modulation. Therefore, more complicated detection techniques, i.e., coherent
    detection, which requires channel state information (CSI), have been used [77].
    Some general information regarding CSI acquisition can be found in [90]. A coherent
    and a partly coherent detector is proposed in [91] for ABCSs, where the backscatter
    device uses a frequency-shifted form of OOK, i.e., pseudo-FSK, to remodulate the
    FM signals, and the RF transmitter and the backscatter device transmit pilot sequences
    to estimate CSI. Such requirements and the difficulty of channel estimation may
    limit the use case scenarios that may allow coherent reception in practice [59].
    The channel estimation problem for an ABCS has been investigated in [92], which
    develops an expectation maximization estimator for the modulus values of the ambient
    backscatter channel parameters. This paper obtains the estimates for absolute
    values of: (a) channel coefficient for the RF source to tag link, and (b) the
    composite channel coefficient involving the sum of direct and backscattered (which
    is the scaled product of forward and backward coefficients) channels. ML based
    detection methods can also be employed to detect modulated signals at the backscatter
    receiver [29], [46], [80], [93]. Specifically, [46] focuses on the problem of
    signal detection and bit-error-rate performance analysis at the reader. Minimum-bit-error-rate
    detector, the optimal detection threshold, expressions and both upper and lower
    closed-form bit-error-rate bounds are derived. Non-coherent signal detection for
    ABCSs, including optimal/suboptimal detectors, bit-error-rate computation, outage
    analysis, threshold derivation, blind parameter acquisition are further investigated
    in [29]. Moreover, [93] studies semi-coherent detection for a typical ABCS. Semi-coherent
    alludes to the fact that a few training symbols are sent to acquire only the parameters
    necessary for signal detection rather than full channel states themselves. Detection
    algorithms can also be designed to take advantage of spatial diversity available
    in multiple-antenna ABCSs to overcome channel fading and to increase the communication
    range. For instance, a ratio detector and antenna selection for ABCSs with multiple
    receive antennas have been developed [94]. Moreover, [95] considers ABCSs with
    multiple-antenna tags and focuses on the signal detection problem. A maximum-eigenvalue
    based detector is also developed in [96] with multiple-antenna reader. The problem
    of blind detection of ambient backscatter signals from a multi-antenna tag has
    been addressed via the generalized likelihood ratio test [97]. Finally, [98] develops
    three detectors for ABCSs with multiple-antenna tags which require neither CSI
    nor the RF signal power and the noise variance at the reader. An antenna selection
    scheme is also proposed. B. Channel Coding and Decoding The purpose of coding
    is to support the recovery of data across noisy channels. It ensures the reliability
    of data transmissions by protecting the message from interference, collision,
    and intentional modification of certain signal characteristics. At the backscatter
    receiver, the encoded baseband signals are decoded to recover the original message
    and detect any transmission errors. Thus, line coding techniques can be adopted
    such as non-return-to-zero (NRZ), Manchester, Miller, and bi-phase space (FM0)
    [99], [101]. Of these, NRZ and Manchester have been widely adopted in RFID [81].
    However, the NRZ code is poor in handling long runs of “0” or “1” and the Manchester
    code effectively doubles the bandwidth usage. Thus, Miller and FM0 channel coding
    techniques (with the maximum rate of one half) are usually adopted in existing
    backscatter communication systems due to their advantages such as enhanced signal
    reliability, reduced noise, and simplicity [34], [100], [112]. But energy consumption
    differs widely between transmitting/receiving bit “0” and bit “1” under FM0 and
    Miller codes, i.e., the transmitting bit “0” consumes much greater energy than
    that for bit “0” [102]. To alleviate this energy consumption disparity, the energy-efficient
    data delivery scheme (EEDDS) is proposed in [102] that reduces energy consumption
    by using a codebook shared by the sender and the receiver. Specifically, the sender
    breaks original bit stream into multiple m -bit data blocks, finds the corresponding
    codewords of the blocks, and then transmits the codewords from which the receiver
    recovers the original data. This scheme however suffers from large codebook size
    and long delays, which poses implementation challenges. Reference [103] thus developed
    an energy-efficient and easy-implementation coding scheme used for WPN-BCs. An
    energy consumption minimization problem is formulated to derive the codebook,
    where only the blocks with the number of energy-consuming bits being equal to
    or greater than an encoding threshold, are encoded, thereby leading to a smaller
    codebook size. The proposed code based backscatter communication (CBBC) is energy-efficient
    and can be effectively applied in the nodes with restricted memory. As more advanced
    BCSs are being developed, the low rate channel coding techniques, i.e., FM0 and
    Miller, may not meet the emerging requirements such as high data rates, long communication
    range, and robustness. Thus, [104] introduces an orthogonal space-time block code
    (OSTBC) to improve the data rate and reliability of RFID systems. The key idea
    of the OSTBC is to transmit data through multiple orthogonal antennas, which is
    referred to as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless. Through this channel
    coding scheme, several symbols are transmitted simultaneously which are spread
    into block codes over space and time. It was shown that, OSTBC achieves the maximum
    diversity order equal to the number of RFID tag antennas, with linear decoding
    complexity. Reference [105] further investigated the joint design of reader and
    tag signals as well as modified OSTBC for MIMO backscatter RFID systems and showed
    that, the diversity order can be much greater than the number of RFID tag antennas.
    Moreover, [106] highlights that the FM0 coding used in ISO 18000-6C standard for
    RFID tags is simple, but may not achieve maximum throughput. Thus an improved-rate
    6/8 channel block codes for ABCSs have been suggested to address the need for
    high data rates in limited bandwidth scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate
    that the balanced block code increases the throughput by 50% compared to the conventional
    channel coding techniques, e.g., FM0. Short length cyclic error-correcting codes
    are also employed in BBCSs to improve transmission rates [77]. This scheme can
    effectively improve throughput when the carrier emitter is far from the reader.
    Short block length channel codes, with very low encoding complexity, are also
    considered for BBCSs [107]. On the other hand, [108] introduces a low-power encoding
    technique, to increase the communication range and ensure concurrent transmissions
    for ABCSs. Without requiring synchronization operations at the receiver, this
    code reduces the energy consumption as well as the complexity of the backscatter
    receiver. Rather than a pseudorandom sequence, this code uses a periodic signal
    to represent the information. Since the backscatter transmitter supports only
    two states, i.e., absorbing and reflecting states, a periodic alternating sequence
    of bits “0” and “1” is adopted. This code enables long communication ranges, (40
    times than that of conventional backscatter), and also supports multiple concurrent
    transmissions. Recently, [109] has proposed a 2×2 space-time code for backscatter
    communications which achieves almost the same performance as the Alamouti code
    in backscatter channels with considerably lower complexity. This code however
    performs worse than the Alamouti code in conventional MIMO wireless channels.
    This issue necessitate further investigation of the existing simple codes, which
    do not perform well in the conventional channels, but do well in the backscatter
    channel. Moreover, [110] has investigated polar codes for reliable long-range
    backscatter communications by leveraging the concept of channel polarization.
    This concept is realized by dividing the physical channel into multiple subchannels,
    each of which could be either extremely reliable or very unreliable. This paper
    gives a new polar code that automatically adopts itself to different channel quality.
    This polar code does not require accurate channel estimates and it reduces storage
    overhead of the coding matrix and energy consumption by orders of magnitudes,
    thereby making it feasible on battery-less backscatter tags. In particular, the
    backscatter tags initially encode information bits with a high code rate, and
    then add redundant bits in an extra transmission according to the decoding requirement
    of the receiver. Thus, this scheme achieves up to 10× throughput gain, or extends
    the range limit by 1.8× compared with PLoRa [111], which is the state-of-the-art
    long-range backscatter with tag-receiver distances up to 1.1 km. Table 4 shows
    the summary of coding schemes for backscatter communications systems. TABLE 4
    Summary of Coding Schemes C. Deployments of WPN-BCs In massive machine-type communication
    and IoT networks, due to the dynamic changes of the network topology, flexibility
    of analysis is of great importance in the evaluation of such networks, which enables
    the pervasive and ubiquitous deployment of sensors. It is necessary to have scalable
    and efficient wireless power transfer and communication connectivity. In addition,
    the spatial distribution of wireless nodes plays a critical role in the overall
    energy consumption and spectral efficiency. Thus, stochastic geometry, which is
    the study of random spatial patterns, has been recognized as a powerful tool to
    capture and model dynamic spatial positions of nodes [113]. Thus, the use of tools
    from stochastic geometry makes the performance evaluation of random large-scale
    networks feasible [114]–[116]. The foundations of stochastic geometry are based
    upon several spatial point processes, with the Poisson point process (PPP) being
    the most notable one due to its tractability [117]–[119]. There are also cluster
    process models, e.g., Poisson cluster process (PCP), where daughter points form
    random clusters centered at points from a parent point process [120]. PPP abstracts
    each randomly located point according to a uniform distribution in the Euclidean
    space. However, because of the assumption of independence, the spatial points
    in a PPP may be arbitrarily close to each other. Performance values based on the
    PPP only serve as lower bounds to the coverage probability and mean rate of real-world
    deployment [121]. Consequently, more sophisticated and general geometric approaches,
    e.g., Ginibre point process (GPP) and its variants, have been proposed to model
    the correlation among spatial points. Recent research works have adopted GPPs,
    e.g., the α -GPP and β -GPP, to model the distribution of cellular stations [122]–[125].
    The family of α -GPPs and β -GPPs also includes the PPP as a limiting case, i.e.,
    when α⟶0 and β⟶0 , respectively. These point processes can model random spatial
    distributions arising from geographical and other factors. These more sophisticated
    theoretical models can provide an accurate approximation for the network performance
    in real-world applications [115], [116]. Due to these reasons, stochastic geometry
    has been widely employed to investigate the performance of wireless-powered networks
    [47], [120], [124], [126]–[129]. In particular, in [126], the deployment of power
    beacons (PBs) is investigated for powering a cellular network by microwave power
    transfer based on a stochastic geometry network model. In [127], using a stochastic
    geometry model, the spatial throughput of a mobile ad hoc network powered by EH
    is analyzed. In [128], a stochastic geometry model is used for a large-scale wireless
    powered communication network to analyze the wireless nodes’ performance tradeoff
    between EH and information transmission. Moreover, in [120], a PB deployment strategy
    is proposed where the spatial distribution of PBs follows a truncated PCP. Furthermore,
    [124] investigates the point-to-point uplink transmission of a wireless sensor
    in a network, where ambient RF sources are distributed as a α -GPP. The performance
    of random EH D2D networks is also analyzed [130], [131]. The above techniques
    mainly focus on pure wireless-powered networks and may not be directly adapted
    to wireless-powered backscatter communications. The reason is that backscatter
    communication introduces other practical factors, e.g., circuit power consumption,
    backscatter duty cycle (the fraction of time used for transmission), reflection
    coefficient (the fraction of backscattered incident energy), which may impose
    new challenges on network performance analysis. Recently, some works have adopted
    stochastic geometry tools to design and analyze WPN-BCs [2], [114], [132]–[134].
    For instance, in [2], a large-scale WPN-BC is modeled using the PCP and the coverage
    and network capacities are analyzed with respect to the duty cycle, reflection
    coefficient and density of the PBs. In this setup, each PB serves only a single
    node. Reference [132] extends the network model of [2] to a more generic case
    where energy from multiple nearby PBs is considered and the effects of the densities
    of PBs and backscatter nodes on the coverage and network capacities are investigated.
    In [133], for a single-cell WPN-BC with a massive number of randomly deployed
    sensors, the combined implementation of three collision resolution techniques,
    i.e., directional antennas, ultra-narrow band transmissions and SIC, is investigated
    to boost the performance. Moreover, [125] analyzes the performance of hybrid D2D
    communications based on α -GPP. More importantly, [114] studies the performance
    of a decentralized large-scale WPN-BC ad hac network with sporadic short packets.
    Exploiting time-space PPP model, this work captures the behavior of the network
    with decentralized and asynchronous transmissions. In [134], a traffic-aware backscatter
    communication for wireless-powered heterogeneous networks is investigated. A large-scale
    secondary network whose distribution follows α -GPP is investigated where multiple
    secondary transmitters (STs) employ ambient backscatter communications in the
    presence of a primary network, comprising of Wi-Fi APs or cellular BSs and mobile
    users with the same distribution. ST nodes communicate with a dedicated secondary
    receiver (reader) with the TDMA protocol by utilizing the traffic sources of the
    primary network. D. Waveform and Energy Harvester Design Wireless power transfer
    may help to energize massive numbers of power-limited devices in large-scale wireless
    networks. To reach this goal, a critical component is the energy harvester circuit.
    Thus, increasing the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of energy harvesters has been
    heavily researched [135]–[142]. The basic structure of an energy harvester is
    rather simple. It integrates an antenna and a rectifier and harvests energy from
    an RF signal and then rectifies and filters it by using a diode and a low pass
    filter. The recovered DC power then either directly powers a low power device,
    or is stored in a super capacitor for higher power low duty-cycle operation [143]–[145].
    The RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of the energy harvester is a function of both
    its design and its input waveform [137]. Therefore, some works have investigated
    the design of the energy harvester [135]–[140], [146], while some others have
    focused on the effect of transmit signal designs [137], [141], [142]. In order
    to develop resource allocation schemes in wireless-powered networks, most works
    adopt linear EH models. As the name implies, according to these models, in the
    harvested power ( p h ) at the user is linearly dependent on the input RF power
    ( p in ) collected by the users’ antenna, i,e., p h =η p in , where 0<η≤1 is the
    energy conversion efficiency [147]. Some empirical works show that, at 2.45 GHz,
    η is measured as from 31.8% to 61.4%, when the receive power level, p in , is
    between −15 dBm and −5 dBm [148]. However, in practice, the energy harvester characteristics
    ( p in vs. p h ) of typical RF energy harvester circuits is non-linear [135].
    Motivated by this empirical fact, a nonlinear EH model is developed based on the
    logistic function [136]. This model, however, does not satisfy the sensitivity
    property; namely that the EH output falls to zero when the input power at the
    EH receiver device is smaller than the sensitivity threshold. Reference [149]
    thus modifies the logistic EH model to address the sensitivity issue. In [137],
    a tractable non-linear EH model is developed through the second and high order
    terms in the Taylor expansion of the diode characteristics. Besides, a piece-wise
    linear EH model is adopted in [140], [150], where the harvested power linearly
    increases with the received RF power, but the maximum power that can be harvested
    by each user is limited. Various energy harvester models, i.e., linear model,
    diode non-linear model and saturation non-linear model, and the corresponding
    signal and system design, i.e., transmitter and receiver architecture, waveform
    design, modulation, beamforming and resource allocation strategies, are investigated
    in [9]. The work mainly focuses on SWIPT systems, however the analysis can be
    well adapted to other types of WPCNs and also their integration with backscatter
    communications. To improve the efficiency and DC output power in WPCNs, special
    designed waveforms, i.e., OFDM, white noise, chaotic and multisine waveforms,
    have been proposed [137], [141], [142], [151]. Multisine waveforms can significantly
    enhance the DC power and RF-to-DC conversion efficiency over a single sinewave
    signal [137], [151]. Recently, multisine waveform methods have attracted great
    attention due to their ability to improve read reliability and read range in RFID
    tags (by increasing RFID tag RF to DC power conversion efficiency) [141], [142].
    It is shown that, with perfect CSI at the RF transmitter (CSIT), significant gain
    can be achieved with optimized multisine waveforms by exploiting the energy harvester
    non-linearity and the frequency selectivity of the channel [137]. In BCSs, dedicated
    RF transmitter typically transmits sinusoidal continuous waveform. However, the
    waveform design techniques, which were used for WPCNs, can be well adapted to
    backscatter communication systems, i.e., WPN-BCs, to improve their performance.
    Besides, non-linear EH models can be further considered which are directly applicable
    to practical systems [118], [152]. For WPN-BCs, since a tradeoff exists between
    the harvested energy at the tag and the SNR at the backscatter receiver, the waveform
    design might be different from that for pure WPCNs. In [153], with perfect CSIT
    and employing the non-linear energy harvester model in [137], a systematic design
    of multisine transmit waveform is designed to enlarge the tradeoff region, thereby
    leading to performance improvement of point-to-point backscatter communication
    system. Besides, in [154], the work in [153] is extended to a multi-user backscatter
    system. An optimization problem is formulated and solved to jointly optimize the
    phases and the magnitudes of the multisine waveform for multiple-tags system.
    Different from the design for pure WPCNs, the authors also optimize the receive
    combiners at the backscatter receiver such that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) with respect to a tag can be higher than a threshold. It is shown
    that, waveform design based on the non-linear energy harvester model can gain
    a larger SINR-energy region than those obtained based on the linear model. Besides,
    power allocation across multiple sinewaves can effectively enlarge the tradeoff
    region by exploiting the frequency selectivity of the channel and the non-linearity
    of the energy harvester. Moreover, with the increasing number of tags, the performance
    gap between waveform optimized based on the non-linear and the linear model increases,
    however, the average amount of energy harvested at each tag decreases. In [155],
    resource allocation problem in a backscatter-assisted WPCN is investigated under
    the piece-wise linear EH model at a dual-mode operating single-antenna users,
    i.e., the users communicate with a single-antenna AP using two modes of operation,
    active communication and passive backscattering. In this setup, a multi-antenna
    RF source transmits either an energy-carrying signal or an energy-information-bearing
    signal to the users via beamforming. Optimal beamforming vectors are designed
    at the RF source as well as the optimal time allocation for EH, backscatter communication
    and active wireless-powered communication of the users. SECTION III. Performance
    Improvement of WPN-BCs In this section, we focus on the general architecture of
    WPN-BCs and review the existing approaches for performance improvement of them.
    Multiple access techniques, multi-antenna and MIMO systems which are critically
    important to meet the requirements of large-scale communication networks, are
    mainly discussed in this section. Moreover, we review the research works that
    employ artificial intelligence techniques, as powerful tools for signal processing
    and communications, to enhance the performance of the large-scale WPN-BCs. Physical
    security of WPN-BCs as a key components of 5G and beyond networks is also addressed
    in this section. A. Communication Improvements Backscatter communications integrated
    with a WPCN can effectively increase the coverage and diminish the SNR outage
    zone compared to an active radio based WPCN [19]. In order to improve the network
    flexibility and to achieve performance improvements, the hybrid of passive backscatter
    communication and RF-powered active communication has been investigated for data
    transmission [125], [156]–[160]. This architecture enables the user devices to
    operate in different modes, i.e., active mode or passive mode via backscattering,
    according to the energy supply and channel conditions. For instance, when the
    user device has sufficient energy supply, it actively transmits information with
    a higher data rate and enhanced reliability against channel variation, otherwise,
    it switches to the power-saving passive mode and transmits its information via
    backscattering. The architecture of hybrid radio communication and several example
    scenarios are studied in [157]. In particular, in [156], to increase the range
    and also to ensure an uniform rate distribution, hybrid of short-range ABCS and
    long-range BBCS for wireless-powered heterogeneous networks is proposed. Dual
    mode operation is adopted which utilizes ABCS and BBCS as the secondary access
    on top of the primary HTT protocol, as shown in Fig. 4. A throughput maximization
    problem is formulated and solved to optimize the dual mode operation. FIGURE 4.
    The wireless-powered heterogeneous network model with hybrid backscatter communication
    [156]. Show All Reference [158] investigates three time-division based RF EH protocols
    to optimize the sum-throughput of a two-way WPCN comprising a H-AP and multiple
    sensors. The first protocol is the reference time-switching protocol, which is
    a sum-throughput optimized method that harvests energy, decodes data and transmits
    data using orthogonal time slots, τ EH , τ DL and τ UL , respectively. The second
    one is a hybrid protocol, which combines the time-switching and power splitting
    receiver structure. The downlink data decoding phase τ DL is also used for EH
    and the received power during τ DL is split by a power splitting ratio λ , the
    proportion used for energy harvesting, and (1−λ) for data decoding. The third
    one is the combination protocol, which integrates hybrid protocol with backscatter
    communication. In this setup, the sensors that operate in backscatter mode will
    backscatter data to the H-AP during τ EH , harvest energy and decode data during
    τ DL and remain off during τ UL . Whereas, sensors operating in the non-backscatter
    mode will work the same as the hybrid one. It is shown that, the combination protocol
    is the most appropriate for wireless-powered networks with a large sensor population.
    The authors further extend their work to the case where there are multiple multi-antenna
    H-APs, which are connected to a global controller [159]. They consider the combination
    protocol for the sensors and investigated the sum-throughput and fairness maximization
    problem with blind adaptive beamforming at the H-APs. They found that, that the
    proposed scheme delivered up to approximately 296% increase in the sum-throughput
    compared to the reference time-switching protocol in a dynamic environment, achieved
    a dropout rate of 0% instead of 28.5% by the reference time-switching protocol
    at 10mW H-AP transmission power, and increased Jain’s fairness index from J=0.76
    to up to 0.90 and 0.80 with and without sensors operating in the backscatter mode,
    respectively. In [125], a hybrid D2D system is introduced that combines both ambient
    backscattering and WPCN capabilities. The authors design a hybrid transmitter
    and a hybrid receiver, as shown in Fig. 5. The hybrid receiver can receive and
    decode data from both the modulated backscatter and active RF transmission. For
    the hybrid transmitter to choose the mode of operation, i.e., HTT or backscattering,
    two mode selection protocols, namely, a power threshold based protocol and an
    SNR threshold-based protocol are proposed. The authors then adopt stochastic geometry
    to analyze the hybrid D2D communications in terms of energy outage probability,
    coverage probability, and average throughput. FIGURE 5. The structure of the hybrid
    transmitter and hybrid receiver [125]. Show All In [160], a transmission scheduling
    problem is investigated for a backscatter-assisted wirelessly powered IoT system
    to maximize the minimum system throughput where devices can backscatter when other
    nearby devices are actively transmitting via RF. As shown in Fig. 6, each device
    is equipped with an RF energy harvester, which it uses to harvest incident RF
    energy. It then uses the harvested energy to power the RF transmitter when sending
    data directly to the HAP. It can also communicate with other devices via backscattering.
    In this setup, first a H-AP charges all devices using an HTT protocol and each
    device then transmits its data directly to the H-AP using the harvested RF energy,
    or it backscatters its data to some neighboring devices to be forwarded to the
    H-AP. There are no dedicated RF sources and a device can backscatter signals emitted
    by any device within a certain range. The groups of devices that can simultaneously
    backscatter without causing interference are identified and it is shown that,
    the max–min throughput can be increased by 46 and 180 times for linear and random
    networks, respectively, compared with TDMA. FIGURE 6. Hybrid backscatter device
    [160]. Show All Different from backscatter-assisted HTT transmission, the backscatter-assisted
    communication systems considered in [161] support battery-free backscatter transmission
    and the battery-assisted transmission (active radio mode with RF chain). Two adaptive
    mode selection schemes, i.e., power maximization-oriented and outage minimization-oriented
    adaptive mode selection schemes, are investigated with opportunistic SIC. In power
    maximization-oriented adaptive mode selection, based on the comparison of the
    backscatter power in the passive mode and the transmit power in the active mode,
    the mode corresponding to the maximum one is selected. While in outage minimization-oriented
    adaptive mode selection, the passive/active mode corresponding to the minimum
    outage probability is selected. The authors further derived the lower bounds for
    the outage performance in the proposed schemes in closed-form expressions. This
    assumption that the devices can support two modes of operation may not be suitable
    for hardware-constrained IoT devices in practice [19]. Thus, the authors in [19]
    proposed a WPN-BC design aiming to achieve long-range coverage, compared to the
    active radio based WPCN with a short-range coverage due to the doubly round-trip
    attenuation. In this scheme, the user not only harvests energy from the RF signal
    broadcast by the H-AP but also the carrier signal from the carrier emitter deployed
    close by the tag, as shown in Fig. 7. The user first harvests energy in the downlink
    and then transmits its own information in a passive way by reflecting the carrier
    signal while performing binary FSK modulation. It is shown that, the proposed
    scheme can effectively resolve the problem of short coverage and wide SNR outage
    zone in WPCNs due to the doubly near-far problem. FIGURE 7. A backscatter radio
    based wireless powered communication network [19]. Show All In [162], to ensure
    that the instantaneous receive power at the device (located far from the RF source)
    is enough for operation, the authors consider a two-state duty cycle involving
    both the sleep and the active states in an RF-powered communication network with
    ambient backscatter. In the sleep state, the device performs dedicated energy
    harvesting only, where the harvested energy from the received RF signal is stored
    in its battery for further use. In the active state, the device backscatters a
    part of the received RF signal, and simultaneously absorbs the remaining part
    energy of the received RF signal to power its circuit. The authors derive both
    the optimal reflection coefficient and the optimal tradeoff between the EH time
    and the backscatter time, to maximize the network throughput. Reference [163]
    further investigates a optimal time scheduling scheme based on compressive spectrum
    sensing techniques in IoT networks with a large number of IoT nodes. Each node
    is equipped with three modules, i.e., spectrum sensing device to detect ambient
    RF signals, RF energy harvester and backscatter device to transmit data to the
    gateway, as shown in Fig. 8. The authors first employed compressive sensing to
    detect ambient RF signals with high signal power, transmitted in wideband spectrum.
    The detected signals are then used to perform RF EH (partial signals) and ambient
    backscatter communication (the rest of signals), simultaneously. An optimal scheme
    is designed to manage the time scheduling of different modules. It is shown that
    larger transmission rates can be achieved via compressive sensing. The authors
    also analyze the outage probability of the backscatter communication and obtain
    the detection threshold of spectrum sensing for enabling backscatter communication.
    FIGURE 8. The block diagram of different modules at the IoT node [163]. Show All
    User cooperation has also been investigated to improve the performance of WPN-BCs
    [164]. The considered WPN-BC consists of a PB, an AP and two devices with two
    different operation modes, i.e., one in HTT and one in backscattering mode. The
    devices can cooperate to deliver the information to the AP, i.e., the one located
    nearer to the AP can serve as a relay node to assist the far device to transmit
    information due to the low channel quality. A weighted sum rate maximization problem
    is formulated and solved to jointly optimize the time schedule, power allocation
    and energy beamforming deployed at the PB. Asynchronous transmission and sporadic
    short packets, the main important features of IoT and massive machine type communications,
    are investigated in [114]. In particular, the authors consider a stochastic WPN-BC
    ad hoc network consisting of multiple RFID reader-tag pairs where each reader-tag
    pair randomly accesses the same frequency for ad hoc transmission asynchronously.
    The multi-antenna RFID reader works in the full-duplex mode to simultaneously
    transmit query signal and receive information signal from its corresponding RFID
    tag. The authors then analyze the information and outage performance during the
    energy harvest and backscatter modulation phases. The spatial throughput maximization
    is also investigated and it is shown that there exists the optimal tradeoff between
    the duration of two phases for spatial throughput maximization. Energy efficiency
    of WPN-BCs is also investigated [165]–[167]. In [165], the energy efficiency of
    a single backscatter link is maximized via jointly optimizing time allocation,
    reflection coefficient and transmit power of the dedicated RF energy source. Moreover,
    the authors in [166], consider a WPCN with two backscatter links and maximize
    the minimum link energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the PB transmission power
    and the backscatter reflection coefficient. Table 5 shows the summary of communication
    improvements for WPN-BCs. TABLE 5 Summary of Communication Improvements for WPN-BCs
    B. Multiple-Access Schemes and Protocols Developing multiple access techniques
    for WPN-BCs is crucially important. The problem is to figure out how a single
    reader may be utilized to serve multiple tags. In this case, the reader will receive
    multiple uplink backscattered signals. For instance, in a warehouse, a single
    reader may be deployed to collect data simultaneously from a massive number of
    items equipped with RFID tags. This causes collisions/interference at the receiver.
    Due to the resulting data loss, re-transmissions may be needed, which negatively
    affects both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency [168]. Thus, this again
    emphasizes the need for efficient multiple access techniques for backscatter systems,
    i.e., WPN-BCs. Common multiple access techniques are orthogonal multiple access
    (OMA) where each user can exploit orthogonal communication resources within either
    a specific spatial direction, time slot, frequency band, or code in order to avoid
    multiple access collisions/interference [8]. A simple solution to avoid collisions
    between multi-tag transmissions are OMA schemes such as spatial division multiple
    access (SDMA) [133], frequency division multiple access (FDMA) [133], TDMA [19],
    [169], code division multiple access (CDMA) [170]–[172], and orthogonal frequency
    division multiple access (OFDMA) [173], among which TDMA is mostly adopted in
    backscatter communications due to its simplicity. In particular, in [66], a FABCS
    over ambient OFDM carrier is considered where a full-duplex AP with two antennas,
    transmits downlink signal which not only carries information for the legacy user
    but also transfers energy to the multiple backscatter devices, while at the same
    time, the backscatter devices transmit uplink information via backscattering similar
    to the TDMA protocol. The minimum throughput of the backscatter devices is maximized
    by the joint optimization of backscatter time allocation, power reflection coefficients,
    and full-duplex APs’ subcarrier power allocation. In addition, [22] proposes a
    backscatter-assisted WPCN that includes a full-duplex H-AP and multiple users.
    The full-duplex H-AP uses one antenna for transferring energy to the users in
    the downlink, and one antenna for receiving signals from the users in the uplink,
    simultaneously. The users switch between HTT and backscatter modes adaptively
    and transmit or backscatter information to the HAP in TDMA. In this set up, the
    authors maximize the sum-throughput by studying the optimal transmission policy,
    including both the optimal working mode permutation and time allocation. The main
    problem with OMA techniques is that the number of orthogonal channels has an upper
    bound. Consequently, the number of users that can be served simultaneously will
    hit this bound, especially for massive IoT devices. Nonorthogonal multiple access
    (NOMA) has thus been developed as an effective solution to overcome this hard
    limitation, where multiple users are served in each orthogonal resource block,
    e.g., a time slot, a frequency channel, a spreading code, or an orthogonal spatial
    degree of freedom [174], [175]. Thus, power-domain and code-domain NOMA schemes
    have been developed. The code-domain NOMA utilizes user-specific spreading sequences
    to enable the concurrent use of the same resource, while power-domain NOMA exploits
    channel-gain disparities among users to achieve the same goal and has the advantages
    of low latency and high spectral efficiency [175]. Therefore, backscatter communication
    with NOMA has recently been recognized as a promising spectrum-, energy- and cost
    efficient technology for enabling low-power IoT networks [176]–[180]. A hybrid
    channel access scheme by combining TDMA with power-domain NOMA for multiplexing
    the backscatter nodes in different regions or with different power levels, has
    been proposed [176], [180] to enhance the spectrum efficiency, outage probability
    and throughput of MBCSs. Reference [177] considers a NOMA-enhanced ABCS comprising
    four nodes, namely, the BS, the backscatter device, the nearby cellular user,
    and the far-away cellular user. The BS transmits the superposition message to
    the users at the same resource block with different powers. The backscatter device
    also transmits its information to nearby cellular user, over the signal received
    from BS. The nearby cellular user first decodes the information of the far-away
    cellular user, then its own information, and finally the backscatter device information.
    The far user, however, only decodes its own information. The authors then analyze
    the outage and ergodic rate performance of the system. On the other hand, [178]
    considers the NOMA-enhanced BBCS with dynamic TDMA and maximized the minimum throughput
    of multiple backscatter nodes by jointly optimizing backscatter time allocation,
    power reflection coefficient while ensuring sufficient harvested energy and SINR
    for NOMA decoding. Moreover, [179] investigates a NOMA-enhanced dynamic TDMA transmission
    scheme for full-duplex symbiotic radios, where a full-duplex AP transmits downlink
    OFDM signals to a legacy user and simultaneously receives signals backscattered
    from multiple passive backscatter devices. The minimum throughput among multiple
    backscatter nodes is maximized by jointly optimizing the full-duplex APs’ subcarrier
    power allocation, the nodes’ backscatter time and power reflection coefficients
    subject to the legacy user’s throughput requirement and the harvested energy requirements
    of the backscatter nodes. In [169], the hybrid of NOMA and TDMA is considered
    in a backscatter-assisted WPCN comprising a PB, an information receiver and multiple
    users that can work in either backscattering mode or HTT mode. The authors also
    derive optimal time allocation policies to maximized the system throughput. For
    simultaneous transmissions from multiple devices in large-scale backscatter networks,
    the NetScatter protocol is suggested [181] which adopts the combination of chirp
    spread spectrum modulation and OOK to enable hundreds of backscatter devices to
    simultaneously backscatter their information to an AP. It is shown that, the NetScatter
    protocol can support concurrent transmission from 256 backscatter devices with
    the data rate of 500 kbps and communication range of 2 meters. Reference [172]
    further analyzes the coded-backscatter multiple access (CBMA) scheme for backscatter
    communication where multiple tags simultaneously transmit data to the receiver
    in the same frequency. The authors investigate the correlation-based detector
    and power control at the tag to respectively reduce the negative effects caused
    by the asynchronous problem and improve the performance against the significant
    power difference among tags. It is shown that, the proposed scheme can achieve
    a 10-tag bit rate up to 8 Mbps with tag-receiver distances up to 10 meters. For
    large-scale networks, it may not be efficient to deploy the centralized MAC protocols,
    e.g., TDMA, FDMA, only for sporadic backscatter communications requirement due
    to the complexity, the energy consumption and the dynamic change of network topology,
    i.e., backscatter devices frequently join or leave from the network. Moreover,
    some critical data messages with high quality of service (QoS) requirements can
    hardly be transmitted in time and the frequency spectrum resources could be wasted
    due to the inflexibility of the centralized schemes. To overcome these challenges,
    distributed MAC protocols have been investigated and MAC-layer performance has
    been also analyzed in addition to physical-layer performance [182]–[184]. For
    these reasons, [182] proposes a modified coordination based the dominant channel
    occupancy (DCO) protocol, where backscatter tags use the RF signals of the Wi-Fi
    helper to communicate with the reader. The backscatter tags contends for the transmission
    together with the Wi-Fi station for a shared channel. Reference [183] further
    proposed a Distributed and Demand-Based (DDB) protocol for a heterogeneous network,
    where backscatter tags use the Wi-Fi signals to transmit information to the AP.
    Unlike [182], the authors considered the AP’s demand for the information of backscatter
    device, and let the Wi-Fi device and backscatter device perform the distributed
    contention in a separate manner. When the AP has a demand to collect the tag information,
    it contends with the wireless devices and sends the CTS_to_self packet upon success
    to suspend their transmissions and reserve the channel. Then, it sends preambles
    to excite the backscatter tags and all the tags will adopt CSMA/CA protocol to
    contend for transmission within this reserved time period. The authors then analyze
    the MAC-layer performance in terms of per-node throughput. Reference [184] investigates
    an opportunistic MAC protocol for backscatter communications in a heterogeneous
    wireless powered IoT network consisting of EH devices coexisting with backscatter
    tags, a backscatter reader and an H-AP. In this network, the wireless devices
    communicate with the H-AP based via HTT and the backscatter tags utilize H-AP’s
    RF energy signal to operate and transmit information to the backscatter reader.
    The EH devices contend for the channel and use a handshaking method to reserve
    the channel to harvest and/or transmit data. The reader listens to the channel
    and excites the backscatter tags for contention and communication when it finds
    the RF energy signal of the H-AP. The authors further compare the performance
    of the proposed MAC protocol with DCO protocol [182] and DDB protocol [183], in
    terms of throughout, i.e., the successful data transmission over total time which
    depends on the idle slots, success, and collision of the transmissions. It is
    shown that, unlike DCO and DBB protocols for which throughput significantly decreases
    with the increase of nodes, the proposed protocol shows a steady throughput performance
    and it is also more collision-resilient due to its contention and channel reservation
    mechanism. In [185], a distributed MAC protocol for ABCS is proposed where the
    backscatter devices achieve power-efficient channel access via the RF signals
    according to their traffic requirements in a distributed way. The authors consider
    the coexistence of the traditional RF communications (consisting of a continuous
    RF source and the legacy users) and ABCSs (consisting of a large number of backscattter
    devices). The proposed MAC protocol also support the backscatter communications
    among backscatter devices, and each backscatter device can switch among backscatter
    transmission, receiving and EH in a distributed fashion by combining an analog
    channel sensing strategy with the dual-backoff mechanism. This mechanism contains
    two dimensions where the first-dimension backoff is to achieve collision avoidance
    (CSMA/CA scheme), and the second-dimension backoff aims to reduce the channel
    waste during the energy harvesting. The authors develop a three-dimensional Markov
    model with the consideration of the false alarm and the miss detection problems
    occurring while sensing, to analyze the normalized throughput of the proposed
    MAC protocol. It is shown that, the proposed MAC protocol operates well under
    the strict-low power consumption for IoT networks. In [186], in order to provide
    seamless wireless communications to massively deployed IoT nodes with few or no
    collisions in WPCNs, coordinating channel access among a large number of sensor
    nodes in a distributed manner is investigated. The authors proposed a group-based
    MAC protocol to distribute the sensor nodes into groups based on their co-location.
    The group head, a H-AP, uses a coordinating mechanism to send collected data from
    sensor nodes to the BS. The sensor nodes harvest energy or transmit data to the
    H-AP in their active time and are sleep during the inactive time. The nodes with
    sufficient energy concurrently access the medium and transmit data by using a
    frame slotted ALOHA to reduce collisions; if more than one node simultaneously
    transmit data during a slot, the outcome may result in collision and re-transmission
    is needed by the nodes in the active time of the next frame. It is shown that,
    the proposed distributed group-coordination mechanism can effectively mitigate
    the inter-group and intra-group collisions, thereby achieving significant performance
    in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency. C. Multi-Antenna and MIMO
    Systems Exploiting multiple antennas at tags/readers provide several benefits
    for backscatter communications [187], [188]: 1) A multiple-antenna tag can perform
    EH and backscattering simultaneously, unlike a single antenna tag [34], [97],
    [98], 2) Multiple antennas at the reader are essential for both downlink excitation
    and uplink detection [114], [189]–[191], 3) Increasing the number of tag/reader
    antennas may enlarge the communication range between the tag and the reader in
    conventional radio backscatter systems [40], [189], [192], and 4) Multiple-antenna
    tags/readers increase diversity gain and thus enhance communication reliability
    and lower the bit-error-rate of conventional radio backscatter systems [104],
    [193]. In order to improve throughout, RFID MIMO systems have been investigated
    for backscatter communications [28]. Reference [187] propose a unitary query at
    the reader query end in the M×L×N MIMO backscatter RFID comprising three components:
    the query end (with M reader transmitting antennas), the tag end (with L tag antennas)
    and the receiving end (with N reader receiving antennas). The proposed unitary
    query can provide time diversity within each channel coherent interval, and improve
    the performance by 5–10 dB in the mid-range SNR regimes. The authors further extended
    the unitary query to block-level unitary query with the corresponding modified
    STBC in [105]. It is shown that, the proposed scheme can achieve full diversity
    of classical OSTBC. Multiple antennas indicate multiple channel parameters between
    the tag and the reader, which significantly challenges signal detection because
    the tag has limited power and can transmit few training symbols only. Thus, efficient
    signal detection and channel estimation techniques for MIMO backscatter communications
    have also gained much interest [66], [97], [98], [189]–[191], [193], [194]. In
    particular, [189] investigates the efficacy of a full-duplex MIMO reader for enhancing
    the limited communication range of MBCSs. A novel least-squares estimator for
    the forward and backward links between the reader and the tag and also corresponding
    linear minimum-mean square-error estimate for the backscattered channel are derived
    in a single-tag BSC setting. The authors further consider multi-tag backscatter
    setting in [190], as shown in Fig. 9. A novel channel estimation algorithm is
    presented by considering practical constraints like unintended ambient reflections
    (UAR), preamble design for the tags. Optimal transceiver designs are then obtained
    for the multi-antenna reader to maximize common backscattered throughput among
    the single-antenna semi-passive tags. As well, [191] maximizes the achievable
    sum backscattered-throughput by jointly optimizing the transceiver design at the
    multi-antenna reader and backscattering coefficients at the single-antenna tags.
    Furthermore, the authors in [193] propose an ML-based backscattering detection
    protocol for MBCSs with the multi-antenna reader and derive closed-form expressions
    for the optimal detection threshold and bit-error-rate. Channel estimation and
    signal detection in an ABCS with a multiple-antenna tag are also investigated
    [97], [98]. Fig. 10 shows an ABCS with a multi-antenna tag where the tag can perform
    energy harvesting and backscatter modulation, simultaneously. For backscatter-assisted
    wireless-powered networks, two-antenna H-AP working in full-duplex mode is also
    considered [22]. FIGURE 9. A MBCS with a full-duplex multi-antenna reader and
    multiple semi-passive single-antenna tags, with optimal transceiver design for
    reader [190]. Show All FIGURE 10. The multi-antenna-tag ambient backscatter system
    [98]. Show All Energy beamforming is also investigated for WPN-BCs where a multiple-antenna
    system focuses the transmitted energy to the direction of the receiver [14], [164],
    [195]. A combination of backscatter communication and retro-directive beamforming
    for energy beamforming is introduced in [14]. Retro-directive beamforming is a
    simple technology, which requires neither knowledge of the user location nor any
    complex beamforming algorithm; a multi-antenna BS automatically steer a radio
    beam toward a target user based on the signal transmitted by the user and received
    at the BS. The authors in [195] investigate a simple energy beamforming technique
    for a multi-user networks that combines large antenna retro-directivity with signal
    backscattering. In particular, the energy beamforming technique consists of two
    phases. In the first phase, the energy transmitter (PB) generates and broadcasts
    an unmodulated single-tone waveform and each energy receiver (backscatter device)
    reflects back a part of the received signal without further processing. In the
    second phase, the PB performs matching filtering on the received signal to detect
    the phase of the signal and transmit energy signal by using phase conjugation.
    The impact of reflection coefficient on the performance is also investigated.
    Moreover, in [164], energy beamforming is deployed at the PB to improve energy
    transmission for the nodes in WPN-BCs. Reference [159] also investigates the performance
    of a wireless-powered network using multiple blind adaptive beamforming H-APs
    and backscatter communication-enabled combination sensors [158]. In this setup,
    The impact of the number of antennas and H-APs on the sum-throughput, throughput
    fairness and sum-throughput and fairness tradeoff is investigated. On the other
    hand, the authors in [196] design transmit beamforming at a mutli-antenna primary
    transmitter (PT), which transmits its primary information to a single-antenna
    primary receiver, and at the same time enables a single-antenna backscatter device
    to transmit its own information to the primary receiver. The transmit beamforming
    is designed such that either the weighted sum rate of the primary and backscatter
    device transmissions is maximized or the PT’s transmit power is minimized under
    rate constraints. The complexity of these schemes however increases exponentially
    as the number of antennas at the PT increases. Thus, the authors further propose
    a low-complexity beamforming structure, which can be well adopted in the case
    of the large-scale antenna array at the PT. D. Artificial Intelligence Artificial
    intelligence techniques are capable of solving complex problems without explicit
    programming and have recently been vigorously considered for signal processing
    and communications [197]–[202]. In particular, machine learning can be used for
    ultra-dense communications, e.g., massive machine type communication [202], large-scale
    MIMO [203] networks, to answer the challenge of supporting a huge number of devices
    in cellular network including QoS provisioning, handling highly dynamic and sporadic
    traffic flows of massive machine type communication and IoT networks and large
    signalling overheads [204]. It is shown that, machine learning algorithms can
    improve channel estimation and signal detection [205]. For example, signal detection
    for ABCSs by using unsupervised learning and other machine learning approaches
    has been studied [43], [206]. By exploring the received signal constellation information,
    these works have proposed a modulation-constrained expectation maximization algorithm.
    Interestingly, their constellation learning methods achieve comparable performance
    as the optimal detector with perfect channel-state information. Moreover, in [207],
    a reinforcement learning approach is proposed to maximize the long term average
    throughput for ABCSs when the distribution of the ambient RF signal strength is
    unknown. It is shown that, the proposed learning method produces a close-to-optimal
    throughput performance, and significantly outperforms the greedy policy (where
    the tag chooses signal backscattering mode if it has sufficient energy to transmit
    information, or energy-harvesting mode otherwise). The authors in [208] also consider
    the data scheduling and admission control problem of a backscatter sensor network.
    The authors formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, and a reinforcement
    learning algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal policy that minimizes the
    weighted sum of delay of different types of data, e.g., urgent or normal. Recently,
    deep reinforcement learning techniques have shown tremendous potential in the
    field of distributed dynamic spectrum access [199], [209]. Motivated by this,
    a distributed deep reinforcement learning based MAC protocol is proposed in [210]
    to assist the backscatter communications for IoT networks by leveraging Wi-Fi
    signals. With this protocol, the Wi-Fi AP can dynamically learn the served backscatter
    devices and the reserved step of the served backsatter devices, which allows the
    AP to determine the action and thus achieve the optimal throughput performance.
    Reinforcement learning algorithms have also gained much interest in order to optimize
    the performance of the RF-powered cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In particular,
    the authors in [211] leverage reinforcement learning algorithms to investigate
    optimal sensing, channel probing, i.e., CSI estimation process, and transmission
    power control for an ST operating in a fading channel with harvested energy from
    ambient sources. Learning algorithms have been further investigated for backscatter-assisted
    wireless-powered CRNs for time scheduling and optimal policies [134], [212], [213]
    (Section IV-A). E. Physical Layer Security The widespread deployment of wireless-powered
    backscatter communications and the lack of strong protection schemes makes these
    systems vulnerable to security attacks such as eavesdropping and jamming [214]–[216].
    WPN-BCs with simple coding and modulation schemes may suffer from potential security
    attacks which adversely impact the performance and reliability of the systems.
    Securing backscatter communication systems is challenging due to its passive nature
    and also practical limitations, in terms of cost, size and computation. Moreover,
    typical security solutions such as encryption, which provide an acceptable level
    of security against a number of attacks, cannot fully satisfy all the requirements
    of resource-constrained backscatter systems and exhibit several limitations in
    such systems [214], [217]. Developing physical-layer security (PLS) mechanisms,
    as an alternative or complement to cryptography, is a promising direction to overcome
    the above limitations and strengthen the security of backscatter systems [214].
    PLS techniques fundamentally enhance wireless communication security at the physical
    layer. They exploit wireless channel characteristics, e.g., noise, fading, interference,
    dispersion and diversity, to construct equivalent channels via signal design and
    power allocation such that the superiority of the equivalent legitimate channel
    to the equivalent wiretap link is established [214], [218], [219]. One promising
    approach to deteriorate the channel condition of the eavesdropper is to inject
    an artificially generated noise [218]. Following this idea, [214] investigates
    the secrecy rate of a single-reader and single-tag model for an RFID system, where
    terminals employ a single antenna. The reader injects a randomly generated noise
    signal that is added to the standard continuous wave signal to interfere with
    an eavesdropper. To maximize the secrecy rate, this approach necessitates the
    power allocation between the continuous wave signal and the artificial noise.
    It is shown that the proposed approach can significantly improve the secrecy performance.
    This work is extended to a more general MIMO RFID system in [219] and the secrecy
    rate maximization is investigated by optimizing the supply energy and precoding
    matrix of artificial noise at the reader. To further improve the security of RFID
    systems, [220] deploys beam steering using a one-dimensional antenna array at
    the tag in addition to the noise injection from the reader side. Secrecy rate
    of the relay-assisted RFID systems is also investigated [221], [222]. Moreover,
    in [223], secrecy outage probability is investigated for an RFID system with multi-tag
    selection. On the other hand, [215] investigates the PLS performance of a multi-antenna
    RFID system with practical binary inputs at the single-antenna tag. In order to
    improve the secrecy energy efficiency of the system, instead of direct using artificial
    noise, one randomized continuous wave signal is used at the reader for security
    enhancement. The secrecy rate is maximized by optimizing the parameters related
    to the continuous wave signal to tackle the stability-variance tradeoff between
    balancing legitimate signal reception and eavesdropper mitigation. Compared to
    passive eavesdroppers, the proactive eavesdropper, which broadcast its own continuous
    wave signal, can extract the on-tag messages more confidently and interfere with
    the information detection at the reader simultaneously [216]. This type of attacks
    can cause severe security threat for RFID systems [216], [224]. In particular,
    [216] investigates security issues in an RFID system in the presence of a proactive
    eavesdropper. The authors propose a secure transmission scheme at the reader in
    which the wiretap channel is estimated and the artificial noise-aided continuous
    wave signal is designed for secrecy transmission. Very few works have investigated
    PLS in ABCSs [225]–[227]. Securing ABCSs faces several challenges because the
    backscatter transmitters are simple devices and the RF sources are not controllable.
    The authors in [226] study an artificial noise-aided tag scheduling scheme in
    an ABCS comprising multiple tag, a reader and an eavesdropper. In the proposed
    scheme, a tag is selected for information transmission and another tag for artificial
    noise generation at the same time. It is shown that the proposed method with SIC
    at the reader can improve the average secrecy rate. The authors then propose a
    cooperation-based multi-tag scheduling method in [227], which selects a tag for
    data transmission and another tag for cooperative transmission (the same data)
    to assist a receiver. These two strategies are evaluated in terms of bit error
    rate and secrecy rate. SECTION IV. Emerging Wireless-Powered Backscatter Systems
    Sixth generation (6G) communications are expected to raise features currently
    set by 5G communications with the provision of enhanced services from the perspectives
    of network data availability, mobile data rate, and seamless ubiquitous connection.
    Attaining a cost-effective approach toward rapid network deployment, reduction
    in the price of mobile communications’ utilization, approaches to network devices
    battery life longevity are some critical challenges associated with the next generation
    communications [228]. A fundamental goal of 6G communication is to perform whenever
    and wherever possible with battery-free communications, aiming at 1 pico-Joules
    per bit communication efficiency [229]. These requirements necessitate the incorporation
    and accumulation of innovative and divergent technologies. Due to the undeniable
    advantages of WPN-BCs, this prominent technology can be further integrated with
    other emerging technologies to realize 6G visions. Cognitive radio and wireless
    relaying are two technologies that can overcome energy and spectrum limitations
    and coverage of wireless networks [230], [231]. These technologies have also been
    adapted for large-scale IoT networks and power-constrained IoT networks. Moreover,
    using light as the transmission medium, visible light communication (VLC) has
    been identified as a promising technology in RF limited environments that can
    revolutionise the future of wireless communication [228], [232]. It possess certain
    compelling merits, such as minimal deployment overhead in terms of hardware replacement
    and high-speed data communication with the added advantage of improved energy
    efficiency and communication security/privacy [232]. Motivated by this, visible
    light backscatter Communication (VLBC) has been developed for battery-free IoT
    applications to tackle the challenges of directional communication and low optical
    coupling for wideband VLC [233]–[236]. Therefore, in this section, we address
    the integration of WPN-BCs with these emerging technologies. In particular, backscatter-assisted
    wireless-powered CRNs and backscatter-assisted wireless-powered relaying, for
    wireless-powered backscatter systems are reviewed to bring about the best use
    of resources and to enhance the coverage of such networks. Moreover, we review
    the recent research efforts that have been expended on the field of practical
    backscatter communication using visible light for battery-free IoT applications.
    A. Hybrid Backscatter-Assisted Cognitive Wireless-Powered Radio Networks Due to
    the tremendous growth of wireless communications, the spectrum bands become scarce.
    Thus, allocating spectrum bands to a large number of devices is another challenge
    for large-scale IoT networks. Cognitive radio by using various spectrum sensing
    methods [237], [238] facilitates the efficient usage of the wireless spectrum
    [239]. Considering both energy and spectrum limitations in large-scale IoT networks,
    RF-powered CRNs have been introduced and extensively investigated in the literature
    [12], [240]. By enabling RF EH on the cognitive radio devices, not only the devices
    exploit the underutilized spectrum but also opportunistically harness the free
    energy from primary signals. However, since the transmission used in a typical
    RF-powered CRN is usually based on HTT manner, the performance of the secondary
    network is highly dependent on the PTs; a PT with high frequent data transmission
    will leave little time for the STs to transmit over the idle channel, while a
    PT with low frequent data transmission will result in shortage of the harvested
    energy [241]. To tackle these challenges and to achieve the best performance for
    the secondary system, equipping the existing RF-powered CR devices with ambient
    backscattering module, has been introduced as an alternative solution [23], [71],
    [241], [242]. Following this idea, [241] investigated a CRN in which a wireless-powered
    ST is equipped with ambient backscattering module. In this setup, when the PT
    is active, the ST can select to perform EH or ambient backscattering. When the
    PT is idle, the ST can perform active transmission with the harvested energy.
    The optimal transmission policies is then obtained to maximize the throughput
    of the ST in two scenarios, i.e., overlay and underlay CRNs. The authors proved
    that there always exists the globally optimal time tradeoff. This implies that
    the integration of the ambient backscatter technique into RF-powered CRN always
    achieves the overall transmission rate higher than that of using either the ambient
    backscatter communication or the HTT scheme, individually. Besides, in [71], a
    CRN with multiple STs operating in HTT and backscatteing modes is considered where
    during the busy state, the STs transmit information via ambient backscattering
    or harvest energy for the future information transmission, while during the idle
    state, the STs adopt the bistatic backscattering mode or the HTT mode for information
    transmission. The authors maximized throughput by finding the optimal time allocation
    between modes in busy and idle states. In [242], an overlay CRN is considered
    with multiple STs which switch among HTT mode and ambient backscattering mode,
    to communicate with a secondary gateway. The authors developed a distributed stackelberg
    game model of the interaction between the secondary gateway and the STs for the
    optimization of time switching between two modes and interference management with
    imperfect channel condition. Considering the variety of demand requirements from
    STs, the authors in [243] employed the auction approach to assign the time resource
    for the STs in a backscatter-assisted RF-powered network where the secondary gateway
    acts as the seller as well as the auctioneer, and the STs act as the buyers to
    bid for the time resource. Moreover, [244] investigated the dynamic AP and service
    selection in such networks where a group of dual mode STs are within a coverage
    of multiple APs. The authors formulated the AP and service selection as an evolutionary
    game where the STs act as players and adjust their selections of the APs and services
    based on their utilities. Energy efficiency of a backscatter-assisted RF-powered
    network comprising a single secondary link is further investigated in [245] in
    the presence of sensing errors and without assuming knowledge of the PT activity.
    Energy detection-based spectrum sensing is employed and analytic expressions for
    the average achievable throughput, the average energy consumption and the energy
    efficiency are derived. The authors further maximized energy efficiency of the
    proposed network, and evaluate the optimal detection threshold, the optimal energy
    harvesting time and the optimal data transmission time, subject to PT interference
    and energy harvesting constraints. Reinforcement learning algorithms have been
    also investigated in backscatter-assisted RF-powered CRN to deal with dynamics
    of the ambient signals. In particular, [212] investigated a learning algorithm
    with incomplete environment parameters, e.g., channel state, the successful data
    transmission probabilities, that helps the ST to obtain the optimal policy through
    learning from its decisions. It is shown that, the proposed learning algorithm
    with incomplete environment parameters can closely attain the performance of the
    Markov decision process [246] optimization with complete information. Besides,
    reference [213] adopted a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for time scheduling
    in an RF-powered backscatter CRN with multiple STs, where the information about
    the network is incomplete. The proposed algorithm allows the network to assign
    backscattering time, EH time, and transmission time to the STs to maximize the
    network throughput. Moreover, for a large-scale RF-powered backscatter CRN, the
    authors in [134] developed an unsupervised Bayesian non-parametric learning algorithm
    to obtain the information from the primary network such as traffic application
    and popularity, which help to improve the performance of the secondary network.
    B. Backscatter-Assisted Wireless-Powered Relaying Relaying has been considered
    as an effective solution to enhance the communication ranges of power-constrained
    IoT networks. Backscatter communication devices have been regularly used as relays
    to assist the transmission by backscattering the received signals from the source
    node to the destination node, where they can effectively improve the signal diversity
    [156], [157], [247], [248]. Following this idea, [247] studied a relay network
    with multiple backscatter devices which are wirelessly powered by a PB. The backscatter
    devices work cooperatively to help as wireless relays for data transmission. The
    authors investigate the joint design of reflection coefficients of the backscatter
    devices to improve the signal reception with imperfect channel knowledge. Short-range
    backscatter communications may not guarantee the network coverage as the critical
    issue for relay networks. To overcome this limitation and to use the advantages
    of both active RF communication ad backscatter communications, it is considered
    that, the relay nodes have a dual mode transceiver structure and can flexibly
    switch between two operating modes, i.e., active and passive modes, to assist
    the information delivery [157], [248]. This way, the passive devices serve as
    passive relays to improve the performance of the active RF communications with
    proper reflection coefficients. In particular, in [248], a wireless-powered D2D
    network is studied where each user equipment can operate in either active mode
    or passive backscatter communications. The users are wirelessly powered by a multi-antenna
    PB via RF signal beamforming. When there are active communications, e.g., cellular
    network, the users can leverage the existing RF signals for low-rate backscatter
    communication. While, the channels are idle, the PB can beamform dedicated RF
    signals for the users and they can switch to active mode to use the idle channels,
    opportunistically. Cooperation among the users is also considered to further improve
    the performance. When a user actively transmit information, the other users can
    either harvest energy or switch into passive mode to assist the active user. The
    authors first investigated the sum throughput maximization by jointly optimizing
    the energy beamforming strategy, the power control and transmission scheduling
    in two radio modes and then consider the cooperation among the users to further
    improve the performance gain. Besides, in [249], a game-theoretic approach is
    proposed for the nodes to optimize the relaying strategy in a distributed manner.
    Moreover, the authors in [250], investigated ambient backscatter-assisted wireless-powered
    relaying for IoT networks where the relays use the ambient RF resources for dual
    mode operation. The end-to-end success probabilities and ergodic capacity under
    different mode selection protocols are derived based on stochastic geometry analysis.
    Furthermore, in [251], ambient backscatter-assisted cooperation method is investigated
    to improve the fairness in a two-user wireless-powered communication network.
    Dual mode operation extensively used in backscatter-assisted relay networks requires
    complex integration circuits for switching modes and consume much more power.
    These requirements may limit their application in large-scale hardware- and power-constrained
    IoT networks in practice. Thus, [252], [253] proposed a relaying scheme for IoT
    networks where energy-constrained gateways are deployed close to the user devices
    to assist them for information transmission to the H-AP, as relay nodes. In [252],
    multiple backscatter devices, each with one gateway which is located near the
    device, are powered by an H-AP. While a user device transmits data to its gateway
    by backscattering the signals from the H-AP, other gateways harvest energy from
    the H-AP. Then, the gateways use the harvested energy to actively forward the
    received signals to the H-AP in a round-robin fashion. The authors maximized the
    achievable sum rate by optimizing the time allocation between data backscattering,
    EH and data forwarding. The authors in [253] further considered multi-antenna
    H-AP with energy beamforming techniques. Three successive working phases were
    considered for data transmission. In the first phase, the H-AP beamforms energy
    signals to the gateways via a known sequence with unit power to the gateways,
    while all backscatter devices keep idle. In the second phase, the sensors employ
    the signals form the H-AP to backscatter data to the gateways in TDMA manner.
    In this phase, in the duration of each backscatter device, the H-AP focuses its
    signals toward the device via beamforming to enhance energy efficiency. In the
    third phase, the gateways forward the receive backscatter signals from the devices
    to the H-AP, sequentially. The authors investigated the joint design of energy
    beamforming vectors, time scheduling and power allocation. However, the assumption
    that each gateway just assists one user device for transmission may not be efficient
    for large-scale IoT networks. In [37], multi-hop relaying with power splitting
    is considered for massive tags/sensors. The authors investigated ABCSs based on
    Wi-Fi architecture and designed multi-hop and massive tag/sensors backscatter
    transmission mechanism. C. Visible Light Backscatter Communication (VLBC) VLBC
    has been identified as a practical solution for indoor IoT applications [233]–[236].
    The VLC backscatter device harvests energy from the existing indoor lighting infrastructure
    and modulates the reflected light beam as long as the illumination is available
    [233]. Unlike RF backscatter, VLC backscatter enjoys minimal deployment overheads
    in terms of hardware replacements [234]. A bi-directional VLC system, RetroVLC,
    is designed in [233], which uses the retroreflector fabric to backscatter the
    encoded information modulated by a liquid crystal display (LCD) shutter. RetroVLC
    achieves 10 kbps downlink rate and 0.5 kbps uplink rate over a distance up to
    2.4 meters using OOK modulation and Manchester coding. The authors in [234] extend
    the idea of RetroVLC and use a plural of retroreflectors and LCD shutters to form
    numbers of pixels, each pixel can be switched on/off independently to produce
    multi-level signals. Experimental results show that by using 8-pulse amplitude
    modulation (8-PAM), a bitrate of 600 bps can be achieved at a distance of 2 meters
    compared to 200 bps when using the OOK scheme. Reference [235] further upgrades
    the RetroVLC design from coding and modulation perspectives to increase the data
    rate. Specifically, Manchester coding is replaced with a Miller code, which doubles
    the bandwidth utilization. Besides, a trend-based modulation and code-assisted
    demodulation scheme is designed. The proposed approach can reduce the modulation
    time from 4 ms to 1 ms and achieves 1 Kbps ( 8× over RetroVLC) using the same
    LCD shutter. This scheme however frees up the potential to further improve the
    data rate by adding more pixels. It is observed that, the response time of LCD’s
    different charging states is highly asymmetric; that is, charging is much faster
    than discharging, i.e., sub-ms and 4 ms. Reference [236] thus exploits the LCD
    asymmetric response and proposes a delayed superimposed modulation scheme that
    pushes the rate limit to 4 Kbps with an array of LCD pixels, which is 4× the rate
    over the proposed method in [235]. SECTION V. WPN-BCs Applications Miniature and
    low-powered WPN-BCs may provide pervasive connectivity for a myriad of applications.
    Some of the potential areas that can leverage the capabilities of low-powered
    WPN-BCs are smart homes/cities, industrial IoT, bio-medical field and environmental
    monitoring systems. In the following, we briefly review the applications of WPN-BCs
    in healthcare and smart homes/cities. A. WPN-BCs for Healthcare Communication
    systems used in modern medical applications consume comparatively excess energy
    because of the need to generate their own radio signals. For instance, wireless
    capsules used for endoscopy consume up to 10 times more power than the sensors
    [254]. Such excessive power consumption is a drawback, and thus new solutions
    for tiny and low heat-radiation in-body and on-body devices are needed and they
    should be capable of battery-free operation with smart networking. WPN-BCs, without
    any active RF components, can be regarded as an innovative communication modality
    to meet these requirements [255]. The low-powered architecture of WPN-BCs can
    be well-suited for not only capturing sensory data but also transmitting it over
    short distances. Some further applications in healthcare are information registry,
    emergency evaluation, health monitoring and lab analysis [255]. Moreover, wireless-powered
    backscatter-based localization systems can also be a potential technology to facilitate
    social distancing, which may be necessary due to COVID-19 [256]. In the context
    of healthcare applications, WPN-BCs may help with energy management, latency minimization,
    mobility management and cost optimization, which are some of the critical system-level
    objectives. B. WPN-BCs for Smart Homes/Cities In a smart home, a large number
    of passive backscatter tags sensors can be deployed at flexible locations (e.g.,
    embedded in walls, roof, and furniture). These passive tags can be powered by
    either multiple in-house deployed PBs or ambient sources such as Wi-Fi access
    points, TV towers, or cellular BSs. These tags can perform a wide range of activities
    such as gas leakage/smoke detection, monitoring movements, indoor positioning,
    and surveillance. On the other hand, in a smart city, a large number of passive
    tags, energized with the ambient sources, can be deployed in buildings, streets,
    bridges, and parking spaces to improve the quality of life. Passive tags can also
    monitor air/noise pollution, traffic, and parking availability [257]. SECTION
    VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Based on our review of recent efforts
    and publications in the field of WPN-BCs, herein, we discuss some open problems
    that require further research attention and specifically ones pertaining to large-scale
    WPN-BCs. A. Interference Management A critical system issue is the interference
    resulting from wireless-powered networks with ambient backscatter on licensed
    users, especially when there are high-rate users. Moreover, for large-scale WPN-BCs,
    massive numbers of devices in close proximity may result in mutual interference
    among them. Therefore, one can investigate sophisticated interference avoidance
    and suppression techniques to not only take care of the communication needs of
    licensed users but also to manage the interference issues in large-scale WPN-BCs
    to guarantee reliable communications with sufficiently high rates. B. Channel
    Coding Schemes As discussed before, backscatter communications could be integrated
    with emerging technologies, e.g., full-duplex, MIMO, CRNs, relays and others.
    Therefore, this integration needs coding and decoding schemes. New OSTBC schemes
    should thus be developed for MIMO backscatter links and their performances should
    be analyzed and quantified. Moreover, well-known error correcting codes, e.g.,
    low density parity check (LDPC) codes and low complexity polar codes, which are
    primarily designed for high-end devices with active radios, may be used with WPN-BCs
    to enable reliable transmission with high data rates [110]. The adoption of these
    codes in power-constrained and low-complexity backscatter tags, the encoder and
    decoder, entails several practical challenges that needs further investigations.
    C. Artificial Intelligence Based Approaches Artificial intelligence techniques
    have recently been vigorously considered for signal processing and communications.
    For instance, deep learning is a powerful tool to extract key features of communication
    systems, e.g., signals, channels, modulation/demodulation schemes and hence it
    can be effectively employed to address many problems in large-scale wireless communication
    systems [199]–[201], [205]. Deep learning approaches to address the challenge
    of CSI sensing and recovery in large dimensional WPN-BCs need further investigations.
    Besides, channel coding algorithms based on deep learning can be well adopted
    in large-scale WPN-BCs. Moreover, in multi-antenna systems, the optimal antenna
    subset selection (e.g., see [258], [259]) problem can be interpreted as a multi-class
    classification and/or decision-making task, which is readily solvable via machine
    learning. Multi-class classifier algorithms are the k-nearest neighbours (k-NN)
    and support vector machine (SVM), Naive–Bayes (NB) and others [260], [261]. These
    may improve the design and optimization of complex and dynamic wireless communication
    systems. D. Multiple-Access Schemes and Protocols In WPN-BCs with a large number
    of devices, high capacity should be offered to not just a single node but as many
    nodes as possible, simultaneously. Through efficient multiple access techniques,
    a large number of devices could be served and at the same time, the interference
    between the devices could be handled and suppressed. Moreover, WPN-BCs require
    new communication protocols to coordinate RF energy and backscatter communications
    together. In particular, decentralized MAC protocols where the nodes are communicating
    in a distributed way need further investigations. To this end, cooperation among
    devices, tag-selection [30], and scheduling algorithms guaranteeing fairness are
    important issues to be addressed. E. Physical Layer Security Provision of network
    security is one of key components of 6G communication networks. Therefore, enabling
    secure WPN-BCs, as an innovative technology to realize 6G visions, is of great
    importance. However, the security aspects of such systems are only marginally
    studied in the existing works. Thus, we must identify effective strategies to
    implement physical security to prevent the vulnerability of different types of
    attacks, e.g., interference attack, denial of service attack, and eavesdropping
    attacks. F. UAV-Aided Large-Scale WPN-BCs Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [262]
    have the potential to provide wireless connectivity to remote locations due to
    their mobility, and hence, UAV-enabled backscatter communications have been recently
    investigated [263], [264]. For large-scale backscatter sensors, UAVs can help
    to ease the channel estimation process and also to assist data transmission. It
    is shown that, UAVs can act not only as data aggregators but also RF signal emitters
    enabling fast data aggregation and energy transfer at remote locations [262].
    Therefore, the integration of UAVs with WPN-BCs is a worthy future research direction
    to facilitate large-scale communication networks. Joint optimization of UAV location,
    time allocation and reflection coefficient, subject to the UAV mobility and practical
    harvest-backscatter constraints need to be investigated to enhance the performance
    of the large-scale WPN-BCs. SECTION VII. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented
    a comprehensive literature survey on wireless-powered networks with backscatter
    communications, as a key enabler for large-scale low-power and low-cost wireless
    communications. First, we introduced the concepts of wireless-powered communication
    networks and backscatter communication systems. We next focused on their integrated
    usage and applications with the emphasis on large-scale wireless communication
    networks. We have reviewed the fundamentals and design issues of WPN-BCs including
    modulation, channel coding, waveform and energy harvester design and deployment
    of such networks. We have also reviewed recent efforts and existing approaches
    to enhance the performance of WPN-BCs. Furthermore, the emerging technologies
    for wireless-powered backscatter systems have been discussed. We have also highlighted
    some applications of this innovative technology. Finally, we have addressed some
    practical open research problems and future research directions. Authors Figures

    Survey

    the advantages of both techniques and can actually be the solution to build up
    totally passive massive WSNs [69]. They complement each other to overcome the
    challenges of each technology, thereby leading to considerable improvements in
    the performance of large-scale dense IoT deployments, i.e., increased range and

  analysis: The paper proposes a method for improving the coexistence of Unlicensed
    Long-Term Evolution (U-LTE) with Wi-Fi/IoT in the 5 GHz band using cognitive radio.
    It presents a system model to utilize the attributes of cognitive radio for optimal
    U-LTE operation in the U-NII band, addressing the mandatory Listen-Before-Talk
    (LBT) requirement in regions like Europe, Japan, and India. The method avoids
    interference to primary Wi-Fi/IoT users while enabling fair spectrum sharing.
    Simulation results in a MatLab-based model validate the proposed method, demonstrating
    reduced back-off rates for Wi-Fi/IoT signals and fair and friendly channel sharing
    between U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT systems. The paper contributes to addressing the point
    by providing a novel approach to achieving coexistence in the 5 GHz band, focusing
    on the identification of idle spectrum and communication without causing interference
    to primary users.

    evolution (LTE) that presently operates in licensed spectrum has been extended
    to unlicensed LTE (U-LTE) to improve data rate and spectral efficiency by utilizing
    unlicensed spectrum. Carrier aggregation of 3GPPLTE-A supports the aggregation
    of licensed and unlicensed spectrum in small and femto cells to provide better
    user experience. The proposed work consists of two objectives, first to accomplish
    the listen-before-talk (LBT) regulatory requirement of radio communication in
    U-LTE and the second to enhance their co-existence with Wi-Fi/IoT users in a non-interference
    style by reducing the back-off rate of Wi-Fi. The importance of spectrum utilization
    by the incumbent users of unlicensed band for the upcoming Internet of Things
    communications is also a key consideration in this work. The recently evolved
    intelligent technology viz. Cognitive radio (CR) is applied in the proposed system
    model to meet the objectives. A ground research is done in a simulation environment
    of LTE signals and 5 GHz band to evaluate the back-off rate of Wi-Fi. A comparative
    performance analysis between proposed and existing systems are also done and presented
    in this paper. Similar content being viewed by others LTE/Wi-Fi Coexistence in

    An Opportunistic Coexistence Analysis of LTE and Wi-Fi in Unlicensed 5 GHz Frequency
    Band Article 13 March 2023 1 Introduction LTE networks are carrying increasing
    amount of data. Reducing the cell size to meet the data demand is not the complete
    solution and the need for more spectrums still exists. The usage of unlicensed
    spectrum alongside licensed bands provides an attractive opportunity for LTE operators
    to satisfy their subscribers’ data demand. Unlicensed LTE (U-LTE) is most interested
    in enabling its access in 5GHz ISM unlicensed band. The reason is quite simple
    as several hundred MHz of spectrum bandwidth is available in 5GHz. One main constraint
    for accessing these frequencies is being able to coexist with other Wi-Fi/IoT
    users i.e. listen before talk (LBT) is required. In this paper, the proposed work
    realizes the LBT requirement of U-LTE with the usage of cognitive radio (CR).
    The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives the
    overview of U-LTE, its evolution and open issues in co-existence with 5GHz band.
    Section 3 describes the features of Cognitive Radio Networks, its compliance with
    5GHz band and spectrum sensing techniques. Section 4 summarizes the existing related
    works of proposed system. Section 5 presents the formulated proposed system and
    followed by simulation architecture and results in Sect. 6. The outcome of proposed
    work is concluded in Sect. 7. 2 Unlicensed- LTE (U-LTE) 2.1 Need for U-LTE The
    3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [1] got inspired to function on fourth-generation
    (4G) mobile namely LTE to meet the very high data usage by recently evolved multimedia
    applications. 3GPP releases R13 and R14 [2, 3] includes LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) and
    narrow band-IoT (NB-IoT). Also 3GPP release 15 concentrates on LTE-Advanced Pro
    with a data rate of 3Gbps and bandwidth of 640MHz [4]. Besides ultra mobile broadband
    and WiMax (IEEE 802.16), LTE competes with several other 4G standards. Followed
    by the US government approval of the first “LTE-U” devices, T-Mobile USA is ready
    to deploy over 5GHz frequencies [5]. High data rate, low latency, packet optimized
    radio-access technology and flexible bandwidth are the main goals of LTE. Also,
    its network architecture too supports packet-switched traffic with persistent
    mobility and high quality of service. Anyhow, the cellular operators are limited
    by the allocation of licensed frequency spectrum. Qualcomm, Huawei and Ericsson
    influenced the 3GPP standards committee to allow LTE service to run on the 5 GHz
    band. This 5 GHz band is one of two unlicensed bands that are typically used by
    Wi-Fi service. 5 GHz is the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)
    band and since it is relatively less congested, when compared to the common 2.4
    GHz ISM band and because new software has been developed to make the various signals
    play nice within a shared spectrum band, U-LTE in the 5GHz band is winning acceptance.
    5 GHz band has a shorter communication range due to higher path loss but has wider
    available bandwidth. Figure 1 shows the unlicensed spectrum layout in several
    different main regions at 5 GHz band [1]. Fig. 1 Unlicensed spectrum in different
    regions Full size image 2.2 Carrier aggregation in U-LTE The first design principle
    of U-LTE is the integration with licensed spectrum [6]. The integration between
    unlicensed and licensed carriers both operating LTE is the key operating mechanism.
    The carrier aggregation (CA) mechanisms defined in LTE Rel-10 to Rel-12 can serve
    this purpose in target scenarios. Several spectrums are aggregated to create large
    “virtual” career bandwidths to support LTE services, which is the key feature
    of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). For commercial purpose, operators deploy CA as the prime
    feature of LTE-A. The current bandwidth (up to 20 MHz) of LTE got enhanced by
    this CA and as well as it ensures the backward compatibility. The users also get
    benefits in terms of high data rates and increased average data rates. CA enables
    the combination of up to five LTE Release 8 (Rel-8) compatible carriers [7]. The
    licensed LTE carriers are Primary carriers and unlicensed carriers are Secondary
    carriers. Since the secondary carriers are under the control of primary in situations
    like load shifting and channel adaption, the security and service QoS are ensured.
    Moreover, control plane messages are always transmitted on the licensed band and
    thus QoS is ensured. The user-plane data can be transmitted on either licensed
    or unlicensed carriers. 2.3 5 GHz band and Wi-Fi/IoT usage The internet of things
    (IoT) or machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is one of the most exciting and
    fastest growing technologies across the globe today. It employs the embedded technology
    with sensors and actuators, connects to other devices or to cloud, and automatically
    transmits information. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Active RFID, loWPAN, EtherCAT,
    NFC, RFID, etc. are the standards and proprietary solutions used by the devices
    to connect among themselves as well as with cloud [8]. Based on the physical characteristics
    of the environment and presence of obstacles like wood, concrete, metal, etc.
    the volume of sensors, their range and data rates, the technology used to connect
    the devices will be chosen. Wi-Fi has been the most successful among these technologies
    listed above due its adaptability, scalability, ease of use and cost. In view
    of its advantages, Wi-Fi has become a ubiquitous standard of connectivity and
    is used in the residential building, commercial enterprises, educational institutions,
    hospitals, airports etc. As the 2.4GHz band is meant for unlicensed users, it
    is presently heavily crowded and hence, the IoT device communication and Wi-Fi
    are shifting to less crowded 5 GHz band. Therefore, it is necessary to safe guard
    the 5 GHz band for its incumbent users viz. IoT and Wi-Fi. In this perspective,
    the proposed work addresses the importance of saving 5 GHz band for the next generation
    wireless communications. 2.4 Coexistence features Due to non-exclusive usage nature
    of unlicensed spectrum by U-LTE, there are two main challenges. The foremost challenge
    of design of U-LTE is its coexistence with Wi-Fi/IoT systems on a fair and friendly
    basis. The Wi-Fi/IoT systems are the user-deployed systems and they are the incumbent
    users or primary users of the unlicensed band. The PHY/MAC implementation differences
    between LTE transmissions and Wi-Fi/IoT, hinders the direct implementation of
    U-LTE transmissions as it can generate continuous interference to Wi-Fi/IoT systems.
    Second is the coexistence of two or more different U-LTE operators in the same
    unlicensed band. The operation in unlicensed band also needs to factor in the
    regulatory requirements of a given region. In some markets, like Europe, Japan
    and India, a specific waveform requirement on supporting listen-before-talk (LBT)
    at milliseconds scale is required which would need changes in LTE air interface.
    In other markets, like US, Korea and China, there are no such requirements. In
    these countries, with carefully designed coexistence mechanisms realizable by
    software to ensure peaceful coexistence with Wi-Fi/IoT, operators can deploy LTE
    in unlicensed bands that are compatible with Rel. 10/11 3GPP LTE standards. In
    markets where LBT is required, LTE in unlicensed operation can be further optimized
    through air interface enhancement with the introduction of LBT feature potentially
    in 3GPP Release 13 [9, 10]. Number of PHY/MAC modifications is required to meet
    regulatory requirements in LBT regions. The required modifications are defined
    in LTE release 13 and beyond, providing a standard LBT mechanism for LTE to coexist
    with Wi-Fi/IoT and other access technologies within the unlicensed bands. Especially,
    LTE PHY/MAC enhancements are required to meet the functionalities such as clear
    channel assessment, discontinuous transmission (DTX) with limited maximum transmission
    duration, UE support for carrier selection and modified HARQ protocol to enable
    LBT. In summary, it may be arrived that besides Qualcomm, Nokia and Huawei, researchers
    have not addressed the coexistence issue for U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT extensively.
    3 Cognitive radio networks 3.1 Features of CRN CR is defined by the Federal Communication
    Commission (FCC) as the radio that is capable of changing its transmission parameters
    as it interact with the environment that it operates on [11]. Increase in high
    data rate requirements has results in increase in wireless communications. The
    inefficacious allocation of frequencies in licensed band leaves white spaces in
    the spectrum while the cellular bands are overloaded [12]. For effective utilization
    of spectrum and also to meet the spectrum demands, FCC revisited the problem of
    spectrum management [13] and this leads to CR invention. The IEEE 802.22 is the
    standard for cognitive wireless regional area networks (WRANs). The main goal
    of CR is to identify the unused licensed spectrum for secondary users (SU) without
    interfering Primary Users (PU) and this method of sharing is often called as Dynamic
    Spectrum Access (DSA). 3.2 Cognitive radio in 5GHz band Cognitive radio is the
    key technology that can enhance the convergence of next-generation wireless devices
    those operate in IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 standards. The flexibility in the
    hardware and its feasibility to program for a band or mode enables CR to adapt
    over to an ISM band or up to an IEEE band and even to unlicensed 5GHz bands. In
    5GHz band, two types of networks are considered to be operating, primary and secondary
    or cognitive radio networks (CRN). The incumbent users of 5GHz such as regular
    Wi-Fi users and IoT communications operate the primary network. The cognitive
    radio networks only access the spectral band not used by the primary band. Each
    CRN can be made to use multiple channels for better performance by adopting modulation
    schemes using software defined radio (SDR) devices such as Universal Software
    Defined Radio Peripheral (USRP). Therefore, CR dynamically monitors certain bands
    of the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum to identify the idle spectrum and uses them as
    needed [14]. 3.3 Future of CR In future of internet of things (IoT), the fact
    is that billions of objects are expected to be interconnected through wireless
    results in huge volume of traffic with high demand in spectrum [15, 16]. The spectrum
    is finite in nature and becoming rare and expensive. As a result of it, the IoT
    paradigm requires the innovative CR paradigm to go hand in hand to meet the demands
    of spectrum. Also, based on the approaches of the dynamic use of frequencies pursued
    to provide high spectral efficiency, CR fits itself to support 5G networks. CR
    principles can be incorporated to enable the spectral coexistence of two or more
    than two heterogeneous wireless networks in different dimensions such as time,
    frequency, spatial, polarization, and geographical space through cognitive beam
    forming, cognitive interference alignment, adaptive power control, carrier aggregation,
    dynamic carrier/bandwidth allocation. 3.4 Sensing techniques The various parameters
    of spectrum such as radio channel characteristics, white spaces, transmit power;
    interference, noise and operating environment are sensed and measured by the spectrum
    [17]. Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is done for two purposes.
    One is to identify the spectrum opportunities (white spaces), other to detect
    the interference in the spectrum. White space detection is done by non-cooperative
    approach (also known as Primary transmitter method) and Cooperative/collaborative
    approach. Non-cooperative approach includes match filter based detection, energy
    based detection, covariant-based detection, cyclostationary-based detection, waveform
    based detection, etc. In cooperative/collaborative approach, a primary user is
    detected based on collective information from multiple cognitive radio users.
    This approach includes either centralized access to the spectrum coordinated by
    a spectrum server or distributed approach [18]. Interference temperature detection
    and primary receiver detection are the other interference based sensing approaches.
    In former method, secondary users are allowed to coexist with primary with low
    transmission power and monitored by the interference temperature level. The second
    method detects the interference based on the primary receiver’s local oscillator
    leakage power. 4 Related works Extensive research has proved that CR is the promising
    technology to improve the spectrum utilization/sharing in an opportunistic manner.
    Few researches have adopted CR to enhance the spectrum sharing in femto cells
    of LTE/LTE-A networks [19, 20]. In such research works femto cells are made cognitive
    to improve the QoS parameters. In [21] authors have studied the Type 2 sensing
    (interference detection) for single-input single-output system of LTE-Advanced
    network. They use conventional energy detection method to sense the spectrum in
    cognitive radio technology and no innovative methods are introduced. Alternative
    methods to sense spectrum is still an open issue for research. The authors in
    [22] analyses the throughput (THR) with changing bandwidth in LTE-A environment,
    Path-loss (PL), the effect of distance between the macro user and femto cell on
    Signal-interference noise ratio (SINR) using cognitive radio. In [23], the authors
    have focused on improving resource efficiency in LTE network by considering CR
    device to device (D2D) communication links. In [24, 25], the quality of service
    (QoS) maximization requirement for secondary users in CRN built upon 3GPP LTE
    platform was experimented. All these research works have tried to cognitize the
    LTE/LTE-A femto cell to improve their efficiency in terms of throughput, spectrum
    sharing, spectrum utilizations, etc. and however no attempt was made to apply
    CR in U-LTE. Co-existence of U-LTE/LTE-A networks with existing wireless networks
    is regarded as the latest paradigms. A considerable research has done to reduce
    the interference level of U-LTE/LTE-A to Wi-Fi users. In early U-LTE with non-LBT
    feature, Qualcomm [9] proposed Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) with
    TDM cycle sharing mechanism for coexistence of U-LTE signals with other existing
    wireless technologies. This method resulted in increased delay perceived by U-LTE
    users. Qualcomm has also done the design modifications to meet LBT requirements
    using Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) method and has proven better results. In
    our previous work [26], the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi in unlicensed 5 GHz
    band in non-LBT fashion was studied. The simulation results proved the unfair
    sharing of spectrum between them. Hence, in this proposed work, considering the
    Indian market scenario, where LBT requirement is mandatory for coexistence of
    U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT, the basic feature of CCA is combined with CR for effective
    protection of incumbent Wi-Fi user’s performance and presented in the proceeding
    sections. The Wi-Fi/IoT communications are considered as primary network. The
    U-LTE is the secondary or CRN, which access the idle spectrum of 5GHz when not
    used by Wi-Fi/IoT users. Yet another open issue is the Co-existence of several
    U-LTE operators named as inter-operator spectrum sharing. In this scenario the
    unlicensed spectrum need to be shared among inter operators as well as with incumbent
    users of unlicensed band. However, such is issue is beyond the scope of this paper
    and presented only to serve the purpose of literature review. 5 Cognitive radio
    in U-LTE 5.1 System model The proposed system is so modeled that it utilizes the
    attributes of the CR to optimally operate U-LTE in U-NII band (5 GHz). As LBT
    feature is mandatory in regions like Europe, Japan and India, an efficient mechanism
    is to be devised to share the unlicensed spectrum with Wi-Fi, the primary users
    of the specified band in a non-interference basis and also paving the way for
    the currently evolving IoT or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. In Fig.
    2, the deployment scenario of U-LTE along with Wi-Fi/IoT users is shown. User
    equipment (UEs) and IoT devices, by communicating with Wi-Fi access point (AP)
    using the unlicensed spectrum, form a femto cell and become primary users. During
    their communications with eNodeB (eNB), UEs form a small cell and try to utilize
    the unlicensed spectrum and become secondary users. As mentioned earlier, U-LTE
    operates in two modes: supplemental downlink (SDL) and time division duplex (TDD).
    In SDL mode, the unlicensed spectrum is used only for downlink traffic. Operations
    such as ensuring reliable communications, checking availability of intended unlicensed
    channel are performed by eNB node [27]. Fig. 2 Deployment scenario of U-LTE with
    Wi-Fi/IoT users Full size image For TDD mode, the unlicensed spectrum is used
    for uplink and downlink, resulting additional implementation complexity in UEs
    for LBT feature. Latest release of 3GPP LTE standard Rel.13 supports usage of
    unlicensed spectrum in both operating modes [10]. In this work, SDL mode is considered
    and the eNB is equipped with CR for the purposes of detecting idle spectrum and
    communicating without causing interferences to primary users. The proposed method
    of applying CR features in U-LTE for effective utilization of 5 GHz band is given
    in Fig. 3. The request for data transmission from eNB triggers the CR to identify
    the white space or the clean channel by sensing the spectrum. Upon the successful
    identification of the clean channel, downlink transmissions take place between
    the terminal devices. The channel can be occupied for a fixed time named as Channel
    Occupancy Time (CCT) for 10 ms as stated by ETSI standards [28]. To comply with
    the demands of U-LTE and to facilitate the coexistence of them with incumbent
    users in a non-interference basis, CR senses the spectrum at regular intervals
    to cater their needs by allocating idle spectrum until the end of their transmissions.
    Fig. 3 System model Full size image The usage pattern by U-LTE users varies from
    few milliseconds, hours or days in multiples of CCT slots and considered as long
    lasting opportunities. However, there are also short-lasting opportunities where
    spectral idleness will expire before the usage by the U-LTE. But this study focuses
    only on spectrum opportunities lasting at least for few seconds. 5.2 Channel and
    traffic model Considering DSA network of CR, the following are the assumptions
    made to formulate the channel and traffic model [29]. 1. The U-NII band spectrum
    is divided into C identical channels shared by primary and secondary users. The
    channels are assumed to be perfect i.e. they are either busy or free. 2. Newly
    arriving requests from primary or secondary will be allocated a free channel,
    if available. If they do not find a free channel, they back off. 3. For a primary/secondary
    user i, the channel is occupied for a period and available for a period \(T_{Busy}^{(i)}\)
    and available for a period \(T_{free}^{(i)}\). 4. Primary and secondary users
    make requests for channel according to Poisson process with arrival rate \(\uplambda
    \hbox {p}\) and \(\uplambda \)sand they hold the channel for a time, which is
    exponentially distributed with mean \(1/\upmu \hbox {p}\) and 1/ \(\upmu \hbox
    {s}\) respectively. 5. p is the number of primary users with transmission time
    \(\upmu \hbox {p}\). s is the number of secondary users with transmission time
    \(\upmu \hbox {s}\). Their transition rate is defined as p\(\upmu \hbox {p}\)
    and s \(\upmu \hbox {s}\). 6. At any instant of time t, let s (t) and p (t) be
    the number of channels occupied by secondary and primary. 7. When primary and
    secondary users occupy p and s channels, a new arrival of primary request can
    occupy any one of the (C-p-s) channels. 8. When primary and secondary users occupy
    p and s channels, a new arrival of secondary request can occupy any one of the
    (C-p-s) channels. The probability that user i (primary / secondary) occupy the
    channel is given by $$\begin{aligned} T_{i}=\frac{T_{Busy}^{(i)}}{T_{Busy}^{(i)}-T_{free}^{(i)}}
    \end{aligned}$$ (1) The channel occupancy in the U-NII spectrum can be modeled
    using Markov chain. Let \(\Phi \) denotes the set of feasible states where \(\Phi
    = \{(\hbox {s, p}) {\vert } \hbox {s} \ge 0, \hbox {p} \ge 0\) and \(\hbox {s}
    + \le \hbox {C}\}\), \(\upphi (\hbox {s, p}) = 1\), if (s, p) \(\upvarepsilon
    \quad \Phi \) and \(\upphi \hbox {(s, p)} =0\) otherwise. The steady state probability
    of the channel occupancy is given by $$\begin{aligned} P(s,p)=\lim \nolimits _{t
    \rightarrow \infty }\hbox {Pr}\{s(t)=s,p(t)=p\} \end{aligned}$$ (2) Fig. 4 Channel
    occupancy state transition for \(\hbox {s}+\hbox {p}<\hbox {C}\) Full size image
    The balance equation for the channel occupancy state transitions as shown in Fig.
    4 can be formulated as $$\begin{aligned}&[\hbox {p} \upmu _{\mathrm{p}}+ \hbox
    {s} \mathop \upmu \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}+ \hbox {(C-p-s)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits
    _{\mathrm{p}}+ \hbox {(C-p-s)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}] \hbox
    {P(s,p)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p)}\nonumber \\&= \hbox {(p+1)} \mathop \upmu \nolimits
    _{\mathrm{p}}\hbox {P(s,p+1)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p+1)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \;\hbox
    {(s+1)} \mathop \upmu \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}\hbox {P(s+1, p)} \upphi \hbox {(s+1,
    p)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \;\hbox {(C-s-p+1)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{p}}\hbox
    {P(s, p-1)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p-1)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \; \hbox {(C-s-p)} \mathop
    \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}\hbox {P(s-1, p)} \upphi \hbox {(s-1, p)} \end{aligned}$$
    (3) P(s,p) also satisfies the normalization condition, $$\begin{aligned} \mathop
    \sum \nolimits _{p=0}^{C} \mathop \sum \nolimits _{s=0}^{C} P(s,p)\phi (s,p)=1
    \end{aligned}$$ (4) Thus P(s,p) can be obtained, \(\forall (s,p)\in \phi \). The
    probability that a newly arriving primary or secondary is blocked is the probability
    that all the C channels are occupied. Thus the back off probability P back off
    is given by $$\begin{aligned} P_{backoff}=\sum _{p\,=\,0}^{C} \sum _{s\,=\,0}^{C}
    P(s,p) \Psi (s+p=c) \end{aligned}$$ (5) Where \(\psi (f (s, p))\)is an indicator
    function i.e. \(\psi (f (s, p)) =1\)if f(s, p) holds and \(\psi (f (s, p)) =0\)
    otherwise. 6 Simulation The system model is simulated in compliance to Rel. 13
    3GPP LTE standards using Mat Lab showing the coexistence of U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT
    in 5 GHz band ranging from 5.0 to 5.3 GHz, 23 channels each with assumed bandwidth
    of 20MHz. For comparison purpose, the coexistence of U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT in 5
    GHz band without LBT feature is also simulated and shown. The following sections
    describe the simulation models for both coexistence mechanisms without LBT and
    with LBT along with their simulation results and comparison. A real-time Wi-Fi
    user traffic was collected and used as input data set. On observing real-time
    LTE traffic, LTE signals were generated to match their energy level. Both LTE
    and Wi-Fi signals are fed into the system in a random fashion to enact the real-time
    environment. The network scenario shown in Fig. 2 with SDL mode is considered.
    The network is assumed with macro cells of eNB nodes and picocells with Wi-Fi
    access points (APs). The system under test is evaluated with increase in number
    of users for both Wi-Fi and LTE. The values of the parameters considered to obtain
    the simulation results are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Simulation parameters Full
    size table Fig. 5 Block diagram of channel allocation in non-LBT scenario without
    cognitive radio Full size image 6.1 Coexistence of LTE with Wi-Fi / IoT without
    LBT The block diagram for simulating the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT without
    LBT is shown in Fig. 5. Two separate sources, one for LTE and other for Wi-Fi/IoT
    generates multiple signals in random fashion with respective energy and transmission
    time. The Channel allocation system allocates the available free channels for
    the successful transmission between respective source and sink. The U-LTE and
    Wi-Fi/IoT systems occupies the available free channel, transmits for its respective
    time duration and leaves the channel free making it available for other contenting
    LTE or Wi-Fi/IoT sources. But, LTE systems, being high demand in nature, and with
    long communication duration, occupies the channels and seldom leaves. Since Wi-Fi
    systems adopt a contention based medium access control (MAC) protocol with random
    back off mechanism, it finds the medium busy most of the time, resulting in high
    back off rate. Considering a smallcell / femtocell, the number of users assumed
    to be minimum of 10 and maximum of 500. The two scenarios depicting coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT without LBT at different continuous instances of time
    for 100 users are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 6, the channel occupancy status
    during the initial time span of 100 ms is shown. During that time, 13 channels
    out of 23 are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT signals and the remaining 10 channels are
    occupied by U-LTE signals. Therefore, channels of U-NII band have been occupied
    almost fairly by U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT systems during the initial phase of channel
    allocation. Fig. 6 Scenario 1: initial channel occupancy status between Wi-Fi
    and U_LTE signals in Non-LBT Full size image Figure 7 depicts the channel occupancy
    status at later time after 200 ms. Here, only eight channels are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT
    signals whereas remaining 15 are occupied by U-LTE signals. Due to high demand
    nature of LTE, the channels are occupied by them leaves no space for Wi-Fi systems
    and hence they results in high back off rate. Fig. 7 Scenario 2: Channel occupancy
    status with increased number of U-LTE signals in Non-LBT Full size image The simulation
    was studied with different number of users ranging from 10, 20, and 30 up to 500
    in order to analyze the back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals. The average back off
    rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals is almost 50% higher than LTE with increase in number
    of users and is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Back off rate of LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT signals

    in LBT scenario with application of cognitive radio Full size image 6.2 Coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi / IoT with LBT using CR system The block diagram for simulating
    the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT with LBT using CR is shown in Fig. 9.
    As similar to non-LBT simulation system, there are two separate sources, one for
    LTE and other for Wi-Fi/IoT generating multiple signals in random fashion with
    respective energy and transmission time. Due to the application of CR in this
    system model, Wi-Fi/IoT systems are considered as the primary users and U-LTE
    systems as secondary users. Incoming signals from Wi-Fi/IoT sources occupy the
    channels by following their own MAC protocol by means of Channel allocation system.
    Whereas, U-LTE signals, in order to accomplish LBT feature, they follows the ETSI
    standards [28] for channel occupancy through CR system. The CR system assumed
    to be in the LTE access point, on getting a transmission request from LTE source,
    identifies the white space (free channel) in U-NII band and estimates the clear
    channel assessment (CCA) threshold. CCA threshold is estimated by measuring the
    energy level of the free channel for a listening period of \(20 \, \upmu \hbox
    {s}\). If the energy level in the channel is below -80 dBm for the listening period
    of \(20 \,\upmu \hbox {s}\), considering it as low interference level in the channel
    and assumed to be free. The Channel is then allocated for the U-LTE signal transmissions
    for the duration equal to Channel Occupancy Time of 10 ms. After that, if LTE
    source wishes to continue its transmission, it has to repeat the white space detection
    and CCA process for channel allocation. On every channel request and allocation
    process, the Channel Occupancy time for LTE source is maximum 10 ms. Therefore,
    the above process is repeated until LTE source completes with its transmission.
    On every cycle, the channel allocated for LTE transmissions is different or same
    based on the free channel availability. The two scenarios depicting coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT with LBT using CR at different continuous instances of
    time for 100 users are shown in Figs. 10 and 11. In Fig. 10, the channel occupancy
    status during the initial time span of 100ms is shown. During that time, 13 channels
    out of 23 are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT signals and the remaining ten channels are
    occupied by U-LTE signals. Therefore, channels of U-NII band have been occupied
    almost fairly by U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT systems during the initial phase of channel
    allocation. Fig. 10 Scenario 1: initial channel occupancy status between Wi-Fi
    and U_LTE in LBT using CR Full size image Figure 11 depicts the channel occupancy
    status at later time after 200 ms. Here, Wi-Fi/IoT signals occupy 15 channels
    and 8 by U-LTE signals. The channel occupancy measure of Wi-Fi/IoT systems is
    almost same as that of an earlier time span. Maintaining almost the same channel
    occupancy status even after the later time span depicts the fair and friendly
    sharing of channels between Wi-Fi/IoT and U-LTE signals. This leads to the reduced
    back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT systems. Fig. 11 Scenario 2: initial channel occupancy
    status between Wi-Fi and U_LTE in LBT using CR Full size image The simulation
    was studied with different number of users ranging from 10, 20, and 30 up to 500
    in order to analyze the back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals. The average back off
    rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals is almost equivalent to LTE and they were maintained
    at minimum level even with increased number of users and are shown in Fig. 12.

    size image 7 Performance comparison The proposed system has been evaluated and
    the performance is compared with three other existing methods. The comparison
    results of four scenarios are presented in Fig. 13. The performance in terms of
    channel utilization is analyzed for an average of 100 users in the network. In
    Fig. 13 for scenario 1, the channel utilization is equal for U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT
    users. In scenario 2, without LBT, Wi-Fi/IoT users are severely deferred by the
    U-LTE users and the channel utilization is reduced to 36% of scenario 1. Fig.
    13 Performance comparison of and LBT (CR with existing techniques Full size image
    Furthermore, implementing TDM cycling and CCA for coexistence mechanisms are shown
    in scenario 3 and 4. Though the channel utilization percentage of Wi-Fi/IoT users
    in those scenarios got increased to 50% of scenario 1, the LTE users are dominating
    the network and the Wi-Fi back off rate is still prominent. Hence, performance
    of scenario 1 can be appreciated as it proves the fair and friendly sharing nature
    of LTE in the unlicensed band by occupying the spectrum at its free time, without
    causing interference and denying the space for the incumbent Wi-Fi users. 8 Conclusion
    The spectrum utilization of radio frequencies is gaining momentum due to the invasion
    of wireless equipment in every field of human life. In this regard, there is a
    change over from licensed LTE to U-LTE in view of the evident advantages of later
    in terms of speed, cost etc. An improved method is proposed in this work to include
    CR in U-LTE for effective utilization of the white spaces in the radio spectrum.
    Also, the importance of saving 5GHz band for the next generation wireless communications
    is addressed by utilizing the spectrum in fair and friendly basis. The basic attributes
    of channel searching and channel allocation are utilized in this work to optimize
    the functionality of U-LTE in terms of clean channel searching and co-existence
    of secondary users with primary users. The simulation results of coexistence of
    U-LTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed 5 GHz band in LBT fashion is presented to support
    the fair and friendly sharing of spectrum between them. In this work, only SDL
    mode is considered, where the unlicensed spectrum is used for downlink traffic
    alone. In future work, the utilization of unlicensed spectrum for both uplink
    and downlink traffic will be considered and the coexistence of U-LTE along with
    incumbent users in such scenarios will be studied. The size and the cost of implementing
    CR in UEs raise the challenges to realize the LBT feature and are under future
    research. 9 Future reference In this work, only SDL mode is considered, where
    the unlicensed spectrum is used for downlink traffic alone. In future work, the
    utilization of unlicensed spectrum for both uplink and downlink traffic will be
    considered and the coexistence of U-LTE along with incumbent users in such scenarios
    will be studied. The size and the cost of implementing CR in UEs raise the challenges
    to realize the LBT feature and are under future research. Moreover, in contrast
    to the above work, CR s can be endowed as “brain” in IoT devices to enable them
    to choose the best segments of the network and best frequency bands. Their ability
    to adapt its internal radio parameters to avoid capacity and congestion issues
    caused by environmental changes ensures to provide optimal service to end-users.

    \ of frequency spectrum, along \nwith the fixed spectrum allocation adopted policy,\
    \ has led to a \ndire shortage of this indispensable resource. Furthermore, with\
    \ \nthe tremendous growth of wireless applications, this problem is \nintensified\
    \ as the unlicensed frequency spectrum becomes \novercrowded and unable to meet\
    \ the requirement of emerging \nradio devices operating at higher data rates.\
    \ Additionally, the \nalready assigned spectrum is underutilized. That has prompted\
    \ \nresearchers to look for a way to address spectrum scarcity and \nenable efficient\
    \ use of the available spectrum. In this context, \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\
    \ has been proposed as a \npotential means to overcome this issue by introducing\
    \ \nopportunistic usage to less congested portions of the licensed \nspectrum.\
    \ In addition to outlining the fundamentals of Cognitive \nRadio, including Dynamic\
    \ Spectrum Access (DSA) paradigms \nand CR functions, this paper has a three-fold\
    \ objective: first, \nproviding an overview of Software Defined Radio (SDR), in\

    \ second, giving an extensive review of spectrum \nsensing, covering sensing types,\

    \ IoT. This Review is elaborated in \nan informative fashion to help new researchers\
    \ entering the area \nof Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) to easily get involved.\
    \ \nKeywords—Cognitive radio; cognitive radio networks; software \ndefined radio;\
    \ spectrum sensing; machine learning; CR-based IoT \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe radiofrequency\
    \ spectrum represents a scarce and finite \nresource that is used for transmitting\
    \ information in the radio \nenvironment. This resource is used by several services,\
    \ \nincluding radiocommunication, radio broadcasting, maritime \nradio, and satellite\
    \ communications. \nAt the national level, the assignment of this spectrum to\
    \ \nthese services is managed and regulated by local authorities \n(governmental\
    \ agencies) that are responsible for determining \nthe appropriate frequency band,\
    \ the geographical extent of the \nuse of this band, the maximum transmission\
    \ power, etc. One of \nthe fundamental purposes of these agencies is to ensure\
    \ a \nminimum interference level between the different radio \ntechnologies. \n\
    At the global level, the International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU) organizes,\
    \ every three to four years, the world \nradiocommunication conferences (WRC)\
    \ 1so as to examine and \nrevise the treaties governing the use of the radio frequency\
    \ \nspectrum. \nNevertheless, the static spectrum allocation strategy \nadopted,\
    \ where spectral frequency bands allocated to a wireless \ncommunication system\
    \ can only be used by that system, has \ncaused the shortage of frequencies. This\
    \ shortage is confronted \nwith a strong demand for spectrum resulting from the\
    \ \nemergence and abundance of wireless technologies and the \nextremely rapid\
    \ proliferation of radio applications developed in \nthe scope of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT). \nIn addition, while unlicensed bands like ISM (Industrial,\
    \ \nScientific, and Medical) bands can be freely used by all radios \nrespecting\
    \ a specific set of rules, such as a shared channel \naccess mechanism and a maximum\
    \ power per Hertz , they have \nbecome very crowded and can’t accommodate more\
    \ wireless \napplications [1]. \nOn the other hand, the already assigned spectrum\
    \ is \ninefficiently used in all domains, such as the time domain, the \nspace\
    \ domain, and the frequency domain, as shown in Fig. 1. \nThis was confirmed by\
    \ the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC), which reported in 2002 that the\
    \ radio \nspectrum, in most of the time, was from 15% up to 85% \nunderutilized\
    \ [2]. \nAs a result, it has been found that while some bands are \novercrowded,\
    \ such as those bands used by cellular base \nstations, many other bands are not\
    \ in use or are used only for \nshort periods [2]. \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\
    \ has been commonly \nregarded as an efficient solution to address the above-\n\
    mentioned issues by enabling the opportunistic usage of the \nfrequency bands\
    \ that are not heavily occupied by licensed users \n[3,4]. \n1 https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/wrc-19\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 1. Spectrum Utilization\
    \ [3]. \nA Cognitive Radio represents a Software Defined Radio \n(SDR) system\
    \ [5] capable of exploring the radio environment, \nlearning, and deciding to\
    \ use the unoccupied portions of the \nspectrum, called \"spectrum holes\" or\
    \ \"white spaces\", and \nconsequently \nof \ndynamically \nadjusting \nits \n\
    operating \nparameters, based on the decisions made. These decisions must \nimperatively\
    \ take into account the impact on the primary users \n(PUs), which have a license\
    \ on the chosen spectrum and have \nthe higher priority to access it, in order\
    \ not to cause them \nharmful interference. Unlicensed users, which use Cognitive\
    \ \nRadio to access the spectrum, are referred to as secondary users \n(SUs).\
    \ \nFurthermore, the transition from analog to digital television \nhas released\
    \ many frequencies, known as TV white spaces, \nwhich have too high propagation\
    \ and penetration qualities [6]. \nFor this reason, the FCC authorized in 2008\
    \ the use of these \nfrequencies by non-licensed users following a list of rules\
    \ like \nusing the geo-location capability to obtain the available TV \nbands,\
    \ from White Space DataBase (WSDB), before operating \n[7–9]. That has created\
    \ a lot of opportunities for Cognitive \nradio users. \nThe remarkable contribution\
    \ of this promising technology \nto the efficient use of spectrum, the minimization\
    \ of \ninterference, the reduction of cost, etc., has pushed its use in \nseveral\
    \ areas, namely the Internet of Things (IoT). \nThe main objective of this paper\
    \ is to provide a \ncomprehensive survey of Cognitive radio with a particular\
    \ \nfocus given to: \n• Software Defined Radio, as it is the building block of\
    \ \nCognitive Radio system; \n• Spectrum sensing, as one of the most important\
    \ pillars \nto set up a Cognitive Radio system; \n• CR-Based IoT, given that Cognitive\
    \ Radio is one of the \nimportant enabler technologies of IoT. \nTo the best of\
    \ our knowledge, in the literature, there is no \nsuch work that gives a comprehensive\
    \ survey of the three \naforementioned aspects, highlights the relation between\
    \ them, \nand exhibits the future research directions to handle their \nchallenges\
    \ in a single paper. The existing surveys dealt only \nwith a particular aspect.\
    \ \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \nSection II gives the\
    \ fundamentals of Cognitive Radio \ntechnology. Section III exhibits an overview\
    \ of Software \nDefined Radio and its different challenges. Section IV provides\
    \ \na detailed view of spectrum sensing and its challenges. Section \nV highlights\
    \ the use of Cognitive Radio in IoT. Finally, this \narticle is concluded in Section\
    \ VI. \nII. COGNITIVE RADIO FUNDAMENTALS \nCognitive Radio technology was first\
    \ introduced by Joseph \nMitola in 1999 to depict an intelligent radio system\
    \ capable of \nreconfiguring dynamically its radio parameters according to its\
    \ \noperational environment and to the user’s QoS requirements \n[4]. Afterward,\
    \ Cognitive Radio has been defined in many \nways by different entities and researchers.\
    \ The Federal \nCommunications Commission defined CR as follows: \n“Cognitive\
    \ radio: A radio or system that senses its operational \nelectromagnetic environment\
    \ and can dynamically and \nautonomously adjust its radio operating parameters\
    \ to modify \nsystem operation, such as maximize throughput, mitigate \ninterference,\
    \ facilitate interoperability, access secondary \nmarkets.” [10]. \nMoreover,\
    \ Simon Haykin defined CR as “an intelligent \nwireless communication system,\
    \ capable of being aware of its \nenvironment, learning, and adaptively changing\
    \ its operating \nparameters (e.g., transmit-power, carrier-frequency, and \n\
    modulation strategy) in real-time for providing reliable \ncommunication (anytime\
    \ and anywhere) and efficient \nutilization of the radio spectrum” [11]. \nAs\
    \ mentioned in the above definitions, the main \ncharacteristics of Cognitive\
    \ Radio are cognitive capability and \nreconfigurability [3,11]. \nThanks to the\
    \ cognitive capability feature, the CR user can \nsense and collect information\
    \ related to its radio environment \nand choose the best channel to use. The collected\
    \ information \nmainly involves transmission frequency, power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. \nThe reconfigurability feature allows CR users to adjust \nautomatically\
    \ its operating parameters (transmission frequency, \nmodulation, power, etc.)\
    \ based on the gathered information and \nwithout the need to change the hardware.\
    \ Hence an efficient \nand effective Cognitive Radio system is imperatively built\
    \ on \nSoftware Defined Radio platform. The latter will be briefly \nreviewed\
    \ in the next section. \nA. Dynamic Spectrum Access \nBy means of Dynamic Spectrum\
    \ Access (DSA) techniques, \nCognitive Radio enables secondary users to use the\
    \ unoccupied \nportions of licensed spectrum which are known as spectrum \nholes\
    \ or white spaces. When a primary user appears, the \nsecondary user vacates the\
    \ current band and moves to another \nspectrum hole or keeps transmitting on the\
    \ same band and \nadjusting its transmission power level or modulation scheme\
    \ in \norder not to cause any harmful interference to the licensed user \nor affect\
    \ its QoS as illustrated in Fig. 2 [3]. \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 2. Spectrum Hole Concept [3]. \nThere are three\
    \ DSA approaches that the SUs can use to \ndynamically access the available spectral\
    \ opportunities: \nunderlay, interweave, and overlay [12]. \n1) Spectrum underlay:\
    \ In the underlay transmission mode, \nthe SU can coexist with the PU as long\
    \ as the SU operates \nbelow the noise floor of the PU. In other words, the \n\
    coexistence between the SU and the PU may occur if only the \ninterference caused\
    \ by the SU at the PU receiver remains \nunder a predefined threshold, known as\
    \ the “interference \ntemperature” [13,14]. To meet the interference threshold\
    \ \nrequirement, SU can use some techniques such as spreading \nits signal over\
    \ a wide bandwidth below the noise floor of the \nPU or using multiple antennas\
    \ to direct its signals away from \nthe PU receiver [15]. \nMoreover, in the case\
    \ of the underlay approach, the \nspectrum sensing process is not required and\
    \ the SUs can \ntransmit the data over the spectrum even if it is occupied all\
    \ the \ntime by the PUs. Therefore, this paradigm is more appropriate \nto use\
    \ in situations when the spectrum usage status of PUs \nchanges rapidly [12].\
    \ \nNevertheless, meeting the interference constraint forces the \nSU to limit\
    \ its transmission power and consequently to operate \nover a small coverage.\
    \ \n2) Spectrum interweave: As regards the interweave \ntransmission mode, it\
    \ stands for the opportunistic usage of the \navailable spectrum holes which was\
    \ the major motivation \nbehind the introduction of the Cognitive Radio technology\
    \ \n[16]. This paradigm mandates that SUs should have only \naccess to the unoccupied\
    \ spectrum resources. Thus, spectrum \nsensing is needed to identify the vacant\
    \ spectrum bands that \nare not currently occupied by the PUs. \nFurthermore,\
    \ in this case, harmful interferences to PUs are \navoided due to the fact that\
    \ SUs do not transmit concurrently \nwith the PUs. Whereas, the constant tracking\
    \ of spectrum \nopportunities is a challenging task, especially in rapidly \n\
    changing environments in terms of spectrum occupancy. \nHence, this approach is\
    \ more adequate for slowly changing \nenvironments [12,17]. \nConcerning power\
    \ resources, they are only limited by the \nrange of the identified spectrum holes.\
    \ \nIt is also worth noting that this class of dynamic spectrum \naccess is also\
    \ referred to as opportunistic spectrum access [18]. \n3) Spectrum \noverlay:\
    \ \nIn \nrespect \nto \nthe \noverlay \ntransmission mode, it is like the underlay\
    \ approach in that \nboth approaches allow SUs to simultaneously transmit with\
    \ \nPUs. However, in the overlay mode, SUs can transmit at any \npower without\
    \ a predefined interference threshold constraint. \nMoreover, in this paradigm,\
    \ the performance of the PU \nshouldn't be negatively affected by the presence\
    \ of the SU. To \nmeet this requirement, SUs use a variety of techniques that\
    \ \nrequire prior knowledge about PUs' codebooks and messages \n[19]. For instance,\
    \ SUs can divide their power into two parts: \none is assigned to transmit their\
    \ packets and the other is \nallocated to support the PUs’ transmissions. In that\
    \ way, the \ninterference caused by the SU at the PU receiver can be \ncompensated\
    \ by the enhancement of the PU’s signal-to-noise \npower ratio (SNR), by dint\
    \ of the part of SU’s power that is \nused to relay the PU packets. \nAdditionally,\
    \ SUs can exploit knowledge about PUs' \ncodebooks and messages to cancel the\
    \ interference caused by \nPUs, using techniques such as dirty paper coding [19].\
    \ \nFinally, hybrid schemes that combine these transmission \nmodes can be conceived\
    \ to increase the overall throughput of \nthe wireless networks [20]. \nB. Cognitive\
    \ Radio Functions \nThe various tasks performed by a Cognitive Radio, \nincluding\
    \ detecting spectrum holes, selecting the best available \nchannel, determining\
    \ the transmission parameters, sharing \nspectrum with other users, and moving\
    \ to another frequency \nband when a licensed user appears are referred to as\
    \ the \ncognitive cycle (See Fig. 3) [21]. \nIn general, the cognitive cycle can\
    \ be divided into three \nfunctional steps, namely spectrum sensing and analysis,\
    \ \nspectrum management and handoff, and spectrum allocation \nand sharing [21]:\
    \ \n• Spectrum sensing and analysis: in this phase, CR \nmonitors the radio environment,\
    \ detects the spectrum \nholes, and estimates its different characteristics. \n\
    • Spectrum management and handoff: at this stage, CR \nchooses the best spectrum\
    \ white space, determines the \ntransmission parameters, and hops among different\
    \ \nbands based on the channel characteristics and user \nrequirements [3,21].\
    \ \n• Spectrum allocation and sharing: through these \nfunctions, CR can share\
    \ and coordinate the spectrum \naccess with other users. The coexistence with\
    \ licensed \nusers is restricted by their allowable interference level. \nThus,\
    \ secondary users should adjust their transmission \nparameters accordingly. As\
    \ for sharing spectrum access \nwith CR users, efficient spectrum access coordination\
    \ is \nrequired so as to avoid collisions and interferences [21]. \n102 | P a\
    \ g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 3. Cognitive Cycle\
    \ [21]. \nWith respect to the layer they are in, the aforesaid functions \ncan\
    \ be classified into three groups namely physical layer \n(PHY) functions, the\
    \ medium access control layer (MAC) \nfunctions, and network layer functions as\
    \ shown in Fig. 4 [22]: \n \nFig. 4. Key Functions of the PHY, MAC, and Network\
    \ Layers in a CR [22]. \n1) Physical layer functions: CR PHY layer is responsible\
    \ \nfor many tasks, including, but not limited to, identifying \nspectrum holes\
    \ through spectrum sensing and acquiring \nadvanced radio environment knowledge,\
    \ such as the channel \ngain from the CR transmitter to the primary receiver and\
    \ \nchannel-state information (CSI), via environmental learning \n[22]. Based\
    \ on the gathered information, cognitive spectrum \naccess is performed by using\
    \ transceiver optimization and \nreconfiguration. \n2) Medium access control layer\
    \ functions: CR MAC layer \nincorporates two key functions that allow to control\
    \ and \nmanage spectrum sensing operations as well as access to the \nidentified\
    \ spectrum opportunities. The first function is known \nas sensing scheduling,\
    \ whereas the second is referred to as \nspectrum-aware access control. The operations\
    \ of these \nfunctions are controlled by the sensing-access coordinator, on \n\
    a time basis, by taking into consideration the compromise \nbetween the sensing\
    \ requirement and the availability of the \nspectrum access opportunity. \nIn\
    \ \ncomparison \nwith \nthe \nconventional \nwireless \ncommunications MAC layer,\
    \ the CR MAC layer is more \ncomplicated to implement because of the dynamic nature\
    \ of the \nradio environment and the constant adaptation process that the \nCR\
    \ should perform. More detailed information about the CR \nMAC layer can be found\
    \ in [23,24]. \n3) Network layer functions: CR network layer provides \nthree\
    \ main functions: network tomography, quality of service \n(QoS) and error control,\
    \ and spectrum-aware routing [22]. \nNetwork tomography refers to the operation\
    \ by which the \nCR nodes sense the traffic patterns of the primary and the \n\
    coexisting networks. The output of this operation provides \nimportant baseline\
    \ data that allows a better understanding of \nthe routing design and the network\
    \ utilization at the packet \nlevel. \nQuality of service (QoS) control and error\
    \ control are of \nparamount importance to build a successful CR network. \nStatistical\
    \ control can be used to address these tasks over \nCRNs that are characterized\
    \ by opportunistic links. \nFurthermore, In CR networks, data routing is a challenging\
    \ \nproblem due to varying link quality, frequent topology \nchanges, and sporadic\
    \ connectivity caused by the movement of \nPUs in the network [25]. In such a\
    \ changing environment, the \nspectrum-aware routing function should be enabled\
    \ in order to \nfind optimal routes and paths while avoiding PUs. This \nfunction\
    \ has two problems to handle [21]: the first problem \nrelates to the fact that\
    \ routing algorithms and protocols should \nbe aware of the various network characteristics\
    \ such as \nspectrum availability, PU activity, channel switching delay, \nand\
    \ link qualities and take them into consideration while \nexecuting their different\
    \ operations. The second problem deals \nwith the setting up of interaction between\
    \ routing algorithms \nand dynamic spectrum allocation routines so as to select\
    \ \nrouting paths with minimum interferences. \nMoreover, the optimization of\
    \ the energy consumption, the \ndesired QoS, and the spectrum management should\
    \ be \nconsidered while designing routing algorithms and protocols \nfor CR networks.\
    \ Routing protocols are further detailed in [26]. \nFinally, the spectrum manager\
    \ serves as the means of \nestablishing a connection between the three aforementioned\
    \ \nlayers and ensuring dynamic and efficient access to the \navailable spectrum.\
    \ \nC. Cognitive Radio Networks \nA Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) consists of\
    \ a number of \nCR nodes with or without a secondary base station. \nBased on\
    \ the presence of infrastructure support, CRNs can \nbe classified as either an\
    \ Infrastructure-based network \n(centralized) or an Ad-Hoc network (distributed).\
    \ Moreover, \nCRNs can be also deployed in another architecture known as \nMesh\
    \ architecture that combines Infrastructure-based and Ad-\nHoc modes. A brief\
    \ description of these architectures is given \nbelow. \n1) Infrastructure-based\
    \ CR network: It is a centralized \narchitecture which contains a CR base station\
    \ that is \nresponsible for controlling and coordinating the transmission \nactivities\
    \ of the CR nodes. In this architecture, the CR base \nstation retrieves the spectrum\
    \ related information from all the \nSUs in the network and on the basis of the\
    \ gathered \ninformation, it makes decisions on spectrum access and \nsharing\
    \ for all CR nodes. \n103 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nCompared to Ad-hoc network, infrastructure-based network \nprovides many advantages\
    \ including, the reliability of the \nsensing process, collision avoidance, and\
    \ a high data right for \nSUs. However, an infrastructure is required to build\
    \ such a \nnetwork. \nSome examples of centralized networks include: \n• The IEEE\
    \ 802.22 network: it is the first wireless \nregional \narea \nnetwork \nstandard\
    \ \nthat \ndefines \nspecifications for broadband wireless access using CR \n\
    technology in TVWS bands [27]; \n• Spectrum Efficient Uni and Multi-cast Services\
    \ Over \nDynamic Radio Network in Vehicular Environments \n(Over DRiVE) [28];\
    \ \n• European Dynamic Radio for IP services in Vehicular \nEnvironment (DRiVE)\
    \ [29]; \n• Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) [30]. \n2) Ad-hoc mode CR network: In Ad-hoc CRNs,\
    \ there is no \nneed for base stations or access points to coordinate the SUs.\
    \ \nThus, in the absence of a central controlling entity, SUs in \nsuch a distributed\
    \ network, make independent decisions \nconcerning spectrum access and transmission\
    \ parameters. \nAdditionally, SUs must use distributed DSA protocols so as to\
    \ \nmanage the spectrum access operation. Designing distributed \nDSA protocols\
    \ for Ad-hoc CRNs is a challenging task because \nof the absence of central control\
    \ entities and the completely \ndistributed networking architecture [12]. These\
    \ protocols \nshould support a set of functions including, transparency for \n\
    PUs, collision avoidance, accurate spectrum sensing, and \nefficient dynamic spectrum\
    \ allocation [12]. \nIII. SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO: OVERVIEW \nGiven that SDR is\
    \ considered as an enabling technology \nthat handles the implementation of Cognitive\
    \ Radio, this \nsection will be dedicated to a brief overview of SDR. \nA. Definition\
    \ of SDR \nSoftware Defined Radio [31,32] is referred to as a \nprogrammable radio\
    \ transceiver where digital signal processing \nfunctions, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ coding/decoding, \nerror \ncontrol, \ninterleaving/deinterleaving, \nand \n\
    scrambling/descrambling are implemented by means of \nsoftware instead of hardware\
    \ as it has been used in traditional \nradio \ncommunication \nsystems. \nThat\
    \ \nenables \nthe \nimplementation of different waveform standards in a single\
    \ \nplatform and switching between them without any change in \nthe hardware components.\
    \ In some cases, there is just the need \nof a simple software upgrade to support\
    \ other modes, bands, \nand functions. \nMany hardware platforms are used to implement\
    \ the \nsoftware part of SDR, mainly, General Purpose Processor \n(GPP), Digital\
    \ Signal Processor (DSP), Field Programmable \nGate Arrays (FPGA), and Application\
    \ Specific Integrated \nCircuit (ASIC) [33]. \nEach of the above-mentioned platforms\
    \ has its own \nchallenges, limitations, and strengths in terms of computational\
    \ \npower, power consumption, implementation cost, flexibility \nand reconfigurability,\
    \ and complexity of design (See Table I). \nB. SDR Architecture \nJoseph Mitola\
    \ proposed the architecture of an ideal \nsoftware radio transceiver that includes\
    \ three components, \nnamely an antenna, a Digital-to-Analog/Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nconverter, and a processing unit as illustrated in Fig. 5. The \nprocessing\
    \ unit allows performing, in software, all the digital \nsignal \nprocessing \n\
    functions, \nincluding \nmodulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, and error control\
    \ \n[3]. \n \nFig. 5. Ideal Software Radio [16]. \nMany factors impede the real\
    \ implementation of this \nproposed architecture such as the technology limitations,\
    \ more \nparticularly those related to ADC’s performance, computing \npower, and\
    \ power consumption of the processing unit. \nUnlike the ideal software radio\
    \ transceiver, the SDR \ntransceiver is feasible. Indeed, the general architecture\
    \ of SDRs \ncontains more components that make its real implementation \npossible.\
    \ \nAs shown in Fig. 6, the SDR transceiver includes mainly \nfour parts which\
    \ are an antenna, an analog RF front end, a \ndigital RF front end, and the signal\
    \ processing unit. \n1) Antenna: One of the main tasks expected from an SDR \n\
    platform is its ability to cover multiple frequency bands. Thus, \nSDR platforms\
    \ often use Intelligent/Smart antennas so as to \nfulfill the aforementioned task.\
    \ \nA smart antenna consists of an antenna array combined \nwith signal processing\
    \ blocks that allow to smartly exploit the \nspatial diversity in order to select\
    \ the appropriate frequency \nband and adapt with interference nulling, and mobile\
    \ tracking \n[34,35]. \nAn antenna for SDR should ideally integrate some features\
    \ \nsuch as self-adaptation, self-alignment and self-healing [35]. \nThese characteristics\
    \ can be defined as follows: \n• Self-adaptation: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to \nadapt its parameters according to the selected band and \nthe system requirements\
    \ (gain…); \n• Self-alignment: it is the capability of an antenna to \ncontrol\
    \ its radiation pattern; \n• Self-healing: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to avoid \ninterferences. \n104 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \n2) Analog RF front end: The RF front end part [34] \nrepresents\
    \ an analog circuitry where the following operations \nare performed: \nIn the\
    \ transmission path, Digital-to-Analogue Converter \n(DAC) converts digital samples\
    \ into an analog signal which \nrepresents the input of the RF Front End. After\
    \ that, the analog \nsignal is mixed with high frequency carriers, modulated to\
    \ a \npreset RF frequency, and then transmitted. \nIn the receiving path, the\
    \ RF signal captured by the antenna \nis fed to the RF Front end section through\
    \ a matching circuitry \nwhich allows achieving an optimum signal power transfer.\
    \ \nThen, in order to amplify very low-power signals while \nguaranteeing a minimum\
    \ noise level, the RF signal passes \nthrough a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) which\
    \ is often mounted \nvery close to the antenna. Afterward, the output of the LNA\
    \ is \nmixed with a signal from the Local Oscillator (LO) so as to \nshift to\
    \ a lower fixed frequency known as intermediate \nfrequency (IF). \nThe frequency\
    \ generated by the Local Oscillator is \nadjustable to ensure that the mixer produces\
    \ a lower fixed \nintermediate frequency independent of the incoming RF signal.\
    \ \nThe intermediate frequency presents several advantages: it \nimproves the\
    \ selectivity due to the fact of being fixed and it \nincreases the performance\
    \ of the processing unit and the global \ngain of the receiver owing to be lower\
    \ than the incoming \nfrequency. \n3) Digital front end: The Digital Front end\
    \ section [34] \ncontains a set of blocks that are responsible for performing\
    \ all \nof the succeeding functions: \nIn the transmission path, the digital baseband\
    \ signal (near-\nzero frequency range) is shifted into the IF frequency by the\
    \ \nDigital Up Converter (DUC) then it passes through the Digital \nAnalog Converter\
    \ (DAC) that converts it to the analog IF \nsignal. The analog IF signal is later\
    \ up-converted to RF signal. \nIn the receiving path, the analog IF signal is\
    \ converted to \ndigital IF samples by the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).\
    \ \nNext, the Digital Down Converter (DDC) changes the IF \nsamples to a baseband\
    \ signal which is then resampled and \nfiltered before being processed by the\
    \ signal processing unit. \nThese above-mentioned tasks can be divided into two\
    \ \nprincipal functions which are Resampling and Channelization. \nResampling\
    \ or Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) is the process \nof converting samples from\
    \ one sample rate to another. As for \nChannelization, it involves up/down conversion\
    \ and channel \nfiltering. \n4) Signal processing unit: This block is regarded\
    \ as the \nmain part of SDR architecture which is designed to perform \nDigital\
    \ \nSignal \nProcessing \nfunctions \nsuch \nas \nmodulation/demodulation and\
    \ encoding/decoding. \nAs already mentioned in this paper many hardware \nplatforms\
    \ are used to implement this section, namely DSP, \nGPP, GPU, ASIC, and FPGA [36–39].\
    \ The real challenge is \ndetermining which of these platforms is best to achieve\
    \ SDR \ngoals and which design approach is appropriate to meet the \nrequested\
    \ quality of service. \nTable I shows the strengths and weaknesses of some \n\
    hardware platforms and highlights certain techniques used to \nimprove their performance.\

    This approach consists of regrouping design schemes that \nemploy hardware techniques,\
    \ such as FPGAs and ASICs, and \nthose that use software solutions including GPPs,\

    \ \nthe problem related to the shared access of the internal memory \nby different\
    \ units (FPGAs, Processors ...) and the very \nexpensive cost of the whole implementation.\
    \ \nOne of the interesting readings that give a detailed review \nof the aforementioned\
    \ platforms, can be found in [35]. \nC. SDR Advantages \nSoftware Defined Radio\
    \ technology has brought a lot of \nadvantages to the world of wireless communications,\
    \ such as \nreconfigurability and flexibility, interoperability, and cost \nreduction\
    \ [34,37]: \n• Reconfigurability and Flexibility: The main feature of \nSDR is\
    \ its capacity to handle wireless standards newly \ndeveloped by simply changing\
    \ or upgrading the \nreconfigurable software instead of replacing the \nhardware\
    \ platform or its analog components. \n• Interoperability: One of the most important\
    \ benefits of \nSDR is its ability to resolve interoperability problems \nbetween\
    \ incompatible radios that work with different \nwireless standards. \n• Cost\
    \ \nreduction: \nSeveral \nexpensive \nhardware \ncomponents disappeared due to\
    \ the fact that in SDR \nmany \ndigital \nsignal \nprocessing \nfunctions \nare\
    \ \nimplemented by means of software. \nIn addition to the forenamed benefits,\
    \ SDR allows to test \nand study several communication standards by using the\
    \ same \nplatform. Furthermore, SDR is regarded as the block building \nof a Cognitive\
    \ Radio system and as already mentioned in this \npaper, SDR enables the reconfigurability\
    \ of Cognitive Radio. \nD. SDR Tools \nThere are different commercial and open-source\
    \ tools that \ncan be used for SDR development. Choosing the more \nappropriate\
    \ \ndevelopment \ntool \nfor \na \nspecific \ndesign \nmethodology requires prior\
    \ knowledge of the available tools’ \nfeatures. Examples of these tools include\
    \ GNU Radio, \nUniversal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), MATLAB, \nLabVIEW,\
    \ and CUDA. \nGNU Radio and USRP are the most widely used tools to \ndevelop SDR\
    \ systems [40]. A brief description of these two \ntools is given below: \nGNU\
    \ Radio: GNU Radio is a free & open-source software \ntoolkit for building software\
    \ radios [35]. It runs on host \n106 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \ncomputers and it provides many signal processing blocks such\
    \ \nas filters, decoders, and demodulators which are required to \nimplement software\
    \ radios. These blocks are programmed in \nC++ and they are often connected using\
    \ Python script that has \nthe advantage of allowing the data flow to be at the\
    \ maximum \nrate, without being interpreted [41]. In addition, this tool offers\
    \ \nthe possibility of easily programming and adding new blocks \nfor supporting\
    \ unavailable functions. GNU Radio can be used \njointly with Universal Software\
    \ Radio Peripheral systems or \nother alternatives to set up complete SDR platforms.\
    \ \nUSRP: Universal Software Radio Peripheral is the most \ncommonly used transceiver\
    \ for SDR platforms, developed by \nEttus2 Research under GPL license. USRPs are\
    \ available in \nseveral series and versions, differentiated by their hardware\
    \ \nperformances and their connection method to a host computer. \nGenerally,\
    \ USRP is a board that integrates the following \ncomponents: ADC/ DAC, an FPGA\
    \ board, an RF front end, \nand a PC host interface [42]. Based on the USRP series,\
    \ a \ncertain number of daughterboards can also be held. \nDaughterboards perform\
    \ functions such as filtering and \nconversion between RF and baseband signals\
    \ (up/down \nconversions) and may support applications operating up to 6 \nGHz\
    \ due to being modular. Concerning the other signal \nprocessing functions, the\
    \ majority of them are performed at the \nhost machine and only some operations\
    \ are processed by the \nFPGA board [42]. USRP platforms offer several advantages,\
    \ \nincluding ease-of-use, affordability, and flexibility. However, \nbandwidth\
    \ limitations of USRP components have an impact on \nsystem throughput. That makes\
    \ USRP platforms only suitable \nfor research experiments and rapid prototyping\
    \ [35,42]. \nE. SDR Challenges \nIn this subsection, the challenges that still\
    \ remain to be \naddressed for implementing efficient and practical SDR \nsystems\
    \ are presented. \n1) Security and attack issues: Although SDR has brought \n\
    many powerful advantages to the field of wireless \ncommunication, it has introduced\
    \ new types of security threats \nand attack issues. Indeed, in addition to the\
    \ known threats that \nexist in conventional wireless communication systems such\
    \ as \ndenial of service attacks, misconfiguration issues, listening \nand capturing\
    \ data that can be used to perform malicious \nactions, there are several threats\
    \ that are specific to SDR, \nincluding downloading and running malicious software.\
    \ \nIn the absence of authentication and verification \ntechniques, unauthorized\
    \ software can easily be installed and \nactivated on SDR terminals. The challenge\
    \ of implementing \nprotection techniques and security mechanisms, to prevent\
    \ this \nissue, has been addressed by many researchers. For instance, in \n[43]\
    \ a framework for establishing secure download for SDR is \npresented. This framework\
    \ uses a public/private key scheme to \nverify the authenticity of the software.\
    \ The digital signature is \nconsidered as a good solution to keep malicious and\
    \ \nunauthorized software from being activated on SDR nodes, \nnevertheless, it\
    \ greatly increases the complexity of the \n2 https://www.ettus.com/ \nframework\
    \ due to the fact that for each combination of \nwaveform and terminal, a digital\
    \ signature should be created. \nFurthermore, the data configuration of SDR components\
    \ \ncan be prone to extraction, alteration, or destruction. Those \nissues can\
    \ be prevented by guaranteeing the integrity of the \nsecurity administrative\
    \ module (SAM) and implementing data \nintegrity and protection techniques [44].\
    \ \n2) Energy efficiency: Addressing the power consumption \nissue is of primary\
    \ importance especially when designing \nsolutions that are intended for battery-powered\
    \ devices and \nlow power objects in an IoT network. Several reasons are \nbehind\
    \ the importance of addressing power consumption \nmanagement, including limited\
    \ size and battery, ensuring a \nlonger lifetime of IoT objects, and enabling\
    \ Green Computing \n[17,45]. In SDR, many factors contribute to the loss of energy\
    \ \nefficiency, namely signal processing complexity and the \nincreased hardware\
    \ requirements. To alleviate this loss, the \nauthors of [46] proposed a cooperative\
    \ wireless network \nscheme that is based on resource sharing (Battery, processing\
    \ \nunit, memory…). \n3) Antenna requirements for SDR: One of the major \nchallenges\
    \ in SDR is to design wideband antennas that support \ndifferent technologies\
    \ and standards. Although smart and \nreconfigurable antennas are used to resolve\
    \ this concern, \nseveral constraints still hamper the SDR implementation in \n\
    portable handsets and other systems, such as bandwidth and \ngain limitations,\
    \ which are imposed by the antenna size, and \nthe complexity of a design that\
    \ meets all the antenna \nrequirements for SDR [47]. \n4) Hybrid design: Implementing\
    \ an optimal SDR design, \nthat meets the real-time requirements at low power\
    \ and cost \nwhile maintaining flexibility and programmability, represents \n\
    a great challenge. Researchers address this issue by using the \nhybrid approach\
    \ which enables the use of hardware schemes \n(ASICs…) along with software schemes\
    \ (GPP...) in the same \nplatform in order to take advantage of their different\
    \ benefits. \nThe hybrid design has also its own challenges in both \nphysical\
    \ and MAC layers, including partitioning and \nscheduling problems [35]. \n5)\
    \ ADC and DAC limitations: The concept of an ideal \nsoftware defined radio transceiver\
    \ consists in placing the \nADC/DAC as close as possible to the antenna. That\
    \ requires a \nvery high-speed ADC/DAC with sampling capability up to \nGiga Samples\
    \ per second which is actually not feasible. To \novercome this issue, an RF front\
    \ end block is placed right after \nthe antenna so as to shift the incoming frequency\
    \ to an \nintermediate frequency that can be supported by the currently \navailable\
    \ ADC/DAC. \nIV. SPECTRUM SENSING \nSensing is considered as the most important\
    \ and critical \nphase in the Cognitive Radio cycle. It refers to the operation\
    \ by \nwhich the CR users can be aware of the channel occupancy, the \npresence\
    \ of the primary user, the quality of the radio channel, \n107 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n                                                           \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nand other parameters such as transmission power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. Based on this gathered information, the CR \nusers can determine the vacant\
    \ portion of the spectrum and \nchoose the white spaces which meet its QoS. \n\
    This section gives a detailed view of sensing spectrum \nfunction in Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks. \nA. Multi-dimensional Spectrum Sensing \nThrough the sensing\
    \ function, Cognitive radio can identify \nthe existing spectrum opportunities\
    \ in its surrounding \nenvironment by using different sensing techniques. Spectrum\
    \ \nopportunity is conventionally defined as “a band of frequencies \nthat are\
    \ not being used by the primary user of that band at a \nparticular time in a\
    \ particular geographic area” [48,49]. This \ndefinition takes into consideration\
    \ only three dimensions, \nnamely frequency, time, and space. However, there are\
    \ other \ndimensions that can be exploited to create new opportunities \nsuch\
    \ as code dimension and angle dimension. Developing \nsensing algorithms that\
    \ take into account all those dimensions \nencounters more complex and challenging\
    \ issues. \nA radio environment in which all the aforementioned \ndimensions are\
    \ exploited to share spectrum access among \nmultiple users is known by several\
    \ names including, \nhyperspace, electro space, and radio spectrum space. Table\
    \ II \nshows parameters that are needed to be sensed for each \ndimension and\
    \ highlights its main idea [49]. \nB. Types of Spectrum Sensing \nSpectrum sensing\
    \ approaches can be divided into several \ntypes on the basis of specific aspects,\
    \ including the cooperation \nbetween secondary users, the bands of interest,\
    \ the sensing \nexecution time, and the number of sensed channels at a time \n\
    (See Fig. 7) [50]: \nBased on the bands of interest for the Cognitive Radio \n\
    system, spectrum sensing falls into two groups: in-band \nsensing and out-of-band\
    \ sensing. In-band sensing consists in \nsensing the channel that is already transmitting,\
    \ in the aim of \ndetecting primary user signals and avoiding harmful \ninterferences\
    \ [51,52]. As to out-of-band sensing, CR senses \nbands other than the band on\
    \ which it is transmitting so as to \ndiscover new spectrum holes [51]. \nBased\
    \ on the sensing execution time, two classes of \nspectrum sensing can be distinguished:\
    \ reactive (on-demand) \nand proactive(periodic) sensing. The reactive sensing\
    \ takes \nplace when the secondary user intends to transmit or as a result \n\
    of radio environmental changes. In proactive sensing, CR users \nsense the radio\
    \ environment persistently so as to detect \nspectrum opportunities. Reactive\
    \ sensing is more energy \nefficient but the time to identify an unoccupied channel\
    \ may be \nlonger than proactive sensing. \nAmong the types of spectrum sensing,\
    \ we also find \nsynchronous \nsensing \nand \nasynchronous \nsensing. \nIn \n\
    synchronous sensing, all CRs respect the same schedule to \nsense a frequency\
    \ band. In that case, a high synchronization \nbetween CRs represents a challenging\
    \ task. \nTABLE II. \nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRUM SENSING \nDimension \nParameters\
    \ to sense \nIdea and remarks \nFrequency \nAvailable frequency bands \nThe available\
    \ frequency band is segmented into disjoint sub-\nbands. Identifying opportunities\
    \ in the frequency domain consists \nin determining the unoccupied sub-bands.\
    \ It is unlikely that all the \nbands can be used concurrently at the same time.\
    \  \nTime \nAvailable time slots in a specific band \nFor a given frequency band,\
    \ there will be times when it is \nunoccupied and available for opportunistic\
    \ usage.  \nGeographic Space \nPU’s location (latitude, longitude, an elevation)\
    \ \nDistance of primary users \nAt a specific time, certain channels may be available\
    \ for \nopportunistic usage in some geographical zones while being \nentirely\
    \ occupied in other zones. The path loss in space enables \nsecondary users to\
    \ identify the presence or the absence of a \nprimary user in a given local area\
    \ by just looking at the \ninterference level. If there is no interference, then\
    \ the primary \nuser is absent otherwise it is present. However, the risk of creating\
    \ \nharmful interferences to a hidden primary user is possible. This \nissue is\
    \ discussed later in this article. \nAngle \nPU’s beam directions (azimuth and\
    \ elevation angle). \nPU’s location. \nBy leveraging advanced antenna technologies\
    \ (e.g., Beamforming \ntechnology), identifying PU’s location, and determining\
    \ PU’s \nbeam directions, new spectrum holes in the angle domain might \nbe available\
    \ for opportunistic usage. Indeed, the secondary user \ncan transmit in the same\
    \ frequency band along with the primary \nuser at the same time in the same location\
    \ by choosing a different \ndirection without causing interferences to the licensed\
    \ user. \nCode \nPU’s spreading code, time hopping (TH), or frequency hopping\

    \ \nsynchronize its transmission with PU. \nBy being aware of code sequences that\
    \ primary users are using at \na given time, secondary users can transmit simultaneously\
    \ along \nwith primary users over the available spectrum by choosing \ndifferent\
    \ code sequences in such a way as to avoid creating \ninterferences on primary\
    \ users. It is important to note that \nsimultaneous transmission is possible\
    \ by using orthogonal codes. \n108 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\

    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \nIn the case of asynchronous sensing, each CR has its own \n\
    schedule to sense a frequency band. Distinguishing between \nSU signals and PU\
    \ signals is a challenging problem. \nIn respect to the cooperation aspect, there\
    \ are two classes of \nspectrum sensing: cooperative and non-cooperative (local)\
    \ \nSensing. In non-cooperative sensing, each CR settles for its \nown sensing\
    \ data and independently decides on the channel \nstate, i.e. the presence or\
    \ the absence of the primary user. \nDecisions that are made through this sensing\
    \ type are \nunreliable and error prone under bad channel conditions, \nmultipath\
    \ fading and shadowing effects, and hidden node \nissues [53]. \nThe aforementioned\
    \ issues can be avoided by using \ncooperative sensing [21,53]. Indeed, when cooperative\
    \ sensing \nis enabled, CR users share their local observations and sensing \n\
    data with others and exploit the shared sensing outcomes of \nother users to decide\
    \ on the presence or absence of the primary \nuser. Several works have been carried\
    \ out on this topic and it \nhas been shown that cooperative sensing contributes\
    \ to the \nimprovement of detection accuracy and reliability on the cost \nof\
    \ increased latency and traffic overhead. It has also been \nproven that cooperation\
    \ between secondary users can solve \nhidden primary user problem and decrease\
    \ sensing time [53]. \nThere are two types of cooperative sensing: centralized\
    \ \nsensing and distributed sensing [3,54]. In centralized sensing \n[55], a central\
    \ unit gathers local sensing information from CR \nusers through a control channel,\
    \ fuses them by means of one of \nthe fusion decision rules [56], identifies spectrum\
    \ holes by \nperforming binary hypothesis testing algorithm such as \nNeyman-Pearson\
    \ test or Bayesian test, and shares the result \namong other cognitive users or\
    \ directly controls the cognitive \nradio traffic. In distributed sensing [54],\
    \ cognitive nodes \nexchange their local observations among each other and make\
    \ \ntheir own decisions on channel state. Distributed sensing \ndoesn’t require\
    \ a backbone infrastructure or a centralized base \nstation. \nOn the basis of\
    \ interference detection, spectrum sensing is \ncategorized as primary transmitter\
    \ detection, primary receiver \ndetection, and interference temperature [51].\
    \ In primary \ntransmitter detection approaches, spectrum holes are identified\
    \ \nby processing received signals at the PU receiver. This class \nincludes several\
    \ techniques such as energy detection and \nmatched filter detection. In primary\
    \ receiver detection, the \nstatus of primary channels is detected based on the\
    \ local \noscillator leakage power of the PU receiver [57]. This power is \nemitted\
    \ by the PU receiver’s RF front end while receiving the \ndata from the PU transmitter\
    \ [58]. As for interference \ntemperature, secondary users transmit simultaneously\
    \ with \nprimary users as long as the interference caused by the SU at \nthe PU\
    \ receiver remains under a specified interference limit. In \nthis case, the underlay\
    \ DSA model is considered. \nIn regard to the requirement of the PU’s information,\
    \ \nspectrum sensing schemes can be categorized into two classes: \nblind and\
    \ feature detection techniques [50]. The blind detection \ntechniques serve to\
    \ blindly determine the channel state without \nany prior knowledge about the\
    \ primary user signals. This type \nincludes, among others, energy detection and\
    \ Higher-Order-\nStatistics detection. The feature detection techniques allow\
    \ \nperforming signal classification to the detected signal. They are \nmore advantageous\
    \ than blind detection techniques in the sense \nthat it is possible to distinguish\
    \ between PU and SU signals and \nto characterize the different types of PU and\
    \ SU signals. \nMatched filter and cyclostationarity detection techniques are\
    \ \nexamples of feature detection techniques. \nDepending on the bandwidth (number\
    \ of sensed channels at \na time), spectrum sensing schemes are classified into\
    \ two broad \ngroups which are narrowband and wideband sensing \ntechniques [59]:\
    \ in the narrowband sensing, only one channel \nis analyzed at a time to detect\
    \ available opportunities. The most \nwidely and commonly known narrowband methods\
    \ are energy \ndetection, matched filter detection, cyclostationary feature \n\
    detection, covariance-based detection, and waveform detection \n[59]. \nAs for\
    \ wideband sensing, multiple frequency bands are \nexplored at a time so as to\
    \ discover spectrum holes. In this \ncase, the available spectrum is usually divided\
    \ into narrower \nsub-bands which are sensed either concurrently or sequentially\
    \ \nby using narrowband sensing techniques. Wideband sensing \ntechniques contain\
    \ two groups: Nyquist-based and Sub-\nNyquist wideband sensing. The former type\
    \ processes digital \nsignals at the rate equal to or greater than the Nyquist\
    \ rate, \nwhereas the latter type processes the signals with a sampling \nrate\
    \ lower than the Nyquist rate [59]. \nWideband sensing allows to exploit the available\
    \ spectrum \nmore efficiently but it brings about new challenges related to \n\
    its implementation. \nOn the basis of the latest mentioned classification of \n\
    spectrum sensing schemes (Narrowband sensing/ Wideband \nsensing), the next subsection\
    \ will review some of the most \ncommon spectrum sensing methods as well as the\
    \ recent \nadvanced spectrum sensing techniques. \n \nFig. 7. Types of Spectrum\
    \ Sensing. \n109 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal\
    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nC. Spectrum\
    \ Sensing Techniques \nBefore reviewing in detail spectrum sensing techniques,\
    \ \nmore particularly narrowband sensing techniques, the system \nmodel for spectrum\
    \ sensing is given below. \n1) System Model for spectrum sensing: The fundamental\
    \ \nobjective of spectrum sensing is to make a choice between two \nhypotheses:\
    \ \n• H0: Channel is temporarily available for opportunistic \nusage i.e. no primary\
    \ user signal is present; \n• H1: Channel is occupied i.e. a primary user signal\
    \ is \npresent. \nThese hypotheses can be expressed as under: \nH0: Y(n)= N(n)\
    \ when PU’s signal is absent  \n         (1) \nH1: Y(n)= h.X(n)+ N(n) when PU’s\
    \ signal is present          (2) \nWhere Y(n) represents the received signal by\
    \ SU, X(n) \nrepresents the transmitted PU signal, N(n) denotes Additive \nWhite\
    \ Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with mean zero and variance \n\U0001D70E\U0001D70E2.h\
    \ represents the channel gain, n= 1,2,3…N where n is the \nsample index, and N\
    \ is the number of samples. \nGenerally, a test statistic of Y(n) is compared\
    \ against a \ndecision threshold value \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide\
    \ between the two \nhypotheses. If the test statistic is greater than the threshold,\
    \ H1 \nis assumed to be true and thus PU’s signal is declared present. \nin contrast,\
    \ if the test statistic is less than the threshold, H0 is \nassumed to be true\
    \ and then PU’s signal is declared absent. Fig. \n8 presents the general model\
    \ of spectrum detection. \n \nFig. 8. Spectrum Sensing Model. \nSensing accuracy\
    \ is typically evaluated using the Receiver \nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curves.\
    \ These curves are the \nplot of the detection probability versus the false alarm\
    \ \nprobability or plot of the probability of miss detection against \nthe probability\
    \ of false alarm [60,61]. These probabilities are \ndefined as: \nProbability\
    \ of detection (Pd): It is the probability that the \nSU declares the presence\
    \ of PU signal when it is actually \npresent. \nPd = Pr(H1/H1)   \n \n \n \n \
    \        (3) \nA \nhigh \nProbability \nof \ndetection \nallows \navoiding \n\
    interference impact on primary receivers. Hence a high Pd is \neminently desirable.\
    \ \nProbability of false alarm (Pfa): It is the probability that the \nSU declares\
    \ the presence of PU signal when it doesn’t truly \nexist. \nPfa= Pr(H1/H0)  \
    \ \n \n \n \n         (4) \nA high Probability of false alarm decreases the efficiency\
    \ \nspectral due to the loss of spectrum access opportunities. In \naddition,\
    \ the QoS may be negatively affected as a result of this \nloss. Thus, Pfa should\
    \ be low to avoid the under-use of \npotential spectrum holes. \nProbability of\
    \ miss detection (Pm): It is the probability of \nmissing a PU signal when it\
    \ is present. \nPm= Pr(H0/H1)   \n \n \n \n         (5) \nA high Probability of\
    \ miss detection causes a harmful \ninterference on primary users because, in\
    \ the case of a miss \ndetection, SUs may transmit simultaneously with PUs in\
    \ the \nsame band. So, to avoid interference to and from license holder \nusers,\
    \ Pm should be low. \n2) Narrowband sensing techniques: In this subsection, we\
    \ \ndiscuss several narrowband sensing techniques, focusing on \ntheir \nfunctions,\
    \ \nmathematical \nmodels, \nstrengths, \nand \ndrawbacks. \na) Energy detection\
    \ scheme: Energy detection [1,62–64] \ncalled also Radiometry or Periodogram,\
    \ is the most widely \nused sensing scheme due to its low computational complexity,\
    \ \nthe simplicity of its implementation, and the absence of need \nfor PU signal\
    \ information. \nIn this sensing technique, the received signal energy is \ncomputed\
    \ and compared with a threshold value. If the \nmeasured energy is higher than\
    \ the threshold, the target \nfrequency band is considered to be occupied by a\
    \ PU; \notherwise, the target frequency band is considered to be vacant. \nThe\
    \ block diagram of the energy detection method is illustrated \nin Fig. 9 and\
    \ its decision metric can be written as: \nT= \n1\nN ∑\n(Y(n))\nN\nn=1\nⁿ  \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (6) \nDespite its aforementioned advantages, energy detection\
    \ \nhas several drawbacks, including the degradation of detection \naccuracy as\
    \ a result of noise uncertainty (NU). The latter refers \nto the noise power fluctuations\
    \ with time caused by the effects \nof various factors such as thermal noise,\
    \ filtering effects, radio-\nfrequency circuits, and interference from other signals\
    \ [65]. \nAuthors of [65] analyzed the impact of NU on energy detection \nperformance\
    \ using different OFDM system designs. The \nresults of their analyses show that,\
    \ for all OFDM system \ndesigns, the probability of detection is higher for signals,\
    \ with \nlower NU and higher SNR, which are transmitted at higher PU \ntransmit\
    \ power and detected with a higher number of samples. \nMoreover, energy detection\
    \ is unreliable at low SNR values \n[66], ineffective in detecting spread signals\
    \ [60], and unable to \ndistinguish between PU signals from other signals. \n\
    To enhance the performance and the accuracy of energy \ndetection, several methods\
    \ based on the use of dynamics \nthresholds are investigated in [67–70]. \n \n\

    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nb) Matched filter detection: The matched filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique is viewed as the best method for identifying the \nunutilized bands\
    \ when the PU transmission characteristics are \nknown a priori, e.g., bandwidth,\
    \ operating frequency, the \nmodulation type and order, packet format, and pulse\
    \ shaping \n[70–72]. In this technique, the received signal is correlated \nwith\
    \ the known PU signal and the result is compared with a \nthreshold to decide\
    \ on the presence of the PU. The block \ndiagram of matched filter detection is\
    \ shown in Fig. 10 and its \ntest statistic is given by: \nT=∑\nY(n)X∗(n)\nN\n\
    n=1\n23T \n \n \n \n         (7) \n \nFig. 10. Block Diagram of Matched Filter\
    \ Detection [70–73]. \nThe main advantage of this sensing scheme is that it \n\
    requires only a small number of samples and thus less sensing \ntime to achieve\
    \ good detection performance due to its \nresilience against noise uncertainty\
    \ [73]. Nevertheless, it has \nseveral drawbacks. First, there is a need for precise\
    \ and \naccurate prior information about the primary user signal, which \nmay\
    \ not always be available [65]. Second, the performance of \nthe matched filter\
    \ technique drops when the prior information \nis incorrect. Third, to detect\
    \ different types of PUs, a dedicated \nmatched filter structure for each type\
    \ must be used, which \nincreases the complexity of the system. \nc) Cyclostationary\
    \ Feature Detection: Cyclostationary \nFeature Detection [74–76] depends on cyclostationary\
    \ \ncharacteristics of the received signals. Indeed, in wireless \ncommunications,\
    \ the transmitted signals are typically \ncharacterized by the periodicity of\
    \ some of their statistics such \nas mean and autocorrelation[76,77].This periodicity\
    \ results \nfrom the fact that signals are modulated and coupled with \ncyclic\
    \ prefixes, hopping sequences, pulse trains, sinusoidal \nwave carrier, and other\
    \ features before being transmitted \n[76,77]. Furthermore, additive noise signals\
    \ are stationary \nwith no correlation. Therefore, Cyclostationary Feature \n\
    Detection schemes are very robust to noise uncertainties and \ncan distinguish\
    \ between the signal and noise by calculating \nand analyzing the cyclic autocorrelation\
    \ of the received \nsignals. \nThe periodicity of the mean and the autocorrelation,\
    \ of a \ncyclostationary signal y(t), can be expressed mathematically \nby: \n\
    my(t) = E[y(t)] = my(t + T0) \n \n \n         (8) \nRy(t, τ) = Ry(t + T0, τ) \n\

    \ Detection scheme is \nillustrated in Fig. 11, in which The Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nConverter (ADC) digitizes the received analog signal y(t) into \ndigital samples\
    \ and then it is fed into the N-point FFT block \nwhich computes its Fast Fourier\
    \ Transform. Next, these FFT \nvalues are correlated with themselves and then\
    \ averaged over \nthe number of samples. Finally, in the feature detection block,\
    \ \nthe sensing decision is obtained by detecting the features of the \naverage\
    \ outcome. \nThis scheme has also the advantage of being able to \ndistinguish\
    \ between various types of PU signals that are \ncharacterized by different transmit\
    \ features [78]. \nHowever, this detector also presents some limitations such\
    \ \nas the need for a large number of samples and high sampling \nrate which results\
    \ in an increase in sensing time, power \nconsumption, and complexity [76,78].\
    \ \nIn order to reduce computation complexity while \nmaintaining sufficient detection\
    \ sensitivity, authors of [79] \nproposed an improved Cyclostationary Detector\
    \ with SLC \nDiversity over Nakagami-m Fading channels, where the test \nstatistic\
    \ of conventional Cyclostationary detector is reliably \nsimplified. For the same\
    \ purpose, in [80], an improved \nCyclostationary Feature Detection Algorithm\
    \ is presented, in \nwhich authors proved that the cyclic spectrum is conjugate\
    \ \nsymmetry about the relevant axis, which decreases the \ncomputational complexity.\

    d) Covariance Based Detection: Covariance-based \ndetection methods exploit the\
    \ correlation structure inherent in \nthe received data and the noticeable differences\
    \ between the \nstatistical covariances of signal and noise to decide on the \n\
    presence of primary signals in background noise without the \nneed for prior knowledge\
    \ about signal, channel, or noise \npower [81]. \nDifferent statistical tests\
    \ can be extracted from the \ncovariance matrix of the received signal and used\
    \ to detect the \npresence of the signal like the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue\
    \ \nto minimum eigenvalue in the case of Eigenvalue-Based \nDetection Method [82].\
    \ The steps of the latter can be \nsummarized as follows: First, the sample covariance\
    \ matrix of \nthe received signal is built from the received signal samples. \n\
    Then, the eigenvalues of this matrix are computed using \ntechniques such as singular\
    \ value decomposition (SVD). \nFinally, a decision on the presence of the signal\
    \ is taken by \ncomparing the ratio between the maximum eigenvalue and the \n\
    minimum eigenvalue with a threshold. The block diagram of \nthis method is shown\
    \ in Fig. 12. \n \nFig. 12. Block Diagram of Covariance-Based Detection [82].\

    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nThe sample\
    \ covariance matrix of the received signal can be \nexpressed as [82]: \nRy (Ns)=\n\
    1\nNₛ ∑\nL−2+Nₛ ŷ(n) ŷH(n) \nn=L−1\n \n \n \n       (11) \nWhere Ns is the number\
    \ of collected samples, L is a \npositive integer called “smoothing factor\",\
    \ ŷ(n) is the received \nsignal vector at sampling instance n, and ŷH(n) is its\
    \ conjugate-\ntranspose. \nThe test statistic can be written as: \nT= \nλ\U0001D45A\
    \U0001D456\U0001D45B\nλ\U0001D45A\U0001D44E\U0001D465  \n \n \n \n \n       (12)\
    \ \nWhere \U0001D706\U0001D706max and \U0001D706\U0001D706min are respectively\
    \ the maximum and \nminimum eigenvalues of Ry (Ns); \nUsing a predefined threshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706, the decision can be made as \nfollows: if T> \U0001D706\
    \U0001D706, H1 is considered to be true, otherwise, H0 is \nconsidered to be true.\
    \ \nIt is noteworthy that, despite the robustness of covariance \ntechniques against\
    \ noise uncertainty, they have a high \ncomputational complexity due to two factors,\
    \ namely \ncovariance matrix computation and eigenvalue decomposition \n[82].\
    \ \ne) Waveform-based \ndetection: \nWaveform-based \ndetection method, also known\
    \ as coherent detection [49], can \nbe considered as a simplified version of the\
    \ matched filter \nscheme. Although, unlike the latter, this method doesn’t need\
    \ \ncomplete information about the PU signals. It simply exploits \nknown patterns,\
    \ that are used in wireless communication \nsystems to support many functions\
    \ such as synchronization, \ncontrol, and equalization so as to execute coherent\
    \ detection. \nThese patterns involve but not limited to the following: \n• Preambles:\
    \ a preamble is a known sequence that is sent \nbefore each burst; \n• Midambles:\
    \ a midamble is a known sequence that is \nsent in the middle of a slot or burst;\
    \ \n• Pilot symbols: pilot symbols are an extra overhead \nadded to the transmitted\
    \ signal. \nWhen such patterns are available, the received signal is \ncorrelated\
    \ with a known copy of itself to perform signal \ndetection. As such, the test\
    \ statistic can be expressed as: \nT=R [∑\ny(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n] \n \n \n \n  \
    \     (13) \nwhere R[.] denotes the real part, y(n) is the received signal \n\
    by SU, x(n)* is the complex conjugate of the signal transmitted \nby PU, and n=\
    \ [1,2…. N] is the sample index. \nIn the absence of the primary user’s signal,\
    \ the given \nexpression can be written as follows: \nT=R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n\
    ] \n \n \n \n       (14) \nWhereas in the presence of the primary user, the test\
    \ static \ncan be simplified as under: \nT= ∑\n(|x[n]|)2\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B\
    =1\n+R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B=1\n] \n \n       (15) \nWhere n(n)\
    \ denotes Additive White Gaussian Noise \n(AWGN) with mean zero and variance \U0001D70E\
    \U0001D70E2. \nThe value of the test statistic T is compared to a fixed \nthreshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide on the presence of a primary user \n\
    signal. H1 is considered to be true if T > \U0001D706\U0001D706, and H0 is \n\
    considered to be true otherwise. \nIt is noteworthy that the waveform-based sensing\
    \ scheme \ncan only be applied to wireless systems having known signal \npatterns,\
    \ such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b) [83] and WIMAX [84]. \nIn [85], it is demonstrated\
    \ that compared to energy detector \ntechnique, this method is more reliable and\
    \ has less sensing \ntime. In addition, it is demonstrated that the accuracy of\
    \ this \nsensing scheme increases with the length of the known primary \nsignal\
    \ pattern. \nIn [86], the authors have opted for waveform-based sensing \nscheme\
    \ to analyze the sensing performance of the simultaneous \ntransmission-and-sensing\
    \ (TS) mode, which has proven its \neffectiveness under imperfect self-interference\
    \ signal (SIS), \nunlike energy detection that cannot differentiate between a\
    \ PU \nsignal and a residual SIS. \nIn spite of the aforementioned advantages,\
    \ there are some \ndownsides to this scheme, mainly the need for complete and\
    \ \naccurate information concerning waveform patterns as well as \nhigh synchronization\
    \ between PU and SU, which is not always \npossible to attain. \nConcerning the\
    \ implementation complexity, coherent \ndetection is more complex than Energy\
    \ detection method and \nhas a lower complexity compared to match filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique. \nTable III provides a performance comparison of the \npreviously\
    \ described narrowband sensing methods based on a \nset of performance criteria,\
    \ namely detection accuracy, \ncomplexity, need for prior information about the\
    \ primary user, \nrobustness against noise uncertainty, and sensing time required\
    \ \nto achieve a good performance. \n3) Wideband sensing techniques: Wideband\
    \ spectrum \nsensing enables detecting spectral opportunities that lie within\
    \ \nfrequency bands greater than the coherence bandwidth of the \nchannel. One\
    \ application of this class of sensing is to exploit \nthe available spectrum\
    \ holes in the UHF (ultra-high-\nfrequency) TV band ranging from 300 MHz to 3\
    \ GHz. \nAs have been discussed earlier, narrowband sensing \nschemes make a single\
    \ binary decision for the whole frequency \nband. That makes these schemes incapable\
    \ to perform directly \nwideband sensing, since the latter intends to determine\
    \ the \noccupancy of several sub-channels that are involved in a given \nwideband\
    \ spectrum at a time. \nThe two types of wideband sensing techniques (Nyquist\
    \ / \nSub-Nyquist) will be briefly reviewed in this subsection. \n \n \n112 |\

    \ \nwideband \nsensing: \nNyquist \nwideband \nsensing is carried out using a\
    \ standard ADC operating at \nNyquist rate to digitize the wideband signal and\
    \ digital signal \nprocessing methods to detect spectral opportunities. It \n\
    includes, among other, wavelet-based detection, multi-band \njoint detection,\
    \ and filter bank detection: \nWavelet-based detection [87] determines spectrum\
    \ holes \nover a wide frequency band, which is assumed to be composed \nof a multitude\
    \ of sub-bands whose locations and power spectral \ndensities are unknown, by\
    \ using the wavelet transform. The \nlatter serves to identify discontinuities\
    \ that are located at the \nboundaries (edges) of each sub-band. The discontinuous\
    \ \nchanges on the edges correspond to irregularities in power \nspectral density.\
    \ As such, information about the locations and \nintensities of the sub-bands\
    \ can be retrieved through the \nwavelet transform and then their status (occupied\
    \ or \nunoccupied) can be deduced. \nConcerning the multiband joint detection\
    \ algorithm [88], it \nsenses the primary signal over multiple frequency channels\
    \ by \nperforming the following procedures: first, sampling the \nwideband signal\
    \ using a high sampling rate analog to digital \nconverter. Second, dividing the\
    \ sampled data into parallel data \nstreams by a serial-to-parallel converter.\
    \ Third, computing the \nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the digital signal. Fourth,\
    \ \ndividing the wideband spectrum into multiple sub-bands that \nare occupied\
    \ by narrowband signals. Finally, detecting \nspectrum opportunities over each\
    \ sub-band by using a \nnarrowband sensing scheme such as energy detection. \n\
    Furthermore, this technique allows to jointly determine the \noptimal threshold,\
    \ that maximizes the accuracy of sensing for \nall the sub-channels, by formulating\
    \ an optimization problem. \nAs for filter bank detection [89], a filter bank,\
    \ consisting of \na set of bandpass filters, is used to separate the wideband\
    \ signal \ninto multiple sub-bands. The bandpass filters are realized \nthrough\
    \ modulation (Poly-phase decomposition) of a prototype \nfilter. The prototype\
    \ filter is a lowpass filter that is used to \nimplement the zeroth band of the\
    \ filter bank. The obtained sub-\nbands are then sensed separately via a narrowband\
    \ sensing \nscheme. In this type of sensing, the sub-bands can be down-\nconverted\
    \ and consequently re-sampled at a lower sampling \nrate. However, a large number\
    \ of RF components will be \nadded, resulting in a high implementation complexity\
    \ [90]. \nWhile Nyquist wideband sensing allows to exploit \nefficiently the available\
    \ spectrum, it has certain limitations, \nincluding the requirement of a high\
    \ sampling rate (Wavelet-\nbased detection and multiband joint detection) and\
    \ the high \nimplementation complexity (Filter bank). \nb) Sub-Nyquist \nwideband\
    \ \nsensing: \nSub-Nyquist \nwideband sensing offers solutions to the challenges\
    \ facing \nNyquist-based sensing, more particularly high sampling rate \nand high\
    \ implementation complexity concerns. Sub-Nyquist \napproaches aim to identify\
    \ spectral opportunities by exploiting \nonly a few measurements derived from\
    \ processing wideband \nsignals at sampling rates less than the Nyquist rate.\
    \ \nAmong the most important Sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \ntypes is compressive-based\
    \ sensing [91–93]. The latter refers to \nthe process of recovering a sparse signal\
    \ from a few \nmeasurements by following a three-step procedure (sparse \nrepresentation,\
    \ measurement, and sparse recovery). In the first \nstep, the sparsity of the\
    \ signal is derived by projecting the \nsignal on an appropriate basis. In second,\
    \ only a reduced \nnumber of measurements are retrieved by multiplying the \n\
    sparse signal by a measurement matrix. In third, the signal is \nrecovered by\
    \ using the few collected measurements. Finally, \nthe sensing operation is performed\
    \ to identify the spectral \nopportunities. \nIt is noteworthy that the use of\
    \ comprehensive sensing, in \nthe context of wideband sensing, is enabled due\
    \ to the sparsity \nfeature that characterizes the wideband signal in the frequency\
    \ \ndomain. \nFurthermore, the reliability of sub-Nyquist wideband \nsensing schemes\
    \ depends largely on the accuracy of sparsity \nlevel estimation. Although, the\
    \ latter suffers from uncertainty \nbecause of various factors, mainly the dynamic\
    \ nature of PUs \ntransmission activities as well as wireless channel impairments.\
    \ \nD. Machine Learning for Spectrum Sensing \nAs pointed out earlier, CR is an\
    \ intelligent radio system that \nincorporates the three main components which\
    \ any intelligent \nsystem should have, namely perception, learning, and \nreasoning\
    \ [94]. Perception refers to the ability of the system to \nsense its radio environment\
    \ and it can be realized by means of \nsensing measurements of the spectrum. Learning\
    \ refers to the \nability of the system to convert the gathered information into\
    \ \nknowledge and it can be achieved through classification and \n113 | P a g\
    \ e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \ngeneralization algorithms.\
    \ Finally, knowledge is exploited by \nthe system to attain its objectives via\
    \ reasoning ability \n[94].Considering this intelligent design, machine learning\
    \ \nbased spectrum sensing presents itself as a good alternative to \ndetermine\
    \ the channel occupancy in Cognitive Radio Networks \nby addressing two main issues\
    \ which are classification and \ndecision making [94]. \nMachine learning algorithms\
    \ can be classified into two \nbroad groups: supervised learning and unsupervised\
    \ learning. \nIn supervised learning, a classifier learns from a training \ndataset\
    \ to make predictions on unforeseen data. According to \nthe training dataset,\
    \ supervised machine learning problems can \nbe further grouped into classification\
    \ and regression problems. \nIf the input variables are mapped to discrete output\
    \ values \n(categories, labels, classes…), then it is a classification \nproblem.\
    \ If the input variables are mapped to continuous \noutput values, then it is\
    \ a regression problem. Some examples \nof supervised algorithms include support\
    \ vector machines \n(SVM), Random forest, and naive Bayesian classifier (NBC).\
    \ \nAs for unsupervised learning, its main function consists in \nfinding patterns\
    \ in a set of untagged data. K-means is one of \nthe simplest and most widely\
    \ used unsupervised machine \nlearning algorithms. \nIn the context of Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks, several papers \nhave dealt with the use of machine learning\
    \ algorithms to \npredict the availability of frequency channels. For instance,\
    \ in \n[95], the authors performed a comparative analysis of different \nsupervised\
    \ and unsupervised machine learning algorithms \nbased on computational time and\
    \ classification accuracy. They \nalso proposed a new method that combines support\
    \ vector \nmachines with the firefly algorithm. The authors of [96] \nproposed\
    \ a deep learning approach to learn channel activities \nand predict its availability\
    \ in future time slots. The ability to \npredict the channel occupancy in the\
    \ next time slots may \nincrease the efficiency of selecting the more appropriate\
    \ \nchannel at the instant t (For example, choosing the channel \nhaving the highest\
    \ probability of being unoccupied in the next \ntime slots). \nGenerally, in the\
    \ case of spectrum sensing, researchers \nadopt a two-phase machine learning approach\
    \ [95,97]. In the \nfirst phase, an unsupervised learning technique, such as K-\n\
    means algorithm, is applied to discover the transmission \npatterns of primary\
    \ users. In the second phase, the discovered \nclusters (channel busy or free)\
    \ are used to train supervised \nlearning classifiers like support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) and \nthen to assign the new input data to the suitable cluster. it is\
    \ \nworth mentioning that in several works, the sensing clusters are \nassumed\
    \ to be known and thus the first phase is omitted. In this \ncase, the researchers\
    \ adopt a one-phase machine learning \napproach in which supervised learning techniques\
    \ are trained \nwith the already known clusters [98,99]. \nIn building machine\
    \ learning models for spectrum sensing, \nseveral features are used, including\
    \ energy statistic, probability \nvector, and occupancy over time. Obviously,\
    \ the accuracy of \ndetecting the primary users may be affected by the selected\
    \ \nfeatures. \nFinally, to evaluate the performance of a given model, a set \n\
    of metrics can be used mainly, probability of detection, \nprobability of false\
    \ alarm, total error rate, sensing time, and \naccuracy. \nE. Sensing Challenges\
    \ \nThis subsection is devoted to discussing the various \nchallenges related\
    \ to the spectrum sensing process in Cognitive \nRadio Networks as well as highlighting\
    \ some possible future \nresearch directions in this field. \n1) Hidden PU problem:\
    \ As the Carrier Sense Multiple \nAccessing (CSMA), which is characterized by\
    \ the presence of \nhidden node problem, spectrum sensing suffers also from \n\
    hidden primary user problem. The latter refers to the situation \nin which the\
    \ secondary user misses the primary user presence \ndue to many issues, including\
    \ severe multipath fading and \nshadowing effects experienced by primary signals,\
    \ during \npropagation from PU transmitter to SU receiver. As such, the \nsecondary\
    \ user may induce undesirable interference to \nprimary user receivers. In several\
    \ research papers, cooperative \nsensing has been proposed as a successful approach\
    \ to handle \nthis issue by exploiting spatial diversity [49,100]. \n2) Challenges\
    \ related to cooperative sensing: Cooperative \nsensing has proven to be effective\
    \ in improving the reliability \nand accuracy of detection, especially in the\
    \ case of the \npresence of channel impairments. Moreover, it has also been \n\
    shown to be useful in decreasing individual sensing durations \nand local processing\
    \ requirements [21,53]. \nDespite its different advantages, cooperation among\
    \ CR \nusers also brought many challenges and invoked significant \nresearches.\
    \ One of these challenges is mitigating the additional \nsignaling overhead and\
    \ reducing delays that are induced by the \ncooperation process [101]. \nAnother\
    \ challenge is to find a tradeoff between the number \nof users participating\
    \ in cooperation and additional processing \nrequirements. Indeed, a large number\
    \ of cooperative nodes can \nensure a high probability of detection, even in the\
    \ presence of \nchannel uncertainties and detectors with less sensitivity, but\
    \ it \nintroduces a considerable amount of extra overhead which \nleads to an\
    \ increase in the sensing time and processing. Hence, \nthere exists a compromise.\
    \ \nAnother challenge consists in developing asynchronous \ncooperative spectrum\
    \ sensing algorithms [102,103]. In fact, CR \nnodes are located at different positions\
    \ and may perform \nspectrum sensing at different times [104]. Therefore, CR nodes\
    \ \ncannot report their local sensing results to the fusion center at \nthe same\
    \ time and thus some of the reported information may \nnot be up to date [103].\
    \ Furthermore, there is always a time \noffset between the local observation and\
    \ the final decision \nwhich may incur performance degradation. In addition, \n\
    reporting channel uncertainties may impact negatively the \nsensing accuracy.\
    \ \n3) Spectrum sensing duration: Admittedly, a long sensing \nduration can guarantee\
    \ a higher accuracy for spectrum sensing \nresults, but it can compromise with\
    \ interference avoidance, \nenergy efficiency, and throughput. \n114 | P a g e\
    \  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nRegarding interference avoidance,\
    \ secondary users must be \naware promptly of the presence of the primary user\
    \ and vacate \nthe frequency band rapidly when the incumbent user resumes \nits\
    \ transmission in that band. Thus, a real trade-off arises \nbetween the quickness\
    \ with which the secondary user must \nperform the aforementioned tasks and the\
    \ required sensing \nduration to ensure more reliable results. \nConcerning energy\
    \ efficiency, the gain in accuracy \nachieved by a long sensing duration comes\
    \ at the expense of \nenergy. Hence, sensing duration and energy efficiency should\
    \ \nbe optimized. \nAs for throughput, it is inversely related to sensing time.\
    \ \nTherefore, there is a compromise between longer sensing \nduration for higher\
    \ performance and lower sensing duration for \ngood throughput. \nThese trade-offs\
    \ should be addressed jointly to find an \noptimum solution that ensure a higher\
    \ performance under \ncertain constraints. \n4) Noise \nuncertainty: \nSeveral\
    \ \nspectrum \nsensing \ntechniques rely on a threshold value to decide on the\
    \ presence \nof primary user signals. Hence, selecting the optimum \nthreshold\
    \ is crucial and important to ensure high accuracy of \nsensing results. To determine\
    \ the best threshold value, many \nparameters should be taken into consideration\
    \ such as noise \npower. The latter is uncertain and developing techniques that\
    \ \nare robust to noise uncertainty is still a challenging task. Some \nresearch\
    \ papers have addressed this issue using different \napproaches. For instance,\
    \ in [105] a blind spectrum sensing \ntechnique based on goodness of fit testing\
    \ of t‐distribution \nhas been proposed to cope with the noise uncertainty problem.\
    \ \n5) Complexity and hardware requirements: Several issues \nneed to be addressed\
    \ to bridge the gap between the theory and \nthe hardware implementation realities\
    \ of spectrum sensing \nschemes from both types, narrowband and wideband sensing.\
    \ \nThese include the complexity of narrowband sensing \ntechniques, mainly covariance-based\
    \ and cyclostationary \nfeature detection schemes, which require large processing\
    \ \npower that is unsuitable for portable devices. Hence, \nAdditional efforts\
    \ are required to reduce the complexity of \nthese techniques and take advantage\
    \ of their various benefits \nin real-life application. Besides, meeting the hardware\
    \ \nrequirements of wideband sensing schemes, like high-\nresolution ADCs and\
    \ high-speed signal processors, while \nmaintaining acceptable complexity and\
    \ moderate computation \npower, is a challenging task. \n6) Sparsity level uncertainty:\
    \ In wideband compressive \nsensing, estimating the accurate sparsity level is\
    \ of paramount \nimportance, since it is a prerequisite for determining the \n\
    optimal number of measurements. However, achieving this \nresult is very difficult,\
    \ especially in rapidly changing \nenvironments, due to random changes in spectrum\
    \ activities \nand time-varying fading channels. That may lead to calculate \n\
    the number of measurements using the worst-case sparsity \nlevel assumption, resulting\
    \ in high energy consumption and \ninefficient use of sub-Nyquist sampling technologies.\
    \ \nTherefore, developing blind sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \nschemes, in which\
    \ the estimation of sparsity level isn’t \nneeded, still a challenging task [90].\
    \ \nIn the literature, only a few papers have dealt with the issue \nof sparsity\
    \ level uncertainty. For instance, the authors of [106] \nproposed an algorithm\
    \ for estimating the sparsity level of the \nchannel over a learned dictionary\
    \ using Machine Learning \nalgorithms. \n7) Security: As with any wireless network,\
    \ Cognitive \nRadio Networks are vulnerable to various cybersecurity \nattacks\
    \ that can be performed by selfish or malicious users and \ninduce disruptive\
    \ effects on network operation. Selfish users \nexploit network facilities for\
    \ their interests, namely \nmonopolizing the use of available spectrum opportunities\
    \ and \nthus depriving legitimate Secondary users of their fair share of \nspectrum.\
    \ As for malicious users, they abuse network facilities \nby exploiting the existing\
    \ vulnerabilities and thereby \nhindering legitimate SUs from using the spectrum.\
    \ \nSome of the cybersecurity attacks in Cognitive Radio \nNetworks include most\
    \ active band (MAB), primary user \nemulation (PUE), and spectrum sensing data\
    \ falsification \n(SSDF) attacks. \nMost active band (MAB) attack aims at detecting\
    \ and \nmaking the most active band, in a multi-band CR network, \nunavailable\
    \ by targeting it via a denial of service (DoS) attack \nand consequently preventing\
    \ the other users (PU and SU) from \nusing it. The authors of [107] proposed a\
    \ coordinated \nconcealment strategy to counter this attack. In this strategy,\
    \ a \nset of SUs cooperate and transmit useless data in a free band to \nmake\
    \ it the most active and therefore the attacker's target. \nPrimary user emulation\
    \ (PUE) attack is an attack where a \nselfish or malicious node adjusts its air\
    \ interface to emulate \nprimary user characteristics and thus mislead secondary\
    \ users \nconcerning the availability of the spectrum holes [108]. During \nthe\
    \ sensing process, SUs, under this attack, may detect attacker \nsignals as primary\
    \ user signals and then refrain from using the \nspectrum. A range of countermeasures\
    \ against PUE attack has \nbeen \ninvestigated \nin \nthe \nliterature \n[109].\
    \ \nThese \ncountermeasures can be categorized into four types: \ncountermeasures\
    \ based on cryptography, countermeasures \nbased on fingerprint, countermeasures\
    \ based on game theory, \nand hybrid countermeasures that combine the three other\
    \ types \n[109]. \nSpectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack, also \n\
    known as Byzantine attack, specially targets cooperative \nspectrum sensing and\
    \ consists in compromising the fusion \ncenter with false spectrum sensing results\
    \ to deceive decision-\nmaking. In [110], a reputation-based approach, in which\
    \ the \nfusion center recognizes the malicious attackers and eliminates \nthem\
    \ from the data fusion process, was proposed to counter \nSSDF attack. \nWhile\
    \ significant efforts have been carried out to detect and \ncope with cybersecurity\
    \ issues, there are still several challenges \nthat need to be addressed, including\
    \ developing advanced \ntechniques that do not need prior knowledge about PU location\
    \ \n115 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n, as this\
    \ is not always available in real-world scenarios, \ndeveloping detection and\
    \ counter-measures methods based on \ncryptography that take into account resource\
    \ constraint (e.g., \npower and bandwidth), and developing spectrum sensing \n\
    techniques capable of differentiating between PU signals and \nmalicious user\
    \ signals. \nV. CR-BASED IOT \nThe wide variety of IoT technologies have led to\
    \ a rapidly \nincreasing number of networked devices that are expected to \nreach\
    \ 51.11 billion by 2023, according to research from Cisco \nstates (See Fig. 13).\
    \ Such devices involve daily tech gadgets \nsuch as smartphones and smart home\
    \ devices, as well as \nindustrial devices like smart machines and robots. These\
    \ smart \nconnected devices are capable of gathering, sharing, and \nanalyzing\
    \ information and creating actions accordingly. By \n2023, global spending on\
    \ IoT will reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollar \n[111]. This puts IoT at the core of\
    \ current and future social and \neconomic transformation. \nFurthermore, with\
    \ the massive proliferation of these \nconnected objects, there is an increased\
    \ demand for spectrum \nresources. Cognitive Radio proves to be a promising \n\
    technology to cater to current and future IoT devices in terms \nof spectrum access.\
    \ In this section, the integration of the \nInternet of Things and Cognitive Radio\
    \ is explored. \n \nFig. 13. IoT Connected Devices Installed base Worldwide from\
    \ 2015 to 2025 \n(in billions)3. \nA. Definition of IoT \nThe term \"Internet\
    \ of Things\" was coined by Kevin Ashton \nto depict “a system in which the Internet\
    \ is connected to the \nphysical world by ubiquitous sensors”4. \nInternet of\
    \ Things (IoT) can be defined as a network of \nobjects connected to the Internet\
    \ and can communicate with \neach other using different communication technologies.\
    \ These \nobjects are equipped with sensors, that allow interaction with \nthe\
    \ environment, and communication modules [112–114]. \nSome of those sensors include\
    \ temperature sensors, pressure \nsensors, proximity sensors, and humidity sensors.\
    \ \nToday, the IoT enables the real world and the virtual/or \ndigital world interconnection.\
    \ Thanks to IoT, things will \n3 https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-\n\
    the-internet-of-things/ \n4 https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3411\
    \ \ncommunicate with each other and develop their own \nintelligence. Televisions,\
    \ cars, kitchen appliances, surveillance \ncameras, smartphones, utility meters,\
    \ cardiac monitors, \nthermostats, and almost anything that we can imagine will\
    \ be \nconnected every day, everywhere and every time. \nThe idea of the IoT dates\
    \ back to 1999 [115] and became a \nreality due to several technologies and protocols,\
    \ including \nMachine to Machine (M2M), Wireless Sensor Networks \n(WSN), Radio\
    \ frequency Dentification (RFID), Internet \nProtocol version 6 (IPv6), IPv6 Low\
    \ power Wireless Personal \nArea Networks (6LoWPAN), Routing Protocol for Low-Power\
    \ \nand \nLossy \nNetworks \n(RPL), \nConstrained \nApplication \nProtocol(CoAP),\
    \ and Cognitive Radio that comes to empower \nthe IoT revolution. This revolution\
    \ gives birth to the \nproliferation of small devices such as sensors and actuators,\
    \ \nwith low consumption at lower cost, and a large number of \nplatforms allowing\
    \ users to develop their own applications. \nThus, the number of connected « things\
    \ » is increasing \nexponentially in the world (See Fig. 13). \nB. Motivations\
    \ behind the use of Cognitive Radio in the IoT \nCognitive Radio has a great potential\
    \ to address several \nissues and challenges related to the deployment of IoT\
    \ \nnetworks, namely, resource scarcity, interferences problem, \nlimited communication\
    \ range, purchasing license, storing and \nanalyzing the data generated by IoT\
    \ objects, heterogeneity, and \nreconfigurability and autonomicity. Dealing with\
    \ these issues \npresents the prime motivation behind the use of Cognitive \n\
    Radio in IoT. \nRegarding spectrum resources, it is difficult to allocate \nfrequency\
    \ bands to all the ever-increasing number of IoT \nobjects. CR address this issue\
    \ by enabling frequency reuse. \n As for the interference problem, most IoT technologies\
    \ \nsuch as RFID, IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) operates in UHF and \nISM frequency bands\
    \ which are already saturated and can’t \naccommodate more applications. Thus,\
    \ sharing these bands \nbetween a large number of objects creates inevitable \n\
    interferences. CR deal with this issue by enabling dynamic \nspectrum access to\
    \ interference-free channels. \nConcerning communication range, ISM unlicensed\
    \ bands \nallow wireless technologies to operate only over a limited \nrange.\
    \ Acquiring a frequency spectrum, that ensures \ncommunications over long distances,\
    \ requires the purchase of \nlicenses which generates superfluous expenses. CR\
    \ avoids the \npurchase of license and allows the opportunistic usage of \nunoccupied\
    \ bands that enables long-distance communications. \nIn terms of storing and analyzing\
    \ the data generated by IoT \nobjects, the objects must find communication links\
    \ to transmit \nthe generated information to numerous servers (Cloud servers).\
    \ \nCR is a proper solution to resolve this issue. \nWith respect to heterogeneity\
    \ problems, IoT applications \nrepresent a wide range of design options (resources,\
    \ \ndeployment, connectivity, energy, communication modality, \ninfrastructure,\
    \ network size, network topology...). Thus, new \ncommunication paradigms should\
    \ be designed to support this \nheterogeneity by providing environmental discovery,\
    \ self-\norganization, and self-management capabilities [116]. CR is \n116 | P\
    \ a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n                                          \
    \                 \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \none of these paradigms that can be\
    \ used to tackle heterogeneity \nissues. \nAnother reason is related to reconfigurability\
    \ and \nautonomicity. In fact, smart objects are expected to have the \ncapacity\
    \ to reconfigure. themselves without any external \naction. Thus, objects need\
    \ to be able to recognize and analyze \ntheir environment, detect neighboring\
    \ objects, and then \nreconfigure. themselves. CR proves to be a suitable solution\
    \ to \nfit these circumstances. \nTaking into account all of the above, it can\
    \ be concluded \nthat Cognitive Radio is genuinely a promising enabler \ntechnology\
    \ for IoT. \nC. IoT Applications and CR \nThe deployment of IoT products and services\
    \ will be \npresent in all sectors and industries, from the smart home to the\
    \ \nsmart city, education, health care, manufacturing, energy, \nutilities, commerce,\
    \ transportation, monitoring, supply chain, \nand logistics as illustrated in\
    \ Fig. 14. In general, the \nopportunities offered by IoT are unlimited and its\
    \ full impact \nand potential will be realized in the near future as more and\
    \ \nmore devices connect to the Internet. At present, there are few \nworks in\
    \ the literature dealing with potential applications of \nCR technology for IoT,\
    \ including military applications, \ncognitive radio-vehicular ad hoc networks\
    \ (CR-VANET), \nemergency networks, smart grids, smart metering, and medical \n\
    applications [117–123]. Table IV describes some IoT \napplications while demonstrating\
    \ how CR can be used to \naddress a number of their concerns. \nD. Open Research\
    \ Issues in CR-Based IoT \nSeveral open research issues need to be addressed in\
    \ order \nto take advantage of the full potential of Cognitive Radio for \nIoT\
    \ networks. In this subsection, some of these issues will be \ndiscussed. \n1)\
    \ Optimization of network resources: Efficient spectrum \nutilization, in the\
    \ context of a network composed of CR IoT \nnodes, requires the joint optimization\
    \ of a set of parameters \nsuch as transmission power, energy efficiency, transmission\
    \ \ndelay, and transmission data rate, which is a challenging task. \nThe authors\
    \ of [125] formulated an optimization problem to \nconverge to an optimal solution,\
    \ in a constrained environment, \nby taking into account three variables namely;\
    \ transmission \npower, transmission rate, and transmission delay. To solve this\
    \ \nproblem, they applied a branch-and-cut polyhedral approach. \nThe results\
    \ show that an increase in network and packet size \nleads to an increase in transmission\
    \ delay, power, rate, and \ninterference. \nFormulating and solving multi-objective\
    \ optimization \nproblems, considering a large number of factors, still need to\
    \ \nbe addressed. \n2) Energy efficiency: One of the main challenges that \nneed\
    \ to be addressed in CR-based IoT networks is energy \nefficiency. IoT objects\
    \ with cognitive radio capabilities \nconsume more energy due to performing additional\
    \ functions \nmainly spectrum sensing, which intensifies the power \nconsumption\
    \ issue, especially for energy-constrained nodes \nand battery-powered devices.\
    \ \n \nFig. 14. Applications of IoT. \nTABLE IV. \nCR CONTRIBUTION IN IOT APPLICATIONS\
    \ \nIoT application \nDescription and CR contribution \nSmart Grids [120,121]\
    \ \nSmart Grid is an electricity distribution network that allows the flow of\
    \ information between producers and consumers in order to \ncontrol and regulate\
    \ the flow of electricity in real time and enable more efficient management of\
    \ the electricity grid. The major \nchallenge of this technology is the transmission\
    \ of data through long distances without investing in the purchase of licenses\
    \ or the \ninstallation of cable trays. Cognitive radio offers a good solution\
    \ to this problem. \nSmart Homes [117] \nHomes will be equipped with smart objects,\
    \ allowing to carry out all daily task, such as smart lamps and smart fridges.\
    \ These \nobjects will integrate sensors endowed with cognitive capabilities that\
    \ help to avoid interference in the ISM band. \nHealthcare and Medical \nApplications\
    \ [122,123] \nSmart sensors are deployed to monitor critical data like blood pressure,\
    \ glucose levels, and temperature. With Cognitive Radio \nthis information can\
    \ be transmitted to medical staff in real time, over long distances without worrying\
    \ about spectrum availability. \nSmart Cities [119] \nThe smart city is a paradigm\
    \ of urban development which integrates information and communication technology\
    \ (ICT) and IoT \nsystems. In this paradigm, continuous connectivity should be\
    \ maintained. CRNs can be a good solution to support this \nrequirement. \nInternet\
    \ of Vehicles (IoV) \n[124] \nToday, the trends toward less dependence on human\
    \ beings have led us to the IoV paradigm in which vehicle control is achieved\
    \ \nthrough the integration of communications and embedded systems. The IoV is\
    \ supposed to be an autonomous travel decision-\nmaker. Safe navigation may be\
    \ possible in the future through vehicle-to-vehicle information exchange, vehicle-mounted\
    \ sensors, \nand user intentions. The challenge in IoVs is the availability of\
    \ spectrum for mobile vehicles. CRNs may be a good solution \nbecause of their\
    \ long-range and interference-free spectrum sensing. \n \n117 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nAmong the solutions that have been introduced to deal\
    \ with \nenergy efficiency concerns are energy harvesting or scavenging \nand\
    \ Cooperative Wireless Networks. Energy harvesting is \ndefined as the process\
    \ through which energy is extracted from \nexternal sources, such as wind and\
    \ solar energies, and then \nstored so as to be used as a source of power [126].\
    \ Energy \nharvesting is considered as one of the most enabling \ntechnologies\
    \ \nfor \nGreen \nComputing \nand \nreal-world \nimplementation of IoT. In [127]\
    \ a differential game model has \nbeen proposed to resolve the resource allocation\
    \ problem in \ncognitive WSN using energy harvesting. Optimal resource \nallocation\
    \ strategies for all SUs are obtained by determining \nthe loop Nash equilibrium\
    \ and the feedback Nash equilibrium \nsolutions of the proposed model. In [128],\
    \ a CR-based energy \nharvesting approach has been used to extend the battery’s\
    \ \nlifetime for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under reliability \nand secrecy\
    \ constraints. To reduce energy consumption, the \nenergy harvested is maximized\
    \ and the transmission energy \nconsumption \nis \nminimized \nby \nsolving \n\
    a \nformulated \noptimization problem. \nCurrently, Cognitive Radio networks based\
    \ on energy \nefficiency approaches are considered an important research \ndirection.\
    \ \n3) Security: Addressing security issues in CR-Based IoT \nnetworks is a prime\
    \ concern and a challenging task as most \nIoT objects are inherently heterogeneous\
    \ and have their proper \nuniform security standards. These standards are not\
    \ adequate \nfor all heterogeneous networks. Several privacy and security \naspects\
    \ should be taken into account in designing IoT systems, \nincluding authentication,\
    \ security assurance, and intrusion \nsoft-ware [117]. Worthy efforts have been\
    \ done to tackle \nsecurity issues in some IoT applications with cognitive radio\
    \ \ncapabilities. For instance, the authors of [129] proposed a \ndistributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum sensing approach to deal \nwith the security problem in\
    \ CR-VANETs. This approach uses \na weighted consensus-based spectrum sensing\
    \ technique with \ntrust assistance to ensure the reliability of spectrum sensing\
    \ \noperation in a hostile CR-VANET. The validity of the \nproposed approach was\
    \ approved by extensive simulations. In \n[128], the proposed CR-Based energy\
    \ management scheme for \nUAVs has been designed in such a way that the secrecy\
    \ and \nreliability of the system are ensured. This is illustrated by \nconsidering\
    \ the scenario for the eavesdroppers. \nSecurity remains an open issue to be addressed\
    \ as \ncybersecurity attacks and threats are emerging and increasing \nin parallel\
    \ with new technologies. Therefore, developing \ninnovative countermeasures is\
    \ demanded. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nNowadays, wireless network devices are emerging\
    \ at an \nunprecedented rate, which will further exacerbate spectrum \nshortages.\
    \ Therefore, addressing the spectrum scarcity problem \nbecomes more urgent. Cognitive\
    \ Radio is a promising \ntechnology to overcome this issue for futuristic networks\
    \ (IoT \nand 5G) by enabling an efficient, flexible, and opportunistic \nusage\
    \ of the scarce frequency spectrum. This paper provides a \nreview of Cognitive\
    \ Radio with emphasis is put on SDR, \nspectrum sensing, and CR-Based IoT. Concerning\
    \ SDR, this \narticle highlights its architecture, tools, advantages, and some\
    \ \nof its ongoing challenges. As for spectrum sensing, it is \nextensively reviewed:\
    \ spectrum opportunities considering \nmultiple dimensions are discussed, classification\
    \ of spectrum \nsensing based on several aspects is presented, Narrowband and\
    \ \nWideband sensing techniques are analyzed, ML-based \nspectrum sensing is studied,\
    \ and challenges and open research \ndirections are reviewed. Regarding CR-Based\
    \ IoT, the focus \nwas on explaining the motivations behind the use of CR in IoT\
    \ \nnetworks and reviewing some of the open issues related to CR-\nBased IoT.\

    Abstract: Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and network slicing are some of the principal
    concepts to realize the emerging applications in Beyond 5th Generation (B5G) and
    6th Generation (6G) networks. The frequency spectrum remains scarce and underutilized,
    while the performance requirements in terms of data throughput and latency of
    the network tenants have diversified. DSA allows for the efficient utilization
    of spectrum resources, while network slicing aims to serve network users with
    highly distinctive service needs. Lack of incentivization, sharing of spectrum
    resources among multiple operators, and lack of trust between operators are some
    of the challenges faced by centralized DSA approaches. Similarly, secure network
    slice orchestration, slice-isolation, secure access to network resources, privacy
    of user sensitive data, assuring the provision of Service Level Agreements (SLAs),
    are some of the challenges in existing network slicing techniques. Blockchain
    due to its innate capabilities can be a promising technology to solve the key
    issues pertaining to current DSA and network slicing approaches. Blockchain through
    smart contracts, provides traceability of network resources, auditability and
    accountability of network operators and service providers. Smart contracts facilitate
    the automation of resource sharing and network slice orchestration, while ensuring
    that SLAs are met, and network operators are compensated. This paper first provides
    a comprehensive overview of the DSA concept, the existing DSA techniques, and
    the challenges posed by these techniques. This is followed by a detailed description
    of network slicing, its key elements and architecture, various network slicing
    parameters, existing network slicing techniques and their challenges. Then an
    in- depth review on blockchain, its working principle, factors that affect blockchain
    implementation, and a comparison of various open-source blockchain platforms that
    support smart contracts is presented. This discussion is... (Show More) Typical

    is a limited and vital resource, and most of our electronic communications rely
    on it. Spectrum usage is increasing exponentially and thus the spectrum is becoming
    scarce. As per the Cisco Annual Internet Report (2018-2023) [1], the total number
    of internet users will increase from 3.9 billion in 2018 to 5.3 billion internet
    users in 2023. This is an increase of 35% in internet users in only five years.
    Furthermore, there will be a massive increase of 59% in networked devices from
    18.4 billion in 2018 to 29.3 billion in 2023, which is almost three times the
    predicted global population in 2023 [1]. Similarly, as per the International Telecommunication
    Union Radio-communication (ITU-R) report on traffic estimates from 2020 to 2030,
    the global mobile traffic is estimated to increase from 62 Exabytes (EB)/month
    to 607 EB/month by 2025 and reach 5016 EB/month by 2030 [2]. This immense growth
    in data requirements and the number of connected devices have resulted in a demand
    for higher bandwidth availability and new network resources. Therefore, spectrum
    scarcity and decentralized management of network resources have emerged as crucial
    challenges in this current era of hyper-connectivity with enhanced data and latency
    requirements [3]. Fixed spectrum allocation is the least efficient resource sharing
    method, as the spectrum becomes insufficient to serve all the users due to it
    being underutilized. For instance, to deploy and provide connectivity to billions
    of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, we need 76 GHz of spectrum resources for
    exclusive frequency allocation [4], [5], [6]. To increase spectrum utilization,
    the concept of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) networks was introduced [7]. With
    DSA, the spectrum required to provide connectivity to billions of IoT devices,
    reduces from 76 GHz to just 19 GHz [4], [5]. In 4 th Generation (4G) Long-Term
    Evolution (LTE), centrally managed DSA techniques, such as Cognitive Radios (CRs),
    Licensed Shared Access (LSA), Spectrum Access System (SAS) for Citizens Broadband
    Radio Service (CBRS), and TV White Spaces (TVWS) were proposed [5], [8], [9],
    [10], [11], and [12]. All these DSA techniques rely on a central control authority
    to gain access to the spectrum and thus introduce issues, such as bias, single-point-of-failure,
    lack-of-incentive-based sharing, breach of security, and additional signaling
    overhead in DSA networks. Therefore, the need for more decentralized approaches
    has gained attention in 5 th Generation New Radio (5GNR) and Beyond 5 th Generation
    (B5G). The issues related to centralized DSA techniques can be mitigated by introducing
    a decentralized and distributed solution for spectrum sharing. Recently, blockchain
    has gained massive popularity in this context due to its inherent capabilities
    such as immutability, decentralization, transparency, traceability, and no single
    point-of-failure. Blockchain-based DSA provides several advantages over the centralized
    DSA techniques, such as incentivization of the spectrum sharing mechanism, sharing
    of spectrum among multiple trustless entities, privacy protection of users and
    the sensitive data of users, fairness of the sharing mechanism, etc. [5], [8],
    [9], [10], [11], [13]. The development of B5G technologies and the emerging data-driven
    applications that 6 th Generation (6G) aims to support, have also contributed
    to this increase in traffic volume [14]. Global 5 th Generation (5G) rollout is
    currently underway where the focus of 5G networks is to achieve services such
    as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication
    (URLLC), and massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) or massive Internet-of-Things
    (mIoTs). These 5GNR services demand varying performance requirements, such as
    peak data rates of 10 Gbps in eMBB, URLLC with a latency of less than 1 ms in
    the Radio Access Network (RAN), while mMTC aims to have as many as 1 million connected
    devices per square kilometer [15]. 5GNR relies on key enabling technologies such
    as End-to-End (E2E) network slicing, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and
    Software Defined Networking (SDN) to realize these diverse services with varying
    data and latency requirements [16]. E2E Network slicing enables the network providers
    to provide the required services to these emerging applications and network tenants
    through the creation of multiple logical networks over the common physical infrastructure
    which span over multiple technical domains such as RAN, Transport Network (TN),
    Core Network (CN), and Network Management System [17], [18]. The security of network
    slice orchestration and the efficiency and transparency of resource allocation
    are prominent challenges in network slicing. Continuous monitoring of customer-devised
    Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is required to coordinate the service requirements
    and network capabilities [16]. This necessitates the need for a more decentralized
    slice orchestration mechanism. To this extent, blockchain-enabled network slicing
    has become increasingly popular. Blockchain enhances the security of network slice
    creation, safeguards the sensitive information of network tenants, reduces operational
    costs, and provides secure access to the services [19]. Fig. 1 presents a typical
    depiction of blockchain-based DSA and network slicing scenario. It shows the different
    5GNR services with distinct Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, such as high
    data throughput for eMBB slice users, high reliability and low latency for URLLC
    slice users, and massive connectivity for mMTC slice users. It depicts how blockchain
    through smart contracts can be deployed in slice manager to ensure the SLAs. It
    also depicts a blockchain-based DSA scenario. FIGURE 1. Typical depiction of a
    blockchain-based DSA and network slicing architecture. Show All 6G networks are
    expected to be more intelligent, secure, energy and spectrum efficient, scalable,
    reliable, and supporting a multitude of emerging applications [20]. 6G is envisioned
    to support peak data rates as high as 1 Tbps, an E2E latency of less than 1 ms,
    the E2E network reliability to be near 99.99999%, and to have as many as 10 million
    connected devices per square kilometer to support Internet-of-Everything (IoE).
    6G is envisioned to support newer applications and use cases, a few of which are
    discussed as follows [8], [20], [21], [22], [23]: Mobile Broadband Reliable Low
    Latency Communication (MBRLLC): Emerging applications, such as Extended Reality
    (XR), encompassing Virtual Reality VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), Brain-Computer
    Interactions (BCI), and Connected Robotics and Autonomous Systems (CRAS), not
    only require low latency and reliable communication, but also high data rates.
    Thus, for the above-mentioned mainstream 6G applications, eMBB and URLLC can be
    combined as MBRLLC to deliver high speed, reliability, and data rates [8], [20],
    [21]. Massive URLLC (MURLLC): To satisfy the newer applications, 6G envisions
    combining mMTC with URLLC and thus making a reliable, latency conscious, and scalable
    network for entertaining services such as IoE [8], [20], [21]. Human-Centric Services
    (HCS): For applications such as wireless BCI, HCS is envisioned which aims to
    define a new performance metric, Quality-of-Physical-Experience (QoPE), which
    determines the network performance based on human users [8], [20], [21]. Multi-Purpose
    Services (MPS): MPS envision the convergence of multiple functions of wireless
    communication as one, such as Communications, Computing, Control, Localization,
    and Sensing (3CLS) [8], [20], [21]. The above discussed ambitious use cases which
    are envisioned for 6G will be challenging to realize without the presence of efficient
    spectrum access and resource management mechanisms. To this extent, some potential
    schemes such as blockchain-based DSA and network slicing will be discussed, as
    well as the implementation challenges of 6G networks with respect to these schemes
    in Section V and VI of this paper. A. Existing Work In the recent research efforts,
    blockchain has been considered as an efficient solution for many emerging wireless
    network applications, such as improving security, enhancing automation, and reducing
    issues pertaining to the centralized control of the application processes [24],
    [25]. Current surveys in the domain of blockchain-based solutions for decentralized
    applications, lack an in- depth discussion on the application of blockchain through
    smart contracts for enhancing the performance of DSA and network slicing, as well
    as in addressing the issues that arise with the centralized control of these applications.
    In [26], authors have provided a detailed survey on E2E network slicing, which
    encompasses the network slicing modelling for RAN, CN, and TN. This survey [26],
    also provides a general structure of network slicing modelling as suggested by
    the ETSI NGP workgroup and how a network slice is ordered through the service
    graph, as well as the in- depth network slicing models for RAN, CN, and TN are
    provided. Furthermore, the authors in [26] have identified key issues pertaining
    to the conventional network slicing orchestration methods, such as security and
    isolation. But this survey lacks the discussion on other potential 6G schemes
    like DSA and blockchain. In [27], various use-cases of blockchain as a solution
    for decentralized applications in 5GNR and beyond such as network coding, authentication,
    infrastructure sharing, spectrum sharing, and network slicing are described. Furthermore,
    a detailed overview of blockchain technology and its characteristics that results
    in blockchain being an effective solution for decentralized applications is provided.
    But this survey does not provide any discussion on other spectrum management schemes
    like DSA. In [28], numerous solutions for Blockchains interoperability are surveyed
    which are based on smart contracts. This survey aims to provide a detailed discussion
    on how different Blockchains can achieve interoperability by employing smart contracts.
    However, it did not discuss the application of blockchain for many decentralized
    applications. In [29], the application of blockchain as a Distributed Ledger Technology
    (DLT) for network slicing is presented. The authors provide an overview of blockchain
    and network slicing. They have also shown how blockchain can be implemented for
    network slicing. But they have not discussed any other use-case of blockchain
    in 5GNR and beyond. In [13], the blockchain implementation for spectrum sensing
    and spectrum sharing is presented. However, the work in [13] lacks a discussion
    on different blockchain platforms that are available and how to use them for spectrum
    sharing, including the use of smart contract based blockchain platforms. Table
    1 highlights the contributions and scope of the related surveys and our work.
    TABLE 1 Summary of Related Surveys and Their Scope B. Our Contribution As evident
    from the discussion provided above, the existing research lacks a comprehensive
    overview of the key-enabling technologies DSA and network slicing for B5G and
    6G networks, as well as their integration with blockchain. Blockchain when deployed
    in these applications, can enhance the spectrum utilization and ensure the provision
    of the required QoS. The recent surveys also lack a discussion about different
    open-source blockchain platforms that provide a smart contract development environment.
    Furthermore, there lacks a discussion about the various implementation features
    of blockchain that facilitate in its implementation for applications like network
    slicing and DSA. In summary, the prominent contributions of this survey article

    SECTION II. Dynamic Spectrum Access The spectrum is divided into two distinctive
    frequency groups for the deployment of 5GNR and B5G networks. One group comprises
    of frequencies lower than 7.225 GHz, and the other group is composed of frequencies
    ranging between 24.25–52.6 GHz. The higher frequencies band can offer high data
    rates as supported in millimeter wave communication, but its transmission range
    is short. This poses other challenges, such as interference management and mitigation.
    For most, long-distance communications, the lower frequency group is the one that
    is preferred, but it is underutilized due to fixed spectrum allocations. To resolve
    the spectrum under-utilization problem, DSA has been proposed as an effective
    way to enhance the spectrum usability [30]. DSA is the process that enables the
    use of spectrum holes through spectrum sensing and real-time management of network
    resources. The aim here is to enhance the resource utilization efficiency and
    support the opportunistic access of spectrum resources without the need for additional
    bandwidth [31]. In this section, we will discuss several different techniques
    for DSA that have been proposed in the past, their drawbacks, and what could be
    a better solution for the challenges posed by DSA in 6G networks. A. Existing
    Approaches to DSA Various DSA techniques have evolved to enhance spectrum utilization.
    From opportunistic access approaches, such as a few different schemes in CRs,
    and LSA, to cooperative sharing schemes which are based on databases, such as
    TVWS and CBRS [32]. For instance, service-based incentives were exploited for
    spectrum sharing between incumbent and secondary users in [33], [34], [35]. Whereas
    [36] presents an analytical case study based on game theoretic analysis of LSA
    to demonstrate the energy and spectral efficiency of the scheme. A game theory-based
    DSA technique for enhancing spectrum utilization is proposed in [37]. Firstly,
    the network is trained using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep Q-network
    with a fairness incentive mechanism for optimal DSA. Then based on the trained
    model, spectrum is allocated to user for maximum utilization of resources. Similarly
    in [38], a deep reinforcement learning based distributed DSA mechanism is proposed.
    A spectrum access system is designed which aims to maximize network utility while
    limiting message exchange among users. The design parameters are established through
    a game-theoretic analysis of the system attributes. In [39], various auction-based
    mechanisms for DSA in cognitive radio networks have been proposed. Several auction-based
    methods for spectrum sharing have been discussed such as: One-sided spectrum auctions
    in which there is one spectrum seller and multiple buyers. Double-sided spectrum
    auctions in which there are multiple sellers and buyers with an intermediate operator
    playing the role of the auctioneer. Online spectrum auctions where the bids are
    placed continuously, and the auctioneer must take a decision about allocation
    and payment instantly. Dynamic spectrum auctions in which the auction mechanism
    is dynamically modified to enhance the performance of the mechanism. These methods
    enhance the spectrum utilization in CRs networks. Similarly, other DSA techniques,
    such as In-Band Full-Duplex (IBFD) scheme for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) in
    the CBRS band have been examined in [10]. In this CBRS Mobile Broadband Network
    (MBN), a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar system represents the Incumbent
    Access (IA) users, while the Priority Access License (PAL) and General Authorized
    Access (GAA) users are specified in terms of IBFD-based MIMO MBN. A joint beamformer
    is designed with constraints on transmit and detection probability of IA users
    to satisfy the QoS requirement of the PAL and GAA users and reduce the interference
    caused by the radar system towards the MBN. It enhances the conventional SAS for
    CBRS three-tier spectrum sharing regime. It also improves the QoS requirements
    and performance of PAL and GAA users while limiting the interference incurred
    on IA users. However, the IBFD-CBRS scheme introduces new challenges, such as
    security of the sensitive information shared by the IA users, such as for military
    communication, and new MAC layer protocols are required for adaptation of the
    IBFD scheme. Recognizing and classifying interfering signals is another open issue.
    The most advanced DSA techniques utilize blockchain as a solution, but these are
    discussed later in Section V of this paper. B. Challenges of Centralized DSA Approaches
    The centralized DSA techniques present certain challenges as these approaches
    demand a central management system to ensure QoS of the incumbent user. Few of
    these challenges are mentioned as follows [40], [41], [42]: centralized control
    requires additional signaling overhead; addition of new infrastructure; sharing
    of sensitive user data such as identity and geo-locations; interference management;
    centralized control of access leads to bias and untrustworthiness of the network
    administrators; risk of exposure of sensitive user information; single-point-of-failure,
    among other challenges. In this section, we discussed one of the key-enabling
    techniques for realizing the emerging B5G and 6G applications, that is DSA. We
    further mentioned some existing DSA approaches, followed by the drawbacks of centralized
    DSA techniques. In the following section, we will provide an overview of another
    5GNR key enabling technology, which is network slicing. SECTION III. Network Slicing
    A. Motivation A multitude of applications with varying data, latency, and QoS
    requirements are emerging with the advent of 6G. Spectrum resources are limited
    and the 6G use case scenarios such as e-health, vehicle-to-everything communication,
    smart cities, smart factories, and mIoTs connectivity, have different QoS requirements
    [43]. Network slicing is a mechanism in 5GNR that enables the service providers
    to meet the diverse service requirements of a broad range of Network Service Customers
    (NSC). In network slicing the end-to-end network is divided into multiple logical
    networks called network slices. A network slice consists of multiple Virtual Network
    Functions (VNFs). These VNFs consist of resource blocks from different layers
    such as access, transport, and core layer. Furthermore, these VNFs must be managed
    and isolated from the other VNFs of slices, while ensuring security, QoS, and
    other aspects of the network slice [29], [44]. Each VNF performs a specific network
    task from Access Network (AN) to the CN to fulfil the agreed-upon SLAs between
    the network tenant and the service provider. Each network slice configures the
    E2E network resources to deliver the required service in terms of throughput,
    latency, QoS, and reliability [45]. E2E network slicing offers numerous advantages
    to network operators and allows them to serve the commercial users as per their
    diverse data and latency demands, but at a low cost with better flexibility and
    swiftness [18], [46]. For instance, high data throughput would concern some commercial
    users. While for others, low latency and seamless communication would be desirable,
    and for some users, massive device connectivity might be crucial for their operation
    [18]. Hence by further optimizing and automating the network slice creation, modification,
    and management process, additional gains in terms of QoS and performance can be
    achieved. Network slice management can allow the network operators to fully utilize
    their physical resources through efficient management and allocation of their
    spare resources to the network slice instances. Automation along with resource
    management can maximize profits while maintaining or lowering the cost of deployment
    [18]. B. Key Attributes In this subsection, we will discuss the key attributes
    of network slicing. Network slicing relies on two enabling technologies: NFV and
    SDN [47]. We first define NFV and SDN, followed by brief definitions of the key
    attributes of network slicing. 1) NFV Traditional networks comprise Network Functions
    (NFs) that are implemented on vendor specific software and hardware and are also
    known as network elements or nodes. NFV decouples software from the hardware,
    thus making the software network nodes independent of the hardware network nodes.
    This assists in modifying both nodes separately. Due to this decoupling, the infrastructure
    resources can be shared and reassigned, thus enabling both the software and hardware
    to perform distinct functions at different times. This further facilitates the
    network operators to deploy latest services over the common physical infrastructure
    [48]. 2) SDN SDN is a network architecture that allows the network to be controlled
    centrally through software applications such as Application Programming Interfaces
    (APIs), regardless of the underlying technologies. Thus, network operators can
    manage and control the whole network consistently. SDN achieves this by separating
    the control plane from the data plane. By decoupling the control plane and data
    plane, the network switches become mere forwarding devices, and network control
    is implemented in a logically centralized controller. This separation between
    SDN controller and network switches is achieved by programming interfaces such
    as OpenFlow [49]. 3) E2E Service The E2E service provision attribute of network
    slicing ensures that the requested E2E performance by the slice customer should
    be provided, and if a specific Network Service Provider (NSP) does not have the
    control over the required E2E network resources, then multiple NSPs must reach
    to an agreement and stitch together the required network resources in order to
    fulfil the agreed upon SLAs [29], [44]. 4) Network Resources The network slice
    consists of VNFs comprising network resources spanned over multiple technical
    domains, from access, to transport, and to the core layer of the network. These
    resources could comprise of virtual resource blocks, computing resources, storage,
    and other network components [29], [44]. 5) Programmability SDN and NFV can simplify
    network management and service provision and enable integration and operability
    of multiple networks to support communication services. They facilitate real-time
    service customization, and they control the allotted network slice resources through
    open APIs [50]. 6) Automation Automation allows the dynamic and on- demand configuration
    of network slices without manual intervention. The automation process relies on
    a signaling-based technique, which enables the third parties to put in network
    slice requests and mention the main performance requirements in the SLAs. Through
    automation techniques, network slice creation, deployment, and management processes
    are automated [47]. 7) Isolation For E2E network slicing, it is crucial to keep
    the network resources allocated to one slice isolated from the other slices. Isolation
    ensures the QoS and performance agreement, as multiple logical slices are created
    over the same shared network resources and each network tenant can have variable
    capacity and latency requirements. However, achieving slice isolation is a critical
    task and it introduces performance degradations, such as reduction in multiplexing
    gain and inefficient use of network resources to achieve explicit resource separation
    [51]. 8) Customization The network resources allotted to the network slice instances
    must be able to adapt to the varying needs of a wide range of services. The allocated
    resources can be scaled up or down as per the diverse requirements of the network
    tenants. This kind of resource customization ensures that the SLA requirements
    are met [52]. C. Architecture of Network Slicing To support a multitude of applications
    and provide particular services to the end users, NFV and SDN are used to create,
    partition, and manage the physical infrastructure elements comprising software
    and hardware network components such as computational, storage, and communication
    resources [53]. Each slice has unique properties such as its design, packet capacity,
    and signal processing capabilities to serve particular users with variable performance,
    functionality, and isolation demands [54]. Let us now briefly discuss the operational
    layers of network slicing architecture. 1) Layers of Network Slicing Architecture
    According to Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) [55], the network slicing
    architecture consists of three layers. These operational layers of network slicing
    are discussed below and shown in Fig. 3 [46], [54], [55]. Resource/Infrastructure
    Layer: This layer is responsible for providing the required physical and VNF resources
    for creating the service instance to serve the end users as per their demands.
    These resources comprise of communication and computational resources, storage
    etc. [46], [53]. Network Slice/Partition Instance Layer: This layer runs on top
    of the resource/infrastructure layer. It provides the necessary network capabilities
    for the service instance layer. A network operator creates a network slice instance,
    and it is shared by multiple service instances. Network slice instances combine
    to form E2E logical network slices [46], [53]. Service Instance Layer: This layer
    is composed of end-users and other services that are required to be served by
    the network operator or by a third party. There is a service instance for each
    service and the service instance layer runs on top of the network slice instance
    layer and resource layer [46], [53]. FIGURE 3. Network slicing operational layers
    [55]. Show All D. Network Slicing Parameters E2E network slicing involves the
    virtualization of network resources which spans over multiple network elements,
    from RAN to CN, and TN to User Equipment and network operators [18], [46]. The
    network parameters that may be configured as SLAs for network slicing implementation
    as per the GSMA white paper [18] are: the maximum data throughput that can be
    achieved, the minimum signal latency, the highest number of users that can be
    served, the availability of resources, in cases of any limits on time and place
    utilization, and the availability of support for voice and mobility capabilities.
    For the creation of a network slice through the virtualization techniques, a logical
    network is created consisting of either dedicated or shared NFs of the 5G Stand-Alone
    (SA) network and the network resources such as computational and storage resources,
    signal propagation resources, and bandwidth allocation in transport network [18].
    E. Existing Network Slicing Techniques In this subsection, we present some of
    the existing network slicing techniques, from deep learning and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) based techniques to opportunistic resource allocation-based network slicing.
    For enhanced resource utilization while satisfying user’s QoS requirements, a
    deep learning based Deep-Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for dynamic network slice creation
    for users with heterogeneous service demands is proposed in [56], [57]. Similarly,
    a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based network slicing mechanism for Vehicle-to-Vehicle
    (V2V) communication is proposed in [58]. An AI-based approach for RAN slicing
    is proposed in [59], for the Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs). A DRL-based
    network slicing solution for resource allocation for smart grids is proposed in
    [60]. A network slicing technique based on opportunistic access of a shared channel
    is proposed in [61], to simultaneously enhance the spectrum utilization. The most
    recent network slicing approaches are based on a blockchain implementation, but
    these are discussed later in Section VI of this paper. F. Challenges of Existing
    Network Slicing Techniques A centralized control-based slice manager can introduce
    certain challenges pertaining to the provision of required SLAs and security of
    the slice orchestration process. With regards to E2E network slice creation, there
    exist two major challenges; isolation and security. Slice isolation is a multi-dimension
    challenge. Firstly, performance isolation requires that the SLAs per slice are
    ensured, regardless of the network load of other slices. Secondly, there must
    exist isolation between network resources which are allocated to various slices.
    And lastly, isolation of slice security, which requires that any attack on one
    network slice does not affect the security of other slices [18], [51]. In the
    next section, we will provide an in- depth review of blockchain technology, which
    is the key enabler for achieving decentralization in the emerging B5G and 6G applications.
    In Section V and VI we will discuss how blockchain can be a potential solution
    to resolve the issues pertaining to centralized approaches for DSA and network
    slicing. SECTION IV. Blockchain In this section, we will provide a detailed overview
    of blockchain technology. We begin by defining the key aspects and elements of
    blockchain architecture, its working principle, and different types of blockchain.
    We then discuss various factors that affect the blockchain implementation, and
    a comparison of various open-source blockchain platforms. We conclude this Section
    with a brief discussion on various applications of blockchain in 6G networks.
    A. History and Overview of Blockchain The term blockchain has been in use since
    2008 when it was first revealed by Satoshi Nakamoto in his paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer
    Electronic Cash System” [62]. However, the concept of creating a secure chain
    of digital blocks has been in existence since 1991, when it was proposed by Stuart
    Haber et al. with the primary aim to digitally time stamp the electronic documents
    in a distributed manner to protect them against any kind of tampering [63], [64],
    [65]. Blockchain technology started to gain massive popularity in the last decade
    [66]. In the earlier years, blockchain had just been used as a DLT to store digital
    transactions without requiring a trusted third party or central control. However,
    blockchain is being used in a variety of different applications beyond cryptocurrency,
    such as for resource sharing, eHealth services, IoTs, security, network slicing
    [25], [67]. Blockchain has been identified and considered as a key-enabler for
    6G communication networks [9]. Blockchain, due to its inherent capabilities such
    as decentralization, auditability, immutability, traceability, and transparency,
    has been integrated with 5GNR and B5G networks by providing E2E services to the
    users. The potential use cases of blockchain in B5G and 6G networks are resource
    management, spectrum sharing, network slicing, authentication, tracking, record
    keeping, infrastructure sharing, and secure control of access [68]. Blockchain
    gives an additional advantage over traditional spectrum sharing by providing a
    secure and incentive-based sharing mechanism. The transactions are monitored and
    tracked, and a distributed ledger is maintained to ensure fairness in the system
    [69], [70], [71]. Furthermore, to deal with the challenges posed by a multitude
    of different applications with diverse performance, security, and mobility requirements,
    network slicing enables a division of the physical infrastructure into multiple
    virtual networks [72]. Blockchain-enabled network slicing ensures the security
    of network slice orchestration and provides secure admission control. These network
    slices provide a customized user experience with specific requirements [27]. 1)
    What is Blockchain? Blockchain is a decentralized, unchangeable, distributed ledger
    that can record a transaction and keep track of the resources in a business network
    [73]. These transaction records are stored on time-stamped, unchangeable, digital
    blocks. These digital blocks of data are connected to form a chain, which is called
    blockchain. Blockchain is maintained by the network nodes. Each node has a copy
    of the blockchain, thus enabling tracking and maintaining a record of transactions
    [74]. In the following sub-section, we will discuss in detail the key elements
    of blockchain architecture, and its operating principle. B. Key Elements of Blockchain
    Architecture To fully understand how blockchain works, we need to review the key
    elements of its architecture, which are: 1) Peer-to-Peer Network A Peer-to- Peer
    (P2P) network consists of a distributed network of connected computing devices.
    P2P devices do not have a central controlling node or a server where data is stored.
    Each node acts as a server and a client by sharing its data with other nodes in
    the P2P network. Each node stores its data in its storage and does not rely on
    a server for storing data. Each node in a P2P network possesses equal capabilities
    in terms of sharing, receiving, and transferring of data and thus is less prone
    to cyberattacks and single-point-of-failure [64], [75]. 2) Node A node can be
    a computer system in a P2P network where all nodes are linked to each other in
    a distributed manner having equal capabilities. The main task of a node is to
    verify and process all the transactions [25]. 3) Hash A hash function calculates
    a fixed length cryptographic string called hash from any kind of data, which can
    either be a sentence or a whole file. Hash chains the digital blocks of data together
    and prevents tampering with the data. Even if a single transaction is tampered
    with, the resulting hash will change indicating that the data integrity is lost
    [74], [76]. 4) Transactions This is the most basic element of blockchain. Blockchain
    technology’s purpose is to be able to access and verify transactions which happened
    in the past. A transaction can be a payment record containing critical information
    about the sender and the receiver, the time stamp marking the completion of transaction
    [25]. A transaction is approved through a method called consensus, and there are
    different algorithms to reach a consensus to approve and validate a transaction
    [77]. These consensus algorithms will be discussed later in detail. 5) Miners
    Adding a transaction to the block consumes substantial amount of computing power
    and resources. Miners are the network nodes/individuals who process blocks. The
    process of solving for the verification of a block is called mining [78], [79].
    6) Block Blocks are the units that are linked together to form a blockchain. Each
    block has two main components, a block header and its data that comprises numerous
    transactions. Each block contains the following information: A block version number,
    containing the policies used for block validation. Timestamp, indicating the creation
    time of that particular block. nBits or target hash, the threshold target for
    a valid block hash. Nonce, is the abbreviation for “number only used once”. The
    nonce is the number that the blockchain miners/nodes are trying to solve. Before
    any block is verified, a nonce is calculated, and the node which calculates the
    nonce first receives the reward. Miners go through several solutions to obtain
    the correct nonce, and this process is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). Merkle tree
    root hash, which is calculated from all the transactions in a particular block.
    If any transaction is modified, the Merkle tree root hash will get modified as
    well. Previous block hash field, which contains the hash of the previous already
    verified block, hence forming a chain which provides security and integrity. Current
    block hash, which is calculated from all the transactions present in the block
    as well as the hash of the previous block [25], [78], [79]. 7) Consensus Algorithm
    Consensus algorithm or consensus protocol is a procedure that takes place when
    a new block is added to the blockchain. The addition of a new block requires a
    consensus from all the participating nodes in the P2P network to reach an agreement.
    Consensus in blockchain is majority-based, so when at least 51% of the network
    nodes agree to the verification and addition of a new block, the block is verified
    and then added to the blockchain. Various types of consensus algorithms are present
    which are implemented based on the specific type and performance requirements
    of a blockchain framework, such as PoW, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Authority
    (PoA), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), LibraBFT, etc. PoW is the basis
    of Bitcoin cryptocurrency blockchain. PoW is highly decentralized and secure,
    but it is not scalable, as it requires a huge amount of computational power and
    storage capacity. Recently new algorithms such as PoS have been implemented which
    focus on reducing energy consumption and decreasing the computations required
    to add a new block to the chain [9], [27]. 8) Smart Contract A smart contract
    is an executable computer code stored on blockchain, and it runs autonomously
    once some predefined conditions are satisfied. Nick Szabo created Smart Contracts
    in 1994 and they allows the participating nodes in a blockchain to make transactions
    without the control of a central entity. Smart contracts promote automated decentralization
    while also ensuring that the terms of the agreement, also known as SLAs, between
    trustless parties are met. When a smart contract is stored in blockchain, it ensures
    its authenticity and integrity [9], [27], [74], [80]. 9) Oracle An oracle is a
    device or entity that provides services for connecting blockchain and real-world
    data. For the smart contract to execute based on some off-chain real-time data,
    oracle provides the required data inputs and outputs from the real-world to meet
    the specific conditions of a smart contract, and thus enable the smart contract
    to execute [74], [81]. C. Blockchain Working Principle After defining the key
    elements that constitute a blockchain, we will discuss how to create a block and
    how these elements are chained together to form a blockchain. Fig. 4 depicts the
    working principle of blockchain [68]. A blockchain is a distributed database,
    shared among all the participating connected nodes forming a P2P network as shown
    in Fig. 4. Each node possesses the same copy of that database. Therefore, it is
    impossible to alter an added block since all the nodes can verify if any record
    is altered. The first block in the blockchain is called the Genesis block, and
    it does not contain the hash of the previous block. But for adding the next block
    to the chain, multiple nodes/miners compete against each other to find the nonce.
    The winner is selected through a consensus algorithm, such as PoW. The winner
    is rewarded with some predefined incentive, and the block is added to the blockchain.
    The new block contains the hash of the previous block; hence any kind of alteration
    can be detected and thus it makes it immutable. Fig. 4 shows that every new block
    that is created holds the hash of the previous block in its header. Furthermore,
    all the nodes are connected in a P2P network, thus each node stores a copy of
    the blockchain, which makes it immutable [82]. FIGURE 4. Blockchain working principle
    depicting the creation of chain of blocks. Show All D. Types of Blockchain There
    are different types of blockchains which are implemented based on their application.
    These are briefly discussed in this sub-section. 1) Public Blockchain In a public
    blockchain or “permissionless” blockchain, anyone can join, view the ledger, and
    write to the blockchain. A public blockchain can be adopted for network slicing
    and spectrum sharing to service the users within the service domain of a single
    operator. It can also find its application in smart cities, smart energy, etc.
    to develop trust among connected communities [83]. 2) Private Blockchain This
    is also called as “permissioned” blockchain, and it is managed by a “trusted”
    intermediary node, allowing only the invited nodes from a specific organization
    to join. Private blockchains can be implemented for services that are limited
    to a specific organization, with particular requirements and regulations, such
    as e-health services, etc. [84]. 3) Consortium Blockchain This is also known as
    “federated” blockchain, and it is a combination of both public and private blockchains.
    Instead of a single organization, multiple organizations join this blockchain
    through permission and are governed by a single trusted node. The consortium blockchain
    is the solution when spectrum is shared among multiple operators, where each operator
    runs a public blockchain for its own users and a private blockchain is implemented
    among multiple operators for regulatory purposes and to build trust among the
    operators [64], [74], [85]. E. Blockchain Implementation The fundamental goal
    behind blockchain implementation is to attain three basic properties that are:
    scalability, decentralization, and security. However, attaining all these three
    properties in a single blockchain implementation is challenging, and this challenge
    in blockchain implementation is also termed “Vitalik’s blockchain scalability
    trilemma” which is shown in Fig. 5 (Vitalik is the co- founder of Ethereum) [85],
    [86]. According to Vitalik, usually, only two out of these three properties can
    be achieved in a blockchain implementation, through simple methods [85]. In this
    sub-section, we will discuss the factors that impact blockchain implementation,
    followed by an overview of various open-source blockchain platforms that are available.
    FIGURE 5. Vitalik’s blockchain scalability trilemma [85]. Show All 1) Factors
    Affecting Blockchain Implementation Applications which have their back-end code
    running on a decentralized network, are called Decentralized Applications (DApps)
    [87]. In recent years, multiple blockchain open-source platforms have been developed,
    which can be employed based on their specific applications requirements. Each
    blockchain has distinct characteristics, and based on those characteristics, we
    decide which implementation is best suited for our specific DApp. The factors
    that impact the decision while choosing which blockchain implementation is suitable
    for a specific application are discussed below, and they are depicted in Fig.
    6: Type of Blockchain: The first thing when choosing a specific blockchain is
    its type, such as a public, private, or consortium blockchain. Many applications
    require a permissionless blockchain, where any user/node can join and read/write
    on the blockchain. While some applications require a permissioned blockchain solution,
    such as for enterprise applications where only a few trusted users/nodes are allowed
    to join the blockchain. Many inter-company applications demand hybrid solutions,
    where a federated blockchain implementation is the most suitable, such as e-Health
    systems [88]. Scalability, Security, and Decentralization: The next factor that
    impacts the blockchain implementation is the attainment of these three capabilities.
    As discussed earlier, through simpler solutions, only two of these three capabilities
    are usually attainable. There are already available open-source blockchain platforms,
    but most of them lack at least one of these three attributes. Most public blockchain
    platforms are highly secure and decentralized, but they are not scalable, since
    storing and processing public Blockchains requires huge storage and computational
    resources. In a similar way, private blockchain platforms are scalable and secure,
    but they lack the decentralized aspect of the blockchain. In a private blockchain,
    there is a central controlling node which decides which nodes can stay and participate
    in the blockchain, thus it is compromised on decentralization. Some of these open-source
    platforms will be discussed in detail later in this Section [89], [90]. Smart
    Contract Development Environment: Smart contracts are self-executable computer
    programs that employ blockchain to store the terms of the contracts. Once the
    predefined conditions in the smart contract are met, the program executes itself,
    thus removing the need for a third party or central control to enforce the terms
    [91]. Several blockchain open-source platforms are available, each with different
    characteristics, some are private, some are public, and many of these platforms
    support a smart contract development environment, but there are quite a few which
    do not support smart contracts. Thus, this becomes a crucial factor when deciding
    which blockchain implementation will be compatible with a specific DApp [92],
    [93]. Transactions per Second (TPS): Another key factor is the TPS rate of the
    blockchain platform. In this context, TPS means how many transactions is a blockchain
    platform able to process in one second. Many of the public and highly decentralized
    blockchain platforms have a lower TPS rate, which means that the time to process
    a single transaction is high. For time-sensitive DApps, such a platform with low
    TPS might not be suitable [94]. Transaction Cost: Transaction cost or transaction
    fees were introduced to speed up the transaction validation process. The transaction
    fee depends upon the size of the data block, as well as the time required to validate
    the transaction. Therefore, if a block’s data size is large, and it needs to be
    validated in a shorter time, then the transaction fee will be higher. Transaction
    fees facilitate transaction processing, help to pay the miners, and reduce the
    number of spam transactions [95], [96]. The transaction fee in the Ethereum platform
    is calculated in terms of ‘Gas.’ Gas is the computing power required to complete
    a specific transaction. Each gas unit has a price that can be measured in gwei.
    For the case of Bitcoin, the pricing is calculated in terms of Satoshis. While
    deciding which blockchain platform would be suitable for a specific application,
    we need to analyze how many times the app will need to interact with the blockchain,
    and what will be the cost burden per transaction [27], [97]. Confirmation Time:
    The time between when a transaction is submitted to the blockchain network and
    the moment it is recorded on a validated block is called confirmation time. This
    is the time which a user will have to wait after submitting the transaction until
    a miner validates the transaction and adds it to the block. A user can expedite
    the confirmation time by paying a higher transaction fee [98]. Consensus Algorithm:
    The purpose of the consensus algorithm is to reach to an agreement regarding the
    addition of a new block in the blockchain, and which consensus algorithm is employed
    greatly impacts the performance of a blockchain platform. Different platforms
    deploy different consensus algorithms, such as PoW, PoS, Delegated Proof-of-Stake
    (DPoS), etc. and each consensus algorithm has varying computational and storage
    requirements, thus impacting the performance of a blockchain platform [99], [100].
    FIGURE 6. Factors affecting Blockchain implementation. Show All 2) Open-Source
    Blockchain Platforms There are various open-source blockchain platforms that are
    available and choosing which blockchain platform to use depends upon its characteristics.
    Traditional chains such as blockchain (Bitcoin) and Ethereum are highly decentralized
    and secure, but they are not scalable. There are also some high-TPS chains such
    as those which deploy DPoS. These are scalable and secure, but not decentralized.
    Multi-chain ecosystems are scalable and decentralized, but they are not secure
    [9], [27]. Here we will only discuss a few open-source blockchain platforms which
    support the smart contract development environment. The comparison of these platforms
    is depicted in Table 2, and these are discussed in detail below. Ethereum: is
    a public blockchain, and it uses PoW as the consensus algorithm. Ethereum is the
    most renowned blockchain platform for creating smart contracts, and it uses Solidity
    and Vyper scripting languages for the implementation of smart contracts. With
    the PoW consensus mechanism, Ethereum can support 15 TPS. The base transaction
    fee for Ethereum is 21,000 Gas units, and the confirmation time ranges between
    12 to 14 seconds [101]. Hyperledger Fabric: is a private blockchain, and it utilizes
    the PBFT algorithm as a consensus mechanism. Hyperledger Fabric can support more
    than 3,500 TPS with a lower than one second confirmation time. It supports smart
    contract development with scripting languages Go and Java [102]. Polygon (Matic):
    Polygon or previously known as Matic, is a scalable version of Ethereum, which
    aims to increase the TPS exponentially with lower transaction costs. It is a public
    blockchain platform and it uses PoS as the consensus mechanism, thus enabling
    higher TPS of more than 7,200. Polygon supports smart contract development, and
    it uses the Solidity language for scripting the smart contracts [103]. Algorand:
    is a public blockchain, which uses Pure PoS as a consensus mechanism. It supports
    smart contract implementation using the Java and Go languages. It has a very low
    transaction fee and supports more than 1,000 TPS with a confirmation time of less
    than 40 seconds [104], [105]. Energy Web Chain: is a hybrid blockchain platform.
    Anyone can join, but only selected few remain on the blockchain. It utilizes PoA
    as the consensus algorithm. With lower Gas fees as compared to Ethereum, it gives
    a high throughput of more than 76 TPS, with a confirmation time of less than 5
    seconds. It supports smart contract deployment and utilizes Solidity as the scripting
    language for smart contracts [106], [107]. TABLE 2 Comparison of Open-Source Blockchain
    Platforms that Support Smart Contract Development Environment F. Applications
    of Blockchain Blockchain technology evolved from cryptocurrency and found its
    application in various key challenges posed by B5G and 6G networks. The following
    sub-section discusses various applications of blockchain in B5G and 6G networks.
    1) Spectrum Management The current spectrum sharing methods rely on a central
    entity for verifying all the spectrum access transactions, which may lead to biasness,
    single-point-of-failure, and privacy issues. There is still a lack of E2E dynamic
    spectrum management and sharing techniques. To create a more flexible and efficient
    spectrum sharing process, blockchain can be deployed to enhance the security,
    access fairness, and automate and incentivize the sharing mechanism [27], [81].
    2) Network Slicing B5G and 6G enables multiple applications with varying QoS,
    mobility, and security requirements. The one-size-fits-all philosophy does not
    apply to these emerging applications, therefore new mechanisms are being proposed
    to cater for such diversified user requirements. Network slicing has been proposed
    as a prominent solution, which divides the physical network resources into multiple
    logical networks with varying QoS requirements. Blockchain can be deployed to
    create and manage the network slices in a decentralized and automated way, while
    safeguarding the privacy of the users. Network slicing aims towards a more efficient
    resource management and utilization, while minimizing the administration related
    costs and the delays caused by negotiations [9], [19], [27]. 3) Secure Access
    Control With the massive increase in the number of connected devices, the security
    risks pertaining to access of the wireless communication systems have also increased.
    The traditional access mechanisms are based on centralized access control, which
    may create challenges such as single-point-of-failure. Blockchain can be employed
    to provide a secure access control mechanism for wireless networks, due to its
    decentralized nature and capabilities such as traceability and auditability [108],
    [109]. 4) Privacy Protection The merging 6G applications involve sharing of sensitive
    user data such as identity information, location, and other confidential data.
    For gaining access to certain services like DSA and network slicing, sensitive
    data needs to be shared. Therefore, to preserve the security and privacy of the
    network users, blockchain can be employed to safeguard user sensitive information,
    and provide a secure access to services [27], [110]. SECTION V. Blockchain-Based
    Dynamic Spectrum Access DSA techniques mostly rely on a centralized control system
    for spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, and spectrum management. The centralized
    control of access poses challenges such as, biasness and untrustworthiness of
    the network administrators, risk of exposure of sensitive user-related data, additional
    communication overhead between user and network operators, and interference management.
    Blockchain provides a potential solution to cater for these problems by providing
    a decentralized solution for DSA. Blockchain-based DSA solution can provide numerous
    benefits, such as automation of resource sharing process, incentivization and
    compensation mechanisms for network operators, fair resource trading, and unbiased
    access to spectrum resources. In this section, we will first provide review of
    the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) research in blockchain-based DSA, followed by the
    challenges and limitations of blockchain-based DSA techniques, and lastly the
    gaps in this research area with some future research directions. A. Review of
    the State-of-the-Art Research In this subsection we present the SOTA research
    which has been done in the field of blockchain-based DSA. We outline the primary
    focus, the consensus algorithms used, DSA techniques and the results obtained,
    and the limitation and/or future direction of these works. The review has been
    summarized in Table 3. TABLE 3 Summary of Related Work With their Main Contributions
    A novel blockchain-based spectrum trading mechanism Spectrum Trading Blockchain
    (STBC) is proposed in [111]. STBC aims to enhance the efficiency, provide better
    security, increase simplicity of the trading process, and improve energy usage.
    As opposed to the Nakamoto consensus algorithm, STBC is based on a new consensus
    algorithm with prompt transaction confirmation and a better fault-tolerance. STBC
    also safeguards against the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack and protects
    the identity of the nodes through temporarily anonymous transactions. Moreover,
    STBC considerably reduces the power consumption, improves the spectrum utilization
    by 30%, and reduces the transaction confirmation delay by 12.5 times. STBC is
    majorly focused on consensus of transaction information of spectrum, and it lacks
    the auction and management of spectrum. Furthermore, the security considerations
    of the proposed mechanism are limited. In [112], for dynamic and opportunistic
    access to the CBRS band, a blockchain-based secure SAS framework called TrustSAS
    is proposed. TrustSAS aims to safeguard the privacy of secondary access users
    lying under the category of PAL and GAA users by providing anonymous access to
    SAS. The major drawback of this work is the communication and computational overhead
    incurred by the blockchain operations. The authors in [113], propose a blockchain-enabled
    interference-based consensus algorithm for spectrum sharing. This mechanism aims
    to reduce the system overhead and improve the efficiency of transactions. The
    node which suffers the most combined interference in the last transaction will
    obtain as a compensation, the accounting rights for the next block to be added
    to the blockchain. When this new block is verified by the participating nodes,
    it will be added to the blockchain, and the node with accounting rights will be
    rewarded with spectrum coins. These spectrum coins can then be traded with other
    nodes for the use of spectrum. An interference-based transaction validation mechanism
    is devised to circumvent the interference caused by spectrum traders, by validating
    the stored spectrum transactions in the block. The proposed solution not only
    reduces the system overhead, but also improves the system fairness and the Signal
    to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) of the nodes. In order to test the proposed
    blockchain-based architecture, various mechanisms are required to be developed,
    such as block generation, pricing, and incentive mechanisms. A blockchain-enabled
    multi-operator spectrum sharing mechanism is proposed in [114], with intra and
    inter spectrum sharing management. Blockchain-based smart contracts are employed
    for serving a primary user of one operator through spectrum resources of secondary
    operators. Extensive simulations show that the blockchain-based spectrum management
    system is not only scalable but provides ample security as well. In [114], the
    trust on operators and security of the regional telecommunications network is
    still an open issue. A blockchain and AI based Dynamic Resource Sharing (DRS)
    mechanism is proposed in [115], for 6G and beyond networks. The authors in [115],
    present a two-layer hierarchical solution for overcoming the challenges of storage
    and computation for blockchain-based DRS strategies. Blockchain is employed to
    obtain DRS functionalities, while AI aims to enhance the performance of pattern
    recognition and decision making, as well as improve the profit margins of the
    users. The future direction includes the setting of criteria for choosing the
    type for blockchain such as private or public for different scenarios. And the
    formulation of a consensus algorithm with reduced computational complexity and
    cost. In [116], a new distributed blockchain-based dynamic access model for CBRS
    band sharing is proposed, which aims to reduce the high administrative costs and
    privacy concerns. For spectrum allocation, a new consensus algorithm named Proof-of-Strategy
    is devised, as well as a privacy protection method based on ring signature techniques.
    These mechanisms protect the spectrum access system from single-point-of-failure,
    protection of legal users from malicious users, and enhance the spectrum utilization.
    The future direction of this work is to predict the usage behavior of incumbent
    users, thus enabling PAL users to continually utilize the spectrum. The authors
    in [117], propose a blockchain and smart contracts based dynamic spectrum access
    management of unlicensed spectrum for transmission of non-real-time data in Cyber-Physical-Social
    Systems (CPSS). Users gain access to spectrum licenses through PoW mining, and
    they can also sell/lease the spectrum access license through an auction when they
    no longer need to utilize the spectrum. Just like digital currency in blockchain,
    such as bitcoin (BTC) or ether coin (ETH), a new virtual currency called Xcoin
    is introduced for spectrum trading which is used in the auction process as an
    incentive for spectrum sharing. Xcoin may refer to spectrum, or paid edge computing
    services, or digital currency etc. They also outline some future extensions of
    their work, such as development of blockchain-based spectrum auction mechanisms,
    blockchain-based cooperative transmission and cloud-fog-edge computing schemes,
    and other consensus algorithms to replace resource-hungry PoW algorithm. The authors
    in [118], envision blockchain-enabled services for 6G networks such as spectrum
    sharing and resource management, computing and energy trading, network slice management,
    and hardware virtualization. Blockchain will enable the sharing of resources between
    devices, such as data, spectrum lease, energy, and computing power. They also
    present some motivations for the use of blockchain in future use-cases, such as
    IoT, network slicing, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, and network virtualization.
    Due to its application as a trusted database, blockchain has opened new opportunities
    for DSM. Blockchain helps to reduce the DSM related administrative costs, and
    it also improves the traditional spectrum management techniques such as spectrum
    auction. We can securely record sensitive information such as spectrum sensing,
    spectrum auction results and leasing mappings, data mining outcomes, and information
    about idle spectrum on the blockchain. The future direction of this work is the
    creating a lightweight blockchain solution while considering the privacy and security
    concerns of a wireless communication system. The authors in [119], propose a blockchain-enabled
    spectrum sharing mechanism for 5G heterogeneous networks. Primary User (PU) agree
    to share its spectrum with the Secondary User (SU) in return for some incentives.
    Matching theory is employed to match the PU spectrum with the SU. PU and SU detail
    their spectrum preferences in their respective preference lists and utilize the
    Gale-Shapley algorithm to get matched. In [119], there are certain limitations,
    such as multi-operator spectrum sharing is not considered, as well as a PU can
    receive varying contracts from multiple base stations with overlapped coverage.
    A cooperation-based contract needs to be devised in such scenarios. The authors
    in [120], propose another blockchain-based spectrum sharing mechanism. They implement
    auction and spectrum sensing based sharing techniques for opportunistic use by
    the secondary user. Blockchain is deployed to ensure that spectrum use is validated,
    tracked, and compensated. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is implemented in Ethereum for
    the purpose of demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed scheme. The drawback
    of this scheme is the increased latency introduced by blockchain mining, but this
    can be deployed for those cases of spectrum sharing where the spectrum share is
    for longer durations, such as CBRS, IEEE 802.22 WRAN, and Small-Cell as a Service.
    In this subsection, we reviewed the SOTA research in blockchain-based DSA, along
    with the limitations of these works. In the following subsection, we will discuss
    the challenges faced by the blockchain-based DSA and few future directions. B.
    Implementation Challenges and Trade-Offs In this subsection, we will discuss the
    challenges of implementing blockchain for DSA and the trade-offs that must be
    made, considering the B5G and 6G network requirements. 6G networks are envisioned
    to support peak data rate of 1 Tbps, latency of 25μs to 1 ms, and a connection
    density of 10 million devices/km2 [8]. Keeping in view these network requirements,
    we will discuss the various challenges and the trade-offs that need to be made
    for blockchain-based solutions. 1) Suitability Considering the performance requirements
    of B5G and 6G networks, the foremost challenge is to categorize the areas where
    blockchain will be suitable as a solution. Blockchain provides certain benefits
    like decentralization of network management system, auditability and accountability
    of network resources, but these advantages come at a cost of higher implementation
    expenses. For a multi-operator resource sharing scenario, where different operators
    are willing to share their resources, a decentralized resource sharing scheme
    outweighs the cost and system overhead incurred by the blockchain. Due to the
    stringent QoS requirements of users in 6G networks, the implications of blockchain
    on the service delivery must be considered before it is employed as a solution
    for resource sharing and management. However, with proper incentive mechanisms,
    the performance of blockchain can be optimized for its applicability in 6G networks.
    2) Storage Overhead vs. Level of Centralization For blockchain-based DSA solutions,
    a highly decentralized public blockchain is a better solution, but that increases
    the storage overhead of the network, since all the participating nodes in blockchain
    have access to the same copy of blockchain and it is saved on each node. For a
    public blockchain, as the number of nodes increases, the storage overhead also
    increases exponentially. While for a private or consortium blockchain implementation,
    the storage overhead is lower, but we lose the degree of decentralization. Thus,
    there exists a trade-off between the level of decentralization and the storage
    overhead, which poses an implementation challenge for 6G networks [115]. 3) Latency
    Requirements vs. Scalability B5G and 6G use-cases like URLLC and MURLLC demand
    a latency of less than 1 ms. Due to high spectrum demand in 6G networks, the resource
    requests will be more frequent, which will induce a high transaction confirmation
    delay in blockchain-based DSA. For a highly decentralized blockchain solution,
    the transaction confirmation time also increases as the number of transactions
    increases, which makes it less scalable. Public blockchain with reduced scalability
    poses an implementation challenge for blockchain-based DSA solutions in 6G networks
    with stringent delay requirements [115]. 4) Computation Complexity vs. Security
    Computation complexity of a blockchain consensus algorithm is an essential implementation
    challenge for blockchain-based DSA solutions. For future 6G networks, to enhance
    resource utilization, more users will be involved in the resource sharing process.
    With high number of nodes involved in the consensus process, the computation complexity
    of consensus algorithms elevates, but this brings more security in the network.
    Therefore, we have a trade-off between computational complexity and the level
    of security for a particular 6G application [121]. 5) Energy Consumption A public
    blockchain consumes a massive amount of energy. Even private or consortium blockchains
    consume more energy than a traditional centralized management system. In 6G networks,
    DSA system will need to accommodate a large number of users, therefore the energy
    consumption will pose a great challenge and will affect the Operational Expenditures
    (OPEX) of the network operators [122]. C. Gaps and Future Directions There is
    immense potential for blockchain implementation for the evolving B5G and 6G applications.
    Firstly, a computationally less complex consensus algorithm needs to be developed,
    which can reduce the transaction confirmation delay and hence improve the system
    latency. This will improve the TPS rate and make the blockchain solution more
    scalable for 6G applications. Secondly, to reduce the system overheads, the researchers
    are focusing on creating off-chain and on- chain blockchains. This will help reduce
    the storage overhead as well as the computation complexity. Most of the transactions
    will be stored on the off-chain part of the blockchain, while only the final transaction
    will be mined on the on- chain part of blockchain. The second most popular concept
    for reducing the blockchain overheads is Sharding. Where the transactions are
    divided among different branches and are only validated by the nodes associated
    with that branch [115]. Since DSA needs a public blockchain platform, so that
    maximum number of users can participate in the resource sharing process, therefore,
    it is required to create lightweight blockchain solutions. Furthermore, combining
    Machine Learning (ML) as well as AI with blockchain can further assist in optimizing
    blockchain solutions for B5G and 6G network applications and services [102]. With
    ML and AI, user request and usage can be predicted, which can help in better management
    of resources, thus improving the performance of blockchain [103]. SECTION VI.
    Blockchain-Enabled Network Slicing Network slicing techniques face certain challenges
    as outlined in Section III-F. Blockchain with its inherent capabilities, can be
    a potential solution to cater for these challenges. Blockchain can enable secure
    network slice orchestration process, safeguarding of user-sensitive data such
    as identity and geo-locations, secure access to network resources, slice isolation,
    and ensuring SLAs. In this section, we first present the SOTA research in blockchain-enabled
    network slicing, followed by the challenges and limitations posed by these techniques,
    and lastly the gaps and future research directions in blockchain-enabled network
    slicing. A. Review of the State-of-the-Art Research This subsection presents a
    review of SOTA research which has been carried out in the domain of blockchain-enabled
    network slicing. We outline the network slicing parameter which has been optimized,
    the consensus algorithm used, the presented network slicing technique and the
    obtained results. The review is summarized in Table 4. TABLE 4 Summary of Related
    Work with their Main Contributions An experimental testbed for blockchain-enabled
    state-based allocation of network slice to User Equipment (UE) has been implemented
    in [123]. This allocation is based on the UE’s state and the user’s QoS demand.
    Blockchain-enabled network slice allocation achieves transparency, security, fairness,
    and makes the slice allocation process cost-efficient. A smart contract is implemented
    for achieving these goals. Furthermore, the blockchain-enabled state-based network
    slice allocation mechanism enhances the network resource handling as well as improves
    the security and transparency of the system. A secure E2E network slice creation
    mechanism called NetChain is proposed in [124], which is based on blockchain and
    the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). NetChain aims to eradicate the challenges
    and risks which arise from the disclosure of sensitive information, from single
    point-of-failure, and having no guarantee of providing the agreed upon QoS to
    the users. Furthermore, to complement the privacy and scalability of NetChain,
    the authors have developed a novel protocol for consensus called CoNet. In order
    to prevent any malicious activities and guarantee QoS and fairness during the
    multi-domain slice creation process, a game theoretic based bilateral evaluation
    method is devised. The viability of the proposed scheme is evaluated on Microsoft
    Azure Cloud, and the results show that NetChain and CoNet provide better security
    during slice orchestration than current blockchain-based solutions. A blockchain-based
    information management system for network slice creation is proposed in [125].
    The goal is to allow the users to securely access and manage the services, while
    also allowing the network and service providers to monitor the transactions. Blockchain
    provides a distributed ledger, which maintains the security, privacy, and integrity
    of delicate information. The authors in [126], propose a novel blockchain-based
    architecture for the implementation of network slicing and NFV. Blockchain-based
    distributed ledger provides secure direct interaction between any end user with
    any virtualized network instance of any Mobile Network Operator (MNO), which enhances
    the flexibility of network deployment. By means of AI-predicted traffic demand
    of each network slice and through the potential of blockchain, network slicing
    performance in terms of overall throughput of the physical network infrastructure
    is improved by almost two times during peak traffic load. A blockchain-based network
    slicing brokerage solution called NSBchain is proposed in [127], to cater for
    the needs of new network tenants such as automotive industry, e-health, smart
    factories etc. NSBchain comprises of Intermediate Brokers (IBs) who acquire network
    resources from Infrastructure Providers (InPs) through the implementation of smart
    contracts. IBs then reallocate these resources among the network tenants who are
    willing to pay for gaining access to the network slices and computational resources.
    NSBchain is proposed as a secure and cost effective solution, which is scalable
    and automated. By making use of the open-source Hyperledger platform and through
    a PoC implementation, the viability of the proposed solution is verified. A blockchain-based
    distributed network slicing framework is proposed in [128], which enables the
    dynamic leasing of resources to the service tenants by the resource providers
    to enhance the performance and QoS provision. The prominent aspect of this framework
    is the Global Service Positioning (GSP) system, which allows the new users to
    make a service request and control their admission through a blockchain-based
    auction type bidding system for dynamic resource allocation. The main purpose
    of this work is to improve the performance of users having varying service requirements,
    and to minimize the monetary burden of operation and service provision of the
    network provider. A blockchain-based brokerage mechanism is devised for network
    slice provision in 5G [129]. The network slice provider will lease the network
    resources from multiple providers while maintaining the security and anonymity
    of the transactions, to create E2E network slices. PoC based implementation is
    used to observe the performance of a blockchain-based network slice broker. The
    results demonstrate that the enhanced security provided by blockchain does not
    impact the performance of the network slice broker. The authors in [130], propose
    a blockchain-based mechanism to ensure that network slice orchestration is secure,
    to identify any malicious and failed VNFs, and to prevent the degradation of QoS
    of valid network users. Each slice has different requirements, which initiates
    the need for the use of various blockchains each with different characteristics.
    Various blockchain characteristics come into play here, such as the number of
    participating nodes, throughput and type of transaction, different consensus algorithms,
    and kinds of networks involved, etc. Through PoC implementation, the viability
    of blockchain-based network slice creation is studied, where the security of slice
    orchestration and network virtualization is assessed. In [131], a blockchain-based
    slice leasing mechanism is proposed for network slice creation for factory equipment.
    It allows the equipment for mechanical operations to dynamically and autonomously
    request and acquire the needed resources for efficient slice creation. Blockchain
    provides the trust and accountability for sharing of resources among resource
    providers. In [131], authors have presented a use case scenario for the blockchain-enabled
    network slice brokerage. In order to fully automate the factory operations, they
    have automated the slice request and creation process for the mechanical equipment
    based on their resource requirements through the use of blockchain. In this subsection,
    we reviewed the SOTA research in blockchain-enabled network slicing. In the following
    subsection, we will discuss the challenges faced by the blockchain-enabled network
    slicing and some future directions. B. Implementation Challenges and Trade-Offs
    In this subsection, we will discuss the challenges of implementing blockchain
    for a network slicing system with stringent QoS requirements in B5G and 6G networks.
    1) Computation Complexity of Consensus Algorithm In B5G and 6G networks, for multi-operator
    resource sharing, a consortium or private blockchain is the appropriate solution.
    When only few permitted stakeholders are allowed in the blockchain network, the
    computation complexity of consensus algorithm will be lower. But if the nodes
    involved in network slice orchestration process increase, the need for a public
    blockchain might arise, which can lead to the challenge of higher computation
    complexity of the consensus algorithm for time-sensitive 6G applications [123],
    [132]. 2) Energy Consumption The energy consumption will be comparatively less
    for a network slice broker with fewer nodes running on the blockchain. But if
    the number of nodes in the network slice management system increases, the OPEX
    will increase significantly, which poses a challenge. But these expenses outweighs
    the benefits received by blockchain-enabled network slicing system for the network
    operators in 6G networks. Since it enables the secure access to network resources
    and proper incentivization when resources are shared among multiple operators
    [29]. 3) Scalability and Storage Overhead The future 6G networks will depend on
    high spectrum availability for users with high mobility. The scalability does
    not pose a bigger concern when it comes to network slicing until the number of
    operators are limited. But even if the blockchain nodes are lower, when the blockchain
    starts recording transactions, the storage overhead starts increasing exponentially,
    which poses a challenge for service providers in 6G networks [29], [132]. C. Gaps
    and Future Directions Blockchain-enabled network slicing is of paramount importance
    in realizing the future wireless networks. There are still many areas which need
    to be investigated in this domain. Since the future networks depend upon even
    lower latency in service provision, blockchain-based network slicing can be combined
    with edge computing to bring the service provision closer to the end users. Furthermore,
    blockchain-enabled network slicing and machine learning can be combined to learn
    the user usage patterns, so that the resources can be managed more efficiently
    [123], [132]. SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Directions A. Conclusion DSA
    and network slicing are the key-enabling technologies for the realization of envisioned
    B5G and 6G applications. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive overview
    of DSA and network slicing, as well as the challenges posed by their existing
    schemes. We have provided an extensive overview of blockchain, its architecture,
    and smart contracts, in a manner that gives the reader a complete yet precise
    tutorial of blockchain. We have reviewed the state-of-the-art in blockchain-enabled
    DSA and network slicing, their implementation challenges related to B5G and 6G
    network requirements, and some future research directions. Considering the stringent
    QoS requirements of B5G and 6G networks, blockchain can be viewed as a promising
    solution for ensuring the SLAs where multiple entities participate in the resource
    sharing process. B. Future Research Directions The research on blockchain integration
    with DSA and network slicing is still in its initial stages, and there are many
    challenges which are yet to be investigated. Trust between operators is still
    an open issue while sharing the resources among multiple operators. Slice-isolation
    and secure network slice orchestration is a challenge faced by current network
    slicing techniques. Preserving the privacy of user sensitive data such as identity
    and geo-location is a challenge faced by both DSA and network slicing. Blockchain
    pose a great storage overhead as well as high energy consumption. Ways to reduce
    the system overheads in blockchain-based solutions and making it more energy efficient
    is of prime importance. A use-case scenario for blockchain-based DSA and network
    slicing is to integrate DSA and network slicing together, so that the focus is
    to primarily use the underutilized spectrum resources while creating the user-specific
    network slices. This way, we not only enhance spectrum utilization, but also satisfy
    users with stringent QoS requirements. Blockchain will provide the functionality
    of ensuring SLAs of users and fair incentivization for the network operators.
    Nonetheless, the transaction confirmation time in blockchain-based solutions pose
    a challenge for time-sensitive applications like URLLC and MURLLC, as well as
    the highly mobile users in B5G and 6G networks. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

  analysis: The paper proposes a novel concept called Smart Mobile Network Access
    Topology (SMNAT) for the realization of in-band D2D communication. SMNAT is a
    new mobility management and addressing concept that aims to reduce signaling overhead,
    improve spectral efficiency, and enhance the overall performance of cellular networks.
    The key idea behind SMNAT is to use the PHY layer to directly participate in addressing
    and mobility management, thus eliminating the need for complex layer 7 signaling
    processes. The paper provides a detailed description of SMNAT, including its network
    architecture, frame formation processes, and integration with LTE-Advanced and
    5G cores. It also discusses security aspects and presents a scenario for next
    generation cellular networks based on SMNAT.

    The Bhagavad Gita (3.5)\nThe foremost focus of this book is on next major phase\
    \ in mobile\ntelecommunication technology – ﬁfth generation mobile technology\
    \ (5G).\nThe ﬁfth generations of mobile systems will be a major stride in the\
    \ mobile\ntechnology. Its standards would be beyond that of 4G. 5G is also referred\n\
    as beyond 2020 mobile communications technology. Many scientiﬁc papers\ndiscuss\
    \ the key concepts and techniques for the implementation of 5G systems.\nSome\
    \ of them are, new data coding and modulation techniques, cognitive radio\ntechnology,\
    \ multi-hop networks, Pervasive networks providing ubiquitous\ncomputing and so\
    \ on. 5G can provide speed that would be at-least an order of\nmagnitude higher\
    \ than the mobile technology used these days.\nix\nx\nPreface\nMobile giants such\
    \ as Samsung, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia Networks\nand Alcatel-Lucent have started\
    \ their research on the development of 5G.\nThough some of the companies claim\
    \ that they were successful in transmitting\nthe data of 1.056 Gbps over a distance\
    \ of 2 kilometres at extremely high\nfrequencies, they do not expect these technologies\
    \ to be commercialized\ntill 2020.\nThe book discusses on providing the goals\
    \ and implementation of a novel\nconcept called Wireless Innovative System for\
    \ Dynamically Operating Mega\nCommunications (WISDOM) which becomes the main 5G\
    \ deﬁnition point.\nAlso, this book gives an idea of the sophisticated techniques\
    \ to be implemented\nfor making 5G a successful mobile generation than its predecessors.\
    \ Certain\ncontents for Chapter 2 are based on WISDOM project proposal, Chapter\
    \ 3 is\nbased on PhD thesis of Rajarshi Sanyal and Chapter 4 is based on Purnendu\n\
    S.M. Tripathi’s thesis.\nThe book is organized into the following chapters portrayed\

    \ a tremendous growth in the wireless\ntechnologies. The result is an enormous\
    \ growth in the evolution of various\nwireless communication devices like smart\
    \ phones, laptops, tablets. Due to\nthe enormous growth in the number of these\
    \ devices for various applica-\ntions, there is also the requirement for the development\
    \ of various wireless\nsolutions that are cost effective and reliable. The focus\
    \ on the mobile wireless\ncommunications is dominant as it is the main means of\
    \ communication in the\nworld.\nBased on the type of services and data transfer\
    \ speeds, mobile wireless\ntechnologies have been classiﬁed according to their\
    \ generations. They are\nshown in the form a tree in the Figure 1.1 for easy understanding\
    \ and are\nexplained below.\n1.1 Mobile Wireless Technology Generations\nThe ﬁrst\
    \ generation mobile systems (1G) were analogue. The ﬁrst cellular\nsystem was\
    \ put into operation in 1978 by Nippon Telephone and Telegraph\n(NTT) in Tokyo,\
    \ Japan. Some of the most popular analogue cellular systems\nwere Nordic Mobile\
    \ Telephones (NMT) and Total Access Communication\nSystems (TACS), Advanced Mobile\
    \ Phone System (AMPS). AMPS and\nTACS use frequency modulation technique for the\
    \ radio transmission. The\ninevitable disadvantage of this generation of mobile\
    \ systems is that, even\nthough these systems rendered handover and roaming capabilities\
    \ the cellular\nnetworks were not able to interoperate among countries. Multiplexed\
    \ trafﬁc\nis carried over a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) system [2].\n\
    The second generation mobile systems (2G) are based on the standard Global\nSystem\
    \ for Mobile Communications (GSM). GSM appeared ﬁrst in 1991 and\nthey are digital\
    \ cellular systems. Digital communications enable advanced\nsource coding techniques\
    \ to be implemented thus allowing the spectrum to\n1\n2\nIntroduction\nFigure\
    \ 1.1\nTree of Standards [1].\nbe used much more efﬁciently. This also reduces\
    \ the bandwidth required for\nvoice and video [2, 3].\nThe main disadvantage with\
    \ GSM is that it could handle a maximum data\nrate of 9.6 kbps which is too slow\
    \ for the Internet related services. The 2G\nwas subsequently superseded by 2.5G\
    \ and 2.7G.\n2.5G systems are evolved based on the General Packet Radio Service\n\
    (GPRS) standard. These systems support Wireless Application Protocol,\nMultimedia\
    \ Message Service, Short Message Service, mobile games, and\nsearch and directory\
    \ mobile services.\n2.75G systems are evolved based on standard Enhanced Data\
    \ rate for\nGSM Evolution (EDGE) and this technology is an extended version of\
    \ GSM.\nData transfer rate is high compared to GPRS.\nThe third generation mobile\
    \ systems (3G) systems were designed to\nprovide a very high speed Internet access\
    \ (about 384 kbps in burst mode).\nSome of the important services that these systems\
    \ support are wide area\n1.2 5G – From History to the Present and Future\n3\n\
    wireless voice telephony, video calls, broadband wireless data and additional\n\
    services like mobile television, Global Positioning System (GPS), other\nreal\
    \ time audio, video broadcast services. The three important technolo-\ngies that\
    \ paved the way to the development of 3G systems are given in\nreference [3]:\n\
    Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) was developed\nthat used Frequency\
    \ Division Duplex (FDD) for forward and backward\nchannels. With the help of wideband\
    \ Code Division Multiple Access 5MHz\nchannel spacing, high data rates of up to\
    \ 2 Mbps can be achieved.\nTime Division Synchronous CDMA(TD-SCDMA) used 1.6 MHz\
    \ channel\nspacing.\nThe fourth generation mobile system (4G) offered very high\
    \ speeds of up\nto 100 Mbps. The important feature of 4G systems are the high\
    \ quality video\nand audio streaming over end to end Internet Protocol. The two\
    \ important\nstandards in 4G technologies are Worldwide Interoperability for microwave\n\
    Access(WiMax)andLongTermEvolution(LTE).4Gisthecurrenttechnology\nused all over\
    \ the important places of the world. But there are many countries\nwhere the 4G\
    \ services are not yet accessible because of the spectrum related\nissues [4,\
    \ 5].\n1.2 5G – From History to the Present and Future\nThe concept of realizing\
    \ next generation communication systems in the form\nof 5th Generation communication\
    \ network based on Wireless System for\nDynamic Operating Mega Communications\
    \ (WISDOM) followed by other\nleading initiatives at research facilities in industry\
    \ and academia is as shown\nin Table 1.1. The operational concept of WISDOM has\
    \ been discussed in\ndetail in the following subsection and the various speciﬁc\
    \ details related with\nits operation, and operational challenges that WISDOM\
    \ – 5G would require\nto overcome have been elaborated in Chapter 2.\nIt has been\
    \ long since the rollout of 4G based services by the cellular\ncompanies. Advent\
    \ and possible utilization of 5G based services in future\nis already picking\
    \ up. 5G based services are expected to commence from\n2020. High data rate is\
    \ expected to usher a new digital age ubiquitous\ncommunication for the masses\
    \ that is unimaginable to be fulﬁlled by today’s\ncommunication networks. 5G mobile\
    \ wireless communications are expected\nto incorporate a large number of advanced\
    \ technologies in order to increase the\nbandwidth further; Quality of Service\
    \ (QoS), improve usability and security,\ndecrease delays and cost of service.\
    \ Some of the interesting services that users\n4\nIntroduction\nTable 1.1\nSigniﬁcant\

    \ for 5G, high frequency bands are to be\nexplored to achieve those higher data\
    \ rates than any other currently emerging\ntechnology. Some sources specify that\
    \ when 5G arrives, it will have to handle\nbillions of devices and myriad trafﬁc\
    \ types. It will offer improved reception\nand less network congestion, allowing\
    \ for better connectivity and smoother\nroaming functionality [1].\n1.3 WISDOM\
    \ (Wireless Innovative System for Dynamically\nOperating Mega Communications)\n\
    WISDOM is an important and novel concept that deﬁnes 5G. The main\nreason for\
    \ its description in this chapter is that it is an evolution towards\na new communication\
    \ connectivity era, which will offer the frequencies up to\nTera Hertz and data\
    \ rate up to Tera bps.\nThe fastest communication and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ is the foremost\npriority of the present era with the need of quick data transfer,\
    \ distant\n1.3 WISDOM\n5\nbusiness correspondence by sharing data and use of single\
    \ IP for worldwide\nconnectivity using hand held mobile.\nTo make it happen, the\
    \ 5G network is assumed as the perfection level in\nmobile technology, which provides\
    \ real life mobility. In this regard WISDOM\nis expected to advance the state-of-the-art\
    \ in the architecture of next generation\nof wireless networks and cognitive technologies\
    \ for higher data rates up to\n1 Tera bps.\nThe relation between WISDOM and 5G\
    \ can be expressed like this:\n4G + WISDOM ≜ 5G [1]\nThe 4G and WISDOM concept\
    \ will lead the wireless communication\ntowards the realization of true 5G systems.\n\
    The main motivation for the development of the WISDOM concept for 5G\nis the needs\
    \ of the society 2020 and beyond.These days, there is an exponential\nincrease\
    \ in wireless access bandwidth that is commercially available to the\nend user.\n\
    This will continue to increase in future wireless networks, taken by\nthe rising\
    \ needs of the mass market in the ﬁelds of bandwidth demanding\napplications such\
    \ as entertainment, multimedia, Intelligent Transport Systems\n(ITS), telemedicine,\
    \ emergency and safety/security applications [1].\nAlso the futuristic applications\
    \ like 3D Internet, virtual and augmented\nreality that combines data for all\
    \ senses, audio, visual, haptic, digital scent\n(e.g., tele-haptic applications,\
    \ like planet or deep sea exploration), networked\nvirtual reality (e.g., video\
    \ streaming in social networks – users stream their\nown reality), and tele-presence\
    \ (e.g., immersive environments with applica-\ntions in both the commercial and\
    \ military ﬁelds) can push the demand for\nreal-time symmetric wireless connectivity\
    \ to an individual with a data rate of\n300 Mbps [1].\nWISDOM aims for up to 1\
    \ Tbit/s (1 Tera bps = 1012 bits/s) wireless\nlink rates in short-distance burst-mode\
    \ or for up to 1 Tbit/s of system\naggregated trafﬁc with sustainable symmetric\
    \ link rates of larger than\n300 Mbps to mobile terminals at high speed [1, 3,\
    \ 6, 7]. The communication at\n1 Tbit/s is expected to be achieved utilizing millimetre\
    \ waves (around 30 GHz\nand above), this has been discussed further in Chapter\
    \ 4.\nExisting wireless technologies like 3G+ cellular, WiMax IEEE 802.16e,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Wi-Media as well as the corresponding emerging next generation\nnetworks\
    \ (LTE/LTE-advanced, IEEE 802.16m, IEEE 802.11n, etc.) in the\nWireless Wide Area\
    \ Network (WWAN), Wireless Local Area Network\n6\nIntroduction\nFigure 1.2\nGlobal\
    \ Connectivity through WISDOM [1].\n(WLAN) and Wireless Personal Area Network\
    \ (WPAN) scales are not\nexpected to meet such demanding needs for data rates.\n\
    WISDOM is a way towards 5G with a coverage extending from a city\nregion to a\
    \ country, continents and the world as shown in the Figure 1.2\nforming a Global\
    \ Information Multimedia Communication Village (GIMCV).\nConsidering a user to\
    \ shift between geographical locations swiftly and rely on\ndifferent access networks,\
    \ WISDOM based 5G network would be capable of\ndynamicallyaligningthecommunicationnetworktosupportdrasticchangesin\n\
    the overall network topology and therefore referred as dynamically operating\n\
    mega communications based system.\nIn brief the key features of WISDOM are [6,\
    \ 7]:\na) combines established, competitive cellular standards with a promising\n\
    frequency spectrum and novel enabling technologies;\nb) reduced coverage, electricity\
    \ and operational expenditure (OPEX) costs;\nc) offers scalable and ﬂexible technology\
    \ options.\n1.4 Global Information Multimedia Communication\nVillage (GIMCV)\n\
    The different applications of the WISDOM network includes, home and ofﬁce\nnetwork,\
    \ medical and health care, IT services, entertainment-movies high-\nspeed data\
    \ transfer, educational systems, rescue vehicular communications,\n1.5 Requirements\
    \ of 5G\n7\nFigure 1.3\nGlobal Information Multimedia Communication Village [1].\n\
    meteorology, security, aviation, global communication, smart town, virtual\nreality,\
    \ intelligent transportation systems, and so forth.\nAll these diverse applications\
    \ of WISDOM are the operating functionality\nand basis for the Global Information\
    \ Multimedia Communication Village\n(GIMCV) as shown in the Figure 1.3.\nThe Global\
    \ Information Multimedia Communication Village consists of\nnational and international\
    \ zones which are divided into macro cells (Suburban,\nRegional and National network).\
    \ Macro cells comprise many micro cells (city\n– centres/highway networks), it\
    \ further contains small pico-cells (in-house –\nnetwork) where there are many\
    \ small personal area networks. It gives scope\nfor WISDOM application which varies\
    \ from a person in home to globe from\nwhere they belong. It is the way of groupings\
    \ of the devices in close vicinity\nof user [3].\nThe new 5G network is expected\
    \ to improve the services and applications\noffered by GIMCV. WISDOM is a dynamic\
    \ entity for human centric systems\noffering GIMCV.\n1.5 Requirements of 5G\n\
    Based on the operational requirements of WISDOM based 5G to support\na data rate\
    \ of 1 Tbit/s there are certain things necessitated in the con-\nventional networks.\
    \ The requirement of the network is categorized into\n8\nIntroduction\npico, micro\
    \ and macro cells. It would be necessary for the mobile termi-\nnal to be recognized\
    \ with a single ID so as to allow seamless network\nconnectivity irrespective\
    \ of the access network. The envisioned high data\nrate applications would necessitate\
    \ that possible authentication and access\nvalidation to the mobile device are\
    \ granted in miniscule time period, i.e.,\nlatency as low as 1 ms [8]. This would\
    \ also necessitate minimization of\npossible shadowing effect and path loss due\
    \ to be absolutely minimized.\nUtilization of distributed antenna systems (DAS)\
    \ and multi-input and multi-\noutput (MIMO) antennas would be unavoidable. The\
    \ current MIMO systems\nwould be insufﬁcient and the requirement would be for\
    \ massive MIMOs\n[9]. Similarly, the capability of mobile devices to communicate\
    \ directly,\nbypassing the conventional network infrastructure, i.e., base station,\
    \ would\nbe necessary.\nAs stated earlier the high data rate operations would\
    \ necessitate mea-\nsures that can minimize latency to the absolute minimum. The\
    \ capacity of\nmobile devices to initiate and establish cellular connections among\
    \ them-\nselves would be highly beneﬁcial, commonly referred as device-to-device\n\
    communication (D2D). Utility of D2D in WISDOM 5G communications\nhas been elaborated\
    \ extensively in Chapter 3. The current cellular operation\nspectrum bands are\
    \ excessively crowded. The high data rate and existing\nspectrum situation would\
    \ necessitate utilization of frequency bands that are\nconventionally not utilized\
    \ for cellular radio communications. Frequency\nbands, higher than referred as\
    \ mm bands mm-waves are capable of sup-\nporting the high data rated along with\
    \ use of visible light communication\n(VLC), are two frequency bands that can\
    \ sufﬁce the operational require-\nments. Details about mm bands for WISDOM based\
    \ 5G communication have\nbeen elaborated in Chapter 4. Apart from the using these\
    \ frequency bands\nthe core network would require to rely on cognitive radio technology\
    \ for\nensuring reliable high data services especially for supporting it on mobile\n\
    devices that are mobile and change geographic locations swiftly. The relevant\n\
    concepts for effective spectrum utilization in economic aspects of spectrum\n\
    trading and sharing have been also elaborated in Chapter 4. The capacity\nof ubiquitous\
    \ communication as envisioned to be provided in WISDOM\n5G based communications\
    \ would require speciﬁc measures in respect of\nsecurity and privacy. Various\
    \ aspects relating with security and privacy\nchallenges and appropriate strategy\
    \ to address them have been discussed in\nChapter 5. Possible technologies such\
    \ as Human Bond Communication and\nCOmmunications-NAvigation-SENsing-SErvices\
    \ that would be signiﬁcant\n1.6 Standardization of WISDOM\n9\nfor fulﬁlling communication\
    \ needs of society in 2020 in relation to 5G have\nbeen elaborated in Chapter\
    \ 6.\n1.6 Standardization of WISDOM\nThe major areas where the standardization\
    \ of WISDOM shown in the\nFigure 1.4 is required are [3]:\n• Multimedia Communications\
    \ where it needs to focus on the areas of\nMachine-to-Machine (M2M) and Peer-to-Peer\
    \ (P2P) with global iden-\ntiﬁcations for home networking and smart cities and\
    \ Techno-social\nSystems.\n• Cognitive Communications where WISDOM based personalized\
    \ cog-\nnitive communication includes all the educational, ofﬁce, community,\n\
    emergency, commercial and intelligent transportation systems.\n• Personalized\
    \ Medicine includes bioinformatics, multi-sensor networks,\nbody sensors, and\
    \ data protection and ethical guidelines.\n• Network without borders basically\
    \ comprises the wide range commu-\nnications for the future Internet or the next\
    \ generation networks. The\nmain focus is on the Physical layer security, management\
    \ and resource\noptimization, identity management, cooperative communications\
    \ and\nInternet of things.\n• Embedded Optimal Resource and Computing It has Energy\
    \ har-\nvesting techniques and models, time and power conscious hardware\nFigure\
    \ 1.4\nStandardization of WISDOM [1].\n10\nIntroduction\n(HW)/software (SW) code\
    \ sign methodologies, terminal energy trade-\noffs and energy aware reconﬁgurable\
    \ and heterogeneous Architectures.\n• Positioning and Localization includes the\
    \ navigation systems, ubiquitous\nand cooperative localization, geo tagging, navigation\
    \ ID systems and\nRobotics.\n1.6.1 Global ICT Standardisation Forum for India\n\
    Global ICT Stadardisation Forum for India (GISFI, http://www.gisﬁ.org/) is\nplaying\
    \ a pivotal role in formalizing standards for 5G based on WISDOM that\nensure\
    \ the overall operational objective of uninterrupted Tera bps data rate to\nthe\
    \ end user and support human centric computing [13]. GISFI is addressing\nthe\
    \ aforesaid objective through its working groups that are looking into\nsub-aspects\
    \ pertaining to it. There are seven working groups at GISI, which\nare as follows:\n\
    • Security and Privacy\n• Future Radio Networks and 5G\n• Internet of Things (IoT)\n\
    • Cloud and Service Oriented Network\n• Green ICT\nIn addition to the working\
    \ groups there are two additional groups:\n• Special Interest Group\n• Spectrum\
    \ Group\nGISFI has produced several documents covering the various aspects of\n\
    standardization related to 5G through the working groups and they have\nbeen submitted\
    \ to the government bodies such as International Telecom-\nmunication Union-T\
    \ (ITU-T, Standardisation), Department of Telecom India\n(DoT) and Telecom Regulatory\
    \ Authority of India (TRAI). Provided inputs to\nTelecommunication Engineering\
    \ Center (TEC), DoT on “Implementations\nof directions issued by DOT on TRAI recommendations\
    \ on ‘Approach\ntowardGreenTelecommunications”’andemergencytelecomservicestoTRAI\n\
    amongst many others.\n1.7 Vision of 5G\nThe overall vision of 5G can be summarized\
    \ into the following broad\nalso shown in Figure 1.5 [6].\n1.7 Vision of 5G\n\
    11\nFigure 1.5\nPlethora of technologies to deliver 5G services and applications\
    \ [6], [13].\n1.7.1 Enabling the 5G Intelligent Core\nM2M and IoT are the two\
    \ major criteria for realizing the intelligent core,\nwhich in turn is the key\
    \ for enabling seamless ubiquitous networking and\nconnectivity in a 5G context.\n\
    M2M and IoT are the key enabling technologies for a pervasive\nand always-connected\
    \ 5G mobile services. Research challenges to fully\ndeployable intelligent core\
    \ are related but not limited to handling the big data\ncollected through M2M\
    \ and IoT communications (e.g., heterogeneous gate-\nways, energy efﬁciency, decentralization\
    \ of routing, naming and addressing),\nand to security, privacy and trust.\n1.7.2\
    \ Enabling Ubiquitous Connectivity\nThis feature has two aspects. On one hand,\
    \ technical challenges relate to\nsufﬁcient coverage range even in a scenario\
    \ of very high mobility and data\nrates, and on the other, to moving application\
    \ from device-to-device without\nany content interruption.\nUse of millimetre\
    \ wave links novel multiple antenna concepts, virtualiza-\ntion, small cell deployments,\
    \ and novel spectrum usage methods are some of\nthe key research enabling areas\
    \ for ubiquitous connectivity [1].\n1.7.3 Enabling Ubiquitous Networking\nThis\
    \ means that regardless of how many access networks are integrated for\nconnectivity\

    \ and Challenges\nThe concept of WISDOM is evolved in order to meet the needs\
    \ of intercon-\nnected society by offering ubiquitous terabit wireless connectivity.\
    \ Based on\nthe novel technologies, systems and network architecture WISDOM is\
    \ a way\ntowards 5th generation networks which will afford frequencies and data\
    \ rates\nup to Tera Hertz and Tera bps, respectively.\nWISDOM embodies the basic\
    \ elements that are the building blocks of\nthe future Internet innovations. The\
    \ development and evolution of WISDOM\noffers a basic formula: E ∼ MC 5\nIt is\
    \ based on the combination of ﬁve independent vectors, Communica-\ntion, Connectivity,\
    \ Convergence, Content and Co-operation [1] as shown in\nFigure 2.1.\nWISDOM is\
    \ developed to enable the growth of an interconnected society,\nbridge the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds by offering a seamless personalized rich\ndigital experience\
    \ for the end users, and also creating the optimal conditions\nfor capitalizing\
    \ on Future Internet innovations.\nThe top down design of WISDOM can be approached\
    \ with the help of\nthree founding pillars shown in Figure 2.2 which are [1]:\n\
    a) Information theoretic performance/capacity estimation:\nDifferent types of\
    \ networking paradigms will lead the directions for\nengineering development.\n\
    b) End-to-End performance optimization:\nProtocol design for the end–to-end optimization\
    \ is very efﬁcient than the\nones based on classical layered design.\nc) Cognitive\
    \ networking principles.\nSelf-healing/self-organizing networks based on the above\
    \ principle are\nessential to manage both, the complexity induced by a variety\
    \ of pos-\nsible usage scenarios and minimization of the spectrum and energy\n\

    \ usage. WISDOM uses the\nconcept of “cognitive network (CN)”, which is a step\
    \ ahead of Cognitive\nRadio.\n2.1 WISDOM Objectives\nWISDOM aims at enabling wireless\
    \ infrastructure for the human-centric mega\ncommunications in 2020 and beyond.\
    \ It aims at providing higher capacity and\nperformance than any other current\
    \ emerging technologies by [1]:\n• Designing air interfaces and new systems that\
    \ achieve a 3 to 5 times\nimprovement over current wireless communications in\
    \ terms of channel\nefﬁciency;\n2.1 WISDOM Objectives\n17\n• exploiting larger\
    \ channel bandwidths in uncontested areas of the spec-\ntrum in higher frequency\
    \ bands and/or considering spectrum co-existence\nand sharing;\n• employing smaller\
    \ size cells and virtual cells with optimized dynamic\nspectrum management across\
    \ different technologies;\n• developing novel cross-layer and cross-network domain\
    \ optimization\ntechnologies based on the principles of power efﬁcient cognitive\
    \ and\ncooperative communications;\n• taking a comprehensive approach in developing\
    \ a converged WISDOM\nsystem by jointly designing radio access systems and network\
    \ proto-\ncols across a number of heterogeneous network architectures including\n\
    ad-hoc, vehicular, mesh and next generation of cellular networks employ-\ning\
    \ femto-cells and virtual cells efﬁciently connected to the wired core\npart of\
    \ the Future Internet.\nWISDOM will also help to design a converged architecture\
    \ as shown in\nFigure 2.3 and network solution and evaluate its performance with\
    \ the\ngoal of enabling ubiquitous terabit wireless connectivity for human-centric\n\
    Figure 2.3\nConverged architecture of WISDOM [2].\n18\nWISDOM Concept and Challenges\n\
    communications over the network of the future. WISDOM will design and\ndevelop\
    \ wireless/wired interfaces and network protocols in order to integrate\nthe wireless\
    \ access networks to the ﬁxed infrastructure as well as the core\noptical part\
    \ of the Network of the Future. It means the focus of WISDOM\nwill be on the design\
    \ of wireless/wire line interfacing network nodes. These\nare the nodes that will\
    \ facilitate the integration of wireless and wired (optical)\nnetwork segments\
    \ [2].\n2.2 WISDOM System Requirements\nIn order to implement a WISDOM system\
    \ the two main requirements are [2]:\n• Mechanisms for enabling the transmission\
    \ of Tera bps.\n• Mechanisms for enabling mega communications.\nThe former can\
    \ be achieved by the use of new physical layer techniques,\nsuch as new radio\
    \ carrier-less transmission, to identify new spectrum bands,\nultra high spectral\
    \ efﬁciency mechanisms, MIMO and advanced physical\nlayer (PHY) interfaces and\
    \ advanced channel coding techniques. Also the\nnew medium access control (MAC)\
    \ and link layer are required for the strict\nQoS requirements that would allow\
    \ the linking source and resource access for\ntrillion device networks.\nThe latter\
    \ can be achieved by the novel network protocols and architectures\nfor heterogeneous\
    \ networks such as femto cells, cooperative transmission,\nwireless-wired network\
    \ integration, integration of high capacity satellite links\nand cognitive radio\
    \ networks [1].\nThe 4G technologies together with WISDOM concept will show a\
    \ way to\nthe wireless communication to realize the true 5G systems.\nTo summarize\
    \ [2]:\nWISDOM communication interfaces are up to Tera bps link rate in a burst\n\
    mode for short range communications.\nWISDOM has a target of delivering a sustainable\
    \ rate of 300 Mbps to\nmobile terminals at high speed for the needs of immersive\
    \ applications and\ntele-presence on the move.\n2.3 WISDOM Architecture\nWISDOM\
    \ architecture is shown in the Figure 2.4. It has three main\ncomponents [2]:\n\
    2.3 WISDOM Architecture\n19\nFigure 2.4\nWISDOM Architecture [2].\nA. Person to\
    \ Machine (P2M)\nThe trend of person to machine communication (P2M) is inﬂaming\
    \ the\nbandwidth demand and changes in communication because of its complexity,\n\
    heterogeneity and integration of new systems and devices using the different\n\
    network paradigms. These network paradigms consist of network devices\nranging\
    \ from computers, phones both landline and mobile, cameras, PDAs,\ncollection\
    \ of embedded machines like cars, washing machines, refrigerators,\ncoffeevendingmachines,allareequippedwithwiredandwirelessapplications\n\
    capabilities.\nApplications of this P2M component are IoT, Wireless Sensor Networks\n\
    (WSN), Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) etc. which transmits data from\nlow bit\
    \ rate up to Tera bps.\nB. Shortrange\nThere are different short-range communication\
    \ application such as smart\nhomes, smart cars, Green Information Communication\
    \ Technology (GICT)\nand smart ofﬁces, personalized medicines, Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation\n(RFID), WLAN, security systems, keyless gates, future Internet,\
    \ immersive\n20\nWISDOM Concept and Challenges\ncommunication, smart robotics,\
    \ wireless accessories etc. Characteristics of\nthe short range communication\
    \ applications are high data rate, very short\nrange, reliability, battery operated\
    \ transmitters as well as receivers and\nlow cost.\nC. Cellular and wide range\n\
    The cellular communication system where in perfect cellular coverage occurs\n\
    if each cell is a hexagon and cells can be arranged in a honeycomb. Most cell\n\
    towers use Omni directional antennas to data transmit in a circular pattern. In\n\
    some cases, cells overlap and in others, gaps exist with no coverage.\n2.4 Users\
    \ Requirements and WISDOM\nSome of the key enablers of satisfying the user requirements\
    \ are capacity,\nconnectivity and pervasiveness. These drive the emergence of\
    \ new environ-\nments that evolve from the gradual development and combination\
    \ of present\nday cellular communications, IoT and Internet of Services, towards\
    \ a more\nadvanced vision of fully reprogrammable mobile devices which would make\n\
    possible to communicate with each other autonomously based on a given\nevent context\
    \ and part of a scale-free self-organized communication system.\nSigniﬁcant breakthroughs\
    \ in the state-of-the-art are required to reach this level\nof performance paving\
    \ us to what can be characterized as a new paradigm for\nfuture systems, namely\
    \ WISDOM [1].\n2.5 WISDOM Offerings\nWISDOM intends to provide at least an order\
    \ of magnitude of more capacity\nthan any currently planned wireless radio technology.\
    \ Creating wireless\ninfrastructure that enables human-centric mega communications\
    \ is the main\naim of WISDOM.\nWISDOM gives a novel cross-layer and cross-network-domain\
    \ optimiza-\ntion technologies based on the principles of power efﬁcient cognitive\
    \ and\ncooperative communications. It also offers a design of new air interfaces\n\
    and systems that achieve a 3–5 times improvement over current wireless\ncommunications\
    \ in terms of channel efﬁciency. It helps in the exploitation\nof a large channel\
    \ bandwidth in uncontested areas of the spectrum in higher\nfrequency bands encouraging\
    \ the techniques like spectrum co-existence and\nsharing. WISDOM development offers\
    \ large evolution [2]:\n2.7 WISDOM Challenges\n21\n• Making extensive use of small\
    \ size cells and the concept of virtual cells,\ni.e., grouping a number of small\
    \ cells in a synchronized manner in a way\nthat they all operate in the same channel\
    \ and are seen by the terminal as\na single base station.\n• Sharing of knowledge\
    \ which is used to improve user safety, through\nintelligent rich presence and\
    \ collaboration.\n• Services for accessibility of users and knowledge based services\
    \ into\nworkﬂow and applications, regardless of device.\n• Freedom for users to\
    \ work from home, ofﬁce or other location using high\nspeed Internet connections.\n\
    • Alogic based on dependability of services for modularization and locality\n\
    which operates on “best effort” of technology usage.\n2.6 WISDOM Impact\nIt is\
    \ already mentioned that WISDOM affords terabit communications with a\ncoverage\
    \ extending from a city region, to a country, the continents, and the\nworld.\
    \ This is possible by combining personal- and cognitive radio-networks\nwhich\
    \ is the basic operational concept of WISDOM.\nWISDOM enables to capitalize on\
    \ major innovations towards the future\nsmart infrastructure by integrating under\
    \ one interoperable umbrella lead-\ning technologies, such as advanced M2M communication\
    \ technologies,\nautonomic networking technologies, data mining and decision-making\
    \ tech-\nnologies, security and privacy protection technologies, cloud computing\n\
    technologies, with advanced sensing and actuating technologies.\n2.7 WISDOM Challenges\n\
    The four main operational domains of WISDOM are:\n1. Short range low mobility\
    \ communications\n2. Outdoor/Indoor cellular communications with full mobility\n\
    3. Converged Architecture\n4. Security\nThe challenges faced by the WISDOM in\
    \ the above domains are as follows:\nShort range low mobility communications\n\
    The main target of WISDOM is to provide high data rates of about 1\nTera bps in\
    \ short range communications. Some of the applications like\n22\nWISDOM Concept\
    \ and Challenges\nsmart phones, smart cars, personalized medicines, WLAN security\
    \ sys-\ntems, Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID), keyless gates, future Internet,\n\
    robotics, immersive applications, Green Information Communication Tech-\nnology\
    \ (GICT) and smart ofﬁces other wireless accessories etc. fall under this\ncategory.\n\
    The key challenges to achieve high data rates in short range distances\nare [1]:\n\
    a) Exploiting the particular bands in the spectrum range from the Extra\nHigh\
    \ Frequency band, that allow for the design of systems that yield\nhigh data rate\
    \ and signiﬁcant bandwidth efﬁciency, as required for\nTbit/s communications.\
    \ Band frequency ranging from 70 GHz up to\n300 GHz should be considered in particular.\
    \ Novel and unconventional\nsolutions, both for RF and baseband design should\
    \ be considered as the\ntraditional design approaches put some limitations on\
    \ the achievement of\n1-Tera bps connectivity. But, the high absorption rate at\
    \ those high carrier\nfrequencies poses great challenges for their utilization\
    \ in Non Line of\nSight (NLoS) and mobile connections.\nExploitation of such high\
    \ frequency bands opens many challenges,\namong them are:\n• available technology\
    \ support;\n• channel characterization at those frequencies is lacking;\n• design\
    \ of robust modulation and transmission techniques has to\nbe done considering\
    \ Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor\n(CMOS) components limitations;\n• pass\
    \ band of digital device does not allow to use one channel with\na bandwidth higher\
    \ than 2 GHz today.\nb) WISDOM short-range communications are based on multiple\
    \ directional\nantennas transmitting to the same terminal in order to create spatial\
    \ diver-\nsity and mitigate Line of Sight (LoS) blocking. Therefore, WISDOM\n\
    requires novel PHY techniques and also the advancements towards the\ncognitive\
    \ network architecture. Progress towards this CN concept can be\ndone by carrying\
    \ out research in a series of interrelated ﬁelds such as,\ndirectional links,\
    \ adaptive modulation and coding, medium independent\nhandover, cognitive radio\
    \ and cooperative techniques at different layers\nof the protocol stack.\nc) The\
    \ human-centric paradigm:This requires a huge interaction of the user\nwith her/his\
    \ environment in order to interchange information related to\nthe context, proﬁle,\
    \ role and other relevant information which in general\n2.7 WISDOM Challenges\n\
    23\nmay help to optimize the whole network behaviour as well as the user\nperception.\n\
    These are the challenges the WISDOM should consider for achieving high\ndata rates\
    \ in short-range communications.\nThe scenario of network architecture for short-range\
    \ communications\nis shown in the Figure 2.5. It consists of wireless communication\
    \ systems\ncomponents such as like CN, WSN, millimetre-wave (mm-wave) cooperative\n\
    communications, MIMO and virtual MIMO, multi-radio and multi-band\ndevices, multiple\
    \ frequency bands and air interfaces [2].\nThere are:\n• In mm-wave Communications:\
    \ MIMO and Virtual MIMO links in the\nmm-wave bands Different network architectures\
    \ (Scatter-nets, Multi-hop\nMesh, ad-hoc, indoor wireless-wireline connectivity).\n\
    • Application points (AP) and User equipment (UE): it consists of mainly\nthree\
    \ types of wireless devices such as Multi-band, Multi-Radio, and\nMicrowave Endometrial\
    \ Ablation (MEA).\nFigure 2.5\nNetwork architecture scenarios for short-range\
    \ communications [2].\n24\nWISDOM Concept and Challenges\n• Different network\
    \ architectures (Scatter-nets, Multi-hop Mesh, ad-hoc,\nindoor wireless-wireline\
    \ connectivity).\n• The concept of a CN: it is the combination of computer networks,\n\
    machine learning, knowledge representation and network management.\nCognitive\
    \ network is a cognitive process which has end-to-end goal\nwhich is achieved\
    \ by following the different network condition, planning,\ndecisions for the different\
    \ network condition with consequences of the\ndecisions.\n• The human-centric\
    \ paradigm: these devices are conﬁgured in such a way\nthat it will give paradigm\
    \ which will be human centric, e.g., smart homes,\nofﬁces, cars etc.\nOutdoor\
    \ mobile communications with full mobility\nWISDOM aims at delivering a sustainable\
    \ rate of 300 Mbps to an individual\nuser at full mobility with a peak rate in\
    \ excess of 1 Gbps, while the vision\nof the 1 Tera bps rate corresponds to aggregate\
    \ capacity of a large number of\nusers served in a metropolitan area. This target\
    \ calls for a revolutionary step\nfor the techniques to be adopted [2]:\na) WISDOM\
    \ shall consider new communication systems, based on the\nsuitable transmission,\
    \ signalling and modulation techniques, to be\nimplemented also in new bands.\n\
    b) MIMO and Virtual MIMO links in the mm-wave bands: MIMO\nand Virtual-MIMO (on\
    \ both sides of the link) and various types\nof beam-forming for establishing\
    \ highly directional links at high fre-\nquencies and in fast-fading environments.\n\
    c) Use of small cells and virtual cells\n• A virtual cell is a group of small\
    \ cells synchronized in a way that\nthey all operate in the same channel and are\
    \ seen by the terminal as\na single base station. The key advantage of such a\
    \ solution, is that\nmobility signalling is not increased compared to larger cell\
    \ systems\nand therefore management overhead and terminal complexity are\nin the\
    \ same order of magnitude. At the same time the solution\nretains the advantages\
    \ of a small cell system since the short distance\nbetween the terminal and the\
    \ nearest cell allows high bandwidth\ncommunication.\nFigure 2.6 illustrates the\
    \ network scenario/architecture for outdoor cellular\nsystem with the following\
    \ listed components [1]:\n2.7 WISDOM Challenges\n25\nFigure 2.6\nNetwork architecture\
    \ scenarios for outdoor mobile communications [2].\n• WISDOM Base Station and\
    \ User Equipment: Multi-band, Multi-Radio,\nMEA Systems\n• In mm-wave Communications\n\
    • MIMO and Virtual MIMO links in the mm-wave bands. Different\nnetwork architectures\
    \ (Multi-hop Mesh, ad-hoc, Wireless/Wireline back-\nhauling, Intelligent Transport\
    \ System (ITS)/Vehicular-to-Infrastructure\n(V2I))\n• The concept of CN\n• The\
    \ human-centric paradigm\nFigure 2.7 explains the network scenario for next generation\
    \ cellular\nnetworks and it consists of network of radio cells. It is aimed to\
    \ achieve\nWireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN). At the WMAN scale, the\n\
    vision of Tera bps wireless corresponds to aggregate capacity of all wireless\n\
    users served in a metropolitan area. For example, 400 radio cells in a\nmetropolitan\
    \ city, each cell serving 10 users, using 250 Mbps each for virtual\nreality applications:\
    \ 400 x 10 x 250 Mbps=1 Tera bps [1].\nConverged Architecture\nWISDOM will help\
    \ to design a converged architecture and network\nsolution with the goal of enabling\
    \ ubiquitous terabit wireless connectivity\nfor human-centric mega communications\
    \ over the network of the future.\n26\nWISDOM Concept and Challenges\nFigure 2.7\n\
    Scenario for next generation cellular networks [2].\nWISDOM will design and develop\
    \ wireless/wired interfaces and network\nprotocols in order to integrate the wireless\
    \ access networks to the ﬁxed\ninfrastructure as well as the core optical part\
    \ of the Network of the Future. For\nan optimized wireless/wire line network WISDOM\
    \ will propose some novel\nsolutions addressing the overall network architecture\
    \ and the interconnection\nof the different technology parts of the network with\
    \ the special focus on\ninterfacing network nodes. This is because these nodes\
    \ will play the role\nof edge devices as far as the optical network is concerned\
    \ and will provide\naggregation, trafﬁc shaping and trafﬁc engineering capabilities.\
    \ For end–\nto-end user optimization WISDOM will design, developand evaluate novel\n\
    transport protocols compatible to the wired part (optical ﬁbre) of the network\n\
    that are able to support the characteristics of both the metro and the core part\n\
    of the network offering abundant bandwidth in an efﬁcient and cost effective\n\
    manner. The converged WISDOM architecture will comprise a number of\nself-organizing/self-healing\
    \ wireless access networks whose design is based\noncognitiveandcooperationnetworkingprinciples.Thedesignoftheseaccess\n\
    networks is based on cognitive networking principles.\nThe key building blocks\
    \ of the WISDOM access networks are the\nWISDOM-node and the WISDOM-station, as\
    \ shown in Figure 2.8. The\n2.7 WISDOM Challenges\n27\nWISDOM-node is envisioned\
    \ as an intelligent cognitive multi-radio, multi-\nband, MIMO mobile device capable\
    \ of operating in a variety of spectrum\nallocation and interference conditions\
    \ by selecting cross-layer, cross-network\noptimized physical and network layer\
    \ parameters often in collaboration\nwith other radios even if they belong to\
    \ different co-located networks. The\nWISDOM-station is envisioned as ﬁxed or\
    \ mobile WISDOM-node that is\nchartered with the task of providing seamless interconnection\
    \ between the\nwire line and wireless parts of the converged architecture [2].\n\
    WISDOM node has a vital role in the design of the network algorithms and\nprotocols\
    \ at the local network and global internetworking levels. Speciﬁcally,\nat the\
    \ local level, support for cross-layer and cross-network optimization algo-\n\
    rithms in autonomous cognitive networks requires an advanced distributed\ncontrol\
    \ and management framework. At the global internetworking level,\nclusters of\
    \ cognitive networks represent a new category of access networks\nthat need to\
    \ be interfaced efﬁciently with the wired network infrastructure\nboth interms\
    \ of control and data.\nFigure 2.8\nWISDOM Node and WISDOM Station [2].\n28\n\

    \ of the\nfollowing components [1]:\na) WISDOM Mesh Network\nb) WISDOM Edge Node\n\
    Metro core network is permutation of WISDOM Mesh Network and\nWISDOM Edge Node.\
    \ In this mishmash authentication, authorization and\naccounting (AAA) streaming\

    \ and integrity. Robustness provides degree\nto which a system operates perfectly\
    \ in all conditions. Conﬁdentiality ensures\ninformation is accessible only to\
    \ those authorized to have access.\n2.8 Summary\nThe aim of the Wireless Innovative\
    \ System for Dynamically Operating\nMega-communications (WISDOM) is to provide\
    \ terabit communications\nto the future world. Future networks will feature applications\
    \ and devices\nthat are highly personalized and humancentric. WISDOM aims to support\n\

    \ like LTE and WIMAX. Data speed per user should\nalso not be compromised. Ubiquitous,\
    \ instantaneous and always connected are\nsome of the key prerequisites of a modern\
    \ mobile device. It has been partly\ncomplied by LTE and some Network based applications\
    \ based on the IMS\n(IP Multimedia Subsystem) [1] framework like Rich Communication\
    \ Suite\n(RCS) [2]. The data requirement per user is facing an exponential growth\n\
    with the high proliferation of the applications on the UEs available today.\n\
    M2M and IoTs today play an important role in shaping up the data trafﬁc\npatterns\
    \ which can be sporadic or distributed over time. As the new device\ntechnologies\
    \ usher in, the data throughput requirement per user soars. The\nsmart phone and\
    \ tablets with three dimension (3D) screens and cameras will\nbe bandwidth hungry.\
    \ Screen resolution will further increase leading to higher\ndata rates. Online\
    \ multiplayer gaming applications running on 5G gaming\nconsoles with 3D displays\
    \ will require higher throughput both for the uplink\nand downlink. Ultra High\
    \ Deﬁnition (UHD) voice and UHD video realized\nthrough Rich Communication Services\
    \ (RCS) [2] will contribute to the growth\nof data trafﬁc. More dedicated data\
    \ bearers will be required at the access and\n31\n32\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device\
    \ Communication\ncore to guarantee the QoS promised to the user. Due to the swarm\
    \ of M2M and\nIoT devices in the network, the mobility management related processes\
    \ will be\nmore intense and will consume more network resources. The nano nature\
    \ of\nthe devices with limited RF power will imply additional small-cells/microcells\n\
    which will increase the intricacy of the access and core network.\nThe key question\
    \ is how can one realize a network that can achieve the\nfollowing:\n1. Cater\
    \ the bandwidth requirement of next generation mobile devices\nmeant for human\
    \ users as well for machines.\n2. High Data rate over large coverage areas and\
    \ dense demographies.\n3. Reduce cost of network infrastructure and operation\n\
    4. Meet the bandwidth, latency, QoS requirement for supporting the next\ngeneration\
    \ network and device applications.\n5. Reduce power consumption in the network\
    \ and the device\n6. Lessen the complexity in the Access (radio) and core network\
    \ layers\nLiving through the advancements in mobile network technology from 2G/3G–\n\
    UMTS towards LTE (4G), one may notice that the primary emphasis is to\nenable\
    \ higher bandwidth per user required to drive the next generation network\nand\
    \ device applications. With the evolution of the mobile networks from 2G to\n\
    4G [3], there is an attempt to inject more symbols (data) per unit time. This\
    \ has\nbeen made possible by the evolution of the modulation schemes from Binary\n\
    Phase Shift Keying in case of 2G, to 64 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation\nfor LTE-Advanced.\
    \ In the current Mobile Radio Access Network there is a\nhost of network processes,\
    \ tightly synchronized and orchestrated by intelligent\nnetwork elements, such\
    \ as:\n• Handover management\n• Location management\n• Call drop off management\n\
    • Interoperability and downward compatibility management\n• Service control (like\
    \ roaming control)\n• Feature management\nThese processes involve complex signalling\
    \ operations across the radio and\nthe core network. The attempt to simplify the\
    \ network in IMS [1] and LTE [4]\nis focused to make the core and access networks\
    \ all IP. Following the evolution\ntrail from 2G to 4G, a signiﬁcant philosophical\
    \ drift towards simpliﬁcation in\nterms of the service logic related to mobility\
    \ and location management is not\ndiscerned. A similar process for handover, frequency\
    \ reuse, location updates\nand cancellations in 4G as compared with 2G [3] is\
    \ witnessed. Hence the\n3.1 5G Communication Landscape\n33\nnetwork elements of\
    \ the state of the art still need to be equipped with the intelli-\ngence and\
    \ processing power to handle all these complex signalling operations.\nThis has\
    \ a knock-on effect on the handsets too. It involves considerable amount\nof processing\
    \ power, thus leading to more battery drainage. So it is imperative\nto look beyond\
    \ the state of the art and conceive a technology which is devoid of\nthese constrains\
    \ and is ideal for the next generation mobile devices. The same\ngoes for core\
    \ network design. Mobility and Location management in the core\nnetwork necessitates\
    \ a substantial volume of signalling interaction between\nthe HLR/HSS (Home Location\
    \ Register/Home Subscription Service) and the\nMME (Mobility Management Entity)\
    \ in LTE core [4] and MSC/VLR (Mobile\nSwitching Center/Visited Location Register)\
    \ in UMTS Core. Inefﬁcient and\nun-optimized engineering and design of these network\
    \ elements impact the\nservice assurance, and ﬁnally degrade to the overall QoS\
    \ offered by the\nnetwork. Also, a substantial amount of resources is used up\
    \ for addressing the\nwireless node in the cellular network, both from the perspective\
    \ of available\nbandwidth and also the associated processing activities carried\
    \ out in the\ndifferent network elements at the Radio Access Network (RAN) and\
    \ Core\nNetwork (CN).\nManaging a mobile network is hugely resource and knowledge\
    \ intensive,\nprimarily because of the inherent complexity of the network architectures.\n\
    For example, during cell planning one needs to consider the trafﬁc demand to\n\
    cover a speciﬁc region, availability of base station sites, available channel\n\
    capacity at each base station, and the service quality at various potential trafﬁc\n\
    demand areas. The allocation of the right frequency at the cells to get an opti-\n\
    mum frequency reuse factor is crucial to achieve smooth handovers, avoidance\n\
    of call drops during handover, and overall elevation of the performance of the\n\
    network. These are part of the overall cell planning activity and it requires\
    \ a lot\nof resources, in terms of FTE (Full Time Equivalent) and hence it increases\
    \ the\noperational cost. The Switching (Time/Space) matrix of a Mobile Switching\n\
    Center of a 2G/3G network has a ﬁnite limit to make and break the number\nof calls.\
    \ The Busy Hour Call Attempt handling capacity of a Switch depends\nmuch on engineering\
    \ and dimensioning of this matrix. With the CSCF (Call\nSession Control Function)\
    \ for IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) [1] and the\nMMEs (Mobility Management Entity)\
    \ for the LTE [4], one does not need the\nTime and Space switching Matrix. The\
    \ CSCF/MME acts more as SIP(Session\nInitiation protocol) router for IMS and SIP/GTP/DIAMETER\
    \ router in case of\nLTE. However, for routing a call, these network elements\
    \ still need to involve\ndirectly the Layer 7, which utilizes lot of resources\
    \ and processing power of\nthese network elements. This in turn makes the network\
    \ elements expensive\n34\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\n\
    and increases the capital and operational cost of the mobile network. As a\nconsequence\
    \ of the convergence of heterogeneous mobile applications catered\nby the expanse\
    \ of the mobile devices preordained for diverse deployment\nscenarios, the signalling\
    \ inter-processes between the network and the user\nequipment become more intricate.\n\
    3.1 5G Communication Landscape\nWith the present day device capabilities, the\
    \ mobile devices are in constant\ninteraction with each other. The human-centric\
    \ mobile device interacts with\nvarious wearable devices, like smart watches,\
    \ wearable computers (e.g., Sixth\nSense), SOS devices and health equipments.\
    \ As the user moves around, these\ndevices become more dynamic in nature. The\
    \ devices, categorized as M2M or\nIoTs, may be as below (though this is an example\
    \ and not an exhaustive list):\n1. Environment sensors\n2. Connected cars\n3.\
    \ Smart objects and robots\n4. Health equipments\n5. Small cells not owned by\
    \ the mobile operators\nAccording to the newly formed group called METIS (Mobile\
    \ and wireless\ncommunications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty Information Society),\
    \ which\nis a consortium of mobile Original Equipment Manufacturer, operators,\n\
    academic institutions and automotive companies a 5G Network should have\n1000\
    \ times higher mobile data rate volume per area, 10 to 100 times more\nconnected\
    \ devices, 10 to 100 times higher typical user data rate, 10 times\nlonger battery\
    \ life for low power devices and 5 times smaller end-to-end\nlatency. The main\
    \ objective of the project is to lay the foundation of 5G, the\nnext generation\
    \ mobile and wireless communications system. The aim is to\nlet people seamlessly\
    \ bridge the virtual and physical worlds offering the same\nlevel of all-senses,\
    \ context-based, rich communication experience over ﬁxed\nand wireless networks.\
    \ Apart from these basic needs, one need systems which\ncan work with the same\
    \ performance level in the crowds. It should offer the\nsame QoS and throughput\
    \ as in ofﬁce, or home as on the move. It should render\nlow end-to-end latency\
    \ and reliability to enable machine type applications.\n3.2 Related Work on 5G\n\
    To meet these demands and to conceive a network which incorporates all\nthese\
    \ enhancements over the 4G, one may need to analyse the potential of\n3.3 Cellular\
    \ Device-to-Device Communication\n35\nnew access technologies and architectural\
    \ concepts and then identify the ones\nwhich can be the eligible contenders to\
    \ serve as 5G technology\nSome of them are as follows:\na) Multi-tier 5G Networks\n\
    b) PHY layer based Network Coding\nc) Generalized frequency division multiplexing\
    \ (GFDM)\nd) Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)\ne) Cognitive Radio\nf) D2D\
    \ communication\ng) Beam forming technology\nh) In mm-wave technology\ni) Massive\
    \ MIMO\nHowever, the scope of this chapter is not to investigate on all these\
    \ options\nand not to provide a comparative analysis. Rather, some new paradigms\n\
    which have the potential to play pivotal roles in shaping up the 5G net-\nwork\
    \ architecture and the D2D Communication Framework are staged. In\nD2D communication,\
    \ user equipments (UEs) exchange information among\nthemselves peer-to-peer over\
    \ a direct link using the cellular resources instead\nof that through the base\
    \ station or eNodeB. This is markedly different from\nsmall cell (femto cell)\
    \ communication where UEs communicate with the help\nof small low-power cellular\
    \ base stations. D2D users communicate directly\nwhile remaining controlled under\
    \ the CellularAccess network. This optimizes\nresource utilization in a cellular\
    \ network and boosts spectral efﬁciency.\nThis chapter will primarily delve in\
    \ the following domains.\na) D2D communication: a study on the existing approaches\
    \ with the new\napproach, the Smart Mobile Network Access Topology (SMNAT).\n\
    b) Integration of SMNAT with LTE-Advanced and 5G Core.\nc) Security aspects in\
    \ light of cooperative communication between two\ndevices.\n3.3 Cellular Device-to-Device\
    \ Communication\nCellular D2D communication is meant to reduce the cellular trafﬁc\
    \ load by\nactuating a breakout from the UE itself and directly establish trafﬁc\
    \ towards\nthe other paired UE using the cellular channel. As a collateral impact,\
    \ this can\nsigniﬁcantly contribute to slacken the processor intensive signalling\
    \ process\nas explained above. It leverages the beneﬁt from the proximity between\
    \ two\ndevices and increases the overall resource utilization of the cellular\
    \ network.\n36\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\nBut it is\
    \ imperative that one needs to come up with new methodologies for\ndevice discovery\
    \ and pairing. Direct D2D technologies have already been\ndeveloped in several\
    \ wireless standards, aiming to meet the needs for efﬁcient\nlocal data transmission\
    \ required by variant services in personal, public and\nindustrial areas. Some\
    \ of the existing contenders are Bluetooth, Zigbee and\ndirect Wi-Fi. With D2D\
    \ communication, the aim is to ﬁnd a method which\nis tightly integrated with\
    \ the cellular network and uses the same spectrum as\ncellular operations.\nImparting\
    \ D2D capability in a mobile device impacts the whole of\nthe network framework\
    \ and is not an inconsequential addition. Issues like\nauthentication, real time\
    \ billing, fraud control will crop up and the devices\nwill directly interact\
    \ with each other bypassing the network.\nBut on a positive note, the beneﬁts\
    \ are bountiful.\n1. As the paired devices are in the same cell sector, or in\
    \ the same cell\n(different sector) or in adjacent cells in physical proximity,\
    \ high data\nrates with low latency can be achieved.\n2. Depending on the proximity\
    \ of the devices, the radio power level will be\nreduced. This will result in\
    \ better battery life.\n3. As the same radio resources are used for cellular and\
    \ D2D communica-\ntion, hence the average frequency reuse factor will be better.\n\
    4. For a traditional cellular network, one needs two distinct channels for\nuplink\
    \ and downlink between the UE and the base station (BS). But\nin case of D2D communication,\
    \ a single channel can be used for both\ndirections. Hence the overall spectral\
    \ efﬁciency is better.\n5. The spectral efﬁciency can be further enhanced if the\
    \ cognitive radio\ncommunication is used wherein the unused spectrum holes may\
    \ be\nutilized for establishing direct communication between the two nodes.\n\
    6. As the D2D communications has limited dependence on the network\ninfrastructure\
    \ the devices could be used for instant communications\nbetween a number of devices\
    \ within a range.\n7. D2D on 5G would use licensed spectrum and this would enable\
    \ the\nfrequencies to be used to be less impacted by interference.\n8. In times\
    \ of natural calamities where some essential components of core\nand access network\
    \ have failed, D2D communication can ensue.\nA practical implementation scenario\
    \ of an Over the Top (OTT) application\nmeant from smartphones (for D2D communication)\
    \ is from Google. A\nnew mobile messaging application called FireChat is empowering\
    \ nearby\nsmartphone users to stay in touch even when there’s no cellular service\
    \ or\n3.3 Cellular Device-to-Device Communication\n37\nInternet connection. The\
    \ messaging application harnesses a technology called\nwireless mesh networking,\
    \ which might someday allow a myriad of devices\nto connect like links in a chain.\
    \ The technique might someday be used to tie\ntogether thousands of devices with\
    \ built-in radios and make it possible to be\nonline without having to pay for\
    \ the access. It could also enable online commu-\nnications in remote areas or\
    \ disaster zones without Wi-Fi or cellular signals.\nD2D has been proposed as\
    \ a Rel.12 3GPP feature. D2D Study Item had\nan approval in 3GPP SA1 (Services\
    \ working group) in 2011, called ProSe\n(Proximity based Services) [5] which identiﬁes\
    \ the use cases and envisage\nthe requirements including network operator control,\
    \ security, Authentica-\ntion, Authorization and Accounting (AAA), regulatory\
    \ aspects, public safety\nrequirements, integration with current infrastructure,\
    \ network ofﬂoading. The\nongoing discussion by ProSe includes evaluation requirements,\
    \ D2D channel\nmodel, resource use, ProSe discovery and ProSe communication, etc.\n\
    ProSe Communication between two UEs in proximity is established by\nmeans of a\
    \ communication path established between the UEs.\n• The ProSe Communication path\
    \ is established\n• by Direct communication between the UEs\n• or routed via the\
    \ local eNB\n• by ProSe Discovery.\n• Communication Process identiﬁes that a UE\
    \ is in proximity of\nanother UE.\n• by Open [ProSe] Discovery\n• ProSe Discovery\
    \ without permission from the UE being discovered.\n• by Restricted [ProSe] discovery\n\
    • ProSe Discovery that only takes place with permission from the UE\nbeing discovered.\n\
    D2D communication for M2M type devices is a topic of interest for many\ntelecom\
    \ researchers. This is because of the huge volume of the devices which\nmay eventually\
    \ clog up the Mobile network and jeopardize the human-to-\nhuman services. The\
    \ study on D2D requirements for MTC Device to MTC\nDevice scenarios covers\n•\
    \ The identiﬁcation and functionality needed to set up a connection towards\n\
    a MTC Device.\n• The IMS domain may provide a solution for this required functionality.\n\
    • MTC Devices often act as a gateway for a MTC capillary network of\nother MTC\
    \ Devices or non-3GPP devices\n38\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\n\
    D2D group for Machine type communications (M2M) Study on Enhance-\nments for MTC\
    \ is a 3GPP speciﬁcation – TR 22.888 [6] has been crafted in\npurview of these\
    \ requirements.\nAs depicted in Figure 3.1, the scenarios that are covered are\n\
    • Devices Communicating directly\n• Devices Communicating via MTC Server\n• Devices\
    \ Communicating with assistance from a Name resolution server\nD2D Communication\
    \ can be broadly categorized as:\n1. Out of band\n2. In-band\nOut of band D2D\
    \ essentially implies that the devices use a radio technology\nin the standalone\
    \ mode to actuate communication with a paired device. The\npairing method is in\
    \ the purview of that speciﬁc radio technology.\nSome existing out of band D2D\
    \ communication methods are:\n• Bluetooth\n• ZigBee\n• Near Field Communication\n\
    • Direct Wi-Fi\nFigure 3.1\nThree methods of D2D communication for M2M devices.\n\
    3.4 D2D Using Physical Layer Network Coding\n39\nIn-band D2D communication implies\
    \ that the devices use the cellular\nspectrum and the cellular technology.\nIn\
    \ this chapter a new concept for the realization of in-band D2D not by\nusing\
    \ new resource allocation methodologies but by using a new mobility\nmanagement\
    \ and addressing concept called SMNAT (Smart Mobile Network\nAccess Topology)\
    \ [7–13] has been presented.\nThe subsequent Sections 3.4–3.6 will bring out the\
    \ various radio resource\nmanagement technologies that can be employed in the\
    \ in band D2D commu-\nnication, as seen in the state of the art. These technologies\
    \ are based on the\nunderlay cellular network, hence they fall in the category\
    \ of in-band D2D\ncommunication methods.\n3.4 D2D Using Physical Layer Network\
    \ Coding\nIn this technique [20], there are two cooperating mobile nodes which\
    \ can\nrelay network codes over the channel codes in two different paths, as shown\n\
    in Figure 3.2. First it is being sent to the candidate mobile, and subsequently\n\
    Figure 3.2\nInteraction between the initiating device, candidate (pair) device\
    \ and base station\nfor realizing network assisted D2D communication.\n40\nSMNAT\
    \ as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\nit is being sent to the BS. The\
    \ candidate mobile node responds back with a\nnew code. The code received from\
    \ the candidate mobile is combined with\nthe code that was originally sent to\
    \ that mobile. The combined code is sent\nto the BS which modiﬁes it with a mathematical\
    \ expression and relays to the\ncandidate mobile. The candidate mobile who is\
    \ aware of this mathematical\nexpression deciphers the code that it had sent/received\
    \ to/from the mobile that\nhas initiated the pairing. When it is successful, the\
    \ channel is identiﬁed and\nthe trafﬁc path between the two nodes is established.\n\
    The random selection of two pairs may not alleviate the performance of\nthe network\
    \ and optimize the system capacity. This is because of the fact that\nchannel\
    \ conditions between the mobile node and the BS can vary to quite some\nextent.\
    \ This may lead to disproportionate SINRs between the nodes and the\nBS, entirely\
    \ depending on the channel quality. Hence User Grouping based on\nproportionate\
    \ parameters is done by the network based on some Cost Function\nso as to optimize\
    \ the performance.\n3.5 D2D Using Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR)\nInterference\
    \ is a signiﬁcant issue in D2D communications. The interference\nis caused by\
    \ devices in D2D mode with that in the normal cellular mode and\nthe eNodeBs.\
    \ It also depends a lot on the position of the D2D device in the\ncell, whether\
    \ it is towards the exterior or towards the interior.\nIn [21], the radio resource\
    \ allocation scheme using FFR is proposed.\nDifferent resources are allocated\
    \ to the D2D UEs according to their location\nin the cell. If the D2D UE resides\
    \ in the inner region of a cell, then they\ncan use the frequency band that is\
    \ not used by the eNodeB for relaying\nto the D2D UEs [24]. The ratio of different\
    \ frequency reuse factor and the\ncorresponding power level are optimized or adjusted\
    \ adaptively according to\nthe trafﬁc load and user distribution. D2D and eNodeB\
    \ relaying UEs located in\nthe same cell do not interfere because radio resources\
    \ from another frequency\nband are orthogonally allocated to the D2D and the eNodeBs\
    \ relaying to\nthe UEs.\n3.6 D2D Using Cognitive Radio\nIn reference [22], there\
    \ is an overview on how D2D communication can be\nrealized over secondary users.\
    \ With this concept, the primary users can only\ntransceive via the BS. The secondary\
    \ user can avail both D2D plus the BS\ntransmission mode.\n3.7 Introducing SMNAT\
    \ 41\nIn reference [23] a joint subcarrier and power allocation method CR-D2D-\n\
    MC for cognitive multicast with D2D communication coexisting with cellular\nnetworks\
    \ have been proposed. The impact of imperfect spectrum sensing is\nconsidered\
    \ in the proposed problem, which results in the capacity decrease\nof the cognitive\
    \ multicast. The simulation results show that the proposed\nalgorithm improves\
    \ the spectrum efﬁciency and maintains a better trade-\noff between capacity and\
    \ fairness for cognitive networks in a low algorithm\ncomplexity. Therefore, employing\
    \ cognitive multicast based on D2D is able to\nexplore more potential spectrum\
    \ resources adequately to improve the system\nperformance, and make it possible\
    \ to satisfy the requirements of multiple kinds\nof high rate transmission.\n\
    3.7 Introducing SMNAT\nSMNAT as a concept has been introduced in references [8,\
    \ 12], which offers a\nglobal solution for various categories of cellular network.\
    \ In SMNAT, the PHY\nlayerisredesignedtotakepartdirectlyinaddressingandmobilitymanagement\n\
    [13]. Similarly, in reference [10], it has been discussed how to implement\nSMNAT\
    \ for a mobile network which serves M2M and H2H (Human-to-\nHuman) users. In reference\
    \ [11], SMNAT has been proposed for Vehicular\ncommunication network where D2D\
    \ communication can be achieved at a\ngroup level. In reference [9], implementation\
    \ scenario for a nano mobile\nnetwork was brought in. In references [16–18] it\
    \ has been demonstrated how\nan intelligent PHY layer can be conceived by using\
    \ colour synthesis and\nconveyed electronically for use in mobile or ﬁxed networks.\
    \ In reference [19]\na system model was developed showing how to use the smart\
    \ PHY layer\nrealized by colour coding for the purpose of joint source channel\
    \ coding.\nOf late, the focus of the telecom researchers is to make the PHY layer\n\
    more generic, intelligent and adaptable for higher bandwidth. As an example,\n\
    GFDM[25]implementsageneralizedOrthoFrequencyDivisionMultiplexing\n(OFDM), which\
    \ introduces additional degrees of freedom when choosing the\nsystem parameters.\
    \ A technique called tail biting is employed to eliminate the\nneed for additional\
    \ guard periods that would be necessary in a conventional\nsystem, in order to\
    \ compensate for ﬁltering tails and prevent overlapping of\nsubsequent symbols.\n\
    The purpose of SMNAT is to realize a smart and ﬂexible PHY layer which\ncan directly\
    \ take part in some activities which are performed by layer 7 in the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ networks. Take the example of mobility management itself\nwhich entails activities\
    \ like device location tracking across cells, handover\n42\nSMNAT as Enabler of\
    \ Device-to-Device Communication\nand channel management.All these activities\
    \ demand some processing power\nrequired to actuate associated service logic at\
    \ layer 7.\nSMNAT aims to simulate layer 5 and 7 processes related to addressing\
    \ and\nidentiﬁcation of a mobile node (UE) in the RAN, at the PHY layer [8, 13].\
    \ A\nmobile node is identiﬁed by a symbol located at a ﬁxed phase and amplitude\n\
    in the complex plane, a time slot in the time frame and a physical channel\nwhich\
    \ are determined during provisioning of the UE. Figure 3.3 shows one\nTime Division\
    \ Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, which includes Tn+1 time\nslots (numbered from\
    \ T0 to Tn). The data rate required for the trafﬁc burst is\ndenoted by fd fp\
    \ denotes the sampling rates of the time slots before it is used to\nconvey the\
    \ trafﬁc data. fr denotes the refresh frequency for the given frame.\nfd>>fp>>fr\n\
    The modulation scheme implemented is a blend of M1 PSK (for outer\nring) and M2\
    \ PSK (for inner ring), where M1<M2. Figure 3.3 shows the\nproposed constellation\
    \ in the case of M1=8 and M2=4. The constellation\ndiagram in Figure 3.4 pertains\
    \ to a speciﬁc time slot, T1, of the frame. The\nframe corresponds to a speciﬁc\
    \ subcarrier. Symbols of the outer ring are\nconveyed at a rate of fr and the\
    \ symbols of the inner ring are exchanged\nat a much higher rate, fd.\nIn particular,\
    \ one could set: fd = 8 × fr. The outer ring comprises M1\nsymbols for user trafﬁc,\
    \ and the inner ring comprises M2 that will be used for\nthe purpose of addressing\
    \ the users. In the proposed multiple access scheme,\na user is identiﬁed in the\
    \ network with respect to the symbol coordinate in the\nFigure 3.3\nTDMA frame.\n\
    3.8 Network Architecture and the Processes\n43\nFigure 3.4\nConstellation diagram.\n\
    complex plane. The 8PSK symbols are continuously rotated with 3/8 radians\nper\
    \ symbol. The rotated symbols are deﬁned in Equation 3.1.\nˆsi = si . eji3π/8\n\
    (3.1)\nThe modulated RF carrier is therefore given in Equation 3.2:\nx(t′) =\n\
    \x02\n2Es\nT\nRe[y(t′).ej(2πf0t′+ϕ0)]\n(3.2)\nWhere, Es is the energy per modulating\

    The network consists of access points which are Wireless transceivers/\nrepeaters\
    \ supporting the Smart modulation scheme. As shown in Figure 3.5,\nmultiple access\
    \ points are interfaced to the local multiplexers. For the uplink,\n44\nSMNAT\

    7. It can actuate the functionality of a gateway router to receive calls from\
    \ a\nstate-of-the-art network. This is alike the functionality of Gateway MSC\n\
    of 2G/3G networks.\n3.8 Network Architecture and the Processes\n45\nFigure 3.6\n\
    High level functionality of Coordination Processor.\n3.8.1 Frame Formation in\
    \ the Uplink\nThe control signalling messages are invoked by the mobile device\
    \ only when\nit initiates a network operation, like Mobile origination Calls,\
    \ SMS, etc. But\nno messages are generated for location update unlike the state\
    \ of the art.\nThe device never gets attached to the network. The network does\
    \ not keep\na track of the location and presence of the device continuously; hence\
    \ one\nmay eliminate the need of the continuous exchange of mobility management\n\
    messages between the network and the device.\nFigure 3.7 Illustrates how the frame\
    \ is formed in the uplink for the\naddressing part. Multiple UEs (mobile devices)\
    \ as in this diagram invoke\n46\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\n\
    Figure 3.7\nAggregate frame formation in the uplink and user (A number) identiﬁcation\
    \ by\nCoordination Processor.\n3.8 Network Architecture and the Processes\n47\n\
    call requests. The UE ﬁrst hunts for an available AFCRN where the time\nslot in\
    \ the allocated position (as assigned to the user during the provisioning\nprocess)\
    \ is identiﬁed. The symbol is then populated in the time slot and the\nUE generates\
    \ a time frame by injecting only the speciﬁc symbol in that time\nslot in the\
    \ time frame. Other time slots in the time frame are empty (as in\nFigure 3.7).\
    \ The time frame pertaining to the available AFCRN is marked in\nblack in Figure\
    \ 3.7 which implies that the user equipment has successfully\npopulated the assigned\
    \ symbol (assigned to itself) in the time slot predeﬁned\nfor the user. The access\
    \ point transfers the information to the local Multiplexer\nwhich aggregates the\
    \ symbols ingressing from the user equipments and\nformulates a single time frame\
    \ for each AFCRN. The Local Multiplexer\nformulates a time frame by injecting\
    \ the symbols from the different users in\nthe appropriate slots as per the time\
    \ frames arriving from the user equipment.\nThis time frame is transported to\
    \ the Aggregate Multiplexer. The Aggre-\ngate Multiplexer synthesizes an aggregate\
    \ time frame with respect to each\nAFCRN and forwards it to the Coordination Processor\
    \ for analysis and call\nprocessing.\nAt this stage, it is impossible to identify\
    \ the address of A party address\n(calling number of a particular user) from the\
    \ symbol coordinate and timeslot,\nbecause the AFCRN is variable. Hence the Coordination\
    \ Processor cannot\ncommence authentication. It ﬁrst needs to secure the time\
    \ slot in both\nuplink/downlink directions between the MS and itself. Hence it\
    \ generates\na response message in downlink towards the MS using the same AFCRN\n\
    number that was used by the A party in the during the uplink layer 1 message\n\
    for call initiation. However, the particular AFCRN may not be available\nbecause\
    \ it may already be in use as trafﬁc channel by other users. In this\ncase, the\
    \ Coordination Processor does not generate the response message\ntowards the MS.\
    \ The MS waits for the timer expiry (in milliseconds) and\nrestarts the scan process\
    \ and re-initiates a new message with another available\nAFCRN. In this process,\
    \ it skips the AFCRN that was previously determined\nas unavailable. Following\
    \ a successful layer 1 handshake between UE and\nthe Coordination Processor, the\
    \ time slot pertaining to the AFCRN is used\nfurther as trafﬁc channel. The UE\
    \ generates a layer 7 message towards\nthe Coordination Processor encapsulated\
    \ in the time slot that was allocated\nfollowing the layer 1 handshake process\
    \ as described earlier. The data\nconveyance materializes following M2 PSK modulation\
    \ on the inner ring\nof the constellation diagram (Figure 3.3). UE populates A\
    \ party addresses\n(calling address in E.212 format), authentication parameters,\
    \ dialled numbers,\nsupplementary service information in this message, so that\
    \ the Coordination\n48\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\nProcessor\
    \ can liaise with the HSS/HLR to actuate authentication, authorization\nfor A\
    \ party. Subsequently, it analyses the B Party (dialled) number and ﬁgures\nout\
    \ the outgoing channel by carrying out dialled digit analysis. The above\nprocess\
    \ deviates from mobile originating call procedure followed by the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ Mobile Networks. Generally in conventional networks, the\nserving MSC/MME/CSCF\
    \ generates an ISUP/SIP message directly for call\ntermination towards the B party\
    \ address. There is no interrogation towards\nthe HLR//HSS. Only in case of Home\
    \ routing scenarios, the call is routed\ntowards the Home network where the SCP\
    \ (Service Control point) is queried\nto generate a “Connect To” number.\n3.8.2\
    \ Frame Formation in the Downlink\nThe downlink process of how the call matures\
    \ at the downlink towards B\nParty (called address) UE is shown in Figure 3.8.\
    \ When the call arrives at the\nCoordination Processor, it ﬁrst analyses if the\
    \ B party address is served by\nthe same mobile network, i.e., the smart network.\
    \ If yes, then it interrogates\nthe HSS/HLR for obtaining the symbol coordinate,\
    \ time slot and the primary\nAFCRN allocated for the B Party. The supplementary\
    \ and the tele-services\nassigned for the B party are also downloaded by the HSS/HLR\
    \ towards the\nCoordination Processor. Subsequently, the Coordination Processor\
    \ injects the\nsymbol of B party in time slot (preconﬁgured for B number) in the\
    \ time frame\nfor the particular AFCRN in the downlink. In case the primary AFCRN\
    \ is\nbusy, then alternativeAFCRNs are tried according to the predeﬁned frequency\n\
    scanning schemes. Note that this time frame also carries the symbols from\nother\
    \ users in the respective time slots. Aggregate frame is formed and is\nFigure\
    \ 3.8\nFrame formation in the downlink\n3.8 Network Architecture and the Processes\n\
    49\nrouted to the Aggregate Multiplexer. The Aggregate Multiplexer broadcasts\n\
    the time frames pertaining to all the AFCRNs in the Downlink via the Local\nMultiplexer\
    \ and access points. B party scans the AFCRNs and looks out\nfor the speciﬁc symbol\
    \ contained in the speciﬁc time slot assigned for B\nnumber. If it ﬁnds one, then\
    \ it formulates a response message by injecting\nthe same symbol in the same time\
    \ slot position in the UL. If the time slot\n(pertaining to the AFCRN) is busy,\
    \ there is no response back from B party.\nThe Coordination Processor has a time\
    \ out and tries to page B party again with\nan alternate AFCRN according to the\
    \ frequency scanning logic. As AFCRN\nis not ﬁxed, one cannot ascertain at this\
    \ stage seeing the radio layer PHY\nlayer message whether the page message is\
    \ intended for the particular B\nparty address or some other users. The page message\
    \ can indeed be meant\nfor another user provisioned with the same symbol coordinate\
    \ and time slot\nposition. Hence, multiple users can simultaneously try to generate\
    \ the response\nmessage. But once the Coordination Processor receives the layer\
    \ 1 page\nresponse, the time slot related to the AFCRN will be reserved for use\
    \ by\nthe Coordination Processor. The time slot/AFCRN is also reserved at the\n\
    UE end. The subsequent layer 7 message generated by the Coordination\nProcessor\
    \ will bear the B party address (E.212) as well as the A party address\n(E.164\
    \ for the CLI) and the supplementary service information. The speciﬁc\nUE (the\
    \ original B party) will respond to this layer 7 message. The other UEs\nwhich\
    \ reserved the time slot will release it when it ascertains from the layer 7\n\
    message carried by the time slot that the page was intended for another user\n\
    (i.e., the B party). This completes the addressing process in the downlink.\n\
    3.8.3 Integration of SMNAT with 5G Cores\nIt is imperative that the success behind\
    \ any new technology lies in its\ninteroperability and integration possibility\
    \ with the existing or evolving\nnetworks. As a reference, in [14], the primary\
    \ challenges for interworking\nbetween LTE core network and legacy core network\
    \ are discussed. SMNAT is\noriented on the PHY layer to implement the processes\
    \ of addressing, mobility\nmanagement and data exchange. On the contrary, 3GPPs\
    \ vision on mobility\nmanagement on 5G is founded on the application layer, more\
    \ speciﬁcally\nthe NAS (Non Access Stratum). The NAS deﬁnes the basic processes\
    \ for\nmobility management for EPC (Enhanced Packet Core) between the UE and\n\
    the MME. The two topologies are ideologically converse. Due to this reason\nit\
    \ is recommended to follow a two stepped approach for integration of the two\n\
    technologies.\n50\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\nShort-term\
    \ approach\nWLAN can be integrated by the EPC core as it permits integration of\
    \ non\n3GPP untrusted network via the ePDG (evolved Packet Data Gateway). In\n\
    Figure 3.9, the end-to-end integration between SMNAT and EPC is shown.\nThe UE\
    \ establishes a communication with HSS through ePDG for actu-\nating EPC authentication.\
    \ At SMNAT end, RADIUS based authentication\nis followed alike the EAP-AKA mechanism.\
    \ The conversion rules from\nRADIUS to DIAMETER (EPC) follow the GSM IR 61 recommendations.\n\
    The data transfer between the UE and the IMS core is established via the\nS2b\
    \ interface between the ePDG and the PGW.\nThe call ﬂow is shown in Figure 3.10.\
    \ It can be seen that two processes\nare covered.\n1. Authentication\n2. Data\
    \ transfer\nIt may be interesting to note that mobility management messages are\
    \ not\nexchanged with EPC. In a state-of-the-art (LTE) network, the UE actuate\n\
    NAS signalling with the EPC. NAS, which is a layer 7 process, is not\nimplemented\
    \ in SMNAT. Rather SMNAT is dependent on a process where\nlocation management\
    \ is realized via layer 1. This is the reason, the mobility\nmanagement messages\
    \ like Location Update/Location Cancellation are not\nseen (Figure 3.10). SMNAT\
    \ can directly ﬁt in the architecture which has been\nrealized for integrating\
    \ Wi-Fi with EPC.\nFigure 3.9\nIntegration of SMNAT with EPC.\n3.9 Implementation\
    \ of SMNAT for In-Band–D2D and Interoperability\n51\nFigure 3.10\nCall ﬂow between\
    \ UE, SMNAT access and EPC core.\nLong-term approach\nThe long-term approach is\
    \ to evolve the eNodeBs and MMEs as to be\ncompatible with SMNAT architecture.\
    \ As the mobility management part is\nsimpliﬁed, these smart eNodeBs will thrive\
    \ on PHY layer addressing, rather\nthan the communication on NAS. The MMEs will\
    \ be closer to the deﬁnition\ndone for Coordination Processor, which can directly\
    \ engage itself in PHYlayer\naddressing and mobility management. Hence eNodeBs/Home\
    \ eNodeB and\nMMEs will be lighter in terms of power consumption and processor\
    \ capacity\nthan the state-of-the-art networks.\n3.9 Implementation of SMNAT for\
    \ In-Band–D2D\nand Interoperability with WISDOM\nThis section brings out how SMNAT\
    \ can be used to realize D2D communi-\ncation, which can solve some issues and\
    \ achieve some speciﬁc objects which\nthe state-of-the-art D2D technologies cannot\
    \ attain. Contrary to the work done\nso far on D2D where the peering is only possible\
    \ between the two devices in\nphysical proximity, SMNAT offers a more versatile\
    \ solution where the D2D\n52\nSMNAT as Enabler of Device-to-Device Communication\n\
    leg also could be established between two UEs which are not in vicinity. The\n\
    following section discusses how this can be achieved.\nSMNAT can be deployed as\
    \ an access and core network layer (Figure\n3.11), located on the same network\
    \ plane as the WISDOM 5G [26–28] based\non cognitive communication. In such a\
    \ scenario, SMNAT will be dedicated for\nD2D communication, while WISDOM will\
    \ be responsible for global cellular\nroaming within the network area or beyond.\n\
    The available spectrum will be allocated between SMNAT and WISDOM.\nThe ratio\
    \ of the spectrum allocation can be determined through the process of\nnetwork\
    \ planning and can vary according to the trafﬁc characteristics and the\nbusiness\
    \ requirement of the particular operator.\nTodecidewhetherD2Dlegwillbeestablishedornot,therearetwopossible\n\
    options.\n1. Decision by the user\n2. Decision by the network based on cooperative\
    \ communication\nFigure 3.11\nCoexistence of WISDOM 5G and SMNAT.\n3.10 Description\
    \ of network elements of SMNAT 53\nWhen any device initiates a communication process\
    \ on data, it will have\ntwo options. It will be given a chance to try a D2D communication\
    \ with the\nincentive of a faster communication process or lesser data charges\
    \ (if offered\nby the network operator).\nIf the device does not opt for the D2D\
    \ option, then the session will be\nestablished via the normal process of EPC\
    \ signalling. Subsequently, the EPC\ncan further decide whether to terminate the\
    \ session to the candidate device\nvia LTE/LTE-A, or the network will send instructions\
    \ to the device rather to\nautomatically initiate a D2D session.\n3.10 Description\
    \ of network elements of SMNAT\nand the Call Flow for Session Establishment\n\
    SMNAT [12] [8] has a unique design of the cellular network which represents\n\
    a checkerboard. There are access points in each cell, which via the Frame\nAggregator\
    \ can communicate with the D2D server. The D2D server is\nFigure 3.12\nD2D Channel\
    \ establishment based on proximity of the paired device.\n54\nSMNAT as Enabler\
    \ of Device-to-Device Communication\ninterfaced to a D2D database which holds\
    \ the mapping between the E.164\naddress of the mobile device and the SMNAT coordinates\
    \ namely the symbol\ncoordinate, time slot and AFCRN.\nAs evident from Figure\
    \ 3.12, D2D transport channel can be established\ndirectly between two nodes in\
    \ case they are in proximity (same or different\ncell), but facilitated by the\
    \ SMNAT Access and core network (for signalling).\nIn case the devices are not\
    \ in the direct signal range of each other, then the\ntrafﬁc channel will be established\
    \ via the SMNAT Access and core (access\npoint Frame Multiplexer D2D Server).\
    \ But this process uses the addressing\nand mobility management methods pertaining\
    \ to the PHY layer as deﬁned by\nSMNAT.\nIn Figure 3.13, the end-to-end call ﬂow\
    \ for D2D channel establishment is\nshown, which is self-explanatory. D2D server\
    \ is a core network application\nplatform which is responsible in establishing\
    \ the pair, either directly between\nFigure 3.13\nEnd–to-End communication channel\
    \ establishment for D2D.\n3.12 SecurityAspectsinLightofCooperativeCommunicationbetween2Devices\n\
    55\nthe two devices or via the core network using PHY layer addressing and\nmobility\
    \ management.\n3.11 Decision by the Network to Initiate D2D Based\non Cooperative\
    \ Communications\nIn case the user attempts (by default) to establish communication\
    \ through BS\nvia the WISDOM 5G [26–28] network, then the 5G Network will ﬁrst\
    \ check\nif the session can be terminated by the D2D channel. This implies that\
    \ the\nnetwork will check if it can ofﬂoad from cellular to D2D for capacity and\n\
    optimization reasons. This can be done with the help of Diameter interaction\n\
    between the HSS and the D2D server. A high level process is shown in\nFigure 3.14.\n\
    3.12 Security Aspects in Light of Cooperative\nCommunication between 2 Devices\
    \ in Cellular\nD2D Mode\nAs explained before, D2D communication can be established\
    \ in the direct\nmode or via the network depending upon the proximity of the devices,\n\
    Figure 3.14\nNetwork initiated D2D channel establishment.\n56\nSMNAT as Enabler\
    \ of Device-to-Device Communication\nchannel conditions and location (both devices\
    \ in the same cell or differ-\nent cells). Security has become a primary concern\
    \ especially for the D2D\ncommunication.\nIn case of the network assisted D2D\
    \ communication, the network can\nenforce the security methods that are in place\
    \ for cellular communication.\nThe integration of SMNAT with the EPC has been\
    \ shown in Figure 3.9, where\nthe conventional EAP AKA method meant for traditional\
    \ WLAN network\ncan be used. The ePDG (Evolved Packet Data Gateway)/AAA platform\n\
    modiﬁes the RADIUS based authentication messages to AKA based EPC\nauthentication\
    \ parameters over DIAMETER directly with the HSS. The EPC\nauthentication vectors\
    \ including ciphering keys that are downloaded from\nthe HSS will be retranslated\
    \ and compared for the purpose of authenticating\nthe UE.\nHowever, for the direct\
    \ mode of D2D communication, where two devices\nneed to pair with each other using\
    \ the cellular channel, the procedures become\nintricate. Generation of symmetric\
    \ keys for the communicating peers without\nkey exchange is challenging. One of\
    \ the methods to generate the keys is\nbased on random variations of wireless\
    \ channel like Channel State Information\n(CSI).Mostofthesemethodsusuallyusethemeasurementresultsofindividual\n\
    subcarriers. But this is not robust, given the fact that the subcarriers in\n\
    proximity can have similar channel conditions and have strong correlation\ndependence.\
    \ Due to this fact there can be repeated segments in the key, which\nmay be easy\
    \ to crack.\nAnother approach is to use RSS key generation mechanism based on\n\
    channel measurements. But the main issue is that it is not designed to meet\n\
    the requirements of a system demanding key generation at massive scale. Bit\n\
    generation rate is low as a single sample can provide a single RSS value. This\n\
    also becomes vulnerable if the UE is static and the channel conditions are\npredictable\
    \ and the channel variations are predictable. Hence the endeavour\nof the researchers\
    \ is to realize a method of key generation based on CSI, but\nnot based on a single\
    \ subcarrier. In reference [29], a new algorithm termed as\nKEEP has been proposed.\
    \ KEEP aims to actuate the key generation process\nby incorporating the following\
    \ sub-processes.\n1. Dropping the inconsistent bits by exploiting the correlation\
    \ of CSI\nmeasurements from multiple carriers. This is executed by a federated\n\
    ﬁltration method.\n2. Implementation of Universal has key for validating consistency\
    \ of\nbit streams between two communicating channels. A pair of devices\n3.13\
    \ Summary\n57\nFigure 3.15\nKey generation process.\nexchanges only a part of\
    \ the hashed keys, which makes it difﬁcult for the\nattacker to guess and formulate\
    \ the whole key.\n3. Using methods of key recombination and adaptive quantization\
    \ to gen-\nerate secret bit from a large number of subcarriers. The bit mismatch\n\
    rate with the process is low. Moreover, it eliminates the correlation of bit\n\
    streams from multiple subcarriers and reduces predictivity.\nThe key generation\
    \ process based adaptive quantization procedure,\nCSI sub-blocking and hashing\
    \ is captured in the following algorithm in\nFigure 3.15.\n3.13 Summary\nAt present,\
    \ mobility management is explicitly in the domain of the application\nlayer. This\
    \ chapter introduces SMNAT where it is proposed to shift from\nthis paradigm and\
    \ knit this functionality with the PHY layer. This entails\n58\nSMNAT as Enabler\
    \ of Device-to-Device Communication\nsimpliﬁcation of network architecture and\
    \ associated processes and helps in\nattaining a network which has a degree of\
    \ location and presence agnosticism.\nThe interaction between the device and the\
    \ network occurs only when one\nof them initiates a network operation for a call,\
    \ SMS or other services. The\nhandover operation is also simpliﬁed. Further, a\
    \ novel D2D communication\nconcept based on SMNAThas been proposed. Unlike the\
    \ existing researches in\nD2D, engrossed in redesigning the radio resource allocation\
    \ process, a parallel\nnetwork stratum has been proposed which can actuate D2D\
    \ communication\nbased on addressing and mobility management processes closer\
    \ to the PHY\nlayer. The processing cycles in the network will diminish, which\
    \ creates extra\nroom to cater to new customers. This is aligned with our endeavour\
    \ to realize\na network which is cleaner, greener and leaner.\nReferences\n[1]\

    4\nDynamic Spectrum Management\nand mm-WAVES\nRadio spectrum is a prime factor\
    \ in driving the growth of mobile services.\nThe success of 5G network is based\
    \ on the unconstrained availability of\nspectrum. About 1200 MHz of spectrum in\
    \ the frequency bands below\n5 GHz has been identiﬁed for IMT services during\
    \ World Administrative\nRadio Conference (WARC)-92, World Radio communication\
    \ Conference\n(WRC)-2000 and WRC-2007. These frequency bands are 450–470 MHz,\n\
    698–960 MHz, 1710–2025 MHz, 2110–2200 MHz, 2300–2400 MHz,\n2500–2690 MHz, and\
    \ 3400–3600 MHz. The identiﬁed spectrum is non-\ncontiguous and scattered in different\
    \ frequency bands from 450 MHz to\n3.4 GHz. However, the actual allocation is\
    \ ranging between the frequency\nband 700 MHz and 2.6 GHz. The irony is that these\
    \ identiﬁed frequency bands\nhave already been allocated to legacy services long\
    \ back. Therefore, no vacant\nspectrum is available especially below 6 GHz at\
    \ present for mobile com-\nmunications. The options available to enhance the spectrum\
    \ availability for\n5G communications are spectrum re-farming, spectrum sharing\
    \ and use of\ncognitive radio technology. Moreover, this identiﬁed 1200 MHz non-\n\
    contiguous spectrum could not hold the pressure of high mobile data growth,\n\
    demand for convergence of different varieties of services and speed as\nenvisaged\
    \ in 5G network.Assigning a new radio spectrum is crucial to meet the\nexpecteddemandsforfuture5Gnetworks.Thisispossiblebyexploitinghigher\n\
    microwave frequencies, referred as millimeter (mm-wave) bands. Therefore,\nmm-frequency\
    \ band is the obvious and the most preferred band for 5G\nnetwork.\nThe 5G network\
    \ envisages as a combination of several micro, pico and\nfemto cells embedded\
    \ within a macro cell.According to physical law, coverage\ndecreases with increasing\
    \ frequency. The mm-waves can be divided into\ndifferent categories, the ﬁrst\
    \ one ranging between 20 and 40 GHz frequency\n61\n62\nDynamic Spectrum Management\
    \ and mm-WAVES\nbands for micro sites and the other one is around 60 GHz frequency\
    \ band for\npico and femto cell sites.\nWith the increase in the number of wireless\
    \ devices, the number of wireless\nconnections and high data rate networks rises.\
    \ This leads to the two important\nfactors spectrum demand and spectrum congestion,\
    \ turning out to be the\ntwo critical challenges for the forthcoming wireless\
    \ communication world.\nSimultaneously the user’s requirements such as high multimedia\
    \ data rate\ntransmission based on the bandwidth demanding applications will make\
    \ the\nfuture wireless networks to suffer from the spectrum scarcity.\n4.1 Command\
    \ and Control Method\nThe conventional method for allocating spectrum is known\
    \ as “Command and\nControl Method” shown in the Figure 4.1. There are some countries\
    \ following\nthis technique of spectrum allocation. In this method radio spectrum\
    \ is divided\ninto different spectrum bands that are allowed to speciﬁc radio\
    \ communication\nservices such as satellite services, mobile, broadcast on an\
    \ exclusive basis.\nThis method guarantees that the radio frequency spectrum will\
    \ be exclu-\nsively licensed to an authorized user and can use spectrum without\
    \ any\ninterference [1].\nThis method of spectrum allocation is not efﬁcient because\
    \ [1]:\n• Spectrum assigned to a particular radio communication service cannot\n\
    be replaced by other services even though it is witnessed that spectrum\nis underutilized.\n\
    • There is no possibility of questioning the user once the spectrum is\nallocated\
    \ to him (during the licensing period) as per the norms, provided\nhe fulﬁlls\
    \ the terms and conditions.\nFigure 4.1\nCommand and Control Method [1].\n4.2\
    \ Spectrum Sharing\n63\n• This method does not make spectrum to be utilized efﬁciently\
    \ in rural\nareas as the spectrum utilization is heavy in the urban regions and\n\
    underutilized in the rural areas.\nIt is sad to see the spectrum underutilized\
    \ and not accessible to all.\nIt is difﬁcult for some nations to provide 4G services\
    \ itself. There is a\nneed for taking serious steps in handling spectrum issues\
    \ by implementing\nsophisticated technologies for the development of nation. In\
    \ these cases\nthe techniques like spectrum trading would be a successful solution.\
    \ This\nwill only lead to the development of 5G communications in these types\
    \ of\ncountries.\n4.2 Spectrum Sharing\nThe demand for multimedia content and\
    \ information processing, services\nsuch as e-education and e-health, mobile broadcasting,\
    \ enormous increase\nin the electronic gadgets necessitate efﬁcient use of all\
    \ available and usable\nfrequency spectrum. The new generation of mobile broadband\
    \ networks will\nrequire supporting higher data throughput rates.\nMany sophisticated\
    \ technologies have been implemented for making\nthe efﬁcient use of available\
    \ spectrum. For example, line-of-sight (LOS)\nsystems are usable up to 100 GHz\
    \ now. Running down the size of electronic\ncomponents and systems introduces\
    \ the multiple frequency bands in single\nequipment leading to the efﬁcient use\
    \ of available spectrum by the enhanced\ndynamic sharing of frequency bands.\n\
    Spectrum management should be in such a way that there should be\nalways optimum\
    \ spectral sharing. Greater sharing of frequencies and bands\nallows more data\
    \ to be sent by different users in the same amount of available\nspectrum.\nSpectrum\
    \ sharing has basically three dimensions: frequency, time and\nlocation. The Collective\
    \ Use of Spectrum (CUS) allows spectrum to be used\nby more than one user simultaneously\
    \ without requiring a license. Some of the\nexamples that come under spectrum\
    \ sharing are frequency reuse concept in the\nexisting telecom networks, FDMA,\
    \ TDMA. Another important challenge is\nthe sharing of spectrum among the heterogeneous\
    \ networks. While it is easier\nto achieve efﬁcient and successful spectrum sharing\
    \ among the homogeneous\nor similar networks or applications, there arises complexity\
    \ in heterogeneous\nnetworks [2].\n64\nDynamic Spectrum Management and mm-WAVES\n\
    The spectrum sharing methods are classiﬁed into three categories based\non based\
    \ on the priority level of accessing the radio spectrum as follows [2]:\na. Horizontal\
    \ spectrum sharing: all the devices have equal rights to access\nthe spectrum.\n\
    b. Vertical spectrum handover only: the primary users are allotted priorities\n\
    to access the spectrum.\nc. Hierarchical spectrum sharing: it is an enhanced variant\
    \ of the vertical\nspectrum sharing.\n4.2.1 Spectrum Using SDR and Cognitive Radio\
    \ – Dynamic\nSharing\nEvolution of software deﬁned radio (SDR) and cognitive radio\
    \ (CR) are\nthe two major milestones in the mobile communications. Dynamic sharing\n\
    of spectrum improves the spectrum efﬁciency and the above mentioned\ntechnologies\
    \ play a vital role in this aspect.\nConventionally, transmitters were tuned to\
    \ speciﬁc frequencies, and facil-\nities for multiple frequencies would cost high.\
    \ But after the development of\nthese technologies, tuning the transmitters to\
    \ the multiple frequencies has\nbecome easier, i.e., switching to the different\
    \ frequencies in a dynamic way\nwould be possible at a reasonable cost.\nCognitive\
    \ radio ﬁrst detects the occupation of the channel, and if it is\noccupied, it\
    \ helps the users to switch to the other vacant channels. Also\nthe carrier signals\
    \ are sensed regularly for usage in other. There is always\na need of large amount\
    \ of spectrum in case of emergency or public safety\nconditions compared to that\
    \ of normal conditions. In these emergency cases,\ndynamic sharing of spectrum\
    \ would be a promising solution. In some countries\nspectrum regulators are used\
    \ for the encouraging dynamic sharing spectrum\nwith public safety requirements.\
    \ It is to be noted that CR is a combination\nof administrative (regulatory),\
    \ technical, and market based techniques to\nenhance the efﬁciency of spectrum\
    \ utilization [2].\nAnother area of utility for dynamic sharing is White Spaces\
    \ (TV Band).\nNormally, the TV broadcasters repeat the same channel/carrier at\
    \ relatively\nlonger distances, to avoid any interference especially at the border/edger\n\
    of the coverage areas that are on the border of two adjacent broadcast\ntransmissions\
    \ on same channel. However, there are very few receivers in this\narea, and the\
    \ spectrum utility is not effective and could be utilized for other\npurposes.\n\
    4.3 Spectrum Trading\n65\nThe broadcasters are generally quite protective for\
    \ their signal trans-\nmissions, even in areas beyond the theoretical coverage\
    \ areas. Hence, only\nlow power systems that cause minimal interference can be\
    \ considered for\nshared usage with the TV spectrum. However, gradually with time\
    \ building\ncollective conﬁdence amongst the users that includes the broadcasters,\
    \ higher\npower based systems could be considered [2].\n4.3 Spectrum Trading\n\
    Spectrum trading is a case of spectrum sharing with the involvement of\ncommercial\
    \ activities. Spectrum trading is found to be a more economical\nway of efﬁcient\
    \ use of spectrum. It is an option through which ﬂexibility can\nbe increased\
    \ and spectrum assigned to a particular service, and can be easily\ntransferred\
    \ for other usage. To explain it in brief, spectrum trading is a market\nbased\
    \ mechanism where buyers and the sellers determine the assignments of\nspectrum\
    \ and its uses in which seller transfers the right of spectrum usage, in\nfullorpart,tobuyerwhileretainingtheownership.Inmanycountriesspectrum\n\
    trading is already running and the trading procedure is conﬁned to speciﬁc\nbands,\
    \ which are in demand for commercial use with speciﬁed conditions.\nSpectrum trading\
    \ improves the efﬁciency and facilitates new services to enter\nin the market\
    \ by making slight modiﬁcation in the regulatory provisions [2].\nThe difference\
    \ between spectrum sharing and spectrum trading can be\nexplained as follows:\n\
    In spectrum trading the usage rights are transferred completely from the\nseller\
    \ for a speciﬁed period. However, in spectrum sharing buyer gets a\ntemporary\
    \ right of spectrum usage with the exclusive rights resting with the\nseller.\
    \ Trading becomes effective only when it is clubbed with liberalization.\nSpectrum\
    \ trading can be implemented if there is solid base in understanding\nadvanced\
    \ technologies and operating systems as the spectrum ﬂexibility\ndemands new approaches\
    \ and practical methods for monitoring compliance,\nenforcement and conﬂict resolution\
    \ [2].\n4.3.1 Spectrum Trading Merits\nThe merits of spectrum trading are as follows\
    \ [2]:\n• Improves efﬁcient spectrum usage\n• Facilitates the evaluation of spectrum\
    \ licenses, and gaining knowledge\nof market value of spectrum\n66\nDynamic Spectrum\
    \ Management and mm-WAVES\n• Quicker process, with better and faster decision-making\
    \ by those with\ninformation\n• Removes barriers to entry by allowing small operators\
    \ and start-ups\nto acquire spectrum rights of use more readily, thereby facilitating\
    \ the\ndevelopment of market competition\n• There is an opportunity for more rapid\
    \ redeployment and faster access\nfor spectrum\n• Encourages new technologies\
    \ to gain access to spectrum more quickly\n• Existing operators gain an opportunity\
    \ to sell unused or under-used\nspectrum and make more ﬂexible use of spectrum\n\
    • Reduction in the transactions costs of acquiring rights to use spectrum\n• Allows\
    \ operators increased ﬂexibility to accommodate shifting demand\ndriven by market\
    \ changes.\n4.4 Cognitive Radio\nIEEE approved deﬁnition of cognitive radio (CR)\
    \ is a radio in which com-\nmunication systems are aware of their environment\
    \ and internal state, and\ncan make decisions about their radio operation based\
    \ on that information\nand predeﬁned objectives. The environmental information\
    \ may not include\nlocation information related to communication systems. Cognitive\
    \ radio is a\nvery good solution for increasing the spectrum utilization.\nCognitive\
    \ radios should be able to self-organize their communication\nbased on sensing\
    \ and reconﬁgurable functions as stated below [3]:\n• Spectrum resource management:\
    \ this scheme is necessary to manage and\norganize efﬁciently spectrum holes information\
    \ among cognitive radios.\n• Security management: cognitive radio networks (CRNs)\
    \ are heteroge-\nneous networks in essence and this heterogeneous property introduces\
    \ a\nlot of security issues. So this scheme helps in providing security functions\n\
    in dynamic environment.\n• Mobility and connection management: this scheme can\
    \ help neighbour-\nhood discovery, detect available Internet access, and support\
    \ vertical\nhandoffs, which help cognitive radios to select route and networks.\n\
    4.4.1 CR Device Concept\nThis section explains the features of CR whose implementation\
    \ in a single\ndevice offers a very smart and high performance user terminal –\
    \ CR terminal.\nThe Figure 4.2 shows the CR properties.\n4.4 Cognitive Radio\n\
    67\nA. Spectrum sensing\nSpectrum sensing operation can be divided into the three\
    \ step functions [4]:\n• Signal Detection: In this step of operation existence\
    \ of the signal is\nsensed. There is no need to know the type of signal in this\
    \ step.\n• Signal Classiﬁcation: In this step of operation the type of signal\
    \ is\ndetected, which is done by extracting the features of the signal.\nFigure\
    \ 4.2\nConcept of CR Device [4].\n68\nDynamic Spectrum Management and mm-WAVES\n\
    • Channel availability decision: In this channel availability is detected.\nOnce\
    \ the free channels are detected, the step next to it is, sharing the\nspectrumholeswhichcanbeachievedbythespectrumallocationscheme.\n\
    The CR technology also brings new security and pricing challenges which\nare shown\
    \ in the Figure 4.2.\n• New security threats appear with the dynamic spectrum\
    \ access concept,\nas well as the CR’s authentication needs.\n• The pricing is\
    \ very much inﬂuenced by the used channel allocation\nscheme. Additionally, CRs\
    \ must be designed with strong capabilities\nto negotiate the available channels’\
    \ price.\nB. Spectrum handover\nThe phenomenon of frequency changing dynamically\
    \ is said to be spectrum\nhandover. A secondary user changes its frequency on\
    \ appearance of a pri-\nmary user or due to transmission degradation. This necessitates\
    \ designing a\nhandover scheme [4].\nC. Environment adaptation\nDifferent changes\
    \ like topological changes, noise or interference power may\noccur while sensing\
    \ the information. In order to adapt to these changes and\nto maintain the constant\
    \ performance new adaptation techniques have to be\nimplemented which is an important\
    \ point of concern [4].\nD. CR routing\nCR routing is based on the requirement\
    \ for CR device to interoperate with\ndifferent systems, and is inﬂuenced by the\
    \ spectrum sharing techniques [4].\nCRNs inherit the PSs (Primary Systems) network\
    \ characteristics:\ninfrastructure - based, mesh, ad-hoc, sensor networks, etc.\
    \ and these archi-\ntecture types impose a speciﬁc routing algorithm, which must\
    \ also include the\nCR devices and the possibility for a CR to be a relay node\
    \ for another CR.\n4.4.2 CR based on 5G\nAs already stated earlier CR technology\
    \ would be a major modality to build\nthe integrated 5G network. The various functionalities\
    \ for 5G that could be\nmet with CR usage are as follows [4]:\n• Advanced PHY\
    \ and MAC technologies.\n• Implementation of novel and ﬂexible protocols.\n4.5\
    \ Millimetre Waves\n69\n• Capacity to support homogenous and heterogeneous systems.\n\
    • Adaptation to different changes like environment changes, dynamic\nfrequency\
    \ changes, etc.\nCorrelation between WISDOM and CR in reference to 5G could be\n\
    given as:\n“5G brings the convergence concept through WISDOM and CR repre-\nsents\
    \ the technological tool to implement it.” The 5G technology eliminates\nthe radio\
    \ terminals that are speciﬁc to particular wireless technologies\nand proposes\
    \ a universal terminal which must include all of the pre-\ndecessor features in\
    \ a single device. This terminal convergence is sup-\nported by the users’ needs\
    \ and demands and is strongly found in CR\nterminal [4].\nThere are many issues\
    \ that still remain to be addressed [4]:\n• How to connect the CR terminal to\
    \ the wired networks?\n• How to reach the maximum 5G’s 1 Tera bps data rate threshold\
    \ when\nusing the CR technology at the access level?\n• How to implement the good\
    \ techniques in order to combine the ﬂows\ncoming from multiple access networks?\n\
    4.5 Millimetre Waves\nMost of the radio communications including TV, satellite\
    \ communications\nGPS, Bluetooth are utilizing frequency band ranging from 300\
    \ MHz to\n3 GHz. But this band is getting crowded and the focus is on releasing\
    \ and utiliz-\ning the additional spectrum. In mm-waves are the promising solution\
    \ for this\nproblem.\nThe spectrum bands identiﬁed under the IMT umbrella do not\
    \ have the\ncapacity to carry such enormous data required for 5G services. Therefore,\n\
    mm-waves could be the candidate bands for 5G mobile communications\ndue to high\
    \ data carrying capacity. The mm-waves have the following\nadvantages [5, 6]:\n\
    (a) Not much operation at mm-waves so more spectrum is available at mm-\nwaves\n\
    (b) Very large blocks of contiguous spectrum to support future applications.\n\
    (c) Due to high attenuation in free space, frequency reuse is possible at\nshorter\
    \ distance\n(d) Spatial resolution is better at mm-waves hardware with CMOS\n\
    technology\n70\nDynamic Spectrum Management and mm-WAVES\n(e) Advancement in semiconductor\
    \ technology allows low cost equipment\n(f) Small wavelength makes possible use\
    \ of large antenna arrays for adaptive\nbeam forming\n(g) Small size of antenna\
    \ at mm-waves facilitates easy integration on chip\nand installation at suitable\
    \ locations.\nIn mm-waves allow larger bandwidth and offer high data transfer\
    \ and low\nlatency rate that are suitable for high speed reliable Internet services.The\
    \ small\nwavelength facilitates small size antenna and other part of radio hardware,\n\
    which reduces costs and also easy to install. The transmitter’s antenna would\n\
    be like a lamppost, which could be installed on building, street lamppost,\netc.\
    \ [6].\nHigh directionality attained in this band can be used to increase spatial\n\
    multiplexing. The size of antenna required for a mm-waves radio can be\none-tenth\
    \ or less of an equivalent lower frequency radio which is an advantage\nto the\
    \ manufactures to build smaller and lighter systems.\nBeam width is the measure\
    \ of how a transmitted beam spreads out as\nit gets farther from its point of\
    \ origin. But due to limited availability of\nradio frequency (RF) bands the ﬁfth\
    \ generation wireless communication\nsystems will move to ultra-high capacity\
    \ mm-wave bands. High frequency\nmakes mm-wave band more attractive for wireless\
    \ communication system\nand these frequencies are used in terrestrial and satellite\
    \ communications.\nWireless products that use millimeter waves already exist for\
    \ ﬁxed, LOS\ntransmissions\nBut the absorption rate of the mm-wave electromagnetic\
    \ signal poses\ngreat challenges for their utilization in the non-LOS and mobile\
    \ connections.\nOn the other hand, high directionality achieved in this band can\
    \ be used to\nincrease spatial multiplexing.Wireless backhaul will be another\
    \ key enabler of\n5G-mm-wave small cells [8].\nWithin the mm frequencies, the\
    \ frequency band of 60 GHz has attracted the\nresearchers to work with, as the\
    \ large amounts of bandwidth are unallocated\nin this band, bandwidths that are\
    \ required for communication systems at\nthe intended data rates of 100 Mbps and\
    \ above. Also, another advantage of\n60-GHz band is due to a physical property\
    \ of the propagation channel at this\nfrequency that provides a natural way for\
    \ reduction of frequency reuse factor,\nwhich tends to compact cell size [8].\n\
    It is a general property of the mm-wave propagation that the behaviour\nof the\
    \ propagation rays is well characterized by the geometric optics. That is,\nthe\
    \ waves do not penetrate the walls or other obstacles and wave reﬂection\n4.5\
    \ Millimetre Waves\n71\nis the main mechanism leading to a multipath [8]. In mm-waves\
    \ have the\npotential to support broad-band service access which is especially\
    \ relevant\nbecause of the advent of Broadband Integrated Service Digital Network\
    \ (B-\nISDN).\nWith the development of personal wireless communication systems,\
    \ two\nthings are appearing to be signiﬁcant:\n• Exploiting high frequency bands,\
    \ such as mm-waves to provide broad-\nband for high rate data transmission.\n\
    • To integrate multi-tasks in one system which greatly extend the applica-\ntion\
    \ of wireless device.\nThe utility of mm-waves for the micro cells that form the\
    \ WISDOM based\nGIMCV are well positioned to be served by these mm-waves. It has\
    \ been\nelaborated in these following points:\n• It is relatively easy to get\
    \ licenses for big blocks of mm-wave spectrum,\nwhich would allow carriers to\
    \ deploy large backhaul pipes over 1 Gbps\nin size. While a single small cell\
    \ may not need that much capacity, the\ncomplexity of heterogeneous networks will\
    \ require daisy-chaining many\nsmall cells together, each cell passing its load\
    \ down the line.\n• Small cell backhaul makes the best use high frequency characteristics\n\
    of mm-waves. The higher the frequency the shorter distance a wave\npropagates\
    \ unless it gets a serious power boost. But the heterogeneous\nnetwork by deﬁnition\
    \ will be composed of densely packed cells in urban\nenvironments, meaning no\
    \ mm-waves will have to travel far between\nhops.\nThe traditional uses of the\
    \ mm-waves include radio navigation, space\nresearch, radio astronomy, earth exploration\
    \ satellite, radar, military weapons\nand other applications. The backbone/backhaul\
    \ networks (point to point\nnetwork) for existing telecom network to connect base\
    \ station to main switch-\ning centre (MSC), Local Multipoint Distribution System\
    \ (LMDS), indoor\nWLAN, high capacity dense networks are also present in the mm-waves.\
    \ The\ntypical microwave backhaul bands are at 6.0 GHz, 11.0 GHz, 18.0 GHz, 23.0\n\
    GHz, and 38.0 GHz frequency bands.\nThe light use of mm-waves could be attributed\
    \ to high attenuation and\nlow penetration. At such high frequency, waves are\
    \ more prone to rain and\nother atmospheric attenuation. The wavelength is in\
    \ the order of millimeters,\nand rain drops are also of the same size. Rains absorb\
    \ high frequency waves\nand make it difﬁcult for propagation. However, the experimental\
    \ results show\nthat in heavy rain condition, attenuation is 1.4 dB and 1.6 dB\
    \ for 200 meters\n72\nDynamic Spectrum Management and mm-WAVES\ndistance at 28\
    \ GHz and 38 GHz, respectively [8]. The rain attenuations at\n60 GHz for a rainfall\
    \ rate of 50 mm/h, is approximately 18 dB/km [11]. A\nproper link design with\
    \ slightly high transmit power may take care of rain\nattenuation.\nSlight change\
    \ in the position would affect the signal strength at the\nreceiving end, due\
    \ to which mm-waves are deeply affected by scattering,\nreﬂection and refraction.\
    \ The root mean square (RMS) delay spread for\nmm-waves is of the order of few\
    \ nano seconds, and it is high for are non-LOS\n(NLOS) links than (LOS) links\
    \ [9]. Similarly, path loss exponent for NLOS\nlinks is higher than LOS links.\
    \ Due to higher path loss and RMS delay spread,\nit is assumed that mm-waves are\
    \ not suitable for (NLOS) links. However,\nthese difﬁculties could be managed\
    \ by using carrier aggregation, high order\nMIMO, steerable antenna, beam-forming\
    \ techniques.\nRecently, extensive measurements to understand the propagation\
    \ charac-\nteristics for deﬁning the radio channel have been carried out at 28\
    \ GHz in\nthe dense urban areas of New York City and at 38 GHz cellular propagations\n\
    measurements were conducted in Austin, Texas, at the University of Texas\nmain\
    \ campus. The measurements were conducted to know the details about\nangle of\
    \ arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD), RMS delay spread, path\nloss, and building\
    \ penetration and reﬂelction characteristics for the design\nof future mm-wave\
    \ cellular systems. The propagation feasibility studies at\n28 GHz and 38 GHz\
    \ showed that propagation is feasible up to 200 meters of\ndistance [6,10] in\
    \ both the conditions, i.e., (LOS) and (NLOS) with transmit\npower of the order\
    \ of 40–50 dBm in a difﬁcult urban environment. This is size\nof micro cell in\
    \ the urban areas.\nThe frequency bands around 60 GHz is best suited for pico\
    \ and femto\ncell due to high data carrying capacity and small reuse distance\
    \ due to strong\noxygen absorption at the rate of 15 dB/Km. The usage in frequency\
    \ bands\naround 60 GHz is highly sparse, which provides freedom to allocate a\
    \ large\nbandwidth to every channel. Moreover, equipment can be made very compact\n\
    due to the very small antenna size.\nMuch research work has been done for indoor\
    \ channel characteriszation\nat 60 GHz band but a very few work has been done\
    \ for outdoor character-\niszation. In reference [12] measurements were carried\
    \ out for narrowband\nCW for received power against separation distance in different\
    \ environments\nmainly airport ﬁeld, urban street and city tunnel. A channel sounder\
    \ based\non correlation has been used for the measurement for centre frequency\
    \ of\n59.0 GHz with a bandwidth of 200 MHz. A 90◦-horn antenna was used at\ntransmitting\
    \ end and a biconical horn with an elevation beamwidth of 20◦\n4.5 Millimetre\
    \ Waves\n73\nwas used at receiver in all the measurements. The measurement was\
    \ carried\nout for path loss exponent and RMS delay spread. The result found that\n\
    path loss exponent was between 2 and 2.5 for outdoor environment and\nRMS delay\
    \ spread was lower than 20 ns. Result also included that multi-\npath phenomenon\
    \ was bad at parking garage due to large dimensions and\nsmooth surface as compared\
    \ to city streets and road tunnel, where multipath\nphenomenon was not much signiﬁcant.\n\
    In [13] measurements were carried out at 55 GHz in city streets of London\n(UK)\
    \ with moderate trafﬁc density using a ﬁxed transmitter and a mobile\nreceiver,\
    \ with link distances not greater than 400 m. The transmitter installed\nat 10\
    \ m above the ground level and receiver was mobile mounted over the\nroof of a\
    \ car. The test signal was narrowband FM signal generated through\nGunn oscillator\
    \ and fed to a 25-dBi horn antenna. The result found that path\nloss exponent\
    \ was 3.6 for a T-R separation of 400 m with LOS path and path\nloss exponent\
    \ was 10.4 for same Tx-Rx separation in NLOS condition.\nIn order to understand\
    \ the radio channel propagation characteristics, exten-\nsive propagation measurements\
    \ in urban environment hasve been carried out\nlong back at the campus of Delft\
    \ University of Technology, Netherlands [14].\nThe measurements for frequency\
    \ fading over 100 MHz bandwidth centered\naround 59.9 GHz were done almost exclusively\
    \ in the time-domain by using\nnetwork analyzsers and channel sounders. The block\
    \ diagram of the measure-\nment system used in reference [14] for the frequency-domain\
    \ characteriszation\nof the radio-channel is shown in Figure 4.3.\nFigure 4.3\n\
    Measurement setup.\n74\nDynamic Spectrum Management and mm-WAVES\nThe two main\
    \ components are signal generator towards transmitter\nside and spectrum analyser\
    \ at receiver side. A ﬂat omnidirectional antenna\n(2 dBi, 120◦) was used at transmitter\
    \ side and omnidirectional (120◦) and\npatch directional antenna (pencil beam,\
    \ 19.5 dBi, 15◦) were used at receiver\nside. Measurements with both were done\
    \ in order to see the difference\nin performance, because omnidirectional antenna\
    \ allows for more reﬂected\ncomponents to enter the receiver. The measurements\
    \ were conducted for\nstatistics of the ‘k’ factor of Rice distribution and the\
    \ path loss coefﬁcient for\nthe pico cell of the order of 50 m radius at three\
    \ different locations including\noutdoor and indoor. The measurements were done\
    \ in possible locations for\nthe mobile multimedia communication.\nThe measurements\
    \ were taken in the corridor area (indoor) of the Univer-\nsity for the Rice factor\
    \ k and received power versus distance with TX–RX\nseparation of 12–15 m are shown\
    \ in Figures 4.4 and 4.5 below.\nThe measurements were taken in the parking area\
    \ (outdoor) of the Uni-\nversity for received power versus distance on logarithmic\
    \ scale with TX–RX\nseparation of 12–15 m is shown in Figure 4.6.\nThe measurement\
    \ results show that propagation is feasible upto 10–15\nm in the indoor and outdoor\
    \ urban environment, which is normal size of\npico cell.\nThe Radiocommunication\
    \ Sector of International Telecom Union (ITU) is\nresponsible for management of\
    \ radio spectrum at international level. As per\nITU-R frequency allocation plan\
    \ [15], the frequency band 10–40 GHz has\nFigure 4.4\nRice factor k versus distance\

    \ the three regions along with\nFixed and mobile services. Local Multipoint Distribution\
    \ System (LMDS),\nWLAN, Satellite services and High capacity dense network etc.\
    \ are main\nservices present in mm-waves. Several point to point ﬁxed microwaves\
    \ links\nare also working in this band. These links are basically for backbone/backhaul\n\
    network for GSM and other services. A good amount of vacant spectrum\n76\nDynamic\
    \ Spectrum Management and mm-WAVES\nis available at mm-waves which could be utiliszed\
    \ for 5G communications\nservices. 5G services may transmit high power approximately\
    \ 40–50 dBW.\nTherefore, coexistence study needs to be carried out with existing\
    \ LMDS and\nsatellite services, that would be working in neighbouring spectrum\
    \ bands.\n4.6 Summary\nSpectrum is a key to mobile wireless communications. The\
    \ concept of\nspectrum sharing and spectrum trading are mainly discussed in this\
    \ chapter.\nThe concept of spectrum trading brings awareness towards its importance\n\
    as it is not much successful in many countries. Spectrum management is\nan important\
    \ challenge for the evolution of 5G communications. Extra high\nfrequency bands\
    \ have to be explored for the quick data transfers. Working on\nthis, mm-waves\
    \ have proved successful for the short-range communications.\nBut still further\
    \ research has to be carried out for the advancements in\nthe existing technologies\
    \ like cognitive networks, for the efﬁcient use of\nspectrum.\nReferences\n[1]\

    \ and Threats\nThe security challenges in communication networks are a major concern\
    \ in\ntoday’s world, with security threats and possible loopholes in communication\n\
    systems appearing at much higher rate compared with technological advances\nin\
    \ the communication systems in itself. Based on the operational structure\nof\
    \ WISDOM 5G it is obvious to note the enormous security challenge that\nsurrounds\
    \ the overall operation of the network. Providing a uniﬁed access\nto the user\
    \ and seamless migration between underlying access networks\nwould necessitate\
    \ enormous effort for securing the conﬁdential data related to\nthe user.\nThe\
    \ security mechanisms to ensure reliable services utilized by the service\nproviders\
    \ rely on authentication, authorization, non-repudiation and conﬁden-\ntiality\
    \ based mechanism among others. These mechanisms collectively ensure\nthat service\
    \ provider fulﬁl their liability to deliver reliable and trust worthy\nservices.\
    \ However, an underlying operational constraint of these mechanisms\nis the imposed\
    \ latency. As WISDOM 5G requires almost zero latency for the\nuser to access the\
    \ services, it would be a major challenge to ensure reliable\nsecure service and\
    \ meet the objective of high data rate access to the customer\nin a ubiquitous\
    \ manner.\nPossible mechanisms that could be utilized for addressing the security\n\
    challenges imposed on WISDOM 5G could be as follows:\nUnique ID: Majority security\
    \ mechanisms are initiated in networks to\nrecognize a particular device in the\
    \ overall network. If a given mobile device\nis recognized in a manner that differentiates\
    \ it from other mobile devices\nthen requirements for authentication and authorization\
    \ could be avoided.\nCharacteristics that could uniquely deﬁne a mobile device\
    \ could be utilized\nfor forming a unique ID.\nPrivacy by Design: Maintaining\
    \ the data and user proﬁle conﬁdentiality\nis a major requirement imposed on the\
    \ service providers through governing\ncyber laws. Security and privacy aspects\
    \ are usually dealt with separate\n79\n80\nCYBER Security and Threats\ncomparison,\
    \ with the other network operations. Designing of network com-\nponents and the\
    \ overall operational backbone in WISDOM 5G with privacy\nand security aspects\
    \ as prime objectives could ensure reliable privacy and\nsecurity.\n5.1 Major\
    \ Challenges Surrounding Future Cyber Security\nThe plethora of challenges that\
    \ surround cyber security can be broadly\ncategorized into the following broad\
    \ areas:\n5.1.1 Network Borders\nThe emergence of 5G network as stated earlier\
    \ that merges cells of different\nsizes and allows uniﬁed access technologies\
    \ for the user device would lead to\ndisappearance of network boundaries. Further\
    \ the user device is expected to\ndirectly communicate with devices that comprise\
    \ IoT for acquiring informa-\ntion about a certain physical parameter. This would\
    \ be a different operational\nsetup from today’s communication network wherein\
    \ government entities, pri-\nvate enterprises and private individual users could\
    \ be the three broad network\ncategories. The government entities currently impose\
    \ strict operational rules\nregarding their communication network. Large private\
    \ enterprises also lay\ndown operational regulations regarding their communication\
    \ network. These\noperational regulations would be hard to maintain if the networks\
    \ are uniﬁed\nand user devices seamlessly switch between them [1].\n5.1.2 Hindrance\
    \ to E Commerce\nThe intention to provide ubiquitous computing and communication\
    \ capability\nwith data rate is to allow users to access rich and diverse information\n\
    unhindered. That would be supported with uniﬁcation of access technologies\nand\
    \ underlying networks, along with support for high mobility of the user\ndevice.\
    \ It can be anticipated in future that many companies would roll out\nnovel information\
    \ providing services that required unhindered data rates. This\nwill, however,\
    \ be hindered if the user is prohibited due to a certain networks’\nrule and regulation,\
    \ or the data connection is interrupted due to requirements\nfor authentication\
    \ and authorization. Cloud and Internet based service provider\nare looking at\
    \ opportunities of the form such as [2, 3]:\n• Anything as a service (XaaS)\n\
    • Sensing as a service (SaaS)\n5.1 Major Challenges Surrounding Future Cyber Security\n\
    81\nLarge enterprises that provide cloud based and Internet based services wish\n\
    to utilize the aforesaid data service models for increasing the utility of\nInternet\
    \ and uniﬁcation of networks that would comprise machines (IoT,\nsensing as a\
    \ service). However, the concept is imposing massive operational\ncomplexities\
    \ even on the enterprises as they are unable to ﬁgure out the\npossible way to\
    \ deliver such a plethora of utilities and create business\nopportunity.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be safely presumed that if the data delivery model is\ntough to design\
    \ and operate, security and privacy challenges that such a uniﬁed\nnetwork would\
    \ throw open would be much more complex to address.\nThe uniﬁed network operation\
    \ promises to offer the end user the enormous\nutility of high data rate access\
    \ with ubiquitous connectivity and extremely\nrich access to required information.\
    \ The enterprises also seek to tap into the\nhuge business potential that such\
    \ a uniﬁed network could offer. However, a\nmajor privacy and security invasion\
    \ issue for the common users could easily\noccur in such a densely connected network\
    \ could lead to the governments\nimposing strong prohibitory orders that could\
    \ ruin the economy and business\nsigniﬁcantly.\n5.1.3 International Cyber Disputes\n\
    The uniﬁed network in WISDOM based 5G would depend signiﬁcantly on\nan Internet\
    \ based core network. Currently, there is a major debate preva-\nlent on controlling\
    \ the Internet. As it has enormous power in the form of\nmillions of people social\
    \ networking using it, or the possible spying and\ncyber crime committed using\
    \ it. Committing cyber crime with an intention\nto ally to harm a nation or a\
    \ major business entity directly, i.e., cyber war\nis discussed in the following\
    \ sub-section. Many countries want to have a\nmultilateral control on the Internet,\
    \ i.e., countries would have direct control\non the Internet activities concerning\
    \ them, including data servers that are\nrelated with them but situated in another\
    \ land; while some countries want a\nmajor international entity to take control\
    \ of the Internet. In both the cases\nthere are possible restrictions that would\
    \ be forced on Internet operations\nin future. To protect sovereign interests\
    \ an individual nation is likely to\nregulate the Internet autonomy, but this\
    \ could have detrimental effect on\nthe possible services foreseen to be fulﬁlled\
    \ in future through 5G. The\nmore connected the world through a uniﬁed network\
    \ would be, the harder\nit would be to govern it and bring about an international\
    \ consensus on Internet\nGovernance.\n82\nCYBER Security and Threats\n5.1.4 Cyber\
    \ War\nIn a uniﬁed mega network that allows users to access information directly\n\
    from cyber physical structures (CPSs) that are in place for automation and\ncontrol\
    \ of a CPS, the CPS could be attacked/compromised to harm the\npossible operations\
    \ derived from that physical structure. Such attacks on\nCPS have taken place\
    \ in current communication network scenarios such\nas Heart bleed and Suxnet.\
    \ Their likelihood would increase signiﬁcantly\nif the networks are uniﬁed and\
    \ users gain larger uninterrupted access. In\nthe event of a large scale, cyber\
    \ attack could lead to paralysis of critical\ninfrastructure services such as\
    \ transportation and banking and public utility\nsuch as electricity distribution.\
    \ The 5G communication network would bring\nthe physical infrastructure and the\
    \ cyber infrastructure very close, thereby the\nthreats to CPS would be enormous.\n\
    The governmental agencies that currently have a tough task in maintain-\ning public\
    \ utilities security and government infrastructure protection could\nencounter\
    \ a situation of securing the infrastructure manifold complex than it\nis today.\
    \ Cyber defence similar to other conventional defence mechanisms\nare cost intensive.\
    \ Nations could be forced to increase their spending on\ncyber defence, in turn\
    \ neglecting other critical priority issues that need to\nbe addressed [1, 6].\n\
    5.1.5 Differentiation of Legitimate Versus Illegitimate Activities\nThe uniﬁcation\
    \ of various communication networks and devices, and the\npossibility of accessing\
    \ information from devices diversely spread across\nthe landscape would make it\
    \ harder to determine as to what would comprise\nas legitimate and what would\
    \ be illegitimate activities. Based on users’\npreferences and choices, the service\
    \ provider wishes to mould that service\nand application to meet the users’ requirement.\
    \ This is a well-established\npractice today. In future, especially in the case\
    \ of service delivery model\nsuch as sensing as a service and anything as a service,\
    \ the service providers\nwould try to data mine about the potential user/customer\
    \ from their person\nspeciﬁc data. The companies are highly interested in inferring\
    \ the customer as\nclosely as possible, since this inﬂuences their business prospects.\
    \ As person\nspeciﬁc data would grow based on the interaction a given person holds\
    \ with\nthe myriad of devices around, it would be very hard to draw a permissible\n\
    line of what could be used for analytics and service providing and what\ncomprises\
    \ personal data that requires to be protected to ensure the privacy\nof the individual.\n\
    5.2 Users Awareness\n83\n5.1.6 Legal System to Govern Machine-to-Machine Interactions\n\
    The legal systems around the world are designed keeping in mind the\nneeds of\
    \ the society, ensuring that by abiding by the law the whole society\nis secured.\
    \ This is also applicable broadly for the cyber laws that have\nbeen enacted by\
    \ the various governmental bodies. However, not in the\n5G communication scenario\
    \ that would comprise communication between\nmachines (M2M) and IoT. The machines\
    \ and devices would communicate\nwith each other for certain self-automated tasks\
    \ based on local decision\nmaking/intelligence, this could bypass the involvement\
    \ of any human being\ngoverning the information exchange and automated decision\
    \ making. In such\na case a compromised machine may exploit a connected machine\
    \ for gaining\ninformation or utilizing it to carry out an activity for illicit\
    \ purpose. If the\ncrime committed shifts from a human being to a machine, it\
    \ would be tough\nto enforce any governing law existent today. The legal rules\
    \ as applicable to\ncommon public are drafted such that they are comprehensible\
    \ to a layman\nin the broad sense. For example a layman can understand reading\
    \ Internet\nprivacy and security rules as to what is the ethical way of using\
    \ the Internet.\nHowever, drafting such a regulation base for machines/devices\
    \ is infeasible\nconsidering the fact that interactions between machines would\
    \ take place in\na highly complex technical way, which could vary from machine-to-machine\n\
    and underlying communication medium between the machines protecting\nnetwork.\n\
    5.2 Users Awareness\nFor efﬁcient user expertise of maintaining the expected cyber\
    \ discipline in\nnavigating across the plethora of data available it would be\
    \ necessitated to\neducate the users of the usage etiquettes on the connected\
    \ network. This\nis of tantamount importance as in a uniﬁed mega network in the\
    \ form of\nWISDOM/GIMCV it would be necessary for the users to ensure that they\n\
    access the data in an appropriate manner, following the basic guidelines. Some\n\
    broad user guidelines and awareness are as described below:\nThe end users must\
    \ be aware of these minimum safety measures [4]:\n• To install the antivirus and\
    \ anti-malware solutions in order to protect the\ndevices from various virus or\
    \ malware attacks. This idea has proved to\nbe an effective solution against malicious\
    \ attacks.\n• The end users must be vigilant of the peculiar activities or behaviours\
    \ in\ntheir own devices.\n84\nCYBER Security and Threats\n• They must install\
    \ the applications from the original developer. The\nsources must be trustful\
    \ having legitimate contact information and\nwebsite.\n• They should prefer to\
    \ choose the applications on the Internet with the\nmaximum number of downloads.\n\
    • They should not access their accounts or any other sensitive data when\nusing\
    \ those devices in public.\n• They must ensure the frequent update of their operating\
    \ systems and\nother software of their devices.\n• They should also install a\
    \ personal ﬁrewall to protect mobile device\ninterfaces from direct attack and\
    \ illegal access.\n• The mobile network operators (MNO) should also be helpful\
    \ to the end\nusers by providing a secure environment. They can install antivirus\
    \ and\nanti-malware software to scan outgoing and incoming SMS and MMS\nto the\
    \ mobile network.\nIn addition to these, application developers should ensure\
    \ that the\nsensitive or private data is not being sent to the unencrypted channel,\
    \ which\nmeans data must be sent through HTTPS or TLS networks.\nIn brief we can\
    \ note important players in securing the mobile wireless\necosystem. They include\
    \ [3]:\n• Mobile network operators (MNOs)\n• Manufacturers of hardware, including\
    \ mobile devices, chipsets and\nnetwork equipments\n• Application developers and\
    \ market places\n• Operating system vendors\n• Network service providers\n• Support\
    \ software vendors\n• Wi-Fihotspotproviders,over-the-top(OTP)providersandotherplatform\n\
    providers\nMost of the mobile industries are investing millions of dollars for\
    \ providing\nthe cyber security solutions for the strong security in the future.\
    \ From the\naspect of mobile operating systems security solutions include [4]:\n\
    • Mandatory encryption\n• Application certiﬁcates\n• Permission list for installations\n\
    The successful delivery of the mobile security or cyber security solutions\nrequire\
    \ an active participation of the entire mobile landscape of mobile\n5.3 Spectrum\

    \ innovative concept has proved its potential worldwide.\nA CR network (CRN) should\
    \ perform following functions [5]:\n• To determine the portions of the available\
    \ spectrum and detect the\npresence of licensed users when a user operates in\
    \ a licensed band which\nis termed as “Spectrum Sensing”.\n• To select the best\
    \ available channel which is termed as “Spectrum\nManagement”.\n• To coordinate\
    \ access to the channels with other users (secondary users)\nwhich is termed as\
    \ “Spectrum Sharing”.\n• To vacate the channel when the licensed user is detected\
    \ which is known\nas “Spectrum Mobility”.\nSome of the spectrum access related\
    \ security issues concerned with CRNs\nare [7, 8]:\n• Masquerading of a cognitive\
    \ radio node: This threat identiﬁes the\nmasquerading of a CR node while collaborating\
    \ with other CR nodes for\nCR functions: spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, spectrum\
    \ manage-\nment and spectrum mobility. For example, a malicious device can send\n\
    wrong spectrum sensing information to other CR nodes. The affected\nfunctionalities\
    \ are spectrum sharing, spectrum sensing and spectrum\nmobility.\n• Selﬁsh Misbehaviours:\
    \ During the channel negotiation process, a selﬁsh\ncognitive node tries to gain\
    \ an unfair advantage and try to improve its own\nperformance. The channel negotiation\
    \ process is done using the results\nfrom spectrum sensing and the fairness depends\
    \ on the cooperation of the\ncontending nodes.Aselﬁsh node may conceal the available\
    \ data channels\nfrom others and reserve it for its own use. The affected functionalities\
    \ in\nthis case are spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility.\n86\nCYBER Security\
    \ and Threats\n• Hidden node problem: This threat identiﬁes the case when a CR\
    \ node\ndoes not detect the user because of the obstacles. The consequence is\n\
    that, it transmits the same frequency bands of the primary user causing\nharmful\
    \ interference. The affected functionalities are spectrum sharing,\nspectrum mobility\
    \ and spectrum sensing.\n• Jamming of the channel used to distribute cognitive\
    \ messages: This\nthreat identiﬁes the jamming of a cognitive control channel\
    \ that is used\nto distribute cognitive messages in the CR network. This can be\
    \ executed\nagainst an out-of-band or an in-band cognitive control channel if\
    \ the\nfrequency of the channel is known. The affected functionalities are\nspectrum\
    \ sensing and spectrum sharing.\n• Unauthorized use of spectrum bands for Denial\
    \ of Service to primary\nuser: This threat identiﬁes the case where a malicious\
    \ node or CRN\nemits power in unauthorized spectrum bands to cause Denial of Service\n\
    (DoS) to primary users.The affected functionality in this case is spectrum\nsharing.\n\
    • Malicious alteration of cognitive messages: This threat identiﬁes the\nalteration\
    \ of cognitive messages that are exchanged in the CRN. The\naffected functionalities\
    \ in this case are spectrum sharing and spectrum\nsensing.\n• Eavesdropping: This\
    \ is a common threat or problem in the wireless\nsystems where the privacy of\
    \ the data is communicated over the other\nsystems. The eavesdropper may get the\
    \ access to the exchanged content\nover wireless links like CRNs and then exploit\
    \ the information against\nthe network.\n5.4 Summary\nAddressing security and\
    \ privacy challenges in respect to 5G would require\nexcessive examination. In\
    \ fact it can be concluded that reliable 5G operations\nwould be unfeasible until\
    \ suitable mechanism that would ensure dynamic\noperations with excessive high\
    \ data rate and mobility could prevent cyber\ncrime against user(s).\nReferences\n\

    \ is referred as beyond 2020 mobile com-\nmunications which means the 5G standards\
    \ can be introduced in early 2020s.\nToday’s current advanced technology is LTE\
    \ advanced, which provides a peak\ndownload speed of 1 Gbps and upload speed of\
    \ 512 Mbps.\n5G has been proposed in response to the needs of the connected society\n\
    2020 and beyond which means its standards are beyond the currently existing\n\
    mobile broad band technologies like 4G/LTE and HSPA. It is also that 5G\nmight\
    \ solve the problem of frequency licensing and spectral management\nissues [1].\n\
    The current 4G LTE system uses advanced technologies such as OFDM,\nMIMO, Turbo\
    \ Code, Hybrid ARQ, and sophisticated radio resource manage-\nment algorithms.\
    \ It is worth mentioning here that WISDOM together with\n4G would lead to realization\
    \ of 5G systems. The fundamental concepts of\n5G are being evolved and developed\
    \ from the existing technologies, and 5G\nsystems by 2020 would fulﬁl the requirements\
    \ of interconnected society by\noffering very high data rates, provision of transmitting\
    \ large amounts of data,\nand security over the data. The 5G terminals have software\
    \ designed radios;\nalso it has different modulation schemes and error control\
    \ schemes [1].\n5G is a concept where personalization meets connectivity and net-\n\
    working technological innovations by integrating under one interoperable\numbrella\
    \ leading technologies, such as M2M communication technologies,\ncognitive radio\
    \ and networking technologies, data mining, decision-making\ntechnologies, security\
    \ and privacy protection technologies, cloud computing\ntechnologies, and advanced\
    \ sensing and actuating technologies.\n5G bundles multi-radio, multi-band air\
    \ interfaces to support portability and\nnomadicity in ultra-high data rate communications\
    \ using novel concepts, and\ncognitive technologies. The aim of 5G is to supersede\
    \ the current propagation\nof core mobile networks with single worldwide core\
    \ network. The objective\n89\n90\nBEYOND 2020\nis to offer seamless multimedia\
    \ services to users accessing all IP-based\ninfrastructure through heterogeneous\
    \ access technologies [1].\n6.1 Challenges for 2020 and Beyond\nThere are more\
    \ than 5 billion wireless connected mobile devices in operation\nin today’s world,\
    \ most of which are handheld terminals and mobile broadband\ndevices in portable\
    \ laptops, tablets and computers.The result is the tremendous\nrise in the overall\
    \ trafﬁc on the wireless communication systems fuelled\nprimarily by the uptake\
    \ in the mobile-broadband. By 2020 and beyond the\nwireless devices would be approximately\
    \ 7 trillion and therefore the trafﬁc\nwill rise manifold as compared with today.\
    \ 5G system should be an intelligent\ntechnology capable of interconnecting the\
    \ entire world without limits.\nThe cost of deploying, operation and managing\
    \ 5G systems for many\napplications are also the major challenges as the services\
    \ should be accessible\nto every common man living in the world [2].\nIncreasing\
    \ bit rates led to increased energy consumption in BS. Main\nchallenge for future\
    \ mobile networks is to reduce power consumption. In\ncellular networks BS consumes\
    \ more than 60% of the power so it is preferable\nto reduce power consumption\
    \ in BS elements. Recent networks are designed\nwith the consideration of high\
    \ peak load, not with medium or low load\nconsideration.Inrealscenarioiftheloadonanetworkincreased,thencoverage\n\
    will decrease and vice versa. To solve this power consumption issue, network\n\
    topology will be designed in such a way that as load decrease BS starts to\ncover\
    \ more regions, and some of the BSs can be shut down [3].\nIn the recent times,\
    \ new types of devices, their respective applications and\nservices are being\
    \ developed and will appear to us in the future. We humans\nare connected to them\
    \ through the mobile networks in our daily life. For\nexample, medical devices,\
    \ trafﬁc lights, vehicles, etc. 5G should provide long\nterm, efﬁcient, high-performing\
    \ solutions for all these types of services.\nDevelopment of 5G is not just replacing\
    \ the current existing technologies,\nbut it is the matter of evolving and complementing\
    \ these technologies with\nnew Radio Access technologies with respect to speciﬁc\
    \ scenarios and user\ncases [2].\n6.2 Future Mobile Technologies\nSome of the\
    \ future mobile technologies to be discussed are [3]:\n• CR\n• Beam Division Multiple\
    \ Access\n6.2 Future Mobile Technologies\n91\n• Flat IP Support\n• Support IPv6\n\
    • Pervasive Network\n• Multi homing\n• Group Cooperative Relay Technique\n• Mobile\
    \ Cloud Computing Support\n6.2.1 Cognitive Radio\nCR technology will be more efﬁcient\
    \ radio communications systems to be\ndeveloped. This new radio technology share\
    \ the same spectrum efﬁciently\nby ﬁnding unused spectrum and adapting the transmission\
    \ scheme to the\nrequirements of the technologies currently sharing the spectrum.\
    \ CR will\nhave knowledge of free channel and occupied channel, type of data to\
    \ be\ntransmitted, modulation scheme, position of receiving equipment and also\n\
    aware of the environment. With the knowledge of above parameters radio\nshould\
    \ capture the best available spectrum to meet user requirements and\nquality of\
    \ services [2].\nWhen the level of occupancy increases then these systems have\
    \ to move\ncontinuously from one channel to another which reduces the efﬁciency\
    \ of the\nsystem.As use of CR increases a single frequency, signal will appear\
    \ on a new\nfrequency continuously so that effective algorithm must be developed\
    \ and CR\nsystem will move only when it is necessary [3].\nA. Continuous spectrum\
    \ sensing\nIn this system spectrum occupancy will monitor continuously, and CR\
    \ system\nwill use the spectrum on a non-interference basis for the user.\nB.\
    \ Monitor for empty alternative spectrum\nWhen primary user returns to the spectrum,\
    \ then CR system must have an\nalternative spectrum available, so that it can\
    \ switch to secondary user on it.\nC. Monitor type of transmission\nThe CR must\
    \ have knowledge of transmission used by users so that\ninterference can be ignored.\n\
    6.2.2 Beam Division Multiple Access\nFDMA, TDMA, CDMA and OFDM are the various\
    \ multiple access\ntechniques used in the wireless communications. In these frequency\
    \ and time\n92\nBEYOND 2020\nare divided among multiple users. But Korea has proposed\
    \ a new technique\ncalled BDMA which is known as “Beam Division Multiple Access”\
    \ as radio\ninterference for 5G which does not depend on frequency/time resources.\n\
    In BDMA technique BS allocates separate beam to each mobile station\nand it divides\
    \ the antenna beam according to the location of mobile stations.\nBased on the\
    \ moving speed and position of mobile station, the calculations\nof direction\
    \ and width of a downlink beam are done by the BS. When mobile\nstations are located\
    \ at different angles with the BS then BS transmits different\nbeams at the different\
    \ angles to transmit data simultaneously. If mobile stations\nare at the same\
    \ angle with the BS, they share same beam. This multiple access\ntechnique signiﬁcantly\
    \ increases the capacity of the system [4].\nThe BS can change the width of beams,\
    \ number of beams and direction\naccording to a communication environment. When\
    \ the mobile station and\nBS know each other’s position or when are in LOS , they\
    \ will communicate\nwith each other by a separate beam. Maximization of radiation\
    \ efﬁciency of\nantenna can be done by matching the radiation pattern of mobile\
    \ station and\nBS antennas [4].\n6.2.3 Support IPv6\nIn the 5G system, each mobile\
    \ phone will have permanent “Home” IP address\nand “care of address” which represents\
    \ its actual location. If computer on\nthe Internet wants to communicate with\
    \ cell phone, it sends a packet to the\nhome address and subsequently server on\
    \ home address sends a packet to\nthe actual location through the tunnel. Server\
    \ also sends a packet to the\ncomputer to inform the correct address so that future\
    \ packets will be sent\non that address.\nBecause of this IPv6 has to be used\
    \ for mobility. IPv6 addresses are 128\nbit, which is four times more than 32\
    \ bit IPv4 address. This 128 bit address\nwill be divided into four parts.\n•\
    \ The part represents the home address of a device.\n• The second 32 bits may\
    \ be used for care of address.\n• The set of 32 bits used for tunnelling to establish\
    \ a connection between\nwire-line and wireless network.\n• The last 32 bits used\
    \ for IPv6 address may be used for VPN sharing.\nFrom this we can conclude that\
    \ future 5G technology has a goal of establishing\nsingle worldwide network standard\
    \ based on IPv6 for control, packet data,\n6.2 Future Mobile Technologies\n93\n\
    video and voice. The users can experience uniform voice, video and data\nservices\
    \ based on IPv6 [3].\n6.2.4 Flat IP control\nIn 5G world, it is beneﬁcial to transmit\
    \ all voice, video and data using packet\nswitching instead of circuit switching.\
    \ It is an important feature to make 5G\nacceptable for all kinds of technologies.\
    \ Each mobile device has to be allocated\nIP based on connected network and its\
    \ location; devices are identiﬁed using\nthe symbolic name instead of conventional\
    \ IP format in Flat IP. This means\nthe data is no longer routed by traversing\
    \ a hierarchy from originating user\nthrough multiple layers of aggregation to\
    \ a central core and then re-routed\nback out in a multilayer disaggregation hierarchy\
    \ to the targeted user. The ﬂat\ncore routers of the originating user routes data\
    \ directly to the local ﬂat core\nrouter of the targeted user. In this technology,\
    \ only one access speciﬁc node\ntype is available.\nThis technology uses the reduced\
    \ number of components lowering the\noperation cost and investment. This is the\
    \ reason when there occur low system\nfailure and latency. The only issue is the\
    \ security as the Internet is open for\nhackers and criminals along with developers.\
    \ Trojan horses and phishing are\nthe two important security challenges [3].\n\
    6.2.5 Multi Homing\nIt is a technique used to increase the reliability of the\
    \ Internet connection for\nan IP network. Future generation networks will support\
    \ vertical handover, and\nuser can simultaneously be connected to several wireless\
    \ access technologies\nand move between them. The Internet through multiple network\
    \ interface or\nIP addresses accessible to a single device is called multi homing.\
    \ The con-\nﬁguration of this network assigns multiple IP addresses to different\
    \ wireless\ntechnologies available on the same device. If one of the links fails,\
    \ then its\nIP address will be unreachable but other IP address will still work\
    \ so we can\naccess the Internet.\nMulti homing has become popular because of\
    \ IPv6 address availability,\nthat support more network protocol for multi homing\
    \ than traditional IPv4\naddress. This IPv6 address has availability of provider\
    \ independent address\nspace. This technique works like IPv4, supports trafﬁc\
    \ balance across multiple\nproviders and maintains existing TCP (Transmission\
    \ Control Protocol) and\nUDP (User Datagram Protocol) sessions through cut-overs\
    \ [3].\n94\nBEYOND 2020\n6.2.6 Pervasive Networks\nThe growth in the mobile broadband\
    \ technology increases air interference\ntechnology and provides local area connectivity\
    \ to the wide area. Future\nnetwork will be “network of networks” which will provide\
    \ uninterrupted\nservice when roaming across many radio access schemes. The user\
    \ can\nsimultaneously be connected to several wireless access technologies and\n\
    move between them which can be 2.5G, 3G, 4G or 5G mobile networks,\nWi-Fi, WPAN,\
    \ or any other future access technology. In 5G user can provide\nmultiple concurrent\
    \ data transfer and also user can move globally. Beyond\n4G, network gives media\
    \ independent handover, vertical handover and IEEE\n802.21 support.\nThis IEEE\
    \ standard 802.21 supports handover between same type of\nnetworks as well as\
    \ distinct type of networks. Mobile IP provides vertical\nhandover mechanisms\
    \ for different types of networks, but can be slow in\nthe process. To support\
    \ this mechanism, mobile station must have dual\nmode cards so that it can work\
    \ on WLAN and UMTS band and modulation\nscheme. To support vertical handover mobile\
    \ station must have dual mode\ncards so that it can work on WLAN and UMTS band\
    \ and modulation\nscheme [3].\n6.2.7 Group Cooperative Relay Techniques\nWith\
    \ the development of the MIMO systems, there is also higher throughput\nand reliability\
    \ in a wireless network. This technology seems beneﬁcial for BS\nside, but not\
    \ on the user side due to size and power consumption. The alternate\nsolution\
    \ for this is group cooperative diversity techniques. In cooperative\ncommunication,\
    \ source transmits data to the destination and at that time\nneighbour user (relay\
    \ user) can also hear a transmission. The relay user also\nprocesses and forwards\
    \ this message to the destination where received signals\nare combined. Both signals\
    \ are transmitted with the different path as this gives\ndiversity in the relaying\
    \ the information. [3].\n6.2.8 Mobile Cloud Computing Support\nCloud computing\
    \ is a new and unique technique to access data like doc-\numents, application,\
    \ video ﬁles, music ﬁle, etc., from any place without\ncarrying any data-storage\
    \ devices. A cloud user can access all data from\nanywhere in the world any time,\
    \ and the best example of cloud computing is\nGmail.\n6.4 Human Bond Communications\n\
    95\nMobile world is depended upon two factors:\n• Network availability (3G, 4G,\
    \ WIFI, etc.,)\n• Handset availability (Feature phones, Smart phones).\nThe cloud\
    \ computing is best option for low processing capability, low data\nstorage. Some\
    \ of the mobile applications that run on one mobile phone cannot\noperate on other\
    \ phone. This problem can be solved by mobile computing.\nIn this, the application\
    \ runs on the speciﬁc device called cloud, and user can\naccess the data and application.\
    \ Requirement is user must have the Internet,\nwithout need for more computing\
    \ capacity [3].\n6.3 High Altitude Stratospheric Platform Station Systems\nThe\
    \ transfer of the large data requires large band width.To use high-bandwidth\n\
    solution is to use lower wavelength waves, which require LOS propagation,\nthat\
    \ are challenged to compare with lower frequency propagation. Wireless\ncommunication\
    \ services are facilitated by terrestrial and satellite systems.\nThe terrestrial\
    \ systems are used to render services in complex propagation\nareas. Satellite\
    \ links are used during the lack of availability of terrestrial links.\nNowadays\
    \ research is going on aerial platforms at high altitudes to provide\nLOS propagation.\n\
    A High Altitude Platform (HAP) is powered by battery, engine or solar\ncell. HAPs\
    \ work similar to a BS and can be compared with a tall antenna\nthat delivers\
    \ a wireless communication. HAP is powered by battery, engine\nor solar cell.\
    \ HAP can be easily deployed in hours which make it favourable\nin emergencies\
    \ and disasters.\nHAP does not require expensive launching like satellites which\
    \ gives\ncost-effective way. HAPs will vary in position vertically and laterally\
    \ depend-\ning upon the wind. This movement changes the look angle from the ground\n\
    terminal. If this variation is greater than beam width of an antenna, then it\n\
    requires the gain to operate the link.\nHAPs provide a coverage radius of 30 Km,\
    \ giving us the beneﬁt of\nestablishing single HAP instead of several terrestrial\
    \ BSs in suburban and\nrural areas [4].\n6.4 Human Bond Communications\nWISDOM\
    \ based 5G communication would usher the society into a digital\nage whereby humans\
    \ can communicate in a real sense. The conventional\ncommunication network carries\
    \ information between users in a ‘digitized’\n96\nBEYOND 2020\nform, which is\
    \ signiﬁcantly different from the real communication that is\nanticipated between\
    \ two users if they are physically present next to each\nother. Human beings interact\
    \ with the environment through ﬁve senses, i.e.,\nskin, eyes, ears, nose and tongue.\
    \ Overall understanding of a physical subject\nby human beings depends on the\
    \ degree to which the observations are made\nby the ﬁve senses. However, the conventional\
    \ information communication\nmechanisms have been centred on either visual (eyes)\
    \ or audio (ears) based\ncommunication. Therefore, for a particular subject the\
    \ overall judgement\nthat can be drawn by human beings would be based on just\
    \ these two\nsenses, ignoring the possible utility of other three sensory systems\
    \ completely.\nAccordingly, the judgement by the brain based on just the two sensory\
    \ inputs is\nindeed only a partial representation of the actual physical subject.\
    \ Human bond\ncommunication (HBC) stresses on utilizing all the ﬁve senses for\
    \ modelling\na physical subject with appropriate representation in digital form\
    \ based on\nappropriate actuation and transmission across the communication network\n\
    to support all sensory information [5]. WISDOM based 5G network that can\nsupport\
    \ very high data rate would be capable of supporting the communication\nbandwidthrequirements,iftheoverallsensordataistobetransmitted.Forming\n\
    an almost true (complete) understanding of a physical subject through HBC\nsupported\
    \ on WISDOM 5G would create an information rich society that is\nunimaginable\
    \ in today’s communication world.\n6.5 CONASENSE – Communication, Navigation,\
    \ Sensing\nand Services\nThe WISDOM based 5G amply covers the communication aspect\
    \ of the\nnetwork, which as discussed earlier would involve one large core network.\
    \ It\nhas also been stated the signiﬁcance of sensing the environment is through\n\
    the capacity of individuals to gain rich information from machines (IoT).\nHowever,\
    \ one of the objectives is to allow seamless connectivity to users even\nif they\
    \ are mobile at high speeds. In the case of a user who is mobile at high\nspeeds,\
    \ it is just not the high speed connectivity that is necessitated, providing\n\
    the user with effective navigational information is also an expected service\n\
    requirement.\nCONASENSE stresses on collective addressing of communication, sens-\n\
    ing and navigation aspects dependent on the context, as the three aspects\nbidirectionally\
    \ relate with each other to deliver services to the end user [6],\n[7]. The services\
    \ that these three aspects provide have been referred as Quality\n6.5 CONASENSE\
    \ – Communication, Navigation, Sensing and Services\n97\nof Life services. This\
    \ justiﬁes that QoL (Quality of Life) for common people\nwouldbeensuredinfutureonlyiftheseaspectsarecollectivelyhandled.Thisis\n\
    validatedconsideringtheenormousutilityofintelligenttransportationsystems\n(ITS)\
    \ and V2V. Both the broad areas rely heavily on navigation information\nand both\
    \ in turn inﬂuence the information and communication that is available\nto the\
    \ end user.\nHBC and CONASENSE are complementary aspects in terms of enormous\n\
    utility of sensing obtained from the myriad types of physical sensors that\ncould\
    \ be deployed in the biosphere for garnering information. HBC stresses\non speciﬁc\
    \ sensing capabilities that human beings utilize to interact with their\nenvironment.\
    \ Therefore HBC and CONASENSE would collectively ensure\nthat information requirements\
    \ of the future society in 2020 and beyond are\nappropriately met. The relation\
    \ between WISDOM, HBC and CONASENSE,\nand their collective result as assured through\
    \ the advent of 5G is shown in\nFigure 6.1.\nFigure 6.1\nWISDOM, HBC and CONASENSE\
    \ Collectively.\n98\nBEYOND 2020\n6.6 Summary\n5G technologies will play a vital\
    \ role in our lives by enabling unlimited access\nto information and data sharing\
    \ to anyone, anywhere at any time. To fulﬁl the\nrequirements of the users to\
    \ experience Terabit communications, a 5G system\nmust be a combination of different\
    \ technologies like integrated Radio Access\nTechnology (RAT), including evolved\
    \ versions of LTE and HSPA and other\nspecial advanced technologies.\nReferences\n\

  analysis: Both papers address the importance of inter-cell interference coordination
    techniques to maximize the capacity of this AG-HetNet in case of a disaster with
    damaged MBSs. However, the contribution of the study in [50] is to address this
    challenge of interference mitigation by using and optimizing eICIC and CRE techniques
    and at the same time, optimize the UAV locations using the brute-force technique
    to achieve maximum spectral eﬃciency. The work in [51] extends the investigation
    of critical aspects such as the inter-cell interference, channel modeling support,
    spectral eﬃciency, and coverage probability is extended to cover both UABSs and
    AUEs as part of the AG-HetNet.

    \ Professor\nEnsuring ubiquitous mission-critical public safety communications\
    \ (PSC) to all the\nﬁrst responders in the public safety network is crucial at\
    \ an emergency site. The\nﬁrst responders heavily rely on mission-critical PSC\
    \ to save lives, property, and\nnational infrastructure during a natural or human-made\
    \ emergency.\nThe recent\nadvancements in LTE/LTE-Advanced/5G mobile technologies\
    \ supported by un-\nmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have great potential to revolutionize\
    \ PSC.\nHowever, limited spectrum allocation for LTE-based PSC demands improved\n\
    channel capacity and spectral eﬃciency. An additional challenge in designing an\n\
    LTE-based PSC network is achieving at least 95% coverage of the geographical\n\
    area and human population with broadband rates. The coverage requirement and\n\
    eﬃcient spectrum use in the PSC network can be realized through the dense de-\n\
    ployment of small cells (both terrestrial and aerial).\nHowever, there are several\n\
    challenges with the dense deployment of small cells in an air-ground heterogeneous\n\
    network (AG-HetNet). The main challenges which are addressed in this research\n\
    work are integrating UAVs as both aerial user and aerial base-stations, mitigating\n\
    inter-cell interference, capacity and coverage enhancements, and optimizing deploy-\n\
    ment locations of aerial base-stations.\nvi\nFirst, LTE signals were investigated\
    \ using NS-3 simulation and software-deﬁned\nradio experiment to gain knowledge\
    \ on the quality of service experienced by the user\nequipment (UE). Using this\
    \ understanding, a two-tier LTE-Advanced AG-HetNet\nwith macro base-stations and\
    \ unmanned aerial base-stations (UABS) is designed,\nwhile considering time-domain\
    \ inter-cell interference coordination techniques. We\nmaximize the capacity of\
    \ this AG-HetNet in case of a damaged PSC infrastructure by\njointly optimizing\
    \ the inter-cell interference parameters and UABS locations using a\nmeta-heuristic\
    \ genetic algorithm (GA) and the brute-force technique. Finally, con-\nsidering\
    \ the latest speciﬁcations in 3GPP, a more realistic three-tier LTE-Advanced\n\
    AG-HetNet is proposed with macro base-stations, pico base-stations, and ground\n\
    UEs as terrestrial nodes and UABS and aerial UEs as aerial nodes. Using meta-\n\
    heuristic techniques such as GA and elitist harmony search algorithm based on\
    \ the\nGA, the critical network elements such as energy eﬃciency, inter-cell interference\n\
    parameters, and UABS locations are all jointly optimized to maximize the capacity\n\
    and coverage of the AG-HetNet.\nvii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHAPTER\nPAGE\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\

    Public Safety Network\nPublic safety organizations protect the well-being of the\
    \ public in case of natural and\nman-made disasters, and are tasked with preparing\
    \ for, planning for, and respond-\ning to emergencies. The emergency management\
    \ agencies include law enforcement\nagencies, ﬁre departments, rescue squads,\
    \ emergency medical services (EMS), and\nother entities that are referred to as\
    \ emergency ﬁrst responders (EFR). The ability\nof EFR to communicate amongst\
    \ themselves and seamlessly share critical informa-\ntion directly aﬀects their\
    \ ability to save lives. The communication technologies such\nas legacy radio\
    \ system, commercial network (2G/3G), and broadband (LTE/WiFi)\nare largely used\
    \ by the public safety organizations as shown in Fig. 1.1.\nOver the recent years,\
    \ there has been increasing interest in improving the ca-\npabilities of public\
    \ safety communications (PSC) systems. For example, in [21–23],\neﬃcient spectrum\
    \ management techniques, allocation models, and infrastructure\noptions are introduced\
    \ for PSC scenarios. Reforms on PSC policy have been dis-\ncussed in [24] and\
    \ [25], which study the decoupling of spectrum licenses for spectrum\naccess,\
    \ a new nationwide system built on open standards with consistent architec-\n\
    ture, and fund raising approach for the transition to a new nationwide system.\
    \ As\nexplained in [26], communication of time critical information is an important\
    \ factor\nfor emergency response. In [27] and [28], insights on cognitive radio\
    \ technology are\npresented, which plays a signiﬁcant role in making the best\
    \ use of scarce spectrum\nin public safety scenarios. Integration of other wireless\
    \ technologies into PSC is\nstudied in [29], with a goal to provide faster and\
    \ reliable communication capability\n1\nFigure 1.1: Example for current public\
    \ safety network structure.\nin a challenging environment where infrastructure\
    \ is impacted by the unplanned\nemergency events.\nTo further enhance the capabilities\
    \ of next generation PSC networks, countries\nsuch as the United States, the United\
    \ Kingdom, and Canada are building a 4G\nLong Term Evolution (LTE) based broadband\
    \ public safety network [30–32]. In\nparticular, 4G mobile networks have great\
    \ potential to revolutionize PSC during\nemergency situations by providing much\
    \ needed high-speed real-time data, video,\nand multimedia services along with\
    \ mission-critical communication.\n1.1.1\nContributions\nIn this dissertation,\
    \ a comprehensive survey and comparative analysis on public\nsafety Land Mobile\
    \ Radio System (LMRS) and LTE public safety network (PSN) is\ndiscussed and covers\
    \ the following aspects in details.\n•\nCase study of public safety spectrum allocation\
    \ in the United States, and\npresent an overview of spectrum allocation in VHF,\
    \ UHF, 700 MHz, 800,\nMHz, 900 MHz, and 4.9 GHz bands for various public safety\
    \ entities.\n2\n• Review the LTE-based PSN with the ﬁrst responders network authority\
    \ (First-\nNet) in the United States as an example, the convergence of LTE-LMR\
    \ tech-\nnologies, support for mission-critical PTT (MCPTT) over LTE, and current\n\
    status of broadband PSNs in diﬀerent regions of the world.\n•\nComparative analysis,\
    \ NS-3 simulation study, and software-deﬁned radio ex-\nperimentation of LMRS\
    \ and LTE PSC.\n• Comprehensive perspective on how emerging wireless technologies\
    \ can shape\nPSN and discuss open research problems for diﬀerent public safety\
    \ technolo-\ngies.\n1.1.2\nPublications\nThe above works have been published in\
    \ peer reviewed journal [30] and conference\nproceeding [33].\n1.2\nRole of UAVs\
    \ in Public Safety HetNets\nRecent developments in reliability and cost-eﬀective\
    \ hardware have enhanced the\ndrones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) capabilities\
    \ such as mobility, location-\naware connectivity, deployment ﬂexibility in three-dimensional\
    \ (3D) space, and en-\nabling ubiquitous and non-line-of-sight connectivity. In\
    \ particular, with minimum\ninterdependencies and at low cost UAVs are deployed\
    \ as unmanned aerial base-\nstations (UABSs) to meet the mobile data and coverage\
    \ demands and to restore\ndamaged infrastructure by relieving the pressure on\
    \ the terrestrial networks and\nreducing the cost of dense small cell deployments\
    \ [30, 34–36]. For example, in the\naftermath of Hurricane Maria, AT&T deployed\
    \ cell on wings (COW) drone to restore\n3\nlong term evolution (LTE) cell coverage\
    \ in Puerto Rico [37–39]. On the other hand,\nVerizon has been testing a ﬂying\
    \ cell site that provides LTE coverage of one-mile\nrange [39].\nIn a broader\
    \ context, the use of UAV as aerial user equipment (AUEs) has\nenabled smart city\
    \ applications such as traﬃc monitoring, data collection from\nInternet-of-Things\
    \ (IoT) nodes, and public safety applications such as search and\nrescue, and\
    \ remote location sensing. In the most recent Kilauea volcano eruption,\nthe ﬁrst\
    \ responders were able to search and rescue a Hawaiian man using a UAV [40].\n\
    Such vast applications have enabled the recent works to study the feasibility\
    \ of de-\nploying AUEs in collaboration with existing LTE-Advanced infrastructure\
    \ in [40–49]\n1.2.1\nContributions\nIn this dissertation, we integrate the UAVs\
    \ as both AUEs and UABSs into the\nexisting LTE-Advanced terrestrial network infrastructure\
    \ and provide system-level\nunderstanding to both modify and extend this air-ground\
    \ HetNet (AG-HetNet).\nWe deﬁne and simulate an AG-HetNet system model for an\
    \ urban environment\nwith public safety LTE band class 14 in the following scenarios:\n\
    • In a two-tier AG-HetNet with macro base stations (MBSs), UABS, and ground\n\
    user equipment (GUEs), we simulate a mock emergency situation by randomly\nremoving\
    \ MBSs as shown in Fig. 1.2, to study the impact of interference and\ncell range\
    \ expansion (CRE) when the UABSs are deployed.\n• In a three-tier AG-HetNet with\
    \ MBS, pico base stations (PBSs) UABS, GUEs,\nand ground user equipment (GUEs),\
    \ we study the feasibility of deploying\nUAVa as both UABS and AUEs with an existing\
    \ LTE-Advanced terrestrial\ninfrastructure. Furthermore, the investigation of\
    \ critical aspects such as the\n4\nFigure 1.2: The PSC scenario with MBS and UABSs\
    \ constituting an two-tier AG-\nHetNet infrastructure. The MBS can use inter-cell\
    \ interference coordination tech-\nniques deﬁned in LTE-Advanced. The UABSs can\
    \ dynamically change their position\nto maintain good coverage and can utilize\
    \ range expansion bias to take over MBS\nUEs.\nFigure 1.3: The terrestrial nodes\
    \ (MBS, PBS, and GUE) and aerial nodes (UABS\nand AUE) constitute the three-tier\
    \ AG-HetNet. The MBS and PBS can use inter-\ncell interference coordination techniques\
    \ deﬁned in LTE-Advanced. The PBSs and\nmobile UABSs can utilize range expansion\
    \ bias to oﬄoad UEs in network congested\nareas.\ninter-cell interference, channel\
    \ modeling support, spectral eﬃciency, and cov-\nerage probability is extended\
    \ to cover both UABSs and AUEs as part of the\nAG-HetNet\n5\n1.2.2\nPublications\n\
    The above works have been published in peer reviewed journal [30, 36] and con-\n\
    ference proceeding [47, 50]. One of the works has been submitted to peer-review\n\
    journal and is under review [51]. The author has jointly worked as a co-author\
    \ in\ntwo other relevant studies [35, 42, 49, 52].\n1.3\nCapacity and Coverage\
    \ Enhancement\nCoverage probability and ﬁfth percentile spectral eﬃciency (5pSE)\
    \ are the key per-\nformance indicators (KPIs) that are considered when designing\
    \ a AG-HetNet for\nPSC. For example, FirstNet in the United States is designing\
    \ a PSC network, which\nis required to minimize coverage gaps and attain at least\
    \ 95% coverage of the geo-\ngraphical area and human population [53] with broadband\
    \ rates. However, given the\nlimited spectrum allocation for LTE-based PSC, the\
    \ usage of high-speed real-time\ndata, video, and multimedia services would need\
    \ improved channel capacity quality,\nand spectral eﬃciency (SE) [30, 54].\nTo\
    \ this end, the deployment of LTE-Advanced small cells such as the PBS and\nUABS\
    \ are increasingly becoming popular to provide improved spectral capacity\nand\
    \ extend network coverage [35, 55–58]. Due to their low transmission power, the\n\
    small cells are unable to associate a substantial number of UEs compared to that\n\
    of MBSs. Therefore, we consider the CRE technique deﬁned in 3GPP Release-8 at\n\
    small cells to extend the network coverage and increase capacity by oﬄoading traﬃc\n\
    from congested cells. Although an adverse side eﬀect of CRE includes increased\n\
    interference at UEs in the cell-edge or CRE region and also limit the overall\
    \ PSC\nnetwork SE [35, 58–60]\n6\n1.3.1\nContributions\nIn this dissertation,\

    \ coordinated subframes (CSF) and uncoordi-\nnated subframes (USF). On the other\

    Recent advancements in UAV technology has enabled the possibility of deploying\n\
    small cells such as UABSs mounted with a communication system. UABSs such as\n\
    balloons, quadcopters, and gliders equipped with LTE-Advanced capabilities can\
    \ be\nutilized to further enhance the capabilities of LTE-based HetNets. The ability\
    \ of\nUABSs to dynamically reposition in a HetNet environment can improve the\
    \ overall\nSE of the network by ﬁlling the coverage gaps and oﬄoading UEs in high-traﬃc\n\
    regions. However, due to their low transmission power, the UABSs are unable to\n\
    associate a larger number of UEs compared to that of MBSs. By using the cell\n\
    range expansion (CRE) technique deﬁned in 3GPP Release-8, UABSs can associate\n\
    a large number of UEs by oﬄoading traﬃc from the MBSs/PBSs. A negative side\n\
    eﬀect of CRE includes increased interference in the downlink of cell-edge UEs\
    \ or the\nUEs in CRE region of the UABS. Hence, for eﬀective utilization of air-borne\
    \ small\ncell, it is of critical nature to optimize the locations of UABSs and\
    \ ICIC parameters\nof AG-HetNet to maximize the overall spectral eﬃciency and\
    \ coverage probability\ngains.\n1.4.1\nContributions\nIn this dissertation, the\
    \ following optimization techniques will be considered for\njoint optimization\
    \ of UABS locations and ICIC parameters of a AG-HetNet. The\n8\nperformance comparison\
    \ in terms of KPI and computational complexity gains is also\ndiscussed in detail.\n\
    •\nBrute-force technique is a lower complexity alternative to optimizing UABS\n\
    locations. We consider deploying the UABSs on a hexagonal grid, where the\npositions\
    \ of UABSs are deterministic and optimize the ICIC parameters of the\nAG-HetNet\
    \ using the brute-force.\n•\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) is a suitable meta-heuristic\

    The above works have been published in peer reviewed journal [36] and conference\n\

    \ Safety Networks\nThere have been relatively limited studies in the literature\
    \ on PSC that present a\ncomprehensive survey on public safety LMRS and LTE systems.\
    \ In [61], authors\npresent a discussion on voice over LTE as an important aspect\
    \ of PSC and then\nprovide a high-level overview of LMRS and LTE technologies\
    \ for their use in PSC\nscenario. In [62, 63], authors survey the status of various\
    \ wireless technologies in\npublic safety network (PSN), current regulatory standards,\
    \ and the research ac-\ntivities that address the challenges in PSC. The ability\
    \ of LTE to meet the PSN\nrequirements, and classifying possible future developments\
    \ to LTE that could en-\nhance its capacity to provide the PSC is discussed in\
    \ [64, 65].\nSome of the key references studied in Chapter 3, 4, and 5 related\
    \ to LMRS, LTE,\nSDR, and emerging PSC technologies are classiﬁed in Table 2.1\
    \ and Table 2.2, along\nwith possible research directions.\n2.2\nInterference\
    \ Coordination and Capacity Analysis of two-\ntier AG-HetNet\nLTE-based HetNets\
    \ are a well-researched topic, and numerous studies have been car-\nried to enhance\
    \ the network performance, improve coverage, and mitigate network\ninterference.\
    \ In [214], a fractional frequency reuse method is used to mitigate inter-\nference\
    \ in a ﬁxed HetNet, improve the indoor coverage, and maximize the network\nSE\
    \ by minimizing the UE’s outage probability to cell-edge UEs in an OFDMA-\n10\n\
    based LTE HetNet. However, [214] did not consider any of the 3GPP Release-10\n\
    and Release-11 ICIC techniques for ﬁxed HetNet deployments.\n3GPP Release-10 eICIC\
    \ and Release-11 FeICIC techniques have been studied in\n[58, 215, 216] for HetNets.\
    \ For example, [215] proposes algorithms that jointly opti-\nmizes the eICIC parameters,\
    \ UE cell association rules, and the spectrum resources\nshared between the macro\
    \ and ﬁxed small cells. Nevertheless, 3GPP Release-11 Fe-\nICIC technique for\
    \ better radio resource utilization and CRE for oﬄoading a larger\nnumber of UEs\
    \ to small cells was not considered in [215]. The eﬀectiveness of 3GPP\nRelease-10\
    \ and Release-11 ICIC techniques with ICIC parameter optimization have\nbeen studied\
    \ in [58], without considering any mobility for small cells.\nRecent advancements\
    \ in UAV technology has enabled the possibility of deploy-\ning small cells as\
    \ UABSs mounted with a communication system. UABSs such as\nballoons, quadcopters,\
    \ and gliders equipped with LTE-Advanced capabilities can be\nutilized to further\
    \ enhance the capabilities of LTE-based HetNets. The ability of\nUABSs to dynamically\
    \ reposition in a HetNet environment can improve the overall\nSE of the network\
    \ by ﬁlling the coverage gaps and oﬄoading UEs in high-traﬃc\nregions.\nHence,\
    \ it is of critical nature to optimize the locations of UABSs in a\nUAV-based\
    \ HetNet to optimize SE gains.\nRecent studies [217–222] are mainly focused on\
    \ ﬁnding an optimal location of\nUAVs in the geographical area of interest to\
    \ meet traﬃc demands. In [217–220],\nUAV location optimization have been explored;\
    \ however, inter-cell interference co-\nordination techniques are not explicitly\
    \ taken into account. Authors in [35, 150]\nexplore UABS-assisted LTE HetNets,\
    \ where the UABSs use CRE for oﬄoading\nusers from a macrocell but do not consider\
    \ any ICIC in the cell expanded region.\nTo maximize the 5pSE of the HetNet, a\
    \ brute force method is used to ﬁnd the opti-\n11\nmal UAV locations in [150],\
    \ while the genetic algorithm is used for optimizing UAV\nlocations in [35].\n\
    The eﬀect of interference in a UAV-based network is investigated in [223]. By\n\
    calculating the optimal distance between the two interfering UAVs, each UAV is\n\
    positioned at ﬁxed height to maximize the coverage area.\nHowever, this UAV-\n\
    based network is not designed for LTE-Advanced HetNets. A priority-based UE\n\
    oﬄoading and UE association with mobile small cells for PSC is studied in [224].\n\
    To improve the overall system throughput, 3GPP Release-10 eICIC and CRE is\ntaken\
    \ into account.\nHowever, using almost blank subframes (ABS) at an MBS\nresults\
    \ in under-utilization of radio resources when compared to the use of reduced\n\
    power FeICIC.\nThe use of 3GPP Release-10/11 inter-cell interference coordination\
    \ techniques\nin a two-tier LTE-Advanced AG-HetNet has not been adequately studied\
    \ in the\nliterature. The contribution of Chapter 6 is to address this challenge\
    \ of interference\nmitigation by using and optimizing FeICIC and CRE techniques\
    \ and at the same\ntime, optimize the UAV locations using the genetic algorithm\
    \ to achieve maximum\nSE.\n2.3\nHeuristics Approach used in Joint Optimization\
    \ of In-\nterference Coordination and UABS Locations in AG-\nHetNet\nThere have\
    \ been relatively limited studies in the literature that use heuristic tech-\n\
    niques for the joint optimization ICIC parameters and the UABS locations in the\n\
    AG-HetNet. The feasibility of deploying UAV as both UABS and AUEs with an\n12\n\
    existing LTE-Advanced terrestrial infrastructure and investigating the critical\
    \ as-\npects such as the inter-cell interference, channel modeling support, SE,\
    \ and coverage\nprobability is extended to cover both UABSs and AUEs as part of\
    \ the AG-HetNet\nis studied in Chapter 6 and 7. The speciﬁc contributions of our\
    \ work in the context\nof the existing literature is summarized in Table 2.3.\n\
    2.4\nInterference Coordination and Capacity and Coverage\nAnalysis of three-tier\
    \ AG-HetNet\nThe UABS-based communications and networking present research challenges\
    \ in the\nﬁeld of network planning, optimal 3D deployment, interference management,\
    \ perfor-\nmance characterization, handover management, and integrating a suitable\
    \ channel\nmodel. However, the existing literature has focused mostly on particular\
    \ aspects of\nUABS-based communications and not the air-ground HetNet (AG-HetNet)\
    \ system\nas a whole. In particular, [35, 217–220, 220–222, 225–228] have explored\
    \ UABS\nlocation optimization and deployment height, but key aspects such as inter-cell\
    \ in-\nterference coordination (ICIC) techniques and air-ground path loss model\
    \ are not\nexplicitly taken into account. The eﬀect of interference in a UABS-based\
    \ network is\ninvestigated in [223], by measuring the optimal distance between\
    \ the two interfer-\ning UABSs and positioning each UABS at a ﬁxed height to maximize\
    \ the coverage\narea. Whereas, in [214], a fractional frequency reuse method is\
    \ used to mitigate\ninterference in a ﬁxed HetNet, to improve the indoor coverage\
    \ and maximize the\nnetwork SE by minimizing the user equipment (UE) outage probability.\
    \ Moreover,\na priority-based UE oﬄoading and UE association with mobile small\
    \ cells for pub-\nlic safety communication (PSC) is studied in [224]. However,\
    \ [214, 223, 224] did\n13\nnot consider any of the 3GPP Rel-10 and Rel-11 ICIC\
    \ techniques for the HetNet\ndeployments.\nThe eﬀectiveness of 3GPP Rel-10 enhanced\
    \ ICIC (eICIC) and Rel-11 further-\nenhanced ICIC (FeICIC) techniques while taking\
    \ cell range expansion (CRE) into ac-\ncount has been studied in [36, 52, 58,\
    \ 215, 216] for LTE-Advanced HetNet. Authors\nin [215] propose algorithms that\
    \ jointly optimizes the eICIC parameters, UE cell\nassociation rules, and spectrum\
    \ resources shared between the macro base-stations\n(MBSs) and ﬁxed small cells.\
    \ However, in [215], the 3GPP Rel-11 FeICIC technique\nis not considered, which\
    \ provides better utilization of radio resources and can of-\nﬂoad a larger number\
    \ of UEs to small cells through CRE. The beneﬁts of 3GPP\nRel-10 and Rel-11 ICIC\
    \ techniques with CRE has been investigated in [58], but\nfor a terrestrial LTE-Advanced\
    \ HetNet. UABS-assisted LTE-Advanced HetNet has\nbeen explored in [36, 52], where\
    \ the UABSs uses CRE for oﬄoading users from a\nmacrocell while considering 3GPP\
    \ Rel-10 and Rel-11 ICIC techniques in the cell\nexpanded region. Furthermore,\
    \ a brute-force technique and heuristic algorithm is\nalso used to maximize the\
    \ spectral eﬃciency gains by optimizing UABS locations\nand ICIC network parameters.\
    \ However, the coverage probability of the wireless\nnetwork is not investigated,\
    \ and channel modeling designed for aerial vehicles is not\ntaken into account.\n\
    When AUEs are deployed as part of existing terrestrial infrastructure, they ex-\n\
    perience the same interference issues in the downlink and signal degradation due\n\
    to path loss. And to address these concerns, a relevant investigation is needed,\
    \ if\nAUEs has to coexist with LTE-Advanced HetNet eﬀectively. In particular,\
    \ AUEs\napplications for smart cities has been studied in [41, 43, 44], and the\
    \ IoT data are\ntransmitted into LTE base-station or via device-to-device multi-hop\
    \ communica-\ntions. However, the coexistence of AUEs with existing terrestrial\
    \ and aerial nodes is\n14\nnot considered. On the other hand, the coverage probability\
    \ of AG-HetNet serving\nAUEs is evaluated while considering appropriate aerial\
    \ propagation model in [234],\nbut does not consider 3GPP Rel-15 enhanced support\
    \ for aerial vehicles and the im-\npact of interference on the AUEs in AG-HetNet.\
    \ The eﬀectiveness of 3GPP Rel-15\nenhanced support for aerial vehicles, and the\
    \ interference mitigation to improve the\ndata capacity is investigated in [45,\
    \ 46], while the AUEs coexist in the AG-HetNet.\nNonetheless, the study does not\
    \ investigate 3GPP Rel-10/11 interference mitigation\ntechniques in the downlink\
    \ of the AUEs and the inﬂuence of CRE on AUEs while\nmitigating interference.\n\

    \ SAFETY NETWORKS\nEﬀective emergency and natural disaster management depend on\
    \ the eﬃcient\nmission-critical voice and data communication between ﬁrst responders\
    \ and victims.\nLMRS is a legacy narrowband technology used for critical voice\
    \ communications\nwith limited use for data applications. Recently LTE emerged\
    \ as a broadband com-\nmunication technology that has a potential to transform\
    \ the capabilities of public\nsafety technologies by providing broadband, ubiquitous,\
    \ and mission-critical voice\nand data support. For example, in the United States,\
    \ FirstNet is building a nation-\nwide coast-to-coast public safety network based\
    \ of LTE broadband technology. This\nchapter presents a comparative survey of\
    \ legacy and the LTE-based public safety\nnetworks, and discusses the LMRS-LTE\
    \ convergence as well as mission-critical push-\nto-talk over LTE. A simulation\

    \ potential for use in public safety networks are reviewed.\n3.1\nIntroduction\n\
    A PSN is a dedicated wireless network used by emergency services such as police,\n\
    ﬁre rescue, and emergency medical services (EMS). This network gives better sit-\n\
    uational awareness, quicker response time to the EFRs, and speed up the disaster\n\
    response. The scope of a PSN can span over a large geographical area, with vital\n\
    data ﬂowing into broadband wireless mesh network such as Wi-Fi and LTE. The\n\
    PSNs are also networked with mobile computing applications to improve the eﬃ-\n\
    ciency of the EFR and public well-being. In this chapter, we broadly classify\
    \ PSNs\n19\nFigure 3.1: An example for a LMRS network [1].\ninto two categories:\
    \ LMRS and broadband networks. APCO-25 and TETRA suite\nof standards falls under\
    \ LMRS network, while LTE-based broadband PSC network\nfalls under broadband network.\n\
    3.2\nLMRS Network\nLMRS is a wireless communication system intended for terrestrial\
    \ users comprised\nof portables and mobiles, such as two-way digital radios or\
    \ walkie-talkies. LMRS\nnetworks and equipment are being used in military, commercial,\
    \ and EFR applica-\ntions as shown in Fig. 3.1. The main goal of LMRS systems\
    \ are to provide mission\ncritical communications, to enable integrated voice\
    \ and data communications for\nemergency response, and to maintain ruggedness,\
    \ reliability, and interoperability.\nAPCO-25 and European Terrestrial Trunked\
    \ Radio (TETRA) are widely used\nsuite of standards for LMRS based digital radio\
    \ communications. APCO-25 also\nknown as Project 25 (P-25), and it is widely used\
    \ by federal, state/province, and\nlocal public safety agencies in North America.\
    \ The APCO-25 technology enables\npublic safety agencies enabling them to communicate\
    \ with other agencies and mu-\ntual aid response teams in emergencies. On the\
    \ other hand, TETRA fulﬁlls the\n20\nFigure 3.2: APCO-25 portable and mobile radios\

    However, these two standards are\nnot interoperable. Fig. 3.2 showcases some of\
    \ the available APCO-25 portable and\nmobile digital radios in the market, while\
    \ Fig. 3.3 showcases TETRA portable and\nmobile digital radios, procured from\
    \ the product sheet and websites of the respective\ncompanies.\n21\n3.2.1\nAPCO-25\n\
    Public safety radios have been upgraded from analog to digital since the 1990s\
    \ due\nto the limitations of analog transmission, and implement technological\
    \ advances by\nexpanding the capabilities of digital radio. Radios can communicate\
    \ in analog mode\nwith legacy radios, and in either digital or analog mode with\
    \ other APCO-25 ra-\ndios. Additionally, the deployment of APCO-25 compliant systems\
    \ will allow for a\nhigh degree of equipment interoperability and compatibility.\
    \ APCO-25 compliant\ntechnology has been deployed in three diﬀerent phases, where\
    \ advancements have\nbeen gradually introduced [235].\n1. In Phase 1, radio systems\
    \ operate in 12.5 KHz band analog, digital, or mixed\nmode. Phase 1 radios use\
    \ continuous 4-level frequency modulation (C4FM)\ntechnique, which is a non-linear\
    \ modulation for digital transmissions. C4FM is\na special type of 4FSK modulation\
    \ as explained in [95] and was developed for\nthe Telecommunications Industry\
    \ Association (TIA) 102 standard for digital\ntransmission in 12.5 KHz. C4FM results\
    \ in a bit rate of 9600 bits/s. Phase 1\nP25-compliant systems are backward compatible\
    \ and interoperable with legacy\nsystems. P25-compliant systems also provide an\
    \ open interface to the radio\nfrequency (RF) subsystem to facilitate interlinking\
    \ between diﬀerent vendor\nsystems.\n2. The goal of Phase 2 was to improve the\
    \ spectrum utilization. Phase 2 intro-\nduces a 2 -slot TDMA system which provides\
    \ two voice traﬃc channels in a\n12.5 KHz band allocation, and doubles the call\
    \ capacity. It also lays emphasis\non interoperability with legacy equipment,\
    \ interfacing between repeaters and\nother subsystems, roaming capacity, and spectral\
    \ eﬃciency/channel reuse.\n22\n3. Project MESA (Mobility for Emergency and Safety\
    \ Applications) is a collabo-\nration between the European Telecommunications\
    \ Standards Institute (ETSI)\nand the TIA to deﬁne a uniﬁed set of requirements\
    \ for APCO - 25 Phase\n3. Initial agreement for project MESA was ratiﬁed in year\
    \ 2000. Phase 3\nplanning activities address the need for high-speed data for\
    \ public-safety use\n[235]. Project MESA also aims to facilitate eﬀective, eﬃcient,\
    \ advanced spec-\niﬁcations, and applications that will address public safety\
    \ broadband commu-\nnication needs [236].\n3.2.2\nTETRA\nTETRA is a digital mobile\
    \ radio system, which is essentially conﬁned to layers 1-3\nof the OSI model.\
    \ The TETRA system is intended to operate in existing VHF\nand UHF professional\
    \ mobile radio frequencies [237], and it has been developed by\nthe European Telecommunications\
    \ Standards Institute (ETSI). The user needs and\ntechnological innovations have\
    \ led the TETRA standard to evolve with release 1\nand release 2 [237].\n1. Release\
    \ 1 is the original TETRA standard, which was known as TETRA\nV+D standard. Under\
    \ this release TETRA radio system supports three modes\nof operation which are\
    \ voice plus data (V+D), direct operation mode (DMO),\nand packet data optimized\
    \ (PDO) [238].\nThe V+D is the most commonly used mode, which allows switching\
    \ between\nvoice and data transmission. Voice and data can be transmitted on the\
    \ same\nchannel using diﬀerent slots. The main characteristics of V+D are: 1)\
    \ support\nfor independent multiple concurrent bearer services, 2) support for\
    \ transmitter\npreemption, 3) support for several grades of handover, 4) crossed\
    \ calls are\n23\nminimized by labeling an event on the air interface, 5) support\
    \ for slot stealing\nduring voice/data transmission, 6) support for diﬀerent simultaneous\
    \ access\npriorities [238].\nThe DMO, on the other hand, supports direct voice\
    \ and data transmission\nbetween the subscriber units without the base stations,\
    \ especially when the\nusers are in the outside coverage area. Calls in the DMO\
    \ can be either clear\nor encrypted, and full duplex radio communication is not\
    \ supported under\nDMO [239].\nAs a third mode of operation, the PDO standard\
    \ has been created for occa-\nsional data-only, to cater the demands for high\
    \ volume of data in near future.\nLocation based services and voice are necessary\
    \ for mission-critical communi-\ncations and need high volume of data, which can\
    \ be the beneﬁciaries of the\nPDO standard [239].\n2. Release 2 provided additional\
    \ functions and improvements to already exist-\ning functionality of TETRA. The\
    \ major enhancement provided by TETRA\nrelease 2 is TETRA enhanced data services,\
    \ which provides more ﬂexibility\nand greater levels of data capacity [88]. With\
    \ adaptive selection of modulation\nschemes, RF channel bandwidths, and coding\
    \ user bit rates can vary between\n10 Kbits/s to 500 Kbits/s.\nData rate plays\
    \ a important role in relaying mission-critical information during\nthe emergency\
    \ situation in timely manner. For example, an emergency sce-\nnario monitoring\
    \ a remote victim would require data rate to support real-time\nduplex voice/video\
    \ communication and telemetry. In such a mission-critical\nscenario, TETRA enhanced\
    \ data service would play an important role by sup-\nporting the applications\
    \ that need high data rate such as mulitmedia and\n24\nTable 3.1: Emerging wireless\

    \ which extended the range for\nair-ground-air services to 83 kilometers when\
    \ compared to 58 kilometers in\nTETRA release 1 [89].\n3.3\nLTE Broadband Network\n\
    LTE is a broadband technology that will allow high data rate applications that\n\
    are not possible to support with LMRS. LTE will enable unprecedented broad-\n\
    band service to public safety agencies and will bring the beneﬁts of lower costs,\n\
    consumer-driven economies of scale, and rapid evolution of advanced communica-\n\
    tion capabilities [13].\nThe Table 3.1 , showcases various potential wireless\
    \ communication standards,\nthat can be used for public safety broadband networks.\
    \ LTE standard, is developed\n25\nby the 3GPP as a 4G broadband mobile communication\
    \ technology.\nThe main\ngoal of LTE is to increase the capacity and high-speed\
    \ data over wireless data\nnetworks. The technological advances has brought LTE\
    \ to a performance level close\nto Shannon’s capacity bound [62]. Due to limited\
    \ code block length in LTE, full SNR\neﬃciency is not feasible. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ LTE performance is less than 1.6 dB - 2\ndB oﬀ from the Shannon capacity bound\
    \ as discussed in [240]. With steady increase\nof investment in broadband services,\
    \ the LTE technology is soon expected to become\nmost widely deployed broadband\
    \ communication technology ever. An LTE-based\nbroadband PSN, dedicated solely\
    \ for the use of PSC can deliver the much needed\nadvanced communication and data\
    \ capabilities. As an example for LTE-based PSN,\nwe brieﬂy study FirstNet deployment\
    \ in the United States in Section 3.6.\n3.4\nMajor Challenges in PSNs\nEven with\
    \ several technical advancements in PSN, there are major challenges that\ncan\
    \ hinder eﬃcient operation of EFR. For instance, during a large-scale disaster,\n\
    diﬀerent public safety organizations are bound to use diﬀerent communications\
    \ tech-\nnologies and infrastructure at the same time. This can cause major challenges\
    \ such\nas, network congestion, low data rates, interoperability problems, spectrum\
    \ scarcity,\nand security problems.\n3.4.1\nNetwork Congestion\nIn the case of\
    \ an emergency, network activity spikes up, causing traﬃc congestion\nin public\
    \ safety and commercial networks.\nMany EFR agencies using IP-based\nthe commercial\
    \ data services in case of emergency would result in a competition\nof air time\
    \ with the general public [87]. The probability of any natural or man-\n26\nmade\
    \ emergency can be assumed as a discrete random event. In case of such events,\n\
    providing reliable communication becomes critical. Therefore, ensuring that network\n\
    congestion will not happen in public safety networks during emergency situations\n\
    is becoming increasingly more important. Emerging technologies such as licensed\n\
    assisted access (LAA) of LTE to the unlicensed bands, small cells, and UAVs can\
    \ be\nused as supplementary solutions during emergency situations to reduce the\
    \ impact\nof network congestion [179–181]. Furthermore, addressing the open challenges\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld of mmWave, massive MIMO, and vehicular network system can further\n\
    help to lower the network congestion. Nevertheless, eﬀective mitigation of network\n\
    congestion problems during emergency situations remains an open issue.\n3.4.2\n\
    Maintaining Ubiquitous Throughput and Connectiv-\nity\nThe data rate plays a critical\
    \ role in relaying the information (i.e., voice and data)\nduring the emergency\
    \ situation in a timely manner. For example, an emergency\nscenario monitoring\
    \ a remote victim would require data rate to support real-time\nduplex voice/video\
    \ communication, telemetry, and so forth. Another example need-\ning a real-time\
    \ situational awareness is during ﬁres for ﬁreﬁghters, through the use of\nstreaming\
    \ video and mission critical voice/data. These examples of mission-critical\n\
    scenarios as per [24] would need higher data rates and require broadband allocation\n\
    of spectrum. Lower data rate limits the usage of data applications, such as mul-\n\
    timedia services which have a great potential to improve the eﬃciency of disaster\n\
    recovery operations [92, 241]. The traditional public safety systems was designed\n\
    to provide better coverage, mission-critical voice, but not peak data capacity.\
    \ With\nthe advent of 3GPP speciﬁcations, the data rates have been steadily increasing\n\
    27\nand will help in enhancing the capabilities of PSC systems. These data rates\
    \ can\nbe further increased by making technologies such as mmWave and massive\
    \ MIMO\ncommercially available. However, 3GPP systems deliver less coverage area\
    \ when\ncompared to LMRS. Furthermore, they can also experience relatively low\
    \ data rates\nand dropped communications at the cell-edge. The coverage and fringe\
    \ condition in\nLTE-based PSN can be addressed by the deployment of UAVs or vehicular\
    \ network\nsystem to set up a small cell or virtual cell site. Regardless of the\
    \ advancements in\nPSC, maintaining ubiquitously high throughput and connectivity\
    \ during the emer-\ngency situation is still a challenge.\n3.4.3\nInteroperability\n\
    Traditionally, interoperability of a radio network means coordinating operating\
    \ pa-\nrameters and pre-deﬁned procedures between the intended operators in the\
    \ network.\nAs discussed in [85], the interoperability failure that occurred during\
    \ the September\n11, 2001 incident was due to the presence of various independent\
    \ public safety agen-\ncies, which resulted in entanglement of systems that were\
    \ not interoperable. This\nled to communication failures between various EFRs,\
    \ and posed a risk to public\nlives. A possible solution for avoiding any potential\
    \ interoperability issue includes\nEFR carrying multiple devices to be eﬀective,\
    \ which is an expensive strategy and an\nineﬃcient use of spectrum resources.\
    \ Alternatively, communication infrastructure\nand policies can be evolved for\
    \ EFR which is a more eﬃcient approach. As per [86],\nFCC is taking steps in resolving\
    \ the lack of interoperability in 700 MHz band in a\ncost-eﬀective manner by leveraging\
    \ on commercial technologies and infrastructure.\n28\n3.5\nCase Study: Public\
    \ Safety Spectrum Allocation in the\nUnited States\nPublic safety operations can\
    \ be classiﬁed mainly based on the applications and usage\nscenarios, such as\
    \ mission-critical, military, transportation, utilities, and corpora-\ntions with\
    \ large geographical footprint. In this section, we provide a comprehensive\n\
    overview of VHF, UHF, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, and 4.9 GHz public safety\nband\
    \ plans and spectrum allocation in the United States. The Federal Communi-\ncations\
    \ Commission (FCC) in the United States is a regulatory body for regulating\n\
    communication by radios, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The FCC has taken\n\
    steps to ensure that 911 and other critical communication remain operational when\n\
    a disaster strikes. A major goal of FCC is to enable an operable and interoper-\n\
    able public safety communications (PSC) system in narrowband and broadband\nspectrum\
    \ [8].\n3.5.1\n700 MHz Public Safety Spectrum\nThe 700 MHz spectrum auction by\
    \ FCC is oﬃcially know as Auction 73 [71]. The\nsignals in 700 MHz spectrum travel\
    \ longer distances than other typical cellular\nbands, and penetrate well. Therefore\
    \ the 700 MHz band is an appealing spectrum\nto build systems for both commercial\
    \ and PSN networks.\nFig. 3.4a, Fig. 3.4b,\nFig. 3.5, and along with Table 3.2\
    \ depict the spectrum allocated in the 700 MHz\nband in the United States. The\
    \ lower 700 MHz range covers channels (CH) 52-\n59 and 698-746 MHz frequency,\
    \ while the upper 700 MHz range covers CH 60-69\nand 746-806 MHz frequency. The\
    \ 3GPP standards have created four diﬀerent band\nclasses within 700 MHz band,\
    \ i.e., band class 12, 13, 14, and 17.\n29\n(a) 700 MHz lower band plan.\nBands\

    \ allocated to\nPSN in the 700 MHz band as shown in Fig. 2. Green color blocks\

    \ in orange color blocks ranging from 769 MHz to\n775 MHz and 799 MHz to 805 MHz.\
    \ This part of 700 MHz public safety band\nis available for local public safety\
    \ entity for voice communication. Guard bands\n(GB) of 1 MHz are placed between\
    \ broadband, narrowband and commercial carrier\nspectrum to prevent any interference.\
    \ A part of the 700 MHz public safety nar-\nrowband spectrum is also available\
    \ for nationwide interoperable communications.\nIn particular, interoperability\
    \ is required to enable diﬀerent governmental agencies\nto communicate across\
    \ jurisdictions and with each other, and it is administered at\nstate level by\
    \ an executive agency [243].\nThe deployment strategy of EFR varies depending\
    \ on the magnitude of the emer-\ngency. As the emergency grows, the demand for\
    \ additional tactical channels would\ngrow too. These tactical channels would\
    \ render necessary short-range communi-\ncations at the emergency scene, without\
    \ taxing the main dispatch channels. This\nimplies the need for additional bandwidth\
    \ allocation to EFR. However, before re-\nallocation of D block, there was none\
    \ to little bandwidth available for PSC in 700\nMHz spectrum. The only option\
    \ for the EFR would be to use commercial network\nfor PSC. However, commercial\
    \ networks are not fully capable of mission-critical\n31\nFigure 3.6: Current\
    \ 800 MHz band plan for public safety services [9], [10].\ncommunication. Therefore,\
    \ the full allocation of D Block i.e., 20 MHz of 700 MHz\nwas critical to public\
    \ safety [72]. With reallocation of the D Block to public safety,\nLTE-based PSN\
    \ in the 700 MHz would be beneﬁcial to both commercial and PSN.\nConversely, the\
    \ interoperability and roaming between a commercial and PSN during\nthe emergencies\
    \ without seriously compromising quality of service for commercial\nusers is an\
    \ ongoing discussion [73].\n3.5.2\n800 MHz Public Safety Spectrum\nThe 800 MHz\
    \ public safety band is currently conﬁgured as illustrated in Fig. 3.6. It\nhouses\
    \ public safety spectrum allocation, commercial wireless carriers, and private\n\
    radio systems. National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee (NPSPAC)\nhas\
    \ come up with guidelines for 800 MHz band and has uplink channels allocated in\n\
    806 MHz - 809 MHz and downlink in 851 MHz - 854 MHz. Various regional public\n\
    safety planning committees administer 800 MHz NPSPAC spectrum. Specialized\nmobile\
    \ radio (SMR) and enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR) can be either\nanalog\
    \ or digital trunked two-way radio system. SMR channels are allocated in\n809\
    \ MHz - 815 MHz and downlink in 854 MHz - 860 MHz. Expansion band (EB)\nand GB\
    \ are of 1 MHz each, which are allocated between 815 MHz - 817 MHz. The\n32\n\
    Figure 3.7: SMR, industrial, scientiﬁc and medical (ISM), paging, and ﬁxed mi-\n\
    crowave are the radio bands in 900 MHz spectrum plan [10], [11].\nESMR channels\
    \ are allocated in the 817 MHz - 824 MHz uplink and 862 MHz - 869\nMHz for the\
    \ downlink [9], [10].\n3.5.3\n900 MHz Public Safety Spectrum\nThe FCC allows utilities\
    \ and other commercial entities to ﬁle licenses in 900 MHz\nbusiness and industrial\
    \ land transport (B/ILT) and the 900 MHz spectrum band\nplan is shown in Fig.\
    \ 3.7.\nThe new licenses in the 900 MHz B/ILT band are\nnow allowed on a site-by-site\
    \ basis for base mobile operator for various commer-\ncial (manufacturing, utility,\
    \ and transportation) and non-commercial (medical, and\neducational) activities\
    \ [8], [76].\n3.5.4\nVHF and UHF Public Safety Spectrum\nAll public safety and\
    \ business industrial LMRS are narrowbands and operate us-\ning 12.5 KHz technology\
    \ [8]. The operating frequencies for VHF low band ranges\nbetween 25 MHz - 50\
    \ MHz, VHF high band between 150 MHz - 174 MHz, and\nUHF band between 421 MHz\
    \ - 512 MHz [8]. Licensees in the private land mobile\nVHF and UHF bands have\

    \ has mandated that all existing licenses in VHF and\nUHF bands must operate on\
    \ 12.5 KHz channel bandwidth. Narrowbanding of VHF\n33\nand UHF bands has ensured\
    \ channel availability, and creation of additional channel\ncapacity within the\
    \ same radio spectrum. Narrowbanding will result in eﬃcient use\nof spectrum,\
    \ better spectrum access for public safety and non-public safety users,\nand support\
    \ more users [76–78].\nPreviously, the frequencies from 470 MHz - 512 MHz were\
    \ designated as UHF-TV\nsharing frequencies and were available in certain limited\
    \ areas of the United States.\nPublic safety in urbanized area such as Boston\
    \ (MA), Chicago (IL), Cleveland (OH),\nDallas/Fort Worth (TX), Detroit (MI), Houston\
    \ (TX), Los Angeles (CA), Miami\n(FL), New York (NY), Philadelphia (PA), San Francisco/Oakland\
    \ (CA), and Wash-\nington DC were allowed to share UHF-TV frequencies and were\
    \ governed by FCC\nrules 90.301 through 90.317. However, as of February 22, 2012\
    \ legislation was en-\nacted to reallocate spectrum in the D Block within the\
    \ 700 MHz band for public\nsafety broadband operation. The legislative act prompted\
    \ FCC to impose a freeze on\nnew T-Band licenses or any modiﬁcations to existing\
    \ licenses. Furthermore, public\nsafety operation is needed to vacate the T-Band\
    \ spectrum by the year 2023 [81].\n3.5.5\n4.9 GHz Public Safety Spectrum\nIn year\
    \ 2002, FCC allocated 50 MHz of spectrum in the 4940 MHz - 4990 MHz\nband (i.e.,\

    \ operating in the 700 MHz band [74].\n36\n3.6.1\nFirstNet Architecture\nAs per\
    \ [13], Fig. 3.8 shows the proposed FirstNet architecture. The FirstNet is a\n\
    LTE-based broadband network dedicated to public safety services. Core features\n\
    of FirstNet will include direct communication mode, push-to-talk (PTT), full du-\n\
    plex voice system, group calls, talker identiﬁcation, emergency alerting, and\
    \ audio\nquality. Band class 14 (D Block and Public Safety Block) shown in Fig.\
    \ 3.5 is the\ndedicated band and will be used by FirstNet PSN [98]. The FirstNet\
    \ is composed of\ndistributed core, terrestrial mobile system, mobile satellite\
    \ system, and deployable\nsystems. Distributed core consists of an evolved packet\
    \ core (EPC) network and\na service delivery platform to provide various services\
    \ to end users such as EFR.\nThe terrestrial mobile system comprises terrestrial\
    \ based communication, while mo-\nbile satellite system will use a satellite communication\
    \ link to communicate with\ndistributed core network for services. Deployable\
    \ systems are cells on wheels, pro-\nviding services in network congestion areas\
    \ or ﬁlling coverage holes.\nIn [172], FirstNet vehicular PSNs were divided into\
    \ 5 categories: vehicle network\nsystem (VNS), cells on light trucks (COLTS),\
    \ cells on wheels (COW), system on\nwheels (SOW), and deployable aerial communications\
    \ architecture (DACA). These\ndiﬀerent vehicular FirstNet PSN systems are expected\
    \ to play a signiﬁcant role in\nproviding coverage extension for NPSBN deployment.\
    \ Thus, these deployments will\ndeliver greater coverage, capacity, connectivity,\
    \ and ﬂexibility in regions which are\noutside of terrestrial coverage, or where\
    \ traditional coverage become unavailable due\nto a natural or man-made disaster\
    \ [61, 65]. Table 3.4 discusses the characteristics\nof the ﬁve diﬀerent vehicular\
    \ PSN architectures in FirstNet.\nAs per [13], FirstNet broadly deﬁnes LTE network\
    \ in distinct layers: Core net-\nwork, transport backhaul, radio access network\
    \ (RAN) and public safety devices as\nseen in Fig. 3.9. Public safety devices\
    \ can be smartphones, laptops, tablets or any\n37\nFigure 3.9: LTE band class\
    \ 14 architecture for FirstNet [13].\nother LTE-based user equipment. RAN implements\
    \ radio access technology, which\nconceptually resides between public safety devices\
    \ and provides a connection to its\nCN. The transport backhaul comprises intermediate\
    \ CN and subnetworks, wherein\nCN is the central part of a telecommunication network\
    \ that provides various services\nto public safety devices across access network.\n\
    The band class 14 communication will be based on the LTE commercial stan-\ndards\
    \ and is solely dedicated to PSC in North America region. Table 3.5 shows the\n\
    available downlink and uplink frequencies and the E-UTRA Absolute Radio Fre-\n\
    quency Channel Number (Earfcn) for a band class 14 system. As per 3GPP spec-\n\
    iﬁcations, the carrier frequency is speciﬁed by an absolute radio-frequency channel\n\
    number (ARFCN). The Earfcn is a designated code pair for physical radio carrier\n\
    for both transmission and reception of the LTE system i.e., one Earfcn for the\
    \ uplink\nand one for the downlink. The Earfcn also reﬂects the center frequency\
    \ of an LTE\ncarriers, and falls within range of 0 to 65535. The bandwidth allocated\
    \ for band\nclass 14 is 10 MHz.\n38\nTable 3.5: Band class 14 parameters.\nDownlink\

    LMRS and LTE Convergence\nSince data is just as important as voice in PSC scenario,\
    \ mission-critical voice and\ndata communication together can deliver the much\
    \ required reliable intelligence and\nsupport to EFR during any emergency [119].\
    \ For example, in the United States,\nFCC has been taking steps to achieve this\
    \ LMRS-LTE convergence by setting various\npolicies and a framework for a NPSBN.\
    \ A private network like NPSBN would include\nFirstNet (a single licensed operator),\
    \ 700 MHz band class 14 (single frequency band),\nand LTE (a common operating\
    \ technology). With large investment in LMRS over\nthe last decade or so, LMRS\
    \ has gained a national footprint in the United States\n[75]. During this time\
    \ the United States has relied on LMRS technology to provide\nmission critical\
    \ communication to the EFR. LTE deployments for replacing 2G and\n3G infrastructure\
    \ had no issues in relative measures, whereas the integration of LTE\nwith LMRS\
    \ is going to be a challenging task. As the complete roll out of the NPSBN\nby\
    \ FirstNet would take few years to meet all mission-critical EFR requirements,\
    \ it\nis inevitable for LMRS and LTE to coexist for some time in the near future.\n\
    There are many deployment models available today for converging LMRS and\nLTE\
    \ in PSC. This includes the combination of mission-critical radios on PSN, broad-\n\
    band devices on dedicated broadband networks, and consumer grade devices on com-\n\
    mercial carriers. The major challenges would be 1) providing an eﬃcient end-user\n\
    experience to EFR using a multitude of diﬀerent device, networks, and infrastructure\n\
    39\nFigure 3.10: VIDA from Harris Corporation is a converge platform that integrates\n\
    legacy and broadband PSC into a core network [14].\nand 2) sharing mission-critical\
    \ information regardless of device or network, without\ncompromising security.\n\
    As a step towards the next generation public safety networks, Motorola Solu-\n\
    tions has envisioned LMRS taking advantage of public and private LTE broadband\n\
    networks. APX7000L, as shown in Fig. 6(b), is a portable APCO-25 digital ra-\n\
    dio converged with LTE data capabilities in a public-safety-grade LMR handheld\n\
    device [2]. In order to have a seamless transition between LMRS and broadband\n\
    networks, Motorola VALR mission critical architecture is utilized [120]. Harris\
    \ Cor-\nporation’s VIDA mission-critical platform provides an ability to support\
    \ narrowband\nand broadband PSC technologies [14] as illustrated in Fig. 3.10.\
    \ Similarly, Ether-\nstack’s LTE25 solution bridges LTE with existing APCO-25\
    \ narrowband networks\nwith integrated push-to-talk solutions and interoperability\
    \ in multi-vendor APCO-\n25/LTE networks [244].\nThese developments build ﬂexibly\
    \ on technological ad-\nvances, without compromising requirements, security, and\
    \ coverage need for mission-\ncritical communication. The converged solutions\
    \ and frameworks have a common\ngoal to provide mission-critical solutions, location\
    \ services, and priority/emergency\ncall support.\n40\nThese devices, solutions,\
    \ and frameworks would provide EFR, the most need con-\ntinuous connection to\
    \ mission-critical voice, and data communications, and would be\na ﬁrst step in\
    \ providing a necessary infrastructure for NPSBN. The LMRS and LTE\nboth have\
    \ individual strengths, and their convergence would result in a nationwide\nPSN\
    \ and therefore enable a better collaboration amongst EFR, interoperability, data\n\
    capability, security, robust coverage, and provide mission critical communications.\n\
    3.8\nMission-Critical PTT over LTE\nThe main goal of mission-critical voice is\
    \ to enable reliable communication between\nvarious EFR. The essential attributes\
    \ of mission -critical voice is to enable fast-call\nsetup and group communication\
    \ amongst the EFR, push-to-talk for various group\ntalks, high audio quality,\
    \ emergency alerting, and support secure/encrypted voice\ncommunication.\nThe\
    \ mission -critical encryption uses data encryption standard\n(DES) and advanced\
    \ encryption standard (AES) for over-the-air-rekeying applica-\ntion [108, 113].\
    \ To support mission-critical voice, LTE needs to incorporate all the\nessential\
    \ attributes mentioned in this section. The objective of mission-critical PTT\n\
    over LTE would be to emulate the functions by LMRS.\nThe 3GPP group is actively\
    \ working to produce technical enhancement for LTE\nthat support public safety\
    \ applications. The main objective of 3GPP is to protect\nthe quality of LTE while\
    \ including the features needed for public safety. In LTE\nRelease 12, 3GPP has\
    \ focused on two main areas to address public safety applica-\ntions. These focus\
    \ areas include proximity services (ProSe) that enable optimized\ncommunication\
    \ between the mobiles in physical proximity and group call system\nthat support\
    \ operations such as one-to-many calling and dispatcher services which\nenable\
    \ eﬃcient and dynamic group communication [15].\n41\nPath (a) in Fig. 3.11 shows\
    \ the current conventional LTE communication whereas\na network assisted discovery\
    \ of users in close physical proximity is shown in Fig. 3.11\npath (c). The direct\
    \ communication, between these users with or without the super-\nvision of the\
    \ network is illustrated in Fig. 3.11 as path (b). In direct communication\na\
    \ radio can establish a communication link between the mobile users without going\n\
    through a network, thus saving network resources and also enable mission-critical\n\
    communication amongst the EFR even outside the network coverage [15, 111, 112].\n\
    Figure 3.11: Proximity service examples as proposed in 3GPP LTE Release 12[15].\n\
    Path (a) shows current conventional LTE communication path, (b) shows direct\n\
    communication with proximity services and (c) shows locally routed communication\n\
    with proximity services.\nThe requirement deﬁnitions of mission-critical PTT over\
    \ LTE are ongoing and\nwill be ﬁnalized in LTE Release 13, which will enhance\
    \ the D2D/ProSe framework\nstandardized in Release 12 and support more advanced\
    \ ProSe for public safety appli-\ncations [110, 117, 118]. Release 12 added basic\
    \ discovery and group communications\nfunctionality speciﬁc to D2D/ProSe. ProSe\
    \ direct discovery, ProSe UE-to-network\nrelay, ProSe UE-to-UE relay, and group\
    \ communication among members via net-\nwork, and a ProSe UE-to-network relay\
    \ for public safety application will be included\nas part of Release 13 [117].\
    \ Isolated E-UTRAN operation for public safety is an an-\nother public safety\
    \ feature included in Release 13 speciﬁcations. It would support\nlocally routed\
    \ communications in E-UTRAN for nomadic eNodeBs operating with-\nout a backhaul\
    \ for critical communication [117], as shown in Fig. 3.11.\n42\n3.9\nComparison\
    \ of LMRS and LTE PSC\nThe LMRS technology has been widely used in PSC for over\
    \ a decade with signiﬁ-\ncant technological advancements. On the other hand, with\
    \ the emerging of the LTE\npush-to-talk technology, focus has been shifting towards\
    \ high speed low latency LTE\ntechnology. With various advancements in commercial\
    \ networks, it can be another\npossible viable solution for PSC. Consider an emergency\
    \ scenario, where diﬀerent\npublic safety organization using diﬀerent communications\
    \ technologies arrive at the\nincident scene. As shown in Fig. 1.1, these public\
    \ safety organizations can be us-\ning diﬀerent types of PSNs. In particular,\
    \ the PSN deployed in the United States\nis a mixture of LMRS, FirstNet, and commercial\
    \ networks. The LMRS provides\npush-to-talk mission critical voice capability\
    \ over narrowband, with restricted data\nrates for voice/data services.\nHowever,\
    \ LMRS has a wide area coverage, which\ncan be achieved through the deployment\
    \ of high-power base stations and handsets,\nportable base stations, repeaters,\
    \ and/or peer-to-peer communication [107]. First-\nNet provides high-speed network\
    \ and can transform EFR capabilities with real-time\nupdates.\nEFR can still rely\
    \ on LMRS for mission-critical voice communication\nalongside FirstNet for high-speed\
    \ data.\n3.9.1\nNetwork Architecture\nCommercial networks are IP-based technologies\
    \ such as 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi. These\ntechnologies need adequate signal coverage and\
    \ network scaling to support PSC ser-\nvices between EFR and victims. Due to existing\
    \ commercial infrastructure, these\nnetworks are beneﬁcial for providing PSC services.\
    \ However, commercial networks\nare vulnerable to network congestion due to higher\
    \ intensity of inbound and out-\nbound communication at the incident scene by\
    \ the public safety organizations and\n43\nFigure 3.12: System level representation\
    \ of the LMRS and the LTE networks for\nPSC.\nFigure 3.13: APCO-25 channel conﬁguration.\n\
    victims. Such vulnerability can result in disrupted communications services and\n\
    bring harm to victims.\nSystem level block representation of the LMRS and LTE\
    \ system are as shown\nin Fig. 3.12. The LMRS comprises of a mobile/portable subscriber\
    \ units, repeater\nor a base station which is connected to an RF subsystem and\
    \ then to a customer\nenterprise network. On other hand the LTE system includes\
    \ user equipment (UE),\neNodeB, and EPC which is connected to external Network.\
    \ EPC, also known as sys-\ntem architecture evolution (SAE), may also contain\
    \ several nodes. Key components\nof EPC are mobility management entity (MME),\
    \ serving gateway (SGW), public\ndata network gateway (PGW), and policy and charging\
    \ rules function (PCRF).\n44\n(a) LTE frame structure.\n(b) LTE channel conﬁguration.\n\
    Each block\nrepresents a RB, an UE can be scheduled in\none or more RBs. LTE FirstNet\
    \ gives more\nﬂexibility in scheduling users to their best\nchannels, and hence\
    \ enables better QoS.\nFigure 3.14: LTE channel conﬁguration.\n3.9.2\nChannel\
    \ Conﬁguration and Frame Structure\nChannel conﬁguration for the LMRS is shown\
    \ in Fig. 3.13. In an LMRS the sup-\nported bandwidth are 6.25 KHz, 12.5 KHz,\
    \ and 30 KHz, wherein 12.5 KHz is the\n45\nstandard bandwidth. The separation\
    \ between two channels is usually 250 KHz or\nhigher. The talkgroups channel assigned\
    \ during a transmission can last for a du-\nration between 2 to 5 seconds. The\
    \ data channel has bandwidth of 12.5 KHz and\nis FDMA and/or TDMA channel. The\
    \ data channel is designed with an aim to\nprovide functionality like over the\
    \ air rekeying, mission-critical voice etc,. On the\nother hand, the control channel\
    \ is used solely for resource control. The main task\nfor control channel is to\
    \ allocate resources, digital communication message bearer,\nand message handler\
    \ between RF subsystem and SU. The APCO-25 control channel\nuses C4FM modulation\
    \ scheme and supports a baud rate of 9600 bits/s [96].\nThe LTE frame structure\
    \ as seen in Fig. 3.14a, has one radio frame of 10 ms\nduration, 1 sub-frame 1\
    \ ms duration, and 1 slot of 0.5 ms duration.\nEach slot\ncomprises of 7 OFDM\
    \ symbols. The LTE UL and DL transmission is scheduled by\nresource blocks (RB).\
    \ Each resource block is one slot of duration 0.5 ms, or 180 KHz,\nand composed\
    \ of 12 sub-carriers. Furthermore, one RB is made up of one slot in\nthe time\
    \ domain and 12 sub-carriers in the frequency domain. The smallest deﬁned\nunit\
    \ is a resource element, which consists of one OFDM subcarrier. Each UE can be\n\
    scheduled in one or more RBs as shown in Fig. 3.14b. The control channel in LTE\
    \ is\nprovided to support eﬃcient data transmission, and convey physical layer\
    \ messages.\nLTE is provided with three DL physical control channels, i.e., physical\
    \ control format\nindicator channel, physical HARQ indicator channel, and physical\
    \ downlink control\nchannel.\nPhysical uplink control channel is used by UE in\
    \ UL transmission to\ntransmit necessary control signals only in subframes in\
    \ which UE has not been\nallocated any RBs for the physical uplink shared channel\
    \ transmission. Physical\ndownlink shared channel, physical broadcast channel,\
    \ and physical multicast channel\nare the DL data channels, whereas physical uplink\
    \ shared channel and physical\nrandom access channel are the UL data channels.\n\

    \ standardized by the 3GPP in 2008, and has been evolving\nsince then. In response\
    \ to growing commercial market demands, LTE-Advanced\nwas speciﬁed as 3GPP Release\
    \ 10. 3GPP has developed Release 11 and Release\n12 with the aim of extending\
    \ the functionality and raise the performance of LTE-\nAdvanced [248]. With a\
    \ vision of 2020, currently LTE has become the target plat-\nform for machine-to-machine\
    \ communications, PSC, and device-to-device services\n[249].\nSince the deployment\
    \ of LTE, 4G is reaching its maturity and relatively\nincremental improvements\
    \ are to be expected. The 5G technology is expected to\nhave fundamental technological\
    \ components that will transform the capabilities of\nbroadband networks [250].\
    \ For example, full-ﬂedged eﬀorts from researchers at the\nUniversity of Surrey’s\
    \ 5G Innovation Centre managed to attain one terabit per sec-\nond (Tbps) of data\
    \ speed [251]. The three big technologies described in [250] that\nwill be shaping\
    \ 5G are ultra-densiﬁcation of base station deployments, millimeter\nwave (mmWave)\
    \ communications, and massive MIMO.\nThis section of paper is an attempt to emphasize\
    \ the potential of the techno-\nlogical advancement achieved through LTE, LTE-Advanced,\
    \ and 5G for transform-\ning the PSC capabilities. In particular, use of eMBMS,\
    \ millimeter wave, massive\nMIMO techniques, small cells, unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), LTE-based V2X,\nunlicensed operation of LTE in the context of PSC, cognitive\
    \ radio, wireless sensor\nnetworks, internet of things, and cybersecurity for\
    \ PSN will be reviewed.\n48\n3.10.1\nMultimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS)\n\
    Figure 3.15: In a single frequency network, base stations transmit the same signal\n\
    at the same time and over the same frequency channel to UE. In this example\n\
    MBSFN area, the group of cells perform synchronized eMBMS transmission. These\n\
    transmitted signals appear as multipath components to the UE.\nThe MBMS is a point-to-point\
    \ interface speciﬁcation for upcoming 3GPP cellu-\nlar networks [130, 133, 134].\
    \ The MBMS is designed to provide eﬃcient delivery of\nbroadcast and multicast\
    \ services with a cell and core network. Broadcast transmis-\nsion across multiple\
    \ cells is via single-frequency network conﬁguration. The MBMS\nfeature can be\
    \ divided into the MBMS Bearer Service and the MBMS User Service\n[133, 134].\
    \ Support for evolved MBMS (eMBMS) will be also included in Release\n13, which\
    \ has important applications for PSC. The eMBMS is designed to improve\nthe eﬃciency\
    \ of legacy MBMS. The LTE technology is backward compatible with\nlegacy 3G MBMS\
    \ and supports new features of the broadcast networks such as\ndigital video broadcast-terrestrial\
    \ networks.\nThe eMBMS is a point-to-multipoint interface where multiple LTE cells\
    \ can\nbe grouped into Multicast/Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and\
    \ all\nof the cells in an MBSFN will simulcast the same information for each bearer\
    \ as\nshown in Fig. 3.15. The eMBMS broadcast bearers provide advantages of unlimited\n\
    group sizes within a cell, better cell edge performance due to simulcast, and\
    \ is\nindependent of the talkgroups size. The eMBMS would provide PSC services\
    \ with\n49\nan ability to use a single set of resources for the traﬃc destined\
    \ to multiple public\nsafety devices. The public safety eMBMS broadcast applications\
    \ would be group\ncalls, PTT, real-time emergency video broadcast, surveillance\
    \ video broadcast, and\nnon-real-time multimedia services. The eMBMS broadcast\
    \ coverage improvement\nwould be similar to that of LMRS simulcast[131, 132].\n\
    3.10.2\nMillimeter Wave (mmWave)\nThe severe spectrum shortage in conventional\
    \ cellular bands has attracted attention\ntowards mmWave frequencies that occupy\
    \ the frequency spectrum for 30 GHz to\n300 GHz. It is also considered as a possible\
    \ candidate from next-generation small-\ncellular networks [135, 142]. The availability\
    \ of huge bandwidth in the mmWave\nspectrum can alleviate the concerns of wireless\
    \ traﬃc congestion which is observed\nin conventional cellular networks [139,\
    \ 252]. The mmWave transceivers can cover\nup to about a kilometer communication\
    \ range in some scenarios [252]. Moreover,\ndensely laid out mmWave small cells\
    \ in congested areas can expand the data capacity\nand provide a backhaul alternative\
    \ to cable [136]. The mmWave’s ability opens up\npossibilities for new indoor\
    \ and outdoor wireless services [135].\nHowever, the key limitation of the mmWave\
    \ technology is its limited range,\ndue to the excessively absorbed or scattered\
    \ signal by the atmosphere, rain, and\nvegetation. This limitation causes the\
    \ mmWave signals to suﬀer very high signal\nattenuation, and to have reduced transmission\
    \ distance. The researchers and sci-\nentists have overcome this loss with good\
    \ receiver sensitivity, high transmit power,\nbeamforming, and high antenna gains\
    \ [135–138, 141, 142, 252, 253].\nA possible solution for extending the mmWave\
    \ range is proposed in [140]. Due\nto limited propagation range of mmWave, a reliable\
    \ communication over mmWave\n50\nrequires a substantial number of access points.\
    \ The authors discuss the transmission\nof radio frequency signals between the\
    \ mmWave small cell base stations and radio\naccess points using optical ﬁbers\
    \ to increase the coverage. This radio over ﬁber\ncommunication is possible by\
    \ applying advanced optical upconversion techniques.\nIn [141], various beamforming\
    \ techniques are introduced for indoor mmWave com-\nmunication.\nA well augmented\
    \ mmWave system can position itself as a reasonable solution for\nPSC needs, by\
    \ addressing the concerns and requirements such as network congestion\nand high\
    \ data rates. A densely populated mmWave small-cell networks can also\naddress\
    \ the coverage needs during emergency situations.\n3.10.3\nMassive MIMO\nMIMO\
    \ is an antenna technology that can be used to reduce communication errors\nand\
    \ scale the capacity of a radio link using multiple transmit and receive antennas.\n\
    Recently massive MIMO is an emerging technology that uses large number of service\n\
    antennas when compared to current MIMO technology [148]. Since the introduction\n\
    of massive MIMO in [144], some researchers have shifted focus on solving related\n\
    traditional problems [143, 145–148].\nMassive Massive MIMO is typically considered\
    \ in time-division duplex systems\nto exploit channel reciprocity since it eliminates\
    \ the need for channel feedback\n[147, 254]. However, the massive MIMO system\
    \ is limited by pilot contamination,\nwhich is an impairment that is observed\
    \ during channel estimation stage in TDD\nnetworks. The pilot contamination is\
    \ caused due to the non-orthogonal nature trans-\nmission of pilots from neighboring\
    \ cells [147, 254]. Nevertheless, the eﬀects of pilot\n51\ncontamination can be\
    \ reduced by using mitigation techniques such as pilot-based\nand subspace-based\
    \ estimation approaches [147].\nOverall, massive MIMO can provide beneﬁts such\
    \ as 100× radiated energy eﬃ-\nciency, 10× capacity increase over traditional\
    \ MIMO, extensive use of inexpensive\nlow-power components, reduced latency, simpliﬁcation\
    \ of the medium access control,\nspectrum eﬃciency, reliability, and robustness\
    \ [146–148].\nMassive MIMO can be used for achieving high throughput communications\
    \ in an\nemergency situation. For example, real-time situational awareness via\
    \ high deﬁni-\ntion multimedia can be enabled via massive MIMO techniques. Massive\
    \ MIMO can\nalso provide better penetration into buildings due to directional\
    \ transmissions. This\nability of deep penetration can be utilized by the EFR\
    \ during emergency scenario\nsuch as building ﬁre.\n3.10.4\nSmall Cells\nHeterogeneous\
    \ network (HetNet) topology blends macrocells, picocells, and femto-\ncells. HetNet\
    \ topology aims at providing uniform broadband experience to all users\nubiquitously\
    \ in the network [149, 152, 153, 155].\nShrinking cell size beneﬁts by\nreuse\
    \ of spectrum across the geographical area and eventually reduction in number\n\
    of users competing for resources at each base station. Small cells can be deployed\n\
    both with standalone or within macro coverage, and they can be sparsely or densely\n\
    distributed in indoor or outdoor environments[149]. They transmit at substantially\n\
    lower power than macro cells and can be deployed to improve the capacity in hot-\n\
    pots, eliminate coverage holes, and ease the traﬃc load at the macro base station\n\
    [152].\n52\nFigure 3.16: Small cell example for PSC during an emergency scene.\n\
    LTE based small cells can be deployed in an emergency scenario to improve\nPSC\
    \ between EFR as shown in Fig. 3.16. This hotspot will improve the capac-\nity\
    \ of PSC, and as a result EFR do not have to compete with general public for\n\
    eNodeB resources. The base stations used as small cells in such scenario can be\n\
    portable/deployable systems. The backhual to these base stations can be via the\n\
    closest eNodeB, via satellite link, or via its own dedicated backhaul. A ﬂexible\
    \ and\nlow cost PSC deployment strategy using small cells can be eﬀective and\
    \ enhance the\nability of the EFR to save lives.\nThe indoor LTE coverage is becoming\
    \ a pressing concern as LTE deployments\nevolve. For instance, EFR would need\
    \ communication coverage in various parts\nof a building such as the basement.\
    \ However, building basements may have weak\ncoverage since the existing LTE deployments\
    \ does not always consider it crucial.\nThis issue can be resolved using LTE mini-towers\
    \ to boost indoor communication\ncoverage. Nevertheless, indoor coverage remains\
    \ ones of the pitfalls for LTE and\nneeds to be addressed for an eﬀective broadband\
    \ PSN [255].\n53\n3.10.5\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\nIn the United States,\
    \ Hurricane Sandy aﬀected 24 states, and particularly severe\ndamage was observed\
    \ in NJ and NY. Electrical power, terrestrial communication\nsystems, and utilities\
    \ cease to exist due to devastation caused by the Hurricane\nSandy. Along with\
    \ disruption of PSC and commercial wireless services, high winds\ncaused damage\
    \ to point-to-point backhaul links and ﬁber-optic cables were cut. The\nservice\
    \ disruption was observed over at least 3-5 days before any services began to\n\
    restore. Hurricane Sandy exposed ﬂaw in public-safety LTE plan as discussed in\n\
    [256], due to loss of commercial cell sites and no backup coverage from commercial\n\
    LTE carriers.\nThe deployment of LTE-equipped UAVs in such an emergency scenario\
    \ would\nprovide necessary voice and data coverage [150, 159, 162]. In [157],\
    \ a similar use\ncase is discussed where LTE-equipped UAVs is deployed as a relay\
    \ node.\nUAV\nwill share the same bandwidth allocated for public safety broadband\
    \ network and\nPSN could also backhaul the traﬃc from UAV. The concept of using\
    \ UAV from\nwireless communication has been a proven technology.\nUAV are easy\
    \ to deploy\nand can quickly restore critical communications during an emergency\
    \ operation.\nAlcatel-Lucent conducted a test with an ad-hoc LTE network using\
    \ 4G smartphone\nand USB Modem. The UAV ﬂew one kilometer while streaming 720p\
    \ video [168].\nHigher heights may occasionally result in line-of-sight and stronger\
    \ connectivity.\nUAVs have limited battery powers, and therefore may have limited\
    \ ﬂight times,\nwhich may introduce operational constraints.\nThe use of UAVs\
    \ in PSC networks pose several challenges that need to be re-\nsolved. For example,\
    \ mobility model, topology formation, energy constraints, and\ncooperation between\
    \ UAVs in a multi-UAV network are surveyed in [164]. Further-\n54\nmore, spectrum\
    \ scarcity speciﬁc challenges and integration of cognitive radio into\nUAVs are\
    \ addressed in [165].\nUAVs can complement the capabilities of PSN and can operate\
    \ in the same public\nsafety spectrum block. They can also achieve a radio link\
    \ with nearest functioning\neNodeB [157]. They can be deployed in high-risk areas\
    \ to assist EFR and used as\na relay node to extend network coverage, as discussed\
    \ in[158, 159, 169, 183]. With\nclearer rulemaking and policies on usage of UAVs\
    \ in civilian space [156], UAVs can\nbe inducted into PSN and making it a viable\
    \ solution in ﬁlling coverage holes.\n3.10.6\nLTE-based V2X Communication\nLTE-based\
    \ V2X communication involves the communication of information from\nvehicle into\
    \ devices of interest, and vice versa. The V2X communication has many\napplications\
    \ such as navigation, driver assistance, travel information, congestion\navoidance,\
    \ and ﬂeet management. It can occur in the form of vehicle to vehicle\n(V2V),\
    \ vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) communi-\n\
    cation [173–177]. The ProSe can ﬁnd good application in V2X communication. In\n\
    Release 13, the ProSe has been designed for pedestrian mobility speed, and further\n\
    research and standardization is needed for extensions to be used directly for\
    \ V2X\n[177].\nV2X communication can also ﬁnd application in PSC. In an emergency\
    \ situation\nFireﬁghters, police cars, ambulances vehicles can broadcast/multicast\
    \ information\nto other traﬃc elements and pave way to the EFR vehicles and avoid\
    \ any traﬃc\ncongestion. The V2X communications can also be used during disaster\
    \ management\nsuch as city evacuation. The vehicular ecological system can gather\
    \ information\nsuch as accident points and traﬃc patterns from multiple sources.\
    \ Furthermore,\n55\nV2X communication can also broadcast this information to other\
    \ vehicular nodes.\nThe eﬀective V2X communication can play critical role during\
    \ disaster management\nand minimize loss to human life [170, 171].\n3.10.7\nLicense\
    \ Assisted Access (LAA)\nWith the limited spectrum availability and ever increasing\
    \ traﬃc demands, re-\nsearcher and cellular companies are motivated to ﬁnd complementary\
    \ solutions to\nthe licensed spectrum.\nAlthough the licensed spectrum is preferable\
    \ to provide\nbetter user experience, exploring LTE in unlicensed spectrum can\
    \ lead to higher\nspectral eﬃciency [184]. LTE in the unlicensed band (LTE-U)\
    \ can complement the\nservices provided by the LTE in licensed spectrum. As per\
    \ the regulation, LTE sig-\nnals transmitted in unlicensed spectrum must be accompanied\
    \ by a licensed carrier.\nPrimary carrier always uses licensed spectrum (either\
    \ TDD or FDD) for both control\nsignals and user signals. The secondary carrier\
    \ would use the unlicensed spectrum\nfor downlink only or both uplink and downlink\
    \ [127, 178, 180, 181, 185]. 5 GHz\nunlicensed spectrum is a top candidate for\
    \ the operation that is globally available\nwhile it should be ensured that LTE-U\
    \ design is forward-compatible with upcoming\n3GPP speciﬁcations [178]. A robust\
    \ design solutions for unlicensed bands, clearer\nguidelines for operators, and\
    \ coexistence framework would be necessary, if LTE and\nWi-Fi have to coexist\
    \ on fair share basis [178, 186, 187, 257].\nLAA is an aggregation of LTE in the\
    \ licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The\nmain goal of LTE and LTE-Advanced for\
    \ a licensed-assisted access to unlicensed\nspectrum would be to achieve better\
    \ traﬃc oﬄoading, achieve spectral eﬃciency,\nand provide a higher user experience\
    \ in a cost-eﬀective manner [179, 184].\nThe\nWi-Fi performance is maintained\
    \ while coexisting with licensed-assisted access to\n56\nunlicensed spectrum as\
    \ discussed in [181, 183, 257]. The LAA beneﬁts to all user,\nby increasing the\
    \ capacity to support the indoor applications, providing seamless\nindoor/outdoor\
    \ mobility, better coverage experience, eﬃcient spectrum usage, and\nbetter network\
    \ performance as outlined by the technical report [257].\nHowever,\noperating\
    \ on unlicensed spectrum may have design implications on LTE that are\nnot yet\
    \ well understood. In particular, co-existence between multiple LTE operators\n\
    sharing the unlicensed band and co-existence with WLAN should be studied and\n\
    addressed [188, 189].\nPSC examples discussed earlier under Section 3.10.2 and\
    \ Section 3.10.3 can ben-\neﬁt from licensed-assisted access to unlicensed spectrum.\
    \ In Fig. 3.16, the small cell\noperating in unlicensed spectrum can be deployed\
    \ outdoor and indoor. Extending\nthe beneﬁts of small cells with LTE-U would lead\
    \ to better network performance,\nenhanced user experience by supplementing the\
    \ downlink, and provide seamless mo-\nbility [154]. These beneﬁts can enhance\
    \ the EFR capabilities, provide much needed\nmission-critical communication, and\
    \ improved data capacity to support real-time\ndata/multimedia/voice [257].\n\
    In an emergency scenario, as discussed in Section\nIX.C where all the terrestrial\
    \ infrastructure has been devastated.\nLTE-U based\nUAV operation can be considered\
    \ [160, 161]. In [160], the feasibility of using UAV\nin unlicensed for the purpose\
    \ of search and rescue operations of avalanche victims\nhas been discussed. Based\
    \ on the simulation results, it can be deduced that UAV\noperations in unlicensed\
    \ spectrum can be used by EFR during search and rescue\nmissions.\n57\n3.10.8\n\
    Spectrum sharing and cognitive radio\nWith the explosion of various wireless technologies\
    \ such as 5G, Internet of Things,\nhome automation, and connected cars. The ﬁnite\
    \ radio spectrum, must accommo-\ndate cellular calls and data traﬃc from various\
    \ wireless devices. As a result, the\nradio spectrum is quickly becoming a scarce\
    \ commodity. For example, according to\nFCC, United States will be soon running\
    \ out of radio spectrum [68].\nAs the spectrum gets increasingly scarce, public\
    \ safety agencies have to compete\nwith commercial entities for the radio spectrum\
    \ resources. If not properly addressed,\nproblem of spectrum scarcity can result\
    \ PSN to be less dependable in the future,\nand may face interoperability challenges\
    \ [69, 70]. In [67], a group of experts from\nAustralia and Europe provide opinions\
    \ on recent research and policy options about\nspectrum management, including\
    \ new approaches to valuation and sharing. Fur-\nthermore, eﬀective detection\
    \ and utilization of white spaces in PSC spectrum are\ncrucial for minimizing\
    \ outages and maximizing throughput [192]. In [190], pervasive\nspectrum sharing\
    \ is envisioned as an enabler for PSNs with broadband communica-\ntion capabilities.\n\
    Cognitive radio technology presents a viable solution to use spectrum more ef-\n\
    ﬁciently, which can potentially address the spectrum scarcity problem. A cognitive\n\
    radio senses and learns the radio frequency spectrum in order to operate in unused\n\
    portions of licensed spectrum or whitespaces without causing interference to pri-\n\
    mary licensed users [66, 191, 194]. Furthermore, a cognitive radio network oﬀers\n\
    support for heterogeneity, reconﬁgurability, self-organization, and interoperability\n\
    with existing networks as discussed in [191, 195].\nThese ability of cognitive\
    \ ra-\ndio can be instrumental during disaster scenarios, with partially/fully\
    \ destroyed\nnetworks. Moreover, the convergence of cognitive radio technology\
    \ and device-to-\n58\ndevice communication can improve the spectrum utilization\
    \ [193] and also beneﬁt\nPSC by mitigating spectrum scarcity.\n3.10.9\nWireless\
    \ Sensor Networks\nA sensor network is composed of spatially distributed autonomous\
    \ sensors with the\nability to monitor and control physical environment. A typical\
    \ sensor network has\nmany sensor nodes and a gateway sensor node. Modern day\
    \ sensor networks are\nusually bi-directional which cooperatively pass their data\
    \ through the networks to\nthe main location. Lately, sensor network received\
    \ extensive interest for their use\ncases in PSN [196–198].\nA sensor network\

    \ bi-directional which cooperatively pass their data through the networks to\n\
    the main location. Lately, sensor networks received extensive interest for their\
    \ use\ncases in PSN [196–198].\nWireless sensor networks (WSN) have the ability\
    \ for situational awareness of a\nlarge physical environment, and this ability\
    \ can support the decision makers with\nearly detection of a possible catastrophic\
    \ event [196]. Furthermore, the localization\nalgorithms can provide key support\
    \ for many location-aware protocols and enhance\nthe situational awareness [199].\
    \ In a large-scale WSN deployment for situational\nawareness, the WSN is vulnerable\
    \ to traﬃc patterns and node convergence as dis-\ncussed in [200]. Further analyzes\
    \ present the sink mobility as a potential solution to\nenhance the network performance\
    \ in large-scale WSN with varying traﬃc patterns.\n59\nA traditional multi-hop\
    \ WSN is resources-constrained and uses ﬁxed spectrum\nallocation. Therefore,\
    \ by equipping a sensor node with cognitive radio capabilities,\na WSN can reap\
    \ the beneﬁts of dynamic spectrum access as discussed in [198].\nFurthermore,\
    \ applying channel bonding schemes to cognitive-WSNs can result in\nbetter bandwidth\
    \ utilization and higher channel capacity as surveyed in [201].\nThe deployment\
    \ of large-scale WSNs into PSN, alongside the LTE-based PSN,\nhave important advantages.\
    \ With sensor gateway node connected to LTE-based\nPSN, data can seamlessly ﬂow\
    \ into public safety data centers. This real-time data\ncan raise the situational\
    \ awareness of the public safety agencies and reduces the\nEFR response time.\n\
    However, the integration of WSN into IP-based network makes it vulnerable to\n\
    various threats as discussed in Section IX-K. The various security aspects of\
    \ WSN\nin PSN are discussed in [196, 197].\n3.10.10\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\
    The IoT revolves around the pervasive presence of objects such as radio-frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation tags, sensors, actuators, and mobile phones having machine-to-machine\n\
    (M2M) communication either through a virtual or instantaneous connection. The\n\
    IoT infrastructure is built using cloud computing services and networks of data-\n\
    gathering sensors. The IoT oﬀers an ability to measure, infer, and understand\
    \ the\nsurrounding environment and delicate ecologies [205–207]. Ubiquitous sensing\
    \ en-\nabled by the wireless sensor networks also cuts across PSC frontiers. The\
    \ M2M and\nconnected devices can collect real-time data from EFR devices, such\
    \ as body-worn\ncameras, sensors attached to gun holsters, and magazine/baton/radio\
    \ pouches [208].\nThis ecosystem of EFR’s personal area network can send the real-time\
    \ alert from\n60\nthese IoT devices to increase the situational awareness. With\
    \ the availability of\nbroadband services, such as LTE and WiFi, this real-time\
    \ data can be uploaded\nand stored using cloud services. The real-time analysis\
    \ of this data at crime centers\nusing artiﬁcial intelligence and decision-making\
    \ algorithms can be used to respond\neasily in any emergency situations [204].\
    \ Furthermore, measures can be taken to\nprevent a situation turning into an emergency\
    \ [202, 203, 258].\nThe IoT can change the way EFR execute their missions, helping\
    \ them to be more\neﬀective and responsive. The real-time tracking of EFR using\
    \ IoT, can relay the\nright information to the right person at the right time.\
    \ Furthermore, this information\nwill enhance real-time decision making capabilities\
    \ of EFR and avoid any potential\ndisasters. However, as these devices become\
    \ more integrated into cloud services, they\nare exposed to vulnerabilities that\
    \ pose risk to public safety mission-critical data.\nThe important major challenge\
    \ involves managing the complex threats created by\nthe IoT, while taking advantage\
    \ of newly discovered capabilities of IoT to enhance\nPSC [259].\n3.10.11\nCybersecurity\
    \ Enhancements and Data Analytics\nfor PSNs\nThe public safety data available\
    \ from public safety agents such as IoT, sensor nodes,\nand specialized public\
    \ safety devices can play a crucial role in disaster management.\nWith the help\
    \ of intelligent learning techniques, the available data can be analyzed\nto understand\
    \ the dynamics of disaster prone areas and plan the rescue operation.\nMoreover,\
    \ the real-time data ﬂowing in from diﬀerent public safety agents can be\nanalyzed\
    \ to predict and issue an early warning in case of natural or man-made\ndisaster.\
    \ This data analysis can enhance the capabilities of PSN. The importance of\n\
    61\ndata analytics and related case studies using big data have been surveyed\
    \ in article\n[213].\nFurthermore, the public safety entities access public safety\
    \ data such as medical\nrecords, site information, and other video and data information\
    \ useful to disaster\nmanagement and emergency response. Such critical information\
    \ is transmitted in\nthe form of voice, data, or multimedia using wireless laptops,\
    \ handheld public safety\ndevices, and mobile video cameras. However, this public\
    \ safety data can be exploited\nby criminals with proper technology. Therefore,\
    \ PSN infrastructure must protect the\nintegrity of all the public safety data\
    \ that is being accessed and transmitted. With\nextensive elevated network privileges\
    \ given to EFR during an emergency scenario,\nhaving a reliable communication\
    \ becomes of critical importance [209, 211, 212].\nIn [209], authors discuss various\
    \ PSN security threats such as, protection against\nevesdropping, protection against\
    \ corrupt information, securing network interfaces\nbetween network elements,\
    \ protection against data exﬁltration, and protection against\ndenial of service\
    \ attacks. Identity management of every public safety device and\nEFR accessing\
    \ the critical information is an absolute necessity.\nAs discussed in\n[209–211]\
    \ identity management can be characterized as identiﬁcation, authentica-\ntion,\
    \ and authorization associated with individuals, public safety devices, or public\n\
    safety applications. There are several proven security methods/techniques for\
    \ iden-\ntiﬁcation, authentication, and authorization. However, the public safety\
    \ agencies\nneed to develop the technical and policy requirements for use of security\
    \ techniques\nin PSN by considering the scope and context of their applicability\
    \ to PSC.\n62\nTable 3.7: PDPR identiﬁed bands/ranges by international telecommunication\

    3.11\nPublic safety broadband deployments in other regions\nof the world.\nBroadband\
    \ deployment for PSC has been grabbing the spotlight in diﬀerent parts of\nthe\
    \ world. The global standards collaboration emergency communications task force\n\
    is investigating standards for a globally coordinated approach for PSC. The world\n\
    radio conference (WRC-15) held in Geneva in November 2015, provided a platform\n\
    to address public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) requirements. The WRC-15\n\
    Resolution 646 is an international agreement between UN and ITU. This agreement\n\
    encourages the public safety entities to use frequency range 694-894 MHz, when\n\
    outlining a draft for nationwide broadband PSN for PPDR applications [102]. The\n\
    public safety entities across diﬀerent countries have diﬀerent operational frequency\n\
    range and spectrum requirements.\nTable 3.7 shows the frequency allocation for\
    \ PPDR in various parts of the world.\nThe amount of spectrum needed for PSC by\
    \ diﬀerent EFR agencies and applications\non a daily basis diﬀers signiﬁcantly.\
    \ To enable spectrum harmonization for nation-\nwide and cross-border operations\
    \ would need interoperability between various EFR\n63\nsystems used for PPDR.\
    \ As a result, having a dedicated broadband spectrum for\nPPDR has been one of\
    \ the WRC-15 agenda items [260].\nEurope: The ECC Report 199 [103] addresses the\
    \ broadband spectrum in Europe\nfor PSC networks, which considers the 400 MHz\
    \ and 700 MHz frequency bands. The\nreport also concludes that 10 MHz of spectrum\
    \ for the uplink and another 10 MHz\nfor the downlink would provide suﬃcient capacity\
    \ to meet the core requirements of\nPSC.\nUnited Kingdom: The public safety agencies\
    \ in the United Kingdom use narrow-\nband TETRA PSN for data and mission-critical\
    \ voice services. Furthermore, the\nUnited Kingdom also plans on building emergency\
    \ services mobile communications\nprogramme (ESMCP), also referred as the emergency\
    \ service network (ESN), which\nwill deliver future mobile communication for the\
    \ country’s emergency services using\n4G LTE network [261]. The United Kingdom\
    \ is preparing for an orderly transi-\ntion from TETRA to LTE-based ESN by the\
    \ year 2020 [262]. However, there is no\nspectrum available in 700 MHz at-least\
    \ until 2019. Therefore, the ESN will latch\nonto 800 MHz to implement voice calls\
    \ over LTE, PTT capabilities, and satellite\nbackhaul in hard-to-reach areas [32].\n\
    Canada: Industry Canada has initiated a framework and policy for public safety\n\
    broadband spectrum in the bands 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz, i.e., band class\n\
    14 as illustrated in Fig. 3.5. Canadian public safety band plan in upper 700 MHz\
    \ is\nshown in [104] and it corresponds to FirstNet’s band class 14. Recently,\
    \ the EFR\nin the City of Calgary, have been testing the ﬁrst public safety LTE\
    \ network in\nCanada [263]. With the help of high-speed broadband capabilities\
    \ Calgary Police\nServices were able to quickly access data, analyze the information,\
    \ and securely\nmulticast data to EFR. The Calgary public safety LTE network is\
    \ composed of\n64\ncellular sites and uses LTE public safety devices such as VML750\
    \ and LEX mission-\ncritical handhelds [263].\nAustralia and China: Similarly,\
    \ in countries like Australia and China, LTE tech-\nnology is fast becoming a\
    \ primary choice for professional digital trunking command\nand dispatching services.\
    \ The main goal is to build a rapid, ﬂexible, and eﬀective\nwireless multimedia\
    \ communications network, which can be used to improve PDPR\napplications [101,\
    \ 264].\n3.12\nIssues and Open Research Directions\nWhile the technologies for\
    \ PSC are ever evolving, given the discovery-delivery gap,\nnot all advanced aspects\
    \ of the public safety technology are commercially avail-\nable. In particular,\
    \ a full-ﬂedged deployment of mission-critical LTE-based PSN is\nunattainable\
    \ in the short term. This has resulted in the amalgamation of legacy and\nemerging\
    \ public safety technologies. The convergence of LMRS-LTE public safety\ntechnologies\
    \ can provide mission-critical voice and broadband data. However, de-\nsigning\
    \ and optimizing LMRS-LTE converged devices which can support mature\n3GPP techniques\
    \ such as MBMS is an open challenge for the engineers [14, 119].\nThe integration\
    \ and optimization of 3GPP Release- 12/13 enhancements such\nas eMBMS, HetNets,\
    \ LAA, and LTE-based V2X for PSC is an open challenge to\nboth academic and engineering\
    \ community. Currently, the MBSFN area and sub-\nframes in eMBMS are static and\
    \ cannot be adjusted according to user distribution.\nTherefore, design and optimization\
    \ of ﬂexible MBSFN resource structures that can\naccommodate diﬀerent user distributions\
    \ have become a challenge and an impor-\ntant area of research. The integration\
    \ of Release- 13 enhancements for D2D/ProSe\nframework into MBMS/eMBMS is an another\
    \ open area of research [133]. Small\n65\ncells need better assessment of attributes\
    \ such as grid conﬁguration, alignment with\nmacro network to avoid interference,\
    \ handover analysis, and backhauling to meet\nthe capacity requirements of cell-edge\
    \ users. Furthermore, a systematic convergence\nof mmWave, massive MIMO, and UAVs\
    \ with small cells are an open areas of re-\nsearch [149, 152, 155]. LTE-U and\
    \ LAA coexisting fairly in the unlicensed spectrum\nwith other broadband technologies\
    \ has become an intense debate. Therefore, having\npolicies to ensure fair access\
    \ to all technologies is increasingly becoming a popular\narea of investigation.\
    \ Furthermore, designing protocols for carrier aggregation of li-\ncensed and\
    \ unlicensed bands is an another important area of research [181, 257]. The\n\
    integration of ProSe and LTE-based broadcast services into LTE-based V2X can en-\n\
    sure connectivity between EFR vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and people in\
    \ PSN.\nThis open area of research can help to further strengthen the mobility\
    \ management,\npublic warning systems, and disaster management. However, resource\
    \ allocation,\nlatency, interference management and mobility management are important\
    \ issues in\nV2X communication that need some study [170, 171].\nThe mmWave, massive\
    \ MIMO, and UAVs are advanced technologies with po-\ntential applications for\
    \ PSC. Each of these technologies have their own metrics such\nas throughput provided,\
    \ latency, the cost of providing higher throughput, ease of\ndeployment, and commercial\
    \ viability for assessing success in PSN. By addressing\nchallenges such as interference\
    \ management, spatial reuse, and modulation and cod-\ning schemes for dynamically\
    \ changing channel user states, mmWave can result in\nmore practical and aﬀordable\
    \ system for the development of cellular and PSN net-\nworks [136–139]. Similarly,\
    \ eﬃcient model of massive MIMO in PSN needs more\naccurate analysis of computational\
    \ complexity, processing algorithms, synchroniza-\ntion of antenna units, and\
    \ channel model [143]. The application of UAVs in PSN\nis shrouded by public’s\
    \ privacy concerns and lack of comprehensive policies, reg-\n66\nulations, and\
    \ governance for UAVs [212]. Investigating the role of mmWave and\nmassive MIMO\
    \ with UAVs for higher throughput gains for robust UAV deployment\n[167]. Furthermore,\
    \ developing new propagation model for better autonomy and\nquicker deployment\
    \ of UAVS as aerial base stations is an open research direction\n[150, 157–163,\
    \ 166, 183].\nSDR and cognitive radio technologies provide additional ﬂexibility\
    \ and eﬃciency\nfor overall spectrum use.\nThese technologies can be combined\
    \ or deployed au-\ntonomously for PSC. However, PSN using SDR or cognitive radio\
    \ technologies\nmust operate in compliance with radio and spectrum regulations.\n\
    Furthermore,\na comprehensive implementation of these technologies for PSC present\
    \ technical\nand operational challenges. An SDR for PSC, which is interoperable\
    \ across vendor\ninfrastructures, frameworks, and radio bands is an area for future\
    \ research [122–124].\nSimilarly, cognitive radio technology needs extensive research\
    \ in areas of energy ef-\nﬁcient spectrum sensing and sharing to be more eﬀective.\
    \ Extensive research over\napplication of LAA, database-assisted spectrum sharing,\
    \ and prioritized spectrum\naccess in cognitive radio technology can further enhance\
    \ the spectrum eﬃciency\n[127, 180, 181, 183].\nPublic safety wearables have become\
    \ increasingly popular amongst EFR and are\nan important area of research. Tailoring\
    \ public safety wearables and wireless sensors\ninto IoT can help in real-time\
    \ data aggregation and situation analysis. Therefore,\nWSNs and IoT needs to evolve\
    \ within the wider context of PSN and address issues\nrelated to infrastructure,\
    \ design, cost, interoperability, data aggregation, regula-\ntions, policies,\
    \ and information security [196–198]. Furthermore constructing robust\nmodels\
    \ for multi-hop synchronization and tethering real-time wireless sensor data\n\
    attached to EFR equipment have become a contemporary area of research [202, 203].\n\
    67\nThe EFR access public safety data such as medical records, site information,\n\
    multimedia, and other information useful for disaster management and emergency\n\
    response. The perpetrators with proper technology can exploit this public safety\n\
    data. Therefore, given the scope of next generation PSN, securing PSN infrastruc-\n\
    tures, public safety device integrity, and public safety data is an important\
    \ issue and\nopen area of research within cybersecurity space [204, 209, 211,\
    \ 212]. Furthermore,\nthe policy requirements for the use of public safety devices\
    \ and information oper-\nating in PSN is an another major issue and area of research\
    \ for the public safety\nagencies and federal regulatory bodies [210].\n68\nCHAPTER\
    \ 4\nAPCO-25 AND PUBLIC SAFETY LTE NS-3 SIMULATION\nThe purpose of this chapter\
    \ is to simulate LTE band class 14 system and APCO-\n25 using NS-3 open source\
    \ tool. The LTE band class 14 simulation is based on LENA\nLTE model [16] whereas\
    \ LMRS simulation is based on the deﬁnition of APCO-25\nportrayed in [95–97, 235].\
    \ We chose to use NS-3 simulator and LENA LTE model\ndue to their eﬀective characterization\
    \ of LTE protocol details.\nIn order to be consistent and to provide a better\
    \ comparative analysis between\nLMRS and LTE band class 14, we implement a single\
    \ cell scenario, and similar user\ndensity. The main simulation goal is to compute\
    \ aggregated throughput capacity\nand signal quality measurement with increasing\
    \ cell size in case of both LTE and\nLMRS. Simulation setup, assumptions, and\
    \ simulation parameters for LTE band\nclass 14 system and LMRS are discussed in\
    \ Section 4.2 and Section 4.1, respectively.\nFurthermore, we analyze these simulation\
    \ results in Section 4.3 to strengthen the\nconclusion of the comparative study.\n\
    4.1\nNS-3 Simulation of LTE Band Class 14\nThe simulation study of LTE band class\
    \ 14 includes, throughput computation in up-\nlink and downlink, cell signal quality\
    \ measurement in terms of SINR, and measuring\nsignal quality in a inter-cell\
    \ interference scenario. Fig. 4.1 shows the throughput sim-\nulation environment\
    \ implemented in this chapter. Simulation environment consists\nof randomly placed\
    \ multiple UEs and one eNodeB (eNB). Other environment entity\nincludes remote\
    \ host which provides service to end user. Remote host will provide\nIP-based\
    \ services to UEs and user datagram protocol (UDP) application is installed\n\
    on both the remote host and the UEs to send and receive a burst of packets.\n\
    69\nFigure 4.1: LTE model for NS-3 simulations, based on the LENA project [16].\
    \ All\nthe important details of the LTE PHY and MAC protocols are implemented\
    \ in the\nNS-3 simulations.\n(a) Average downlink throughput (Mbits/s).\n(b) Average\
    \ uplink throughput (Mbits/s).\nFigure 4.2: The CDF plot of simulated LTE NS-3\
    \ model; plot illustrates average\nuplink and downlink throughput (Mbits/s) with\
    \ 25 and 50 UEs.\n4.1.1\nScenario:Average Downlink and Uplink Throughput\nIn the\
    \ constructed LTE simulation model, UEs were randomly distributed through-\nout\
    \ the cell and follow a random walk mobility model in 2D. Fig. 4.2(a) and\n70\n\
    Fig. 4.2(b), show the CDF plot of the average downlink and uplink throughput\n\
    seen across the 25, and 50 UEs. By intuition, it can be seen that in a relatively\n\
    dense populated cell (with 25, and 50 UEs) the DL throughput is approximately\n\
    33 Mbit/s whereas the UL throughput is 13 Mbit/s. A Monte Carlo experimental\n\
    approach was used to obtain average throughput in each simulation iteration of\
    \ 25,\nand 50 UEs. These data rates can support applications such as IP-based\
    \ multimedia\nservices and also provide mission-critical real-time voice/video\
    \ communications in\nPSC scenarios[265].\n4.1.2\nScenario: Aggregate throughput\
    \ vs. Distance\nIn this simulation scenario, we implement a macro-eNodeB site\
    \ with a transmission\npower of 46 dBm. The simulation comprises 20 UEs being\
    \ randomly distributed\nthroughout the cell, which has transmission power of 23\
    \ dBm, and follows random\nwalk 2D mobility model. The round robin MAC scheduler\
    \ is used to distribute\nthe resources equally to all the users. The communication\
    \ channel included in the\nsimulation is trace fading loss model in a pedestrian\
    \ scenario. The LTE band class\n14 simulation uses a bandwidth of 10 MHz and the\
    \ frequency values is shown in\nTable 3.5.\nResult observation: In this simulation\
    \ scenario for data only transmission and\nreception, the aggregated DL throughput\
    \ can be as large as 33 Mbit/s whereas the\naggregated UL throughput can be as\
    \ large as 11 Mbit/s as seen in Fig. 4.3. Further-\nmore, it is also observed\
    \ that the throughput experience by the UEs is diminished\nas the distance the\
    \ between the UE and macro-eNodeB increases.\n71\nFigure 4.3: Aggregated uplink\
    \ and downlink throughput observed by 20 UEs in the\nLTE band class 14. UEs experience\
    \ better throughput when in close proximity with\nmacro-eNodeB.\nTable 4.1: LTE\

    \ measurement\nIn this simulation scenario, the UEs are placed at the cell center,\
    \ post cell center,\npre cell-edge and cell-edge regions of a macro-eNB site.\
    \ The simulation model uses\nthe simulation parameters and their attributes as\
    \ shown in Table 3.5. The signal\nquality is a measurement of three quantities:\
    \ namely RSRP (reference signal received\npower), RSRQ (reference signal received\
    \ quality), and SINR. SINR is a measure of\nsignal quality deﬁned by a UE vendor\
    \ but never reported to the network. The UEs\nreport the CQI to the network indicating\
    \ DL transmission rate. The CQI is a 4-bit\ninteger and is based on the observed\
    \ SINR at the UE. In this simulation scenario,\nSINR factor is used to measure\
    \ the link quality and the chapter assumes the link\nquality is poor if the CQI\
    \ value approaches 0.\n72\nFigure 4.4: The CDF plot of DL SINR values measured\
    \ by the UEs placed at cell\ncenter, post cell center, pre cell-edge, and cell-edge\
    \ regions.\nResult observation: The simulation cell size varies between 0.5 km2\
    \ to 5 km2.\nAs the distance between the eNB and the UE gradually increases, a\
    \ change in signal\nquality is observed. Fig. 4.4 shows the CDF plots of DL SINR\
    \ values measured by\nthe UEs throughout the cell, which range from −10 dB to\
    \ 50 dB. These SINR values\nrecorded by the UEs ﬁt between the range of excellent\
    \ to cell-edge RF conditions\nas speciﬁed in Table 4.1. The UEs when positioned\
    \ nearby to the base station they\nexperience better signal quality.\n4.1.4\n\
    Scenario: Inter-cell interference measurement\nThe inter-cell interference in\
    \ our simulation occurs in a homogeneous network with\neNodeBs having the same\
    \ capability, and same transmit power class. The inter-cell\ninterference between\
    \ two adjacent cell results in signal degradation and the UEs ex-\nperience poor\
    \ link quality at the cell-edge [114–116]. In the simulation model of the\ninter-cell\
    \ interference measurement, 20 UEs are placed beyond the mid-cell region,\nand\
    \ along the cell-edge region. The simulation model includes, two homogeneous\n\
    73\nFigure 4.5: Inter-cell interference simulation scenario with cell-edge UEs\
    \ with in-\nterference from neighboring cell. Such a scenario may e.g. correspond\
    \ to two ﬁre\ntrucks or police cars that utilize LTE small cells, and are parked\
    \ next to each other\nduring an emergency incident.\nFigure 4.6: The CDF plot\
    \ of DL SINR values measured by the UEs placed on the\nedge of a LTE cell 1 of\
    \ Fig. 4.5.\neNodeBs with ﬁxed location and transmission power of 23 dBm, 20 UEs,\
    \ round\nrobin MAC scheduler, pedestrian fading model, MIMO 2-layer spatial multiplexing,\n\
    a bandwidth of 10 MHz, and the other simulation parameters deﬁned in Table 3.5.\n\
    The simulation scenario is as shown in Fig. 4.5, which shows two adjacent homoge-\n\
    neous small cells and cell-edge UEs. The cell-edge UEs in cell 1 observe interference\n\
    from the neighboring cell 2. The main goal of inter-cell interference simulation\
    \ is to\nmeasure the signal degradation observed by UEs at cell-edge in cell 1.\n\
    Result observation: The intuitive analysis of Fig. 4.6 conclude that the cell-\n\
    edge UEs in Fig. 4.5 observe signal degradation and experience poor link quality\n\
    74\nwhen compared to cell-edge UEs with no interference. The SINR values measured\n\
    by the cell-edged UEs in both the scenario are plotted in Fig. 4.6 in form of\
    \ a CDF.\nThe DL SINR values experienced by the UEs range from −10 dB to 10 dB\
    \ in the\ncell with no interference. On the other hand, the SINR values measured\
    \ by the UEs\nin cell 1 fall in the range of −15 dB to 10 dB due to the signal\
    \ degradation caused\nby the adjacent cell.\n4.2\nNS-3 Simulation Setup for APCO-25\n\
    The main goal of APCO-25 simulation study is to compute the throughput, and\n\
    the SINR distribution. Fig. 4.7 shows the APCO-25 simulation environment im-\n\
    plemented in this chapter.\nThe subscriber units in the simulation environment\n\
    operate in direct mode, also known as talk-around, which enables EFR to have\n\
    radio-to-radio direct communications by selecting a channel that bypasses their\
    \ re-\npeater/base systems. However this direct mode of communication limits the\
    \ distance\nbetween mobile/portable subscriber units and spectrum reuse [93, 97].\
    \ A portable\nsubscriber units can be described as a hand held device, while mobile\
    \ subscriber\nunits are mounted in EFR vehicle for mission-critical communication,\
    \ to operates\nvehicle siren and lights. The APCO-25 Phase I and Phase II both\
    \ can employ direct\nmode operations. Phase II TDMA systems require timing reference\
    \ from the base\nstation via system control channel and traﬃc channel for slot\
    \ synchronization. The\ndirect mode operation is challenging in case of Phase\
    \ II TDMA due to the unavail-\nability of master timing reference from the base\
    \ station or a repeater [97]. In direct\noperation mode, as the distance between\
    \ the subscriber units increases, the SINR\nvalue decreases.\n75\n(a) The lines\
    \ indicate direct communication\nmode between the subscriber units.\n(b) APCO-25\
    \ CAI digital voice modulation\nstandard in a radio system.\nFigure 4.7: APCO-25\
    \ suite of standards for public safety communication referenced\nin NS-3 simulation.\n\
    The APCO-25 common air interface (CAI) is a speciﬁed standard for digital\nvoice\
    \ modulation used by the compliant radios as shown in Fig. 4.7b. Public safety\n\
    devices form diﬀerent vendors using APCO-25 CAI can communicate with each\nother.\
    \ APCO-25 CAI has a control channel with a rate of 9600 bps and it uses\nimproved\
    \ multi-band excitation (IMBE) for voice digitization.\nThe IMBE voice\nencoder-decoder\
    \ (vocoder) samples the audio input into digital stream for transmis-\nsion. At\
    \ the receiver, vocoder produces synthetic equivalent audio from the digital\n\
    stream [94, 97].\n76\nFigure 4.8: The maximum observed throughput in case of data\
    \ communication is\napproximately 580 Kbits/s for both portable and mobile public\
    \ safety devices.\n4.2.1\nScenario: Throughput and SINR Simulation of APCO-\n\
    25 Portable and Mobile Devices\nThe NS-3 simulation for APCO-25, consist a square\
    \ simulation area and with a uni-\nform random distribution of 20 subscriber units\
    \ across the cell. These 20 subscriber\nunits in direct communication mode use\
    \ APCO-25 CAI for digital voice modula-\ntion and Friis propagation model. The\
    \ portable subscriber units have transmission\npower of 5 Watts, mobile subscriber\
    \ units have transmission power of 10 Watts.\nResult observation: In the direct\
    \ communication mode, maximum throughput\nis possible when subscriber units are\
    \ in proximity. As the geographical distance\nbetween the portable and mobile\
    \ public safety devices increases, the throughput\ndecreases as shown in Fig.\
    \ 4.8. The simulation of APCO-25 for data only system and\ndirect communication\
    \ mode demonstrates an aggregate throughput of 580 Kbits/s\nas shown in Fig. 4.8.\
    \ Whereas, Fig. 4.9 and Fig. 4.10 showcases the SINR observed\nby the portable\
    \ and mobile public safety devices in the geographical area of interest.\nFrom\
    \ Fig. 4.9 and Fig. 4.10 it is observed that the SINR values decreases with the\n\

    \ units as shown in Fig. 4.9 and Fig. 4.10.\n79\n4.3\nNS-3 Simulation Result Analysis\n\
    The key factors for successful PSC can be broadly classiﬁed into mission-critical\
    \ voice\ncommunication and wider coverage for public safety devices. From the\
    \ comparison of\nFigs. 4.4, 4.9, and 4.10, it can be deduced that LMRS public\
    \ safety devices experience\nlarger cell coverage when compared to the band class\
    \ 14 LTE devices. This volume\nof cell coverage is critical during the emergency\
    \ scenario and is necessary to cover the\nmaximum amount emergency prone area.\
    \ Another rising factor in mission-critical\nPSC is real-time video communications,\
    \ high data rate is needed to support real-time\nmultimedia applications [265].\
    \ The aggregated throughput of LMRS infrastructure\nis less when compared to the\
    \ aggregated throughput of band class 14 infrastructure\nand is shown in Fig.\
    \ 4.3 and Fig. 4.8. These data rates experienced by the LTE UEs\ncan deﬁnitely\
    \ support the much needed real-time video communications in several\nof the PSC\
    \ scenarios.\nAn adaptation of successful edition of mission-critical PTT over\
    \ LTE would take\nsome time [267]. In the meantime, applying the individual strength\
    \ of LMRS and\nLTE into a converged public safety device to mission-critical voice\
    \ and much needed\nmission-critical real-time data support can be beneﬁcial to\
    \ PSC.\n80\nCHAPTER 5\nSOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO EXPERIMENTATIONS IN APCO-25\nAND\
    \ PUBLIC SAFETY LTE FREQUENCY BANDS\nThis chapter discusses the experiments conducted\
    \ using SDR receiver such as the\nRTL-SDR RTL2832U [19] and HackRF [18]. SDR is\
    \ an implementation of a radio\ncommunication system where the components that\
    \ have normally implemented in\nhardware such as ampliﬁers, mixers, ﬁlters, modulators/demodulators,\
    \ and detectors\nare instead implemented by means of software [125, 126, 268].\
    \ Most SDR receivers\nuse a variable-frequency oscillator, mixer, and ﬁlter. The\
    \ ﬂexible SDR receiver helps\nin tuning to the desired frequency or a baseband\
    \ [125, 269]. These ﬂexible tuning\ncharacteristics can be used to tune into public\
    \ safety signals.\nSDR provides a low-cost infrastructure and more or less computer-driven\
    \ envi-\nronment which makes it an integral part of the public safety research,\
    \ development,\nand test activities [123, 124]. The continual development of SDR\
    \ related hardware\nand software have assisted PSC researchers in gaining a better\
    \ understanding of\npublic safety signals. Furthermore, in this section we capture\
    \ and analyze LMRS\nand public safety LTE signals and is shown via examples.\n\
    5.1\nCapturing APCO-25 signals\nThe setup for the detection of APCO-25 signals\
    \ consists HackRF connected to a per-\nsonal computer equipped with a sound card\
    \ and installed with SDRSharp freeware\ntool [17, 129]. This setup is used as\
    \ radio scanner to observe unencrypted APCO-\nP25 digital radio voice spectrum\
    \ using the instructions provided in [122]. Fig. 5.1\nshows the observed Broward\
    \ County public safety radio spectrum for frequency of\n851.68 MHz with signal\
    \ strength of −36.59 dB. The second embedded window is\na spectrogram which is\
    \ a visual representation of the frequency spectrum of the\n81\nFigure 5.1: Broward\
    \ County, FL, APCO-25 spectrum monitored using SDR# soft-\nware and captured using\
    \ a HackRF receiver [17, 18].\nreceived signal. HackRF has three receiver gain\
    \ i.e., RF ampliﬁer between 0 dB or\n14 dB, IF low noise ampliﬁer 0 dB to 40 dB,\
    \ and baseband variable gain ampliﬁer\nbetween 0 dB to 62 dB. RF ampliﬁer gain\
    \ is set high to receive string signal, while\nkeeping noise ﬂoor as low as possible.\
    \ In this experiment the RF ampliﬁer gain is\nset to 9 dB. The two primary factors\
    \ that describes window function are width of\nthe main lobe and attenuation of\
    \ the side lobes. 4-term Blackman-Harris window is\nbetter suited for spectral\
    \ analysis [270] and therefore used in the current APCO-25\nSDR experiments.\n\

    \ Safety Band class 14 cell detection using LTE-Tracker open source\ntool and\
    \ RTL-SDR [19, 20].\n5.2\nCapturing LTE Band Class 14\nThe SDR experiment for\
    \ analysis of band class 14 signals is conducted using the\nMotorola Solutions\
    \ band class 14 infrastructure. The band class 14 base station in\nthis scenario\
    \ has DL frequency range of 758 MHz to 768 MHz whereas the UL fre-\n83\n(a) Magnitude\

    \ The variation in the channel magnitude and phase is observed\ndue to the mobility\

    \ as speciﬁed in Fig. 3.5. Motorola APX7000L,\nan LTE-LMR converged device is\
    \ treated as a UE in this scenario. Ping requests\nare initiated over a user terminal\
    \ is routed via APX7000L to reach the remote host\nwhich generates the ping replies.\
    \ An another user terminal equipped with SDR\nsetup is used to capture these band\
    \ class 14 signals as shown in Fig. 5.2. The user\nterminal equipped with SDR\
    \ setup is running an open source LTE cell scanner and\nLTE tracker [20] tool\
    \ to identify and track the band class 14 cell. Fig. 5.3 shows\nthe identiﬁed\
    \ band class 14 cell with cell ID 27, with two transmit antennas, center\nfrequency\
    \ of 765.5 MHz, and receive power level of −33.6 dB. Overall 25 resource\nblocks\
    \ are occupied by the cell (channel bandwidth of 5 MHz), while the PHICH has\n\
    84\nnormal duration and the resource type one. The transfer functions of the wireless\n\
    channel from that port on the BS to the dongle’s antenna are shown in Fig. 5.4.\n\
    Fig. 5.4a shows the instantaneous magnitude transfer function of port 0 of cell\
    \ 27\nwhereas Fig. 5.4b shows the phase plot.\nThese analyses of LTE band class\
    \ 14 signals can assist PSC researchers in detect-\ning coverage holes in PSN\
    \ and gain knowledge on the quality of service experienced\nby the UEs.\n85\n\
    CHAPTER 6\nANALYSIS OF FEICIC IN TWO-TIER AG-HETNET\nIn this chapter, we investigate\
    \ the performance of inter-cell interference coordi-\nnation (ICIC) and cell range\
    \ expansion (CRE) techniques for an LTE band class 14\nPSC network\nas shown in\
    \ Fig. 1.2 for a suburban environment.\nBy randomly\nremoving macro base stations\
    \ (MBSs), we simulate a mock emergency situation\nto study the impact of interference\
    \ and CRE when the UABSs are deployed. The\ntwo-tier AG-HetNet simulation model\
    \ considers Rayleigh fading and simpliﬁed path\nloss model and Okumura-Hata model\
    \ for calculating the propagation losses. Sub-\nsequently, we explore potential\
    \ gains in 5pSE from the use of 3GPP Release 10/11\nICIC techniques. Furthermore,\
    \ we jointly optimize the UABSs locations, CRE pa-\nrameter of the UABSs, and\
    \ ICIC parameters for both MBSs and UABSs.\n6.1\nSystem Model\nIn the two-tier\
    \ AG-HetNet model, we consider a wireless network after a disaster\nas shown in\
    \ Fig. 6.1. In particular, Fig. 6.1(a) shows that most of the geographical\narea\
    \ in a typical PSC network is under SE coverage before a disaster. In the event\n\
    of a disaster, the PSC network infrastructure is destroyed, and the ﬁrst responders\n\
    and victim users experience SE outage as illustrated by white areas in Fig. 6.1(b).\n\
    In this scenario, the existing MBSs get overloaded with many UEs, and as a result,\n\
    these UEs begin to experience poor QoS. Subsequently, at the site of emergency,\n\
    the ﬁrst responders and victim users located in the spectral eﬃciency (SE) outage\n\
    regions will observe very low SE or possibly complete outage.\nTo address the\
    \ SE problems in a scenario as in Fig. 6.1(b), We consider a two-tier\nHetNet\
    \ deployment with MBSs and UABSs as shown in Fig. 1.2, where all the MBS\nand\
    \ UABS locations (in three dimensions) are captured in matrices Xmbs ∈ RNmbs×3\n\
    86\n(a) Typical PSC network.\n(b) PSC network after a disaster.\nFigure 6.1: Wireless\
    \ network coverage before/after a disaster with ﬁxed terrestrial\ninfrastructure.\n\
    and Xuabs ∈ RNuabs×3, respectively, where Nmbs and Nuabs denote the number of\n\
    MBSs and UABSs within the simulation area. The MBS and user equipment (UE)\nlocations\
    \ are each modeled using a two-dimensional Poisson point process (PPP)\nwith intensities\
    \ ˘mbs and ˘ue, respectively [58, 271]. The UABSs are deployed at\nﬁxed height\
    \ and their locations are either optimized using the genetic algorithm, or\nthey\
    \ are deployed on a ﬁxed hexagonal grid. The heights for each of these wireless\n\
    nodes are speciﬁed in Table 6.1.\nWe assume that the MBSs and the UABSs share\
    \ a common transmission band-\nwidth, round robin scheduling is used in all downlink\
    \ transmissions, and full buﬀer\ntraﬃc is used in every cell. The transmit power\
    \ of the MBS and UABS are Pmbs\nand Puabs, respectively, while K and K′ are the\
    \ attenuation factors due to geomet-\nrical parameters of antennas for the MBS\
    \ and the UABS, respectively. Then, the\neﬀective transmit power of the MBS is\
    \ P ′\nmbs = KPmbs, while the eﬀective transmit\npower of the UABS is P ′\nuabs\
    \ = K′Puabs.\n87\nAn arbitrary UE n is always assumed to connect to the nearest\
    \ MBS or UABS,\nwhere n ∈ {1, 2, ..., Nue}. Then, for the nth UE the reference\
    \ symbol received power\n(RSRP) from the macro-cell of interest (MOI) and the\
    \ UAV-cell of interest (UOI)\nare given by [58]\nSmbs(dmn) = P ′\nmbsH\n10ϕ/10\
    \ , Suabs(dun) = P ′\nuabsH\n10ϕ′/10 ,\n(6.1)\nwhere the random variable H ∼ Exp(1)\
    \ accounts for Rayleigh fading, ϕ is the path-\nloss observed from MBS in dB,\
    \ ϕ′ is the path-loss observed from UABS in dB, dmn\nis the distance from the\
    \ nearest MOI, and dun is the distance from the nearest UOI.\nIn this chapter,\
    \ the variation in deployment height of the UABSs and the eﬀects of\ndominant\
    \ line-of-sight links on 5pSE of the network are not treated explicitly and\n\
    left as a future work. Hence, Rayleigh fading channel is considered instead of\
    \ Rican\nfading channel in this system model.\n6.1.1\nPath Loss Model\nGiven the\
    \ complexity of signal propagation, an accurate path-loss modeling would\nrequire\
    \ complex ray tracing models and empirical measurements. To measure the\npath-loss\
    \ observed by the nth UE, we use the simpliﬁed path loss model (SPLM),\nwhich\
    \ is an approximation to the real propagation channel.\nHowever, for more\naccurate\
    \ analysis of the signal reliability requirements in PSC networks, we also\nimplement\
    \ the free space suburban Okumura-Hata path loss model (OHPLM) with\nLTE band\
    \ class 14 frequency [30, 272].\nSimpliﬁed Path Loss Model\nThe SPLM gives a coarse\
    \ analysis of signal propagation and is a function of path loss\nexponent and\
    \ the distance between the serving base station and the nth UE [273].\n88\n(a)\
    \ CDF of simpliﬁed path loss model.\n(b) CDF of Okumura-Hata model.\nFigure 6.2:\
    \ The CDF of the combined path loss observed from all the base stations\nin a\
    \ two-tier AG-HetNet. Dashed lines correspond to the scenario with 50% of the\n\
    MBS destroyed, while solid lines correspond to the scenario with 97.5% of the\
    \ MBS\ndestroyed.\nThe SPLM is a free space model and does not considered any\
    \ physical structures or\nother obstacles which might aﬀect the coverage of UABSs\
    \ in real world deployments.\nBased on the SPLM, the path-loss (in dB) observed\
    \ by the nth UE from mth MOI\nand uth UOI is given by\nϕ = 10log10(dδ\nmn), ϕ′\
    \ = 10log10(dδ\nun),\n(6.2)\nwhere δ is the path-loss exponent, and dun depends\
    \ on the locations of the UABSs\nthat will be dynamically optimized.\nFig. 6.2(a)\
    \ shows the empirical path-loss cumulative distribution functions (CDFs),\ncalculated\
    \ for all the distances between base stations (Xmbs and Xuabs) and UEs\n(Xue)\
    \ using (6.2). For the path-loss exponent value deﬁned in Table 6.1, we plot\n\
    the CDFs for the cases when 50% and 97.5% of the MBS are destroyed. Inspection\n\
    of Fig. 6.2(a) reveals the variation in CDFs is minimum for the diﬀerent number\
    \ of\nUABSs deployed and for a diﬀerent number of the MBSs destroyed. This is\
    \ because\n89\nthe SPLM does not consider external terrestrial factors. Nevertheless,\
    \ the maximum\nallowable path-loss for the system is 160 dB.\nOkumura-Hata Path\
    \ Loss Model\nThe OHPLM is more suited for a terrestrial environment with man-made\
    \ struc-\ntures and the environment in which the base-station height does not\
    \ vary signiﬁ-\ncantly [274, 275]. This model is a function of the carrier frequency,\
    \ distance between\nthe UE and the serving cell, base station height, and UE antenna\
    \ height [274, 276].\nBased on curve ﬁtting of Okumura’s original results, the\
    \ path-loss (in dB) observed\nby the nth UE from MOI and UOI is given by [277,\
    \ 278]\nϕ = A + Blog(dmn) + C,\n(6.3)\nϕ′ = A + Blog(dun) + C,\n(6.4)\nwhere the\
    \ distances dmn and dun are in km, and the factors A,B, and C depend on\nthe carrier\
    \ frequency and antenna height.\nIn a suburban environment, the factors A, B,\
    \ C are given by\nA = 69.55 + 26.16log(fc) − 13.82log(hbs) − a(hue),\n(6.5)\n\
    B = 44.9 − 6.55log(hbs),\n(6.6)\nC = −2log(fc/28)2 − 5.4,\n(6.7)\nwhere fc is\
    \ the carrier frequency in MHz, hbs is the height of the base station in\nmeter,\
    \ and a(hue) is the correction factor for the UE antenna height hue in meter,\n\
    which is deﬁned as\na(hue) = 1.1log(fc) − 0.7hue − 1.56log(fc) − 0.8 .\n(6.8)\n\
    Furthermore, OHPLM assumes the carrier frequency (fc) to be between 150\nMHz to\
    \ 1500 MHz, the height of the base station (hbs) between 30 m to 200 m, UE\n90\n\
    antenna height (hue) between 1 m to 10 m, and the distances dmn and dun between\
    \ 1\nkm to 10 km [277, 278]. Nevertheless, the simulation values considered for\
    \ OHPLM\nare deﬁned in Table 6.1.\nIn Fig. 6.2(b), we plot the empirical path-loss\
    \ CDFs using (6.3)–(6.8) and the\nOHPLM parameters in Table 6.1. Moreover, we\
    \ plot the OHPLM path-loss CDFs for\nthe cases when 50% and 97.5% of the MBS are\
    \ destroyed. Inspection of Fig. 6.2(b)\nreveals a step-wise distribution of path-loss\
    \ in the CDFs. This behavior is due to\nthe variation in the height of base-stations,\
    \ i.e., UABSs are deployed at the height\nof 100 m (larger path loss) while the\
    \ height of MBSs is 30 m (smaller path loss).\nWith 50% of the MBS destroyed,\
    \ it can be seen that most UEs are connected to the\nMBSs, while with 97.5% of\
    \ the MBS destroyed most UEs are served by the UABSs.\nRegardless, the maximum\
    \ allowable path-loss when 50% and 97.5% of the MBSs are\ndestroyed is 225 dB\
    \ as shown in Fig. 6.2(b).\n6.1.2\n3GPP Release 10/11 Inter-Cell Interference\
    \ Coordi-\nnation\nDue to their low transmission power, the UABSs are unable to\
    \ associate a larger\nnumber of UEs compared to that of MBSs. However, by using\
    \ the cell range ex-\npansion (CRE) technique deﬁned in 3GPP Release-8, UABSs\
    \ can associate a large\nnumber of UEs by oﬄoading traﬃc from the MBSs. A negative\
    \ side eﬀect of CRE\nincludes increased interference in the downlink of cell-edge\
    \ UEs or the UEs in CRE\nregion of the UABS, which is addressed by using ICIC\
    \ techniques in LTE and LTE-\nAdvanced [279–281].\n3GPP Release-10 introduced\
    \ a time-domain based enhanced ICIC (eICIC) tech-\nnique to address interference\
    \ problems. In particular, it uses ABSs which require the\n91\n(a) 3GPP Release-10\
    \ eICIC with ABS.\n(b) 3GPP Release-11 FeICIC with reduced power ABS (RP-ABS).\n\
    Figure 6.3: LTE-Advanced frame structures for time-domain ICIC in two-tier AG-\n\
    HetNet. Certain UABS subframes are protected from MBS.\nMBS to completely blank\
    \ the transmit power on the physical downlink shared chan-\nnel (PDSCH) resource\
    \ elements as shown in Fig. 6.3(a). This separates the radio\nframes into coordinated\
    \ subframes (CSF) and uncoordinated subframes (USF). On\nthe other hand, 3GPP\
    \ Release-11 deﬁnes further-enhanced ICIC (FeICIC), where\nthe data on PDSCH is\
    \ still transmitted but at a reduced power level as shown in\nFig. 6.3(b).\nThe\
    \ MBSs can schedule their UEs either in USF or in CSF based on the schedul-\n\
    ing threshold ρ. Similarly, the UABSs can schedule their UEs either in USF or\
    \ in\nCSF based on the scheduling threshold ρ′. Let β denote the USF duty cycle,\
    \ deﬁned\nas the ratio of number of USF subframes to the total number of subframes\
    \ in a radio\nframe. Then, the duty cycle of CSFs is (1−β). For ease of simulation,\
    \ in this chap-\nter, we consider that the USF duty cycle β is ﬁxed at 0.5 for\
    \ all the MBSs, which\nis shown in [58] to have limited eﬀect on system performance\
    \ when ρ and ρ′ are\n92\noptimized. Finally, let 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 denote the power reduction\
    \ factor in coordinated\nsubframes of the MBS for the FeICIC technique; α = 0\
    \ corresponds to Release-10\neICIC, while α = 1 corresponds to no ICIC (e.g.,\
    \ as in LTE Release-8). We assume\nthat the ABS and reduced power pattern are\
    \ shared via the X2 interface, which is\na logical interface between the base\
    \ stations.\nGiven the eICIC and FeICIC framework in 3GPP LTE-Advanced as in Fig.\
    \ 6.3,\nand following an approach similar to that in [58] for a HetNet scenario,\
    \ the signal-\nto-interference ratio (SIR) experienced by an arbitrary UE can\
    \ be deﬁned for CSFs\nand USFs for the MOI and the UOI as follows:\nΓ =\nSmbs(dmn)\n\
    Suabs(dun) + Z , → USF SIR from MOI\n(6.9)\nΓcsf =\nαSmbs(dmn)\nSuabs(dun) + Z\
    \ → CSF SIR from MOI,\n(6.10)\nΓ′ =\nSuabs(dun)\nSmbs(dmn) + Z → USF SIR from\
    \ UOI,\n(6.11)\nΓ′\ncsf =\nSuabs(dun)\nαSmbs(dmn) + Z → CSF SIR from UOI,\n(6.12)\n\
    where Z is the total interference power at a UE during USF or CSF from all the\n\
    MBSs and UABSs, excluding the MOI and the UOI. In hexagonal grid UABS de-\nployment\
    \ model (and in [58]), locations of the UABSs (and small cells) are ﬁxed.\nTo\
    \ maximize the 5pSE of the network, in this chapter we actively consider the\n\
    SIRs in (6.9)–(6.12) while optimizing the locations of the UABSs using the genetic\n\
    algorithm.\n6.1.3\nUE Association and Scheduling\nThe cell selection process relies\
    \ on Γ and Γ′ in (6.9) and (6.11), respectively, for\nthe MOI and UOI SIRs, as\
    \ well as the CRE τ.\nIf τΓ′ is less than Γ, then the\n93\nUE is associated with\
    \ the MOI; otherwise, it is associated with the UOI. After cell\nselection, the\
    \ MBS-UE (MUE) and UABS-UE (UUE) can be scheduled either in\nUSF or in CSF radio\
    \ subframes as:\nIf Γ > τΓ′ and Γ ≤ ρ → USF − MUE,\n(6.13)\nIf Γ > τΓ′ and Γ >\
    \ ρ → CSF − MUE,\n(6.14)\nIf Γ ≤τΓ′ and Γ′ > ρ′ → USF − UUE,\n(6.15)\nIf Γ ≤τΓ′\
    \ and Γ′ ≤ ρ′ → CSF − UUE.\n(6.16)\nOnce a UE is assigned to a MOI/UOI and is\
    \ scheduled within the USF/CSF radio\nframes, then the SE for this UE can be expressed\
    \ for the four diﬀerent scenarios in\n(6.13)-(6.16) as follows:\nCmbs\nusf = βlog2(1\
    \ + Γ)\nN mbs\nusf\n,\n(6.17)\nCmbs\ncsf\n= (1 − β)log2(1 + Γcsf)\nN mbs\ncsf\n\

    In this chapter, we consider only 5pSE is considered as the KPI for the two-tier\n\
    AG-HetNet. The use of 5pSE which corresponds to the worst ﬁfth percentile UE\n\
    capacity among the capacities of all the Nue UEs (calculated based on (6.17)-(6.20))\n\
    within the simulation area. We believe it is a critical metric particularly for\
    \ PSC\nscenarios to maintain a minimum QoS level at all the UEs in the environment.\
    \ We\n94\ndeﬁne the dependency of the 5pSE to UABS locations and ICIC parameters\
    \ as\nC5th\n\x10\nXuabs, SICIC\nmbs , SICIC\nuabs\n\x11\n,\n(6.21)\nwhere Xuabs\
    \ ∈ RNuabs×3 captures the UABS locations as deﬁned earlier, SICIC\nmbs =\n[α,\
    \ ρ] ∈ RNmbs×2 is a matrix that captures individual ICIC parameters for each\n\
    MBS, while SICIC\nuabs = [τ, ρ′] ∈ RNuabs×2 is a matrix that captures individual\
    \ ICIC\nparameters for each UABS. In particular,\nα = [α1, ..., αNmbs]T,\nρ =\
    \ [ρ1, ..., ρNmbs]T\n(6.22)\nare Nmbs × 1 vectors that include the power reduction\
    \ factor and MUE scheduling\nthreshold parameters for each MBS. On the other hand,\n\

    \ vectors that involve the CRE bias and UUE scheduling threshold at\neach UABS.\n\
    As noted in Section 6.1.2, the duty cycle β of ABS and reduced power subframes\n\
    is assumed to be set to 0.5 at all MBSs to reduce search space and complexity.\n\
    Considering that the optimum values of the vectors α, ρ, ρ′, and τ are to be\n\
    searched over a multi-dimensional space, computational complexity of ﬁnding the\n\
    optimum parameters is prohibitively high. Hence, to reduce the system complexity\n\
    (and simulation runtime) signiﬁcantly, we consider the same ICIC parameters are\n\
    used for all MBSs and for all UABSs.\nIn particular, we consider that for i =\n\
    1, ..., Nmbs we have αi = α and ρi = ρ, while for j = 1, ..., Nuabs we have τj\
    \ = τ and\nρ′\nj = ρ′. Therefore, the dependence of the 5pSE on the UABS locations\
    \ and ICIC\nparameters can be simpliﬁed as\nC5th(Xuabs, α, ρ, τ, ρ′) ,\n(6.24)\n\

    In this section, we discuss the UABS deployment using the genetic algorithm (GA)\n\
    and the hexagonal grid model, where we use the 5pSE as an optimization metric\

    \ locations and ICIC\nnetwork parameters in order to maximize the 5pSE of the\
    \ network over a given\ngeographical area of interest. The location of each UABS\
    \ within a rectangular sim-\nulation area is given by (xi, yi) where i ∈ {1, 2,\

    \ we use the GA to ﬁnd optimum\nUABS locations and the best-ﬁt ICIC parameters\

    \ when the UABSs are\ndeployed on a hexagonal grid and utilizing optimized ICIC\
    \ parameters (see (6.26)\nand Algorithm 2). In Fig. 6.7 and Fig. 6.9, we plot\
    \ the variations in 5pSE with\nrespect to CRE while using SPLM and OHPLM, respectively.\n\
    5pSE with Simpliﬁed Path Loss model\nIn Fig. 6.7(a), we plot the 5pSE variation\

    \ shows\nthat the peak value of 5pSE for NIM is observed at around 0 dB CRE. This\
    \ is\nbecause, with no CRE, the number of UEs associated with the UABSs and the\
    \ in-\nterference experienced by these UEs is minimal. Moreover, as the CRE increases,\
    \ the\nnumber of UEs associated with the UABSs increases and so does the interference\n\
    experienced by these UEs. Hence, with NIM the 5pSE decreases with increasing\n\
    CRE as seen in Fig. 6.7(a).\nThe performance of 3GPP Release-10 and Release-11\
    \ ICIC techniques in terms\nof 5pSE and the variation in CRE are plotted in Fig.\
    \ 6.7(b) and Fig. 6.7(c). As\nnoted in Section 6.1.2, the transmission power during\
    \ blank subframes at the MBSs\nfor eICIC is 0, and power reduction of the CSFs\
    \ at the MBSs for FeICIC is αP ′\nmbs.\nUsing this understanding, the analysis\
    \ Fig. 6.7(b) and Fig. 6.7(c) shows that the\n5pSE for ICIC techniques at 0 dB\

    \ performance with increasing CRE\nand the peak values of the 5pSE for the ICIC\
    \ techniques is observed when the\nCRE is between 6 − 9 dB. This inﬂuence of CRE\
    \ on the 5pSE for NIM and 3GPP\nRelease-10 and Release-11 ICIC techniques are\
    \ summarized in Fig. 6.8.\n102\nFigure 6.8: Peak observations for the 5pSE with\

    \ Model\nIn Fig. 6.9(a), we plot the 5pSE variation with respect to CRE for NIM.\
    \ In the case\nof NIM, all the base stations (MBSs and UABSs) always transmit\
    \ at full power (P ′\nmbs\nand P ′\nuabs). The peak value of 5pSE for NIM is observed\
    \ at around 3 dB CRE when\n50% of the MBSs are destroyed. On the other hand, when\
    \ 97.5% of the MBSs are\ndestroyed, even though the number of existing MBSs are\
    \ small and the interference\nis minimum, the higher path-loss presents higher\
    \ probability for a cell-edge UE to\nfall out of coverage area. Moreover, in the\
    \ absence of any ICIC, using CRE can\nmagnify the impact of interference. Hence,\
    \ the 5pSE gains with NIM are close to\nzero.\nIn Fig. 6.9(b) and Fig. 6.9(c),\
    \ we plot the variation of 5pSE with respect to CRE\nfor 3GPP Release-10/11 ICIC\
    \ techniques. The analysis of Fig. 6.9(b) and Fig. 6.9(c)\nshows that the ICIC\
    \ techniques observe improvement in 5pSE performance with in-\ncreasing CRE. When\
    \ 50% MBS are destroyed, the 5pSE peak values for the eICIC\nand FeICIC are observed\

    \ and Fig. 6.9(c). Fur-\nther analysis show that the FeICIC technique observes\

    \ to NIM and eICIC. This inﬂuence of CRE on the\n5pSE for NIM and 3GPP Release-10/11\
    \ ICIC techniques is summarized in Fig. 6.10.\nOn comparison of Fig. 6.8 and Fig.\
    \ 6.10, we observe modest deviation in peak\nvalues of 5pSE between NIM, eICIC,\
    \ and FeICIC with SPLM. This is because UEs\nexperience better SIR with lower\
    \ path-losses. Whereas, with OHPLM we observe\nsigniﬁcant deviation in the peak\
    \ values of 5pSE due to higher path-losses. However,\nthe higher path-losses in\
    \ OHPLM can be compensated by using modest/higher CRE\nvalues and 3GPP Release-10/11\
    \ ICIC techniques.\nOverall, with hexagonal grid deployment for both the path-loss\
    \ models, the 5pSE\nfor the network is higher when larger number of UABSs are\
    \ deployed and when\nfewer MBSs are destroyed. Also, the 5pSE decreases with the\
    \ increasing number of\ndestroyed MBSs as seen in Fig. 6.7 and Fig. 6.9.\n105\n\

    \ the key 5pSE observations, when UABS locations\nand ICIC parameters optimized\
    \ through the GA as in (6.25) and Algorithm 1. In\nFig. 6.11 and Fig. 6.13, we\
    \ plot the peak 5pSE for the network using the GA, versus\nthe optimized CRE value\
    \ while using SPLM and OHPLM, respectively. In the GA\nbased simulations, the\
    \ optimum CRE value is directly related to the locations of the\nUABSs with respect\
    \ to the MBSs, the number of UEs oﬄoaded to the UABSs, and\nthe amount of interference\
    \ observed by the UEs.\n5pSE with Simpliﬁed Path Loss Model\nIn Fig. 6.11(a) and\
    \ Fig. 6.11(b), we plot the peak 5pSE with respect to the optimized\nCRE value\
    \ for eICIC and FeICIC, respectively, for SPLM. Inspection of Fig. 6.11(a)\n106\n\
    and Fig. 6.11(b) shows higher values of CRE when 50% of the MBSs are destroyed\n\
    and implies the presence of substantial interference from these large number of\n\
    MBSs. Hence, oﬄoading a large number of UEs from MBSs to UABSs with higher\nvalues\
    \ of CRE is necessary for achieving better 5pSE gains.\nOn the other hand, when\
    \ most of the infrastructure is destroyed (i.e., when\n97.5% of the MBSs destroyed),\
    \ the interference observed from the MBSs is limited,\nand a larger number of\
    \ UEs need to be served by the UABSs.\nTherefore, with\nfewer UABSs deployed,\
    \ higher CRE is required to serve a larger number of UEs\nand achieve better 5pSE.\
    \ On the other hand, when a larger number of UABSs are\ndeployed, smaller values\
    \ of CRE will result in better 5pSE gains. We record these\nbehavior in Fig. 6.11(a)\
    \ and Fig. 6.11(b) for eICIC and FeICIC, respectively.\n(a) SIR observations for\

    \ values of CRE are required for UABSs to\ncompensate for the high path-loss and\
    \ under-utilization of radio resources by the\nMBSs in CSF radio subframes. When\
    \ 50% and 97.5% of the MBSs are destroyed, the\npeak 5pSE values for eICIC are\
    \ achieved with minimal SIR values, and by oﬄoading\na large number of UEs from\
    \ MBSs to UABSs as seen in Fig. 6.13(a).\nOn the other hand, with 3GPP Release-11\
    \ reduced power subframes (FeICIC),\nMBSs can establish and maintain connectivity\
    \ with suﬃcient number of cell-edge\nMUEs, while oﬄoading the out-of-coverage\

    \ the GA and when the\nUABSs are deployed in a ﬁxed hexagonal grid.\nCRE and optimized\
    \ location provides a better 5pSE than the UABSs deployed on\na ﬁxed hexagonal\
    \ grid. Furthermore, Fig. 6.14 shows that the 5pSE gains from the\noptimization\
    \ of UABS locations are more signiﬁcant when 50% of the MBSs are\ndestroyed and\
    \ less signiﬁcant when 97.5% of the MBSs are destroyed.\nWhen 50% MBSs are destroyed,\
    \ there are still a large number of MBSs present\nwhich causes substantial interference.\
    \ Hence, in such interference driven scenario\nit is important to optimize the\
    \ locations of the UABSs, and use of larger number\nof UABSs to provide signiﬁcant\
    \ gains in the 5pSE. On the other hand, with 97.5%\nof the MBSs destroyed, the\
    \ interference from the MBSs is small, and deploying the\nUABSs on a hexagonal\
    \ grid will perform close to optimum UABS deployment.\nInﬂuence of OHPLM on 5pSE\n\
    In Fig. 6.15, we compare the 5pSE observations with OHPLM shown in Fig. 6.9\n\
    and Fig. 6.13. The comparative analysis reveals that UABSs deployment with op-\n\
    110\ntimized CRE and optimized location provides a better 5pSE than the UABSs\
    \ that\nare deployed on a ﬁxed hexagonal grid.\nWith eICIC in Release-10, when\
    \ 50% and 97.5% of the MBSs are destroyed,\nthe 5pSE gains from the optimized\
    \ UABS locations are signiﬁcant as shown in\nFig. 6.15(a). On the other hand,\
    \ with FeICIC in Release-11, the 5pSE gains from the\noptimized UABS locations\
    \ are more signiﬁcant when 50% of the MBSs are destroyed\nas seen in Fig. 6.15(b).\
    \ However, the diﬀerence between the hexagonal deployment\nand optimized deployment\
    \ is especially small since the power reduction factor α\nin the MBS CSFs provides\
    \ an additional optimization dimension for improving the\n5pSE. Use of a larger\
    \ number of UABSs when 97.5% of the MBSs are destroyed is\nshown to provide modest\
    \ gains in the 5pSE, in contrast to signiﬁcant gains in the\n5pSE when 50% of\
    \ the MBSs are destroyed.\n6.3.4\nComparison of Computation Times for Diﬀerent\
    \ UABS\nDeployment Algorithms\nIn this subsection, we compare the computation\
    \ times for the GA and hexagonal\ngrid deployment techniques with ICIC optimization.\
    \ Using an Intel Core i7-4810\ncentral processing unit operating at 2.8 GHz, 24\
    \ GB of random access memory,\nand Monte-Carlo experimental approach, we calculate\
    \ the mean runtime for the\nMatlab simulations. In Fig. 6.16, we plot the mean\
    \ runtime required for calculating\nthe optimal ICIC network parameters and optimized\
    \ UABS locations using (6.25),\nAlgorithm 1, and the simulation values deﬁned\
    \ in Table 6.1. Inspection of Fig. 6.16\nreveals FeICIC technique requires similar\
    \ computational time when compared to\nthe eICIC technique for GA based optimization.\
    \ The main reason for this is that\nthe large search space for UABS locations,\
    \ which are common in both FeICIC and\n111\nFigure 6.16: GA simulation runtime\

    \ AG-HetNet model.\nFigure 6.17: Fixed hexagonal grid simulation runtime using\
    \ FeICIC and eICIC\ntechnique with OHPLM and SPLM for the proposed two-tier AG-HetNet\
    \ model.\neICIC based approaches, dominates the computation time when compared\
    \ with the\noptimization of ICIC parameters.\nOn the other hand, in Fig. 6.17,\
    \ we plot the mean runtime required for UABS de-\nployment on a hexagonal grid\
    \ using (6.26), the simulation values deﬁned in Table 6.1,\nand with ﬁxed step\
    \ size for the ICIC parameters. Inspection of Fig. 6.17 reveals\nFeICIC technique\
    \ requires signiﬁcantly higher computational time when compared\n112\nto the eICIC\
    \ technique. The main reason for this behavior is due to additional\ncomputation\
    \ required for optimizing the power reduction factor α for the FeICIC\napproach.\
    \ In general, with the GA and the hexagonal grid deployment, when larger\nnumber\
    \ of UABSs are deployed, and larger number of the MBSs are present, the\nmean\
    \ runtime is the largest. On the other hand, the mean runtime decreases with\n\
    smaller number of UABSs deployed and when a smaller number of MBSs are present.\n\
    Moreover, the comparative analysis of Fig. 6.16 and Fig. 6.17 reveals that optimiza-\n\
    tion (ICIC parameters and UABS locations) using GA requires signiﬁcantly more\n\
    computational time when compared to UABSs deployment on a hexagonal grid.\nTo\
    \ summarize, the GA is a suitable meta-heuristic technique that relies on bio-\n\
    inspired approach that uses mutations, crossovers, and selections of chromosomes,\n\
    for ﬁnding optimum or close to optimum solution of a search problem.\nOn the\n\
    other hand, the computational complexity required to optimize the considered UAV\n\
    deployment optimization problems in real world using the GA techniques require\n\
    further investigations.\n113\nCHAPTER 7\nHEURISTIC APPROACH FOR JOINTLY OPTIMIZING\
    \ FEICIC\nAND UAV LOCATIONS IN MULTI-TIER LTE-ADVANCED PUBLIC\nSAFETY HETNET\n\
    In order to integrate the UAVs as both AUEs and UABSs, would require a\nsystem-level\
    \ understanding to both modify and extend the existing terrestrial net-\nwork\
    \ infrastructure. A vital goal while planning any AG-HetNet is to ensure ubiq-\n\
    uitous data coverage with broadband rates. To achieve this goal, we deﬁne and\n\
    simulate an AG-HetNet system model for an urban environment with public safety\n\
    LTE band class 14, as illustrated in Fig. 1.3.\nThe proposed AG-HetNet model\n\
    leverages on 3GPP Release 8 CRE, 3GPP Release 10/11 ICIC, 3GPP Release 12\nthree-dimensional\
    \ (3D) beamforming (3DBF), and 3GPP Release 15 enhanced sup-\nport for UAVs. Consequently,\
    \ to assess the performance of this AG-HetNet, we\nconsider both coverage probability\
    \ and ﬁfth percentile spectral eﬃciency as the key\nperformance indicators (KPIs).\
    \ To maximize the two KPIs of the system model, we\njointly optimize the UABS\
    \ locations in 2D and ICIC and CRE network parameters\nusing a brute-force technique,\
    \ genetic algorithm (GA), and elitist harmony search\nalgorithm based on the genetic\
    \ algorithm (eHSGA), while mitigating intercell inter-\nference. To reduce the\
    \ complexity of the optimization algorithms, the deployment\nheight of UABS is\
    \ not considered during joint optimization. However, we do investi-\ngate the\
    \ impact of UABS height on the overall performance of the wireless network\nby\
    \ manually varying the deployment heights.\n7.1\nSystem Model\nWe consider a three-tier\
    \ AG-HetNet deployment, where all the MBS, PBS and\nUABS locations (in 3D) are\
    \ captured in matrices Xmbs ∈ RNmbs×3, Xpbs ∈ RNpbs×3,\n114\nand Xuabs ∈ RNuabs×3,\
    \ respectively, with Nmbs, Npbs and Nuabs denoting the number\nof MBSs, PBSs,\
    \ and UABSs within the simulation area (Asim). Similarly, the 3D\ndistribution\
    \ of GUEs and AUEs are respectively captured in matrices Xgue and Xaue.\nAssuming\
    \ a ﬁxed antenna height, the location of wireless nodes MBS, PBS, GUE,\nand AUE\
    \ are modeled using a 2D Poisson point process (PPP), with densities λmbs,\nλpbs,\
    \ λgue and λaue, respectively. On the other hand, UABS locations are either\n\
    optimized using an eHSGA or GA or deployed on a ﬁxed hexagonal grid at low-\n\
    altitude and medium-altitude [282]. The densities and deployment heights each\
    \ of\nthe wireless nodes are speciﬁed in Table 7.2.\nLet Nue be the total numbers\
    \ of UEs (AUEs + GUEs) to be scheduled, then\nthe nearest distance of an arbitrary\
    \ nth UE from any macrocell of interest (MOI),\npicocell of interest (POI), and\
    \ UABS-cell of interest (UOI) is given by don, dpn, and\ndun, respectively. Then\
    \ assuming Nakagami-m fading channel, the reference symbol\nreceived power from\
    \ MOI, POI, and UOI is given by\nRmbs(don) = PmbsAE(φ, θ)H\n10ϕ(don)/10\n,\nRpbs(dpn)\
    \ = PpbsAE(φ, θ)H\n10ϕ(dpn)/10\n,\nRuabs(dun) = PuabsAE(φ, θ)H\n10ϕ(dun)/10\n\
    ,\n(7.1)\nwhere variables ϕ(don), ϕ(dpn), and ϕ(dun) are path-loss respectively\
    \ observed\nfrom MBS, PBS, and UABS in dB. And random variable H accounts for\
    \ Nakagami-\nm fading, whose probability density function is given by [234]\n\
    fN(ω, m) = mmωm−1\nΓ(m)\nexp(−mω),\n(7.2)\nwhere m is the shaping parameter, ω\
    \ is the channel amplitude and Γ(m) is the\nstandard Gamma function given as Γ(m)\
    \ =\nR ∞\n0 exp(−u)um−1du. Through shaping\n115\nparameter m, received signal\
    \ power can be approximated to variable fading condi-\ntions. The value m > 1\
    \ approximates to Rician fading along line-of-sight (LOS) and\nm = 1 approximates\
    \ to Rayleigh fading along non-LOS (NLOS). Furthermore, us-\ning the deﬁnition\
    \ of zenith (θ) and azimuth (φ) spherical angles and spherical unit\nvectors in\
    \ a Cartesian coordinate, we deﬁne variable AE(φ, θ) as the transmitter\nantenna’s\
    \ 3DBF element and is deﬁned in [283] as\nAE(φ, θ) = GE,max − min { − (AH(φ) +\
    \ AV (θ)), Am},\n(7.3)\nAm − 30 dB, GE,max = 8 dBi,\nwhere antenna element for\
    \ horizontal (AH(φ)) and vertical (AE(θ)) radiation pat-\ntern, respectively is\
    \ given by\nAH(φ) = − min\n\x14\n12\n\x12 φ\nφ3dB\n\x132\n, Am\n\x15\n, φ3dB =\
    \ 65◦,\n(7.4)\nAE(θ) = − min\n\x14\n12\n\x12θ − θtilt\nθ3dB\n\x132\n, SLAV\n\x15\
    \n, θtilt = 90◦,\n(7.5)\nSLAV = 30, θ3dB = 65◦.\nUsing 3DBF, the power transmission\
    \ from MBS (Pmbs), PBS (Ppbs), and UABS\n(Puabs) can be controlled at UEs in cell-edge/CRE\
    \ region. Thus limiting the power\ntransmission into adjacent cells which causes\
    \ inter-cell interference and subsequently\nimproving signal-to-interference ratio\
    \ (SIR) of the desired signal [284].\n7.1.1\nPath Loss Model\nIn an urban environment,\
    \ based on the type of communication link, i.e., ground-\nto-ground (GTG), any-to-air\
    \ (ATA), and air-to-ground (ATG) between a UE and\n116\nbase-station (BS) of interest,\
    \ we consider distinct path-loss models for accurate\nanalysis of signal reliability\
    \ for the proposed AG-HetNet.\nGTG Communication Link\nWe consider Okumura-Hata\
    \ Path Loss (OHPL) while estimating the GTG com-\nmunication link between GUE\
    \ and terrestrial MBS and PBS. The OHPL is better\nsuited to an urban terrestrial\
    \ environment, in which the base-station height does\nnot vary [36, 274] signiﬁcantly.\
    \ When a GUE camps on a terrestrial base-station\nof interest (MOI or POI), OHPL\
    \ is given by\nϕ(d) = 74.52 + 26.16log(fc) − 20.37log(hbs) − 3.2(log(11.75hgue))2\
    \ + 38.35log(d),\n(7.6)\nwhere fc is the carrier frequency in MHz, hgue is the\
    \ height of GUE in meter, and\nhbs is the height of terrestrial base-station in\
    \ meter i.e., height of MBS is given by\nhmbs and PBS by hpbs.\nATA Communication\
    \ Link\nWhenever, an AUE camps on any nearest base-station, we consider a 3D channel\n\
    model for an urban-macro with aerial (UMa-AV) scenario deﬁned in 3GPP Release-\n\

    \ AUE\nand the base-station of interest, and haue is the height of AUE in meter\
    \ such that\n22.5m < haue ≤ 300m for ϕLOS(d) and 10.0m < haue ≤ 100m for ϕNLOS(d).\n\

    \ between AUE and the base-station of interest such\nthat d2D ≤ 4km, and the factors\
    \ p1 and d1 (in meters) are given by\np1 = 4300log10(haue) − 3800,\nd1 = max(460log10(haue)\
    \ − 700, 18).\nUsing this model, we calculate the average path loss over the probabilities\
    \ of\nLOS and NLOS communication link between AUE and the camping base-station.\n\
    Then using (7.7) and (7.8), the average path loss is given by\nPLavg = PLOS ×\
    \ ϕLOS + (1 − PLOS) × ϕNLOS.\n(7.9)\nATG Communication Link\nWhenever, a GUE camps\
    \ on a UOI, we consider a more conventionally used LOS/NLOS\npath loss model deﬁned\
    \ in the literature [217, 286, 287] and is given by\nϕuabs(d) =\ny\nY\nx=0\n\"\

    where huabs is the deployment height of UABS, y = ﬂoor(r\np\nζξ −1), r is the\
    \ ground\ndistance between the UABS and GUE, ζ is the ratio of built-up land area\
    \ to the total\nland area, ξ is the mean number of buildings per unit area (buildings/km2),\
    \ and Ω\ncharacterizes the building height (denoted by HB) distribution in meters\
    \ and is based\non a Rayleigh distribution: f(HB) = HB\nΩ2 exp(\n−H2\nB\n2Ω2 ).\
    \ Furthermore, we consider LOS\nprobability PLOS(ϕuabs) as a continuous function\
    \ of θ and environment factors. By\n118\nFigure 7.1: The CDF of path loss observed\

    \ cumulative distribution functions\n(CDFs), calculated for all distances between\
    \ base stations (Xmbs, Xpbs, and Xuabs)\nand UEs (Xgue and Xaue), using conditions\
    \ deﬁned in previous paragraph. Inspec-\ntion of Fig. 7.1 reveals that the maximum\
    \ allowable path loss is diverse for GTG,\nATG, and ATA communication links. This\
    \ variation is primarily due to the envi-\nronmental factors and LOS/NLOS probability\
    \ of communication link. Nevertheless,\nmaximum allowable path-loss for the models\
    \ used in GTG, ATA, and ATG link is\napproximately 255 dB, 216 dB, and 154 dB,\
    \ respectively.\n119\nFigure 7.2: The proposed three-tier reduced power USF/CSF\

    Spectral Eﬃciency with 3GPP Release-10/11 ICIC\nDue to their low transmission\
    \ power, the small cells such as the PBS and UABS\nare unable to associate a substantial\
    \ number of UEs compared to that of MBSs.\nTherefore, we consider the CRE technique\
    \ deﬁned in 3GPP Release-8 at small cells\nto extend the network coverage and\
    \ increase capacity by oﬄoading traﬃc from\ncongested cells. Although an adverse\
    \ side eﬀect of CRE includes increased interfer-\nence at UEs in the cell-edge\
    \ or CRE region. To address this intercell interference,\nboth MBS and PBS are\
    \ capable of using ICIC techniques deﬁned in 3GPP Release-\n10/11 [36], wherein\
    \ both MBS and PBS can transmit radio frames at reduced power\nlevels as shown\
    \ in Fig.7.2.\nThe radio subframes with reduced power are termed as coordinated\
    \ subframes\n(CSF) and full power as uncoordinated subframes (USF). The power\
    \ reduction factor\nof radio subframes at MBS is given by αmbs and αpbs at PBS.\
    \ In particular, αmbs =\nαpbs = 0 corresponds to Release-10 almost blank subframes\
    \ (ABS) eICIC, αmbs =\nαpbs = 1 corresponds to no ICIC, and otherwise corresponds\
    \ to reduced power\nFeICIC deﬁned in Release-11. As illustrated in Fig.7.2, using\

    \ We coordinate the USF/CSF duty cycle using\nβmbs and (1−βmbs) at MBS and βpbs\
    \ and (1−βpbs) at PBS. The proposed AG-HetNet\nmodel assumes that the power reduction\
    \ pattern and radio subframes duty cycle is\nshared via the X2 interface, which\
    \ is a logical interface between the base-stations.\nAlthough applying the ICIC\
    \ technique at each base-station reduces the intercell\ninterference with adjacent\
    \ cells, it also reduces the desired SIR at the scheduled UEs.\nTherefore, to\
    \ improve the desired SIR, we consider the 3DBF at each transmitting\nbase-station\
    \ to restrict the beamforming and power transmission to the location of\nscheduled\
    \ UE [284].\nGiven the ICIC framework in 3GPP LTE-Advanced and using a three-tier\
    \ re-\nduced power USF/CSF structure given in Fig. 7.2, we deﬁne the SIR experienced\n\
    by a nth arbitrary UE scheduled in USF/CSF of MOI, POI, and UOI by following\n\
    an approach similar to that given in [36]. Then, let Γmbs\nusf , Γmbs\ncsf , Γpbs\n\
    usf , Γpbs\ncsf , Γuabs\nusf , and\nΓuabs\ncsf\nbe the SIRs for the UE scheduled\
    \ in the USF/CSF of MOI, POI, and UOI,\nrespectively and is deﬁned in Table 7.1.\
    \ Wherein, Iagg is the aggregate interference\nat the UE from all the base-stations,\
    \ except the MOI, POI, and UOI.\n121\nFigure 7.3: Cell selection and UE association\
    \ in USF/CSF subframes of MBS, PBS,\nand UABS in three-tier AG-HetNet.\nThe cell\
    \ selection process relies on the deﬁnition of MOI, POI, and UOI SIRs\ngiven in\
    \ Table 7.1, as well as the CRE τpbs at PBSs and τuabs at UABSs. Using\npositive\
    \ biased CRE τpbs at PBSs and τuabs at UABSs, the small cells can further\nexpand\
    \ their SIR coverage. Consequently, during the cell selection process, a UE\n\
    always camps on an MOI/POI/UOI that yields the best SIR. After cell selection,\n\
    an MBS-UE (MUE), PBS-UE (PUE), and UABS-UE (UUE) would be scheduled in\neither\
    \ USF/CSF radio subframes based on the scheduling threshold of MBS (ρmbs)),\n\
    PBS (ρpbs), and UABS (ρuabs). This strategy of cell selection and UE scheduling\
    \ in\nUSF/CSF of MOI/POI/UOI is similar to that of [36] and is summarized in Fig.\
    \ 7.3.\nOnce the nth arbitrary UE is assigned to an MOI/POI/UOI and scheduled\n\
    within the USF/CSF, then using the SIR deﬁnitions, the SE of a UE scheduled in\n\
    the three-tier USF/CSF subframes is deﬁned by Cmbs\nusf , Cmbs\ncsf , Cpbs\nusf\

    In the proposed system model of three-tier AG-HetNet, 5pSE corresponds to the\n\
    worst ﬁfth percentile UE capacity amongst all of the scheduled UEs. On the other\n\
    hand, we deﬁne the coverage probability of the network as the percentage of an\n\
    area having broadband rates and capacity larger than a threshold of TCSE. The\n\
    primary goal of this simulation study is to maximize these two KPIs while obtaining\n\
    the best ﬁt ICIC network conﬁguration and optimal UABS locations using a brute\n\
    force algorithm, genetic algorithm, and elitist harmony search based on the genetic\n\
    algorithm.\nConsider individual locations (xi, yi) of each UABS i ∈ {1, 2, ...,\

    \ the UABSs are initially de-\nployed on a ﬁxed hexagonal grid, as shown in Fig.\
    \ 7.4(a), and every UABS sends\nits locations and all the base-stations send the\

    \ Subsequently, a brute-force tech-\nnique will be used to optimize the only the\
    \ ICIC network parameters and evaluate\nthe 5pSE and coverage probability for\
    \ this ﬁxed AG-HetNet. Then, a centralized\nserver can run any appropriate heuristic\
    \ algorithm to jointly optimize the UABS\nlocations and ICIC parameters, as illustrated\
    \ in Fig. 7.4(b). Then, for the proposed\nAG-HetNet the best state (S′KPI) of\

    \ GA has limitations in terms of low convergence\nspeed and requires high computation\
    \ time.\nFurther, to obtain possible improvement over GA, we explore elitist harmony\n\
    search based on the genetic algorithm proposed in [288]. We extend the approach\
    \ of\nthe proposed hybrid algorithm to optimize the UABS locations and ICIC network\n\
    parameters. In the main procedure, the initial population generated using GA is\n\
    128\nconsidered as the harmony memory and the chromosome illustrated in Fig. 7.5\
    \ as\nthe harmony. Let Si be the ith element of harmony S; ui and li are the upper/lower\n\
    bounds of the ith variable; rand() is a uniformly-distributed real random number\
    \ in\n[0, 1] [288]. Then, we initialize the eHSGA parameters such as the harmony\
    \ mem-\nory size (SZHM), harmony memory consideration rate (RHMC), pitch adjustment\
    \ rate\n(par), maximum number of improvisation (NIMP) and fret width (fr). The\
    \ RHMC\nand par parameters in harmony search are critical to controlling the performance\n\
    and speed of the convergence of the solution. To guarantee that the hybrid search\n\
    method can expeditiously detect its way by avoiding local optima and the solution\n\
    reached is diverse, RHMC is updated linearly decreasing with the iteration and\
    \ par\nis dynamically adapted in linearly increasing rates. Then, we evaluate\
    \ the ﬁtness of\nevery harmony in the harmony memory and sort the harmony memory\
    \ in descend-\ning order of best ﬁtness. This sorting ensures the harmony memory\
    \ head always\npoints to the best harmony member. Subsequently, using selection,\
    \ crossover, and\nmutation, new harmony memory is generated. A merge rule is applied\
    \ to sorted har-\nmony memory and new harmony memory to generate an elitist harmony\
    \ memory.\nAs described in Algorithm 5, through an iterative process, elitism\
    \ is employed in the\nsearch process of obtaining optimal UABS locations and ICIC\
    \ network parameters.\n7.3\nSimulation Results\nIn this section, with the help\

    \ Table 7.4 and Table 7.3.\n141\nComparison of Computational Complexity Gains\n\
    In this subsection, we compare the computational complexity gains for brute-force,\n\
    GA, and eHSGA techniques with/without ICIC optimization and when UABSs are\ndeployed\
    \ at 25 m, 36 m, and 50 m. Using the NCSU high-performance computing\nserver,\
    \ and Monte-Carlo experimental approach, we calculate the mean runtime for\nMatlab\
    \ simulation while evaluating an individual KPI. In Fig. 7.11, we plot the mean\n\
    runtime required for calculating the peak KPI value with optimal ICIC network\n\
    parameters and UABS locations using (7.12), brute-force given in Algorithm 3,\
    \ GA\ngiven in Algorithm 4, eHSGA given in Algorithm 5, and the simulation values\
    \ deﬁned\nin Table 7.2.\nIn an initial inspection of Fig. 7.11, we observe reduced\
    \ power FeICIC technique\nrequires signiﬁcantly higher computational time when\
    \ compared to the ABS eICIC\nand without ICIC techniques, for diﬀerent deployment\
    \ heights of UABS (25 m, 36\nm, and 50 m) and optimization techniques (brute-force,\
    \ GA, and eHSGA). The\nreduced power FeICIC technique requires signiﬁcantly higher\
    \ computational time\nbecause the optimization of power reduction parameters (αmbs\
    \ and αpbs) of the\nthree-tier LTE subframes, increases the scope of search space\
    \ when compare to\nABS eICIC and without ICIC techniques. Further analysis of\
    \ Fig. 7.11 reveals that\noptimization (ICIC parameters and UABS locations) using\
    \ GA and eHSGA both\nrequire signiﬁcantly more computational time when compared\
    \ to the brute-force\ntechnique. In particular, for lower complexity eICIC and\
    \ without ICIC techniques,\neHSGA observes substantial computational complexity\
    \ gains between 10.65−29.14%\nover GA. Whereas with higher complexity reduced\
    \ power FeICIC technique, eHSGA\nobserves marginal computational complexity gains\
    \ of upto 7% over GA.\nWhereas, the UABS deployment height of 50 m observes a\
    \ sparse increment in\nthe computation time when compared to 36 m and 25 m, while\
    \ jointly optimizing\n142\nthe ICIC parameters and UABS locations in the same\
    \ search space. The higher\ndeployment heights of the UABS improve LOS to the\
    \ UEs but also increases in-\nterference probability with UEs in cell-edge/CRE\
    \ and consequently increases the\ncomputation time to optimize the ICIC parameters\
    \ and UABS locations.\nTo summarize, although the computational complexity required\
    \ to optimize the\nICIC network parameters and UAV locations using heuristic techniques\
    \ (GA and\neHSGA) is higher, but is eﬀective in achieving broadband rates.\nIn\
    \ particular,\nthe heuristic techniques can meet the public safety network requirement\
    \ of 95%\ngeographical coverage with broadband rates [59]. Furthermore, from Fig.\
    \ 7.11, Ta-\nble 7.3, and Table 7.4, we observe hybrid eHSGA achieves marginal\
    \ computational\ncomplexity gain over meta-heuristic GA technique. Whereas, optimization\
    \ using\nGA marginally improves KPI gains when compared to optimization using\
    \ eHSGA.\nHence the determination of an appropriate heuristic algorithm, which\
    \ achieves the\ntrade-oﬀ between computational complexity and ﬁnding optimum or\
    \ close to the\noptimum solution of a search problem in the real world, requires\
    \ further investiga-\ntion.\n143\nTable 7.4: 5pSE peak value observations in bps/kHz.\n\

    CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORKS\nEnsuring ubiquitous mission-critical public\
    \ safety communications to all the ﬁrst\nresponders in the public safety network\
    \ is crucial at an emergency site. LTE/LTE-\nAdvanced has emerged as a broadband\
    \ communication technology that has a poten-\ntial to transform the capabilities\
    \ of public safety technologies by providing broad-\nband, ubiquitous, and mission-critical\
    \ voice and data support. In this research, we\nstudied the legacy and LTE-Advanced\
    \ public safety networks and addressed some\nof the important challenges which\
    \ can be categorized into capacity and coverage\nenhancements, interference coordination,\
    \ location optimization of UABSs, and en-\nergy eﬃciency enhancements. In this\
    \ chapter, we present the concluding remarks\non diﬀerent research tasks explained\
    \ earlier.\nIn Chapter 3, an overview of legacy and emerging public safety communication\n\
    technologies is presented along with the spectrum allocation for public safety\
    \ usage\nacross all the frequency bands in the United States. As a case study\
    \ discuss the\narchitecture of FirstNet which is a nationwide coast-to-coast public\
    \ safety network\nbased of LTE broadband technology.\nFurthermore, the challenges\
    \ involved with\nPSN operations are described, and the beneﬁts of LTE-based PSN\
    \ over LMRS are\nalso discussed. The comparative survey of legacy and the LTE-based\
    \ public safety\nnetworks, concludes that in the upcoming years, LMRS is bound\
    \ to stay as the\nprimary PSC solution for mission-critical voice connectivity,\
    \ alongside LTE provid-\ning the much need mission-critical real-time data. The\
    \ technological advancement\nachieved through LTE, LTE-Advanced, and 5G will continue\
    \ to enhance and trans-\nform the PSC capabilities in the future.\nIn Chapter\
    \ 4, a simulation study of LMRS and LTE band class 14 technologies\nis provided\
    \ using the NS-3 open source tool. From the comparison of the simulation\n145\n\
    results summarized in Table 4.2, it can be deduced that LMRS public safety devices\n\
    experience larger cell coverage when compared to the band class 14 LTE devices.\n\
    This volume of cell coverage is critical during the emergency scenario and is\
    \ necessary\nto cover the maximum amount emergency prone area.\nAnother rising\
    \ factor in\nmission-critical PSC is real-time video communications, high data\
    \ rate is needed to\nsupport real-time multimedia applications. However, the aggregated\
    \ throughput of\nLMRS infrastructure is less when compared to the aggregated throughput\
    \ of LTE\nband class 14 infrastructure. These data rates experienced by the LTE\
    \ UEs can\ndeﬁnitely support the much needed real-time video communications in\
    \ several of\nthe PSC scenarios. An adaptation of successful edition of mission-critical\
    \ PTT over\nLTE would take some time. In the meantime, applying the individual\
    \ strength of\nLMRS and LTE into a converged public safety device to mission-critical\
    \ voice and\nmuch needed mission-critical real-time data support can be beneﬁcial\
    \ to PSC.\nIn Chapter 5, an experimental study of capturing APCO-25 and LTE band\
    \ class\n14 signals is conducted using software-deﬁned radio. The capturing of\
    \ LTE band\nclass 14 signals can assist PSC researchers in detecting coverage\
    \ holes in PSN, gain\nknowledge on the quality of service experienced by the UEs\
    \ and enhance the ability\nto design better PSN.\nIn Chapter 6, we show that the\
    \ mission-critical communications could be main-\ntained and restored by deploying\
    \ UABSs in the event of any damage to the public\nsafety infrastructure. Through\
    \ simulations, we compare and analyze the 5pSE of the\nnetwork for diﬀerent path-loss\
    \ models and diﬀerent UABS deployment strategies.\nWith SPLM, our analysis shows\
    \ that deployment of the UABSs on a hexagonal grid\nis close to optimal when the\
    \ observed interference is limited. In the presence of\nsubstantial interference,\
    \ the GA approach is more eﬀective for deploying UABSs.\nOn the other hand, with\
    \ OHPLM, the network observes high path-loss when com-\n146\npared to SPLM. To\
    \ subdue the eﬀects of high path-loss, the GA approach is shown\nto be more eﬀective.\
    \ Our simulation shows that optimizing UABSs locations and\nICIC parameters using\
    \ GA yields signiﬁcant improvement when compared to the\ndeployment of the UABSs\
    \ on a hexagonal grid. Finally, we observe that the HetNets\nwith reduced power\
    \ subframes (FeICIC) yield better 5pSE than that with almost\nblank subframes\
    \ (eICIC). In a simulated network with SPLM and when 60 UABS\nlocations are optimized\
    \ using the GA, the FeICIC observes a modest improvement\nover eICIC: approximately\
    \ 17% and 15% when 50% and 97.5% of the MBSs are\ndestroyed, respectively. On\
    \ the other hand, with OHPLM and when 60 UABS lo-\ncations are optimized using\
    \ the GA, the FeICIC yields a signiﬁcant improvement\nover eICIC: approximately\
    \ 66% and 51% when 50% and 97.5% of the MBSs are\ndestroyed, respectively. GA\
    \ is a suitable meta-heuristic technique that relies on\nbio-inspired approach\
    \ for ﬁnding optimum or close to optimum solution of a search\nproblem. However,\
    \ the computational complexity required to optimize the consid-\nered UAV deployment\
    \ optimization problems in real world using the GA techniques\nrequire further\
    \ investigations.\nIn Chapter 7, we provide system-level insights into the LTE-Advanced\
    \ AG-\nHetNet and evaluate the network performance in terms of coverage probability\
    \ and\n5pSE. In particular, we integrate low-altitude unmanned vehicles as both\
    \ AUE and\nUABS into an existing terrestrial network. While considering key design\
    \ param-\neters such as the base-station heights, antenna 3DBF, path loss model\
    \ speciﬁc to\nUE camping, interference coordination, and altitude variation of\
    \ unmanned vehi-\ncles. Using these design considerations and through Monte-Carlo\
    \ simulations, we\nmaximized the coverage probability and 5pSE of the overall\
    \ network, while miti-\ngating intercell interference and optimizing ICIC parameters\
    \ and UABS locations\nusing brute-force and heuristics approach.\nFinally, our\
    \ analysis shows that the\n147\nAG-HetNet with reduced power subframes (FeICIC)\
    \ yields better coverage proba-\nbility and 5pSE than that with almost blank subframes\
    \ (eICIC) and without any\nICIC. Our simulations results show that the heuristic\
    \ algorithms (GA and eHSGA)\noutperform the brute-force technique and achieve\
    \ eﬀective peak values of coverage\nprobability and 5pSE. In particular, optimization\
    \ of higher complexity FeICIC using\nthe GA technique achieves marginally better\
    \ peak KPI values but requires slightly\nmore computational time when compared\
    \ to hybrid eHSGA. Although the trade-oﬀ\nexists between KPI gains and computational\
    \ complex gains, simulation results show\nthat hybrid eHSGA can be feasible and\
    \ eﬀective. We also found that the wireless\nnetworks performed sparely better\
    \ when UABSs are deployed at the height of 25 m\ncompared to 36 m and 50 m deployment\
    \ height\n148\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n[1] Anritsu Corp., “Eﬀectively Testing 700 MHz Public\

  title: Towards UAV Assisted 5G Public Safety Network
  verbatim_quote1: We consider deploying the UABSs on a hexagonal grid, where the
    positions of UABSs are deterministic and optimize the ICIC parameters of the AG-HetNet
    using the brute-force.
  verbatim_quote2: By using the cell range expansion (CRE) technique deﬁned in 3GPP
    Release-8, UABSs can associate a large number of UEs by oﬄoading traﬃc from the
    MBSs/PBSs.

  analysis: 'The paper titled “Fog Computing in the IoT Environment: Principles, Features,
    and Models” by Madakam and Bhagat provides a comprehensive analysis of Fog Computing,
    its characteristics, models, and applications. It examines the role of Fog Computing
    in the Internet of Things (IoT) and discusses its potential to enhance data processing
    and storage at the edge of the network, closer to the devices generating and requiring
    data. This paper is relevant to the point about the types of data most applicable
    to irrigation management and their typical sources as it highlights the importance
    of data proximity and real-time processing in IoT applications like irrigation
    management.


    **Specific Contributions to the Point**


    1. The paper emphasizes the need for efficient and scalable data management in
    IoT environments, where a vast amount of data is generated from various devices
    and sensors. Irrigation management, being an IoT application, requires timely
    access to data from sensors monitoring soil moisture, water usage, and environmental
    conditions. Fog Computing can facilitate this by bringing data processing closer
    to the edge devices, enabling real-time decision-making and efficient resource
    allocation.


    2. The paper discusses the concept of “fogging,” which involves decentralizing
    the cloud computing model by introducing a layer of computing and storage resources
    at the network edge. This aligns with the requirements of irrigation management,
    as it enables data processing and analysis to be performed closer to the sensors
    and actuators involved in the irrigation system. By reducing latency and improving
    response time, Fog Computing can enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of
    irrigation management systems.


    3. The paper explores the potential benefits of Fog Computing in IoT applications,
    such as reduced bandwidth requirements, improved security, and enhanced privacy.
    In irrigation management, these benefits translate into cost savings on network
    infrastructure, increased protection against cyber threats, and better control
    over sensitive data related to crop yields, water usage, and farm operations.

    1613 Accesses 2 Citations Abstract Internet of Things , abbreviated as IoT , is
    a distributed computing environment that is full of promise, helping to shape
    the future of the world. IoT is a network of smart devices capable of processing
    and storage. It integrates the existing and upcoming technologies to ensure enhanced
    provision of quality of life for human beings. IoT applications are immense, touching
    the varied fields of aviation, medicine, home automation, manufacturing, mining,
    marine zone, agricultural fields, forests, transportation, and citizens’ security
    , to name but a few. IoT has already helped tag the tigers from forests and cows
    from farming fields for identification and tracking. Smart wearable technologies
    have been embedded into the human body for health monitoring. Recently, IoT has
    become the backbone of a rising new distributed computing paradigm, called Fog
    Computing, also known as Edge Computing. Fog Computing is the latest distributed
    computing model that extends the Cloud Computing vision. The main advantage of
    the Fog paradigm is that it brings partial computation and storage right at the
    edge of the network, thus helping to reduce latency and the Internet bandwidth
    bottlenecks. With this background, this book chapter presents a detailed literature
    analysis using the Web of Science and Relecura software . This chapter also outlines
    fundamentals of Fog Computing such as its characteristics, models, theories, and
    different applications. Moreover, various upcoming technologies and frameworks
    have also been illustrated for better understanding of the Fog Computing phenomenon.

    amounts of money on salaries for the technology experts in planning, designing,
    coding, developing hardware , software , and networking products and services.
    These are direct products or technologies embedded into physical things to bring
    operational efficiency in objects and systems, in relation to the Internet of
    Things (IoT) vision. It has been widely misunderstood that IoT technologies are
    limited to sensors and radio frequency identification. This is certainly not the
    case. Sophisticated technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-fi, ZigBee, EPC, Barcode,
    QR codes, IPv4/6, Microcontrollers, Sensors, Actuators, Pumps, Social media, 4G/5G,
    Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Ambience intelligence, Web 3.0, Big Data Analytics,
    Cloud Computing , and many more are under the IoT umbrella [1]. In fact, the IoT
    technologies extend even further to cover all the existing software together with
    existing operating systems such as Windows 16, Linux, SuSE Linux, Macintosh, Ubuntu,
    Android, Sun Solaris, Unisys, CP/M, and upcoming Urban Operating Systems. Electronic
    hardware devices including computers, laptops, servers, tablets, and smartphones
    are the backbone of the IoT environment. These technologies are helping human
    life become more comfortable, modifying public utility services to make them better
    fit for the purpose, home automation, educational performance, good governance
    practices, automated manufacturing process, defence services, and healthcare—all
    in a big way. Most of these technologies are already in existence and in the public
    domain, except the technologies that are in advanced version usages. Using these
    technologies, even objects such as the tables, chairs, curtains, windows, fridges,
    washing machines, clothes, and glasses can be connected to the Future Internet
    (FI). Even the mountains, lakes, and forests can get connected via the Wi-Fi or
    local wired connections for monitoring and securing them from willful damage.
    In fact, natural or man-made inanimate objects can become capable of interacting
    with the Homo sapiens! European countries, Singapore, Korea, Japan, China, and
    other South Asian countries are proactively developing newer IoT technologies
    for better business, effective operational efficiency and improved day-to-day
    human life. Several collaborative projects in designing the hardware , software
    , and networking products are underway. Some researchers are working on IoT architectures,
    their inter-operability, and security mechanisms during data transmission among
    IoT devices. Many multinational corporates, firms, organizations, and universities
    have entered into a common understanding for developing IoT products under the
    umbrella of the IPSO alliance. Another significant factor is the security of devices
    and data transmission, for which many multinational corporate giants are in the
    line, developing better high standard security software and mechanisms. Even International
    cyber laws are coming into practice for the security of personal data. A humongous
    amount of data is being generated by different objects getting connected to the
    Internet. Benefits are numerous, however, computational issues, storage scarcity,
    lack of speed capacity, and security concerns are a few of the challenges that
    face the new technologies. In order to solve these issues, a new technology christened
    as “Fog Computing ” has been gradually gaining foothold in the market. Importantly,
    widespread adoption of the Fog Computing paradigm requires the development of
    new network architectures and middleware platforms deploying new emerging communication
    technologies such as 5G, edge analytics tools for IoT, big data, and machine learning
    of novel context-aware management approaches. Fog Computing is proposed to enable
    computing directly at the edge of network, closer to the devices that generate
    and require processing of data, to deliver new applications for billions of connected
    devices [2]. The organization of this book chapter is as follows. The next section
    discusses the existing literature in some detail. The third section focuses on
    principles, characteristics, and concepts of Cloud and Fog Computing. The next
    section is devoted to discussing the models and Cloud/Fog architectures, and the
    last but not the least section presents the conclusion. 2 Literature Review—Analysis
    2.1 Methodology The present literature review analysis on Fog Computing was purely
    dependent on secondary data. The secondary data was collated from the Web of Science
    , which is maintained by M/s. Thomson and Reuters. It is now known as a part of
    Clarivate Analytics. Importantly, only the indexed articles in the Web of Science
    database were considered for this study. The research articles were collected
    in February 2018. This Web of Science database is widely acknowledged by researchers
    as one of best, yielding empirically-proven articles, manuscripts and whitepapers
    for academicians, researchers, and corporate personnel alike. In total, 746 articles
    were obtained from the Web of Science database regarding Fog Computing. The articles
    published during the period from 2011 to 10 February 2018 were included in this
    study. The keywords used to collate the article were “Fog Computing” and “Edge
    Computing”. The purpose of this analysis was to analyse the Fog Computing paradigm,
    with emphasis on the concepts, principles, models, and prominent contributors
    in this domain. The literature analysis will help in understanding the fundamentals
    of Fog Computing through explanatory figures, statistics, and tables. 2.2 Literature
    Analysis Using Web of Science The phenomenon of Fog Computing traces its beginning
    to the year 2011. Soon after, computer scientists, IT experts, engineers, and
    mobile computing developers started developing Fog Computing-related hardware
    , software , and networking components in a bigger way. Figure 2.1 demonstrates
    the year-wise publications on this topic. 282 articles were published in 2017,
    which was the highest figure obtained during 2011–2018. It is likely that this
    figure for the year 2018 goes up as the present study has only considered for
    the period of 1 January–11 February 2018. The year 2016 followed next, with 230
    articles, followed by 100 publications in the year 2015. The period between 2011
    and 2017 showed a steady growth rate in the number of publications, which indicates
    that the phenomenon is gaining popularity, touching human life through more and
    more applications. Remarkably, Fog Computing is an interdisciplinary subject.
    It marries all the elements involved in providing human comfort, connecting several
    allied subjects. In the last 7 years, the applications developed relating to this
    phenomenon of Fog Computing include Computer Science, Engineering, Telecommunications,
    Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, Medical Imaging, Optics, Oncology, Instruments Instrumentation,
    Transportation, Chemistry, Meteorology Atmospheric Sciences, Electrochemistry,
    Imaging Science, Photographic Technology, Physics, Automation Control Systems,
    Neurosciences, Remote Sensing, Materials Science, Science Technology, Cardiovascular
    System, Cardiology, and Energy Fuels to name a few. Figure 2.2 provides the percentage-based

    to Fog Computing research. Thus, research and development in Fog Computing is
    gaining popularity across countries. The International Journal of Fog Computing,
    through its publications, aims to provide an international forum for researchers
    to discuss and address these challenges and propose innovative solutions, products,
    theories, and concepts for seamless future computing infrastructures now and future.

    Software Several multinational IT-related companies started working in planning,
    designing, and developing the innovative Fog Computing technological products
    and services to increase their business. These firms are working towards new hardware
    , software and networking products, which shall possess embedding and interoperable
    capabilities. On the other side, the companies are filing their new innovative
    products and then striving to obtain Intellectual Property Rights in the form
    of patents , being pioneers for particular technologies. Some individual scientists
    and companies are selling their patents to other companies and R&D centres to
    convert them into real-time products. In this scenario, authors are conducting
    Fog Computing patent analysis to discuss the state-of-the-art of Fog Computing
    products and services at the global level. This is likely to help other competitors
    innovate accordingly, reduce monopoly, and increase consumer convenience. For
    patent analysis, Relecura software was used to categorise companies’ portfolios
    into multi-level classifications, determine the strengths and gaps in the portfolio,
    and plan for adequate patent coverage. This software helps track companies’ needs
    for in-licensing or acquiring patents. This will be used to identify patents for
    sale or licensing and generate leads for the same. Patent documents contain important
    research results. However, they are lengthy and rich in technical terminology
    such that it takes plenty of human efforts for analysis. Automatic tools for assisting
    patent engineers or decision-makers in patent analysis are in great demand. Thus,
    patent analysis is a unique emerging management tool all around the globe for
    addressing the strategic management of business technologies, new products, and
    service development processes. Table 2.1 and Fig. 2.5 illustrate patent analysis
    using the Relecura software. Table 2.1 Countrywide patent analysis on fogging
    Full size table Fig. 2.5 Country wise—patent analysis on fogging Full size image
    Figure 2.5 depicts the number of patents filed by different countries across the
    globe in the field of Fog Computing . The European countries, EP [European Patent
    Office] won 2 patens in 2012 and 1 in 2015, whereas WO [WIPO (PCT)] also obtained
    3 patents in the same period. In contrast, China bagged a good number of patents
    compared to the other countries. The USA bagged 13 patents from the year 2011
    onwards. Clearly, Fog/Edge Computing technologies are attracting the attention
    of researchers, entrepreneurs, and academicians all over the world. 3 Principles
    Fog Computing is a hyper term that is often used as a substitute to Cloud Computing,
    though there are differences, as will be illustrated in the discussion below.
    Fog Computing is a new concept that extends the cloud computing model to the edge
    of the computing networks, much closer to where the devices, that generate data,
    exist. Fogging provides computation, data storage, and application services to
    the end user. This facilitates a new variety of applications and services [3].
    As the Internet of Things (IoT ) phenomenon matures into reality, a vast number
    of devices are going to connect to the Future Internet (FI). Every physical thing
    and object that will be connected to the Future Internet shall generate a huge
    volume of data each nanosecond, in the range of Giga-, Tera-, Peta-, Exa- and
    Zetta-bytes, and perhaps even in Yottabytes. Hence, the existing storage infrastructure
    with cloud computing may not be capable of carrying out the required processing
    in the required time. Data transmission bandwidth does not possess the required
    calibre to accommodate all this data on a single occasion, given the voluminous
    data generated by multiple heterogeneous devices, and fast data transmission rates.
    Further, unnecessary data transmissions in the unwanted networks of Wide Area
    Networks, State Area Networks, Metropolitan Area Networks, Local Area Networks,
    and Home Area Networks are also to be processed. Given this scenario, the concept
    of Fog Computing comes to the rescue. Cloud computing has established itself as
    an alternative of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and service model.
    However, as with all logically centralized resources and service provisioning
    infrastructures, the cloud does not efficiently handle local issues involving
    a large number of networked elements and it is not responsive enough for many
    applications that require the immediate attention of a local controller [4]. As
    we discussed above, the traditional cloud-based infrastructures are not enough
    for the current demands of IoT applications. Two major issues are the limitations
    in terms of latency time and network bandwidth. The study conducted by Bierzynski
    et al. [5] reveal that in recent years, the concepts of Fog Computing or Edge
    Computing were proposed to improve these limitations by moving data processing
    capabilities closer to the network edge. The term Fog Computing is frequently
    associated with the networking multinational company “Cisco ”. It is believed
    that Mr. Ginny Nichols, Cisco’s product line manager coined the term, and hence
    he has been credited as the father of Fog Computing. While “Cisco Fog Computing”
    is a registered name, Fog Computing is open to the community at large. Cisco recently
    delivered the vision of Fog Computing to enable applications on billions of connected
    devices to run directly at the network edge. Customers can develop, manage, and
    run software applications on the Cisco framework of networked devices, including
    hardened routers and switches. The OpenFog Consortium was founded in November
    2015 by members from Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft, ARM and the Princeton University.
    The main intention of the “OpenFog Consortium” mission was to develop open reference
    architecture and convey the business value of Fog Computing. Fog Computing is
    arguably the next frontier for accelerating IoT connections, offering increased
    speed, performance, and a multitude of other benefits. Fog Computing is a highly
    virtualized platform that provides computing, storage, and networking services
    between end devices and traditional Cloud Computing Data Centres, typically, but
    not exclusively located at the edge of the network. This means that Fog Computing
    provides data, computing, storage, and application services to end users. Some
    believe that Prof. Salvatore J. Stolfo, coined “Fog Computing” as “fogging”. Fog
    Computing is defined as a disseminated computing infrastructure in which the applications
    and services are handled either at the network edge or in a remote data centre
    cloud. Therefore, in this requirement, the networking “Switches” and “Mugs” and
    smart devices themselves become the calculating devices to carry out the computing
    process within nanoseconds, for local computing. The concept of Fog Computing
    was introduced by Cisco [6], as an analogy to Cloud Computing, as clouds are far
    away from earth, but the fog is closer. Hence, the term Fog Computing is considered
    to mimic the limited form of cloud behaviour, located nearer to end users. Fog
    Computing was specifically introduced to facilitate latency-sensitive applications
    and broader IoT vision. To mitigate real-time, mobility, and location awareness,
    edge technologies such as fog, mobile edge, cloudlets, and micro-data centres
    are foreseen as the Internet of Everything (IoE) enabling technologies [7]. That
    means that Fog Computing is open to the community at large. The choice of the
    word “fog” is meant to convey the idea that the advantages of cloud computing
    should be brought closer to the data source. In meteorology, “fog” is simply a
    cloud that is close to the ground. The cloud is migrating to the edge of the network,
    where routers themselves may become the virtualization infrastructure, in an evolution
    labelled as “the fog” [8]. With this technology, every smart building/home can
    have their own Fog Computing facilities for smart homeowners using smart mobiles
    or devices. Fog Computing is better suited than cloud computing for meeting the
    demands of numerous emerging applications such as self-driving cars, traffic lights,
    smart homes, etc. However, it cannot replace cloud computing totally—as cloud
    will still be preferred for high-end batch processing jobs that are very common
    in the global business world. Hence, we can arrive at the conclusion that Fog
    Computing and Cloud Computing will complement each other while having their own
    advantages and disadvantages. Fog (Edge) computing plays a crucial role in the
    Internet of Things environment. New studies related to privacy , security , system
    reliability, and security mechanisms in the Fog Computing platform are topics
    for fundamental research and need to be explored. Fog Computing will grow in helping
    the emerging network paradigms that require faster processing with less delay,
    whereas cloud computing would help the business community meet their high-end
    computing demands and lower their costs based on a utility pricing and the reliability
    of the networks of smart devices. Combining the reliability requirements of grid
    and cloud paradigms with the reliability requirements of networks of sensor and
    actuators, it follows that designing a reliable Fog Computing platform is a feasible
    model. Hence, the Fog Computing paradigm can be perceived as a non-trivial extension
    of the cloud [9]. This puts some types of transactions and resources at the edge
    of a communication network rather than establishing channels for cloud storage
    and utilisation. Fog Computing exponents debate that it can reduce the need for
    bandwidth by simply not sending every bit of information over cloud channels,
    and instead, gathering it at certain access points, such as modern routers. This
    computation allows for a more strategic compilation of data that may not be needed
    in cloud storage right away, if at all. By using this kind of distributed strategy,
    company’s project managers can ensure lower costs, quicker processing and improved
    efficiencies of systems. In the Fog Computing environment, processing takes place
    in a data hub on a smart device like smart or android mobile, or in a smart router
    or mugs or network gateways. This reduces the amount of data sent to the cloud
    via a network. It must be especially noted that the fog networking complements
    do not replace cloud computing at any point of time; fogging allows for short-term
    analytics at the edge, whereas the cloud computing technology performs resource-intensive
    and longer-term analytics. Initially, while the edge devices and sensors are where
    the data is created and composed, they do not have the computation and storage
    resources to perform advanced analytics and machine learning tasks. Though cloud
    servers have the power to do these, they are often too far away to process the
    data and respond in a timely manner. In addition, having all endpoints connecting
    to and sending raw data to the cloud over the Internet can have privacy, security
    and legal implications, especially when dealing with sensitive data subject to
    regulations in different countries. In this scenario, fogging is the best available
    method. Fog Computing has many advantages for services in numerous fields, such
    as Wireless Sensor Networks, Smart Grid, Internet of Things, and Software-Defined
    Networks (SDNs). However, some general issues associated with Fog Computing are
    privacy, trust, and security service migration among Fog Computing devices. The
    Global Fog Computing Market revenue is expected to reach $556.72 million by 2023,
    growing at a CAGR of around 61.63% during the forecast period 2017–2023. 3.1 Characteristics
    Fog Computing extends the cloud computing paradigm to the edge of the network,
    thus enabling a new breed of applications and services [6]. Characteristics of
    Fog Computing include: Low latency and location awareness, Widespread geographical
    distribution, Mobility, A large number of network nodes, Predominant role of wireless
    access, The strong presence of streaming and real-time applications, Heterogeneity.
    Some authors have defined the Fog Computing physiognomies as follows: The main
    characteristic being that it is an edge location, with location awareness, and
    low latency, which means that Fog Computing supports endpoints with the finest
    services at the edge of the network. Secondly, its Geographical distribution has
    been very attractive in that the services and applications in the fog are widely
    distributed across spaces and nations. In sharp contrast to the more centralized
    Cloud, the services and applications targeted by Fog Computing demand widely distributed
    deployments. The Fog, for instance, will play an active role in delivering high
    quality streaming to moving vehicles, through proxies and access points positioned
    along highways and tracks [10]. The third attribute is support for mobility, i.e.,
    using LISP protocol fog devices to provide mobility techniques like decoupling
    host identity to location identity. That means it is essential for many Fog and
    Edge computing applications to communicate directly with mobile and other smart
    or computational devices. Hence, the support for mobility techniques, such as
    the LISP protocol, which decouple host identity from location identity and require
    a distributed directory system are required. Ability for Real-time interactions
    in another attribute and an essential requirement. Fog Computing requires real-time
    interactions for speedy service without any interruptions. Sky is the limit for
    connectivity of heterogeneous devices in the network. Fog nodes can be deployed
    in a wide variety of environments. These environments include the heterogeneity
    objects or devices such as computers, servers, laptops, printers, pagers, and
    smartphones as well as physical objects including both living and non-living things.
    Hence, one may well imagine a home where everything—from appliances to pet animals—is
    connected to the Internet. Interoperability is one of the vital networking communication
    characteristics in Fog Computing. This explains how different hardware devices
    or IoT objects interact and cooperate during the data transmission process by
    software through various networks. Fog components must be able to interoperate
    in order to give a wide range of services such as platform-independent streaming.
    The end object is to improve the quality of life of general public . To do so,
    one will have to overcome bandwidth limitations, increasing computing capabilities
    and storages in these heterogeneous environments, and fogging technology is the
    best method to fulfil these requirements. Table 2.2 delineates the differences
    between Cloud and Fog Computing [11]. Table 2.2 Difference between cloud and fog
    computing Full size table 3.2 Concepts The Fog Computing technology offers a number
    of benefits in the computing and communication arena. As defined by Cisco in one
    of their research papers, “by moving data processing and delivery closer to the
    requesting devices through the expansion of their geographic network footprint
    and operating in node-based fog architecture rather than in either cloud or traditional
    systems, response times to customers can be improved almost exponentially”. Nearness
    is the major contributor to network efficiency, and the effect of moving data
    towards the consumer along a communication network path through such fog nodes
    simply cannot be overstated. The increased network efficiency through proximity
    multiplies many of the benefits of the classic architecture while avoiding the
    drawbacks of such. As part of this movement towards network nodes, congestion
    on the network is likewise drastically reduced. In the traditional architectural
    paradigm, the total of processing is being demanded in a rather centralised system.
    Essentially, standard architectures are glorified bottlenecks in all but a few
    specific use cases, where data is trapped in a looping hold pattern. Thus, Fog
    Computing gets around this by distributing this functionality across a much wider
    space. While cloud distribution can indeed be negated by some solutions, it is
    problematic, as it also means that network response as a whole suffers, even with
    multiplexing and other load balancing solutions. Users may still face bottlenecks,
    but the concept of load balancing has been amply made use of, resulting in quicker
    data delivery and better network efficiency. As more nodes become necessary, dormant
    nodes can be spun and utilised. Fog Computing also boasts of impressive scaling
    abilities. Working with nodes implies geographical nearness to the data request.
    This also indicates a boost in security —data is encoded as it moves towards the
    edge of the network; and changing node relations and presence means that the user
    attack surface is ever changing. End devices, fog and cloud form a three-layer
    hierarchical service delivery model, supporting a range of applications such as
    web content delivery [12], augmented reality [13], and big data analysis [14].
    However, several challenges are also associated with the Fog/Edge Computing. The
    major disadvantage of the Fog technology and architecture is that it intensifies
    the complexity of the communication network, and thus, adds a certain amount of
    overhead in business terms—both directly and indirectly. Furthermore, implementing
    Edge Computing means that the user is introducing an ever-increasing number of
    points of failure. While privacy and security are benefited in a way by this constant
    change, the maintenance and probability aspects are not. Besides, the security
    and privacy should be addressed in every layer while designing the fog Computing
    system [15]. In old-style solutions, the user has a single point of failure with
    centralised effort to repair, maintain, and identify potential issues in the Fog
    Computing architecture. By spreading out the computational load, users are spreading
    out that effort and responsibility, which can make for stress on the entire Fog
    Computing process. Fog is another layer of a distributed network environment and
    is closely associated with cloud computing and the Internet of Things . 4 Models/Architectures
    No standard architectures and tested models have been derived from empirical research.
    However, some of the Fog Computing architectures have been described in the following
    sections for better understanding of the Fog vision. 4.1 A Generic Fog Computing
    Architecture Mind Commerce [22] has outlined a generic Fog Computing architecture
    that consists of the following elements: IoT endpoints: which include end devices
    like sensors , gateways, edge devices, and other physical computing objects that
    perform the required functions and provide apps that are installed on the end
    devices. These devices are generally connected to a data storage. The IoT endpoints
    collect the data from other different devices; process some data in real-time
    in the IP network data processing units. The rest of the data is stored in a Cloud
    environment for further processing. IP (Internet Protocol) Network: that provides
    distributed intelligence and is linked to IoT End-point devices (e.g. sensors)
    to receive data from and also to the Cloud environment to send required data for
    storage purposes and future analysis. Purpose is mainly to provide communication
    links. the IP network utilises distributed intelligence for supporting intelligence
    representation e.g. big data mining etc. Distributed Intelligence is considered
    as a collective intelligence that provides an effective theoretical framework
    for understanding what humans can achieve and how artefacts, tools, and socio-technical
    environments can be designed and evaluated to empower human beings. Centralised
    Control and Mediation Unit: which is a cloud-based unit in the Cloud environment
    where the remaining data, which was not processed in the data processing unit,
    is stored and analysed, as required. This unit is used for storage, queries, and
    business analytics. 4.2 Fog Computing Environmental Model Zhu et al. [16], in
    their seminal research paper “Improving website performance using edge servers
    in Fog Computing architecture” structured the Fog Computing Environmental Model.
    This model has been presented in Fig. 2.6. They have divided the entire Fog Computing
    environment into three layers as follows: Fig. 2.6 Fog computer architecture (adapted
    from [16]) Full size image Centralised Intelligence: Cloud Computing Here, Data
    Centre Cloud may be employed for services for application hosting, management.
    The Core Networking and Services are responsible for Internet Protocols (IP),
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Quality of Service, Multicast, Data Security
    , Network Services, and Mobile Packet Core functions. Distributed Intelligence:
    Fog Computing This layer is the primary one at the edge level. It may also be
    called Multi-Service Edge. In this layer, 3G/4G/Long-Term Evolution (LTE), Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technologies and other such
    can be encountered. This is much like the field area network. Distributed Intelligence:
    End-Point Computing It can alternatively be called the Smart Things Network. This
    layer consists of several embedding systems, objects and sensors . This indicates
    that smart and less smart things like vehicles and machines are connected via
    wired and wireless connections. 4.3 A Fog Computing Architecture by Joud Khattab
    [21] The Fog Computing model (Fig. 2.7) by Joud Khattab was published in August,
    2017. In this approach, the Fog Architecture has been divided into seven layers,
    as briefly articulated below. Fig. 2.7 Fog computer architecture by Joud Khattab
    (adapted from [21]) Full size image IoT Sensors and Actuators The bottom-most
    layer of the architecture in Fig. 2.7 is formed by IoT sensors and actuators.
    This layer is geographically distributed and possesses sensing, communication,
    and application objectives, directing the fetched values to the next layers via
    gateways for further processing. The IoT actuators play an important role in this
    layer as they are responsible for controlling the mechanism or IoT system. They
    fetch the data from the remote sensors and convert them into mechanical or electrical
    moments. The actuator usually responds to the sensors that sense the changes in
    the environmental deviations. Fog Devices The next layer of the architecture has
    the “Fog Devices” that consist of gateways for connecting the sensors to the Internet,
    edge devices and physical computing devices. This layer is capable of hosting
    the different sorts of application modules. Data Generation The collected data
    from different sensors, RFID and other IoT devices is processed further through
    this layer; of this, some data can be used for real-time processing; some of the
    rest can be sent to a Cloud environment. An enormous amount of data is generated
    at this layer. Infrastructure Monitoring This layer is mainly responsible for
    the monitoring of resource utilisation, availability of sensors, actuators, and
    IP network. It monitors and keeps track of the services and applications deployed
    on the infrastructure. Depending on the requirement, the monitoring component
    supplies the gathered information to other services and application objectives.
    Resource Management The core layer of Fog architecture is resource management.
    It consists of computational components that systematically manage resources in
    such a way that resource wastage is virtually minimised to zero. This layer has
    a uniform and programmable interface for seamless resource management of hardware
    and controlling. It provides generic Application Process Interfaces (APIs) for
    monitoring, and controlling physical resources such as CPU, Memory, network and
    IoT devices. In this layer, the placement and scheduler components are the most
    important parts as they keep track of the state of available resources. Application
    Model This layer of Fog architecture consists of the sense-process-actuate model
    in which the sensor publishes measured data either periodically or in an event-based
    manner. Applications running on Fog devices subscribe to and process data coming
    from the sensors. Finally, insights obtained from the processing are translated
    into actions forwarded to actuators. Two relevant models are briefly described
    below. Sense-process-actuate model: The information collected by sensors is transmitted
    as data streams, which is acted upon by applications running on fog devices and
    the resultant commands are sent to actuators. Stream-processing model: The stream-processing
    model has a network of application modules running on fog devices that continuously
    process data streams emitted from sensors. The information mined from the incoming
    streams is stored in data centres for large-scale and long-term analytics. We
    consider stream-processing model as a subcategory of the sense-process-actuate
    model [17]. IoT Applications No field, societal or commercial, has been left untouched
    by the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IoT scenarios includes healthcare,
    manufacturing, governance, urbanisation, home automation, citizen security , education,
    transportation, defence and many more [18]. 4.4 Fog Computing Tree Model Figure
    2.8 shows another proposed architecture for the Internet of Things (IoT ) environment.
    This has been called the “Tree Model”. It describes the IoT architecture consisting
    of three layers. It has been developed based on the IoT Forum Architecture, ITU
    Architecture, and European FP7 Research Project ARM models of IoT Architectures.
    The model is an addition to IoT-ARM (Architectural Reference Model) by the FP7
    Research Project. The approach describes the components including connectivity
    among them and process flow. IoT “Tree Model” is like a tree structure with roots,
    trunk and unlimited leaves [19], [20]. The three components of the Tree Model
    are the Processing, Transportation and Application Layer s, as elaborated below.
    Fig. 2.8 Fog computing view of IoT —A tree model Full size image Processing Layer
    For every tree, roots are the base and they are essential for the growth and entire
    life of the tree. Similarly, in an IoT architecture, Processing Layer is the principal
    layer in the global IoT world, with interoperable capabilities. This layer generally
    has the computing and embedding abilities with different physical objects or things.
    The relevant technologies help in the identification of the objects, securing
    them, and monitoring the events. Of course, these technologies are also capable
    of conducting automation based on the protocols defined in the network connection
    and may end up controlling even human beings. A few of the technologies involved
    in the Processing Layer include Smart Cards, Radio Frequency Identification, Electronic
    Product Codes, Barcode, IPv4/6, QR Codes, NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Sensors,
    Actuators, Hyper Text Mark-up Language 5, robotics, microcontrollers, Big Data
    Analytics, Urban Operating Systems, Windows, Linux, Android, and Social Networking.
    Network Layer The Networking Layer is placed between the Processing and Application
    Layer . However, there are no hard and fast rules that fixate this sequence and
    in Fog Computing , the Processing Layer and Application Layer are likely to be
    embedded into each other. In the Network layer, there are sub-networks consisting
    of Home Area Network (HAN), LAN, MAN, SAN, WAN, and overlapping. HAN is a new
    and relatively unknown network. All the home appliances including towels, shirts,
    utensils, windows, doors, tables, fans, fridges, radiators and so on can get connected
    to the Internet through smart mobile/devices for easy automation. To ensure ease
    of application, this Network Layer has high bandwidth capabilities, and high data
    rate speeds for the transmission of yottabytes of data. The 5G mobile and NG9-1-1
    technologies are soon likely to be in place to further enhance the capabilities.
    Fog Computing will occur via switches, thermostats, actuators and smart mobile
    devices of this networking layer. Application Layer The Application layer is similar
    to leaves of the “Tree”. Like the uncountable leaves on a tree, the IoT Application
    layer consists of a gamut of applications including transportation, security ,
    governance, education, health, pharmacy, logistics, manufacturing and process
    industries. Beside these, Application Layers support the technologies for improved
    Quality of Life in urban areas in public utility services. These services include
    power management, water management, waste management and irrigation management.
    In fact, even mining processes can be monitored through this and the monitoring
    of natural ecosystems including ponds, forest, lakes, and mountains also is possible,
    too. IoT has brought about a tremendous number of services for round-the-clock
    provision of Quality of Life. 5 Conclusion Fog Computing-based systems are becoming
    important in our daily lives. It is amply clear from the above discussions that
    Fog Computing will, in future, be omnipresent and pervading across all disciplines,
    social and commercial. Through this, even earthen things are likely to get high
    calibre computation capabilities, through the inclusion of basic electronic devices
    and embedded processing capabilities. The beauty of this technology is that all
    smart devices, including smart phones, already possess this computation technology.
    The user-oriented applications are already fully loaded in almost all these mobiles.
    These applications include Google, music, album, movies, camera, calendar, maps,
    alarms, Facebook, Twitter, navigation, voice speech, Hangouts, voice dialler,
    WhatsApp, notes, Email and so on. Edge technologies can be used to assist free-view
    videos by offering virtual view synthesis and related multi-view video incentives.
    All these applications require local storage and high-speed real-time processing,
    along with high-speed connected bandwidth to perform edge computing. Even in the
    case of home automation, smart devices are coming on board with facilities such
    as computation, residential tracking, sensing and adapting the IoT environments
    through Ambient Intelligence (AmI), as well as manipulation of databases in real-time
    situations. All the IT-related companies are developing IoT products and services
    to interoperable Fog Computing hardware , software , and networking. However,
    researchers still have much work to do on the fundamentals of Fogging and its
    allied applications to develop standard Fogging models and architectures. References

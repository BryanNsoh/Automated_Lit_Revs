    PDF Abstract The objective of the study was to examine suitable remote sensing
    methods and data for mapping and measuring the acreages of active crop lands in
    order to improve irrigation management. We compared classification results from
    a supervised classification method and a method using normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) with additional pre‐classification processing. IKONOS and Landsat
    Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were tested to see if high spatial
    resolution remote sensing data would have significant advantages in distinguishing
    between active and fallow lands. The classification achieved an overall accuracy
    of 93.63%. The results showed that the supervised classification did not have
    a clear advantage over the simple method using NDVI at the level of distinguishing
    between active crops and fallow lands. The result suggests that using ETM+ instead
    of IKONOS high spatial resolution imageries is appropriate because of the high
    cost of IKONOS imageries and image heterogeneity of agricultural fields. It was
    shown that pre‐processing with a mask to exclude the non‐agricultural objects
    blended with agricultural fields is critical. 1. Introduction Knowing the acreage
    of active crops in a particular irrigation rotation is one of the most important
    factors for water planning and management, especially for semi‐arid and arid environments
    where water is limited. Efficiency of managing irrigation water is an important
    issue in arid and semi‐arid areas, such as along the Rio Grande Valley area in
    the south‐west USA where there is a major agriculture corridor for the region.
    The water requirement for an agricultural irrigation rotation usually depends
    on the area of active crops. Traditionally, water planning for agricultural water
    uses is conducted by referring to information on the acreage of irrigated agriculture
    and water supplied in the previous year. Previous water use information is usually
    incomplete since it consists of volunteer‐based reporting from farmers at the
    end of the year. Also, water demand for agricultural uses can vary significantly
    from year to year due to the changes of the acreage of active crops. Therefore,
    mapping and measuring active crops and fallow lands from satellite imagery would
    be appropriate for agricultural water‐use planning. Using satellite remote sensing
    technology for mapping irrigated areas was attempted several decades ago (Heller
    and Johnson 1979, Hoffman 1979, Tinney et al. 1979, Thiruvengadachari 1981). In
    the present decade, there have been new research efforts incorporating the rapid
    advancement of technology to improve the capability of monitoring agricultural
    and hydrological conditions of the land surface (Ambast et al. 2002). For example,
    Thome et al. ( 1988) used Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data and estimated
    the total irrigated area in the Mendoza province of Argentina. Azzali and Menenti
    ( 1996) used temporal data to distinguish the irrigated and non‐irrigated crops.
    Several studies (Vidal and Baqri 1995, Herrero and Casterad 1999) reported the
    results of using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to detect irrigated areas or
    to assess net water requirements in crop fields using supervised classification.
    A common deficiency of the previous methods of assessing acreages of croplands
    using remote sensing data is the complexity that is impractical for management
    purpose. Their classification methods of using regression or supervised training
    depend on absolute image values so the calibrated coefficients are not transferable
    to a variety of spatial and temporal conditions. Based on the literature, we question
    if these complex methods are significant in terms of achieving the required accuracy
    of classifying between active and fallow lands. One possible solution for simplifying
    the classification process might be the use of a simple classification method
    jointly with a pre‐processing scheme. In this study, we examined two land‐use
    classification methods with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery
    for mapping and measuring the acreages of active crop lands. One is a complex
    supervised classification method, namely the spectral angle mapper (SAM), which
    is based on similarity of spectral characteristics of classes to training site
    (class). The other one is a simple classification method using the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) incorporating a pre‐classification processing
    procedure. By comparing to the complex SAM method, this study can determine if
    the NDVI‐based classification with a pre‐processing procedure would be a suitable
    method for irrigation planning. Suitable results for this application would be
    classification accuracy, less complexity in processing, and cost‐effectiveness
    for required data. In the pre‐classification processing, we explore the usefulness
    of involving ancillary data. The ancillary data include ortho‐planimetric layers
    and land resources, such as road edge, hydro line, hydro area, parcel base‐maps,
    and irrigation boundary. The ancillary data were used to create a mask for delineating
    agricultural fields by excluding non‐agricultural objects. Additionally, the IKONOS
    and Landsat ETM+ images were tested with the SAM classification method to see
    if high spatial resolution remote sensing data would have significant advantages
    in distinguishing between active and fallow lands. Using ETM+ instead of IKONOS
    high spatial resolution imageries can avoid high cost of purchasing imageries.
    Besides the higher cost, the high resolution imagery might not be appropriate
    to use for land‐use with greater heterogeneity. Accuracy of classification with
    different methods and imageries were assessed using a confusion matrix based on
    ground data. The study results would be useful in identifying an accuracy‐reliable
    and cost‐effective method of extracting acreages of active crop fields and fallow
    lands for irrigation management and planning. 2. Study site and data The study
    site is located in El Paso County, Texas, part of the semi‐arid area of the south‐western
    USA (figure 1). Agricultural land uses dominate the site, including the Upper
    Valley and Lower Valley along the Rio Grande River valley. The total irrigated
    agriculture area is about 47 000 acres. Primary field crop commodities consist
    of cotton, pecan, corn, wheat, alfalfa, and commercial vegetables. Figure 1 Index
    map of the study area(El Paso, Texas). The IKONOS images covered two agricultural
    areas: Upper Valley and Lower Valley. Display full size Two types of imagery data,
    Landsat ETM+ and IKONOS, were used in the study. Simple dark subtraction method
    was used for radiometric correction. Five ETM+ images (path 33/row 38) acquired
    at different times (between 1999 and 2001) were sub‐setted to cover the study
    area (figure 1). Landsat ETM+ has a resolution of 30 m with six multi‐spectral
    bands, one thermal band of 60‐m resolution, and one panchromatic band of 15‐m
    resolution. The 386 scenes of IKONOS imagery were acquired by El Paso Water Utilities
    through a contract awarded to a Californian company. The acquisitions were carried
    out between August 2000 and February 2001 to satisfy the requirement of cloud
    free or less than 5% of cloud cover. The images in the Lower Valley portion (south,
    251 scenes) acquired from August to October 2000, and in the Upper Valley portion
    (north, 135 scenes) acquired from August 2000 to February 2001. Each scene is
    in 1‐m spatial resolution (4‐m multi‐spectral bands fused with 1‐m panchromatic
    band) with four bands: blue (band 1), green (band 2), red (band 3) and near‐infrared
    (band 4). Each image (tile) size is 1500×1500 pixels (i.e. 2.25 km2) All IKONOS
    and ETM+ images were geo‐referenced against the El Paso street centreline or El
    Paso Water Utility''s (EPWU) digital orthorectified airphotos, which are in 1‐foot
    spatial resolution and acquired in 1997. Both the street centreline and the orthorphotos
    are in Texas central state plane coordinates with North American Datum of 1983
    (NAD83). 3. Ground investigation (ground data) and analysis In order to understand
    the signatures of crops and fallow lands in the images, an area of 2295.7 acres
    was selected for ground investigation (ground data). The area is covered with
    four scenes of IKONOS images as displayed in figure 2. Three ground investigations
    were conducted on 25 July, 18 September, and 6 November 2001, respectively. The
    ground investigation served for both training and accuracy assessment. The first
    field investigation in 25 July (figure 2( b)) reflected all agricultural lands
    in the crop‐growing season and no fallow land in the ground data area. The area
    of crops was about 1854 acres out of the total area of 2295.7 acres (table 1).
    The remaining areas are residential, school and irrigation ditches. Cotton was
    the dominant crop (∼60%), with corn the second‐most dominant crop (∼27%). Besides
    crop lands, fallow lands (the harvested cornfields) were found in the second field
    investigation carried out on 18 September. This is similar to the situation in
    the previous year (2000) mapped by IKONOS images, as displayed in figure 2( c).
    This portion of IKONOS images was acquired mostly in September 2000, although
    the image acquisitions spanned from August to October 2000. The interpreted results
    of figure 2( c), combined with information observed from the second field investigation
    as well as the information from figure 2( a) and (b) are shown in figure 2( d).
    The acreage of each crop is also included in table 1. The total acreage of the
    fallow lands in this time of 2000 (mostly September) was 484.164 acres, which
    is similar to the total acreage of cornfields (492.191) in 2001. Also included
    from the IKONOS images of 2000 is the 1042.319 acres covered by ‘other crops’
    (table 1). The type of ‘other crops’ in 2000 is cotton, since cotton is usually
    harvested later than corn. In the third ground investigation of early November,
    only cotton (ready to be harvested) and alfalfa remained, while most of the harvested
    cornfields were growing sorgum, which will be ploughed for soil fertilizer in
    December. Figure 2 Images and related ground investigation(ground data) results.

    three field investigations provided the baseline information for various crops
    and experiences for selecting the training sites and for image interpretations.
    4. Pre‐processing and classifications 4.1 Excluding non‐agricultural fields A
    pre‐classification process was conducted to improve classification accuracy. The
    pre‐processing involves the creation of a mask for excluding non‐agricultural
    areas before the classification. figure 3 is a part of the Lower Valley image
    mosaicked from 183 IKONOS images. It visually shows that non‐agricultural fields
    (residential, commercial, school, road system) are blended with agricultural fields
    (green and white polygons). Furthermore, the far right portion (east) of the image
    is the dessert area, while the far left portion (west) of the image is the agriculture
    area in Mexican side (Rio Grande River is the border of the USA and Mexico). Due
    to the spectral similarities of objects in multi‐spectral imagery, a simple threshold‐based
    NDVI classification method as well as supervised‐based classification methods
    without pre‐classification processing are not capable of distinguishing the backyard
    grasses and trees in the residential area from crops. Similarly, spectral resemblance
    occurs to parking lots, roads, buildings, even desert area and fallow lands. Therefore,
    it was hypothesized that creating a mask to exclude the non‐agricultural fields
    would improve the classification accuracy. Figure 3 Portion of the mosaicked IKONOS
    image(tile rows 42–55) in the Lower Valley. Green and white polygons within the
    El Paso irrigation area overlaid on the image are the classified agricultural
    fields. They are active crops and fallow lands, respectively. Display full size
    Ancillary data in GIS format, such as road edge, hydro line, hydro area, parcel
    map, and irrigation boundary, were used for the creation of the mask. Road edge
    covers all of the paved roads (not including the small roads among agriculture
    fields). Hydro line refers to the small irrigation ditches and hydro area refers
    to the larger irrigation ditches. Both these two features overlap with most of
    unpaved roads, although they are much narrower than unpaved roads. Therefore,
    buffer zones of 25 feet on both sides of the hydro line and hydro area were created
    to mask these unpaved roads. Parcel maps were used to mask out residential, business,
    and school areas such as grassy lawns, sports fields, parking lots, and buildings.
    The irrigation boundary is used to exclude the areas outside the El Paso irrigation
    area such as the dessert area to the east and the Mexican side to the west. Then
    these five types of GIS layers were merged into one shapefile for exclusion from
    classification. With this shapefile, a mask shapefile that only covers the agriculture
    fields can then be created. In order to incorporate the mask into classification
    in ENVI software, a binary image of the mask was first produced from the mask
    shapefile. 4.2 Supervised classification There are many supervised classification
    methods such as parallelepiped, maximum likelihood, Mahalanobis distance, neural
    network, and spectral angle mapper. For an accurate classification in our preliminary
    test, we chose the SAM supervised classification in this study. Following usual
    procedures, we also conducted post‐classification with the popular methods, such
    as combining classes, sieve classes, and clump classes. For simplicity, we only
    detail the SAM method and the selection of training sites, while all methods and
    procedures used are summarized in table 2. Table 2. Summary of SAM‐based classification
    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table 4.2.1 N‐dimensional visualizer and spectral
    endmembers selection Due to the heterogeneity of the land uses in the study site,
    training areas (polygons) were carefully handpicked as polygons in GIS throughout
    the entire irrigation area (not limited in the field data area). Since the same
    crop type (such as corn) may vary in spectral characteristics from field to field
    depending on growing status, water stress, pest infestation, and soil type, we
    usually picked many sites of each variation and then grouped all of them into
    one crop (corn, for example). Similarly, we also grouped many sites of bare soils,
    harvested lands, or ploughed fields throughout the entire irrigation area as fallow
    lands. The field investigations (§3) significantly helped the selection of training
    sites for July 2001. For other old images—four scenes of ETM+ images and all IKONOS
    images—the selection of training sites completely depended on expert''s knowledge
    due to the project not beginning until June 2001. The training polygons selected
    in GIS were converted as regions of interest (ROIs) in ENVI (image processing
    software). These ROIs were used in the N‐dimensional visualizer of ENVI to identify
    the purest pixels (i.e. most extreme spectral responses), or spectral endmembers.
    4.2.2 SAM classifier The SAM classifier is a physically‐based spectral classification
    method that uses n‐dimensional angles to match pixels to reference spectra. The
    algorithm determines the similarity between two spectra by calculating the angle
    between the spectra, treating them as vectors in a space with dimensionality equal
    to the number of bands. This technique, when used on calibrated reflectance data,
    is relatively insensitive to illumination and albedo effects. The SAM classification
    was conducted for both ETM+ and IKONOS images to classify the active crops and
    fallow lands of the El Paso County. An endmember spectrum used by SAM in this
    study was first extracted directly from the ROIs by averaging spectra derived
    from the previous section. SAM compares the angle between the endmember spectrum
    vector (ROI) and each pixel vector of the image in n‐dimensional space. Smaller
    angles (in radians) represent closer matches to the reference spectrum. Pixels
    with a spectral angle larger than a user‐specified maximum angle threshold (in
    radians) are not classified (ENVI User''s Guide, Research System, Inc. 2000, Kruse
    et al. 1993). Selecting the maximum angle threshold value is an important factor
    for successfully using SAM classification. Crosta et al. ( 1998) noticed that
    changes in the value of the threshold produced significant changes in the number
    of pixels classified as one of the reference spectrum. For that reason, we tested
    numerous threshold values for each case, and selected a value that resulted in
    the best classification compared with field data or conceptual valuation based
    on experiences. For the IKONOS images, the threshold value of 0.03 is the best
    value for both active crops and fallow land (table 2). For ETM+ images, the best
    values are 0.08–0.13 for active crops, and 0.05–0.06 for fallow land except for
    the ETM+ image of 12 September 1999. The endmembers of the 1999 image came directly
    from the image of 7 September 2000 due to being the same time of year. However,
    these endmembers worked very well for the year 2000 images, but did not work well
    for the 1999 image. As a complement, endmembers for the image of 1999 were readjusted
    by adding new endmembers and deleting some existing ones, and the threshold values
    were increased to be much larger than the previous threshold values used for the
    image of year 2000 (table 2). This experience suggests that (1) the training endmembers
    usually vary greatly for multi‐temporal images, even for the two images acquired
    in almost the same day (or month) in different years; and (2) there are limitations
    for any standard spectral library due to varying atmospheric and illumination
    conditions since perfect atmospheric correction is impossible. table 2 summarizes
    the key processes in the classification. figure 4 is the general work flow chart
    of SAM‐based classification procedure for using an ETM+ image. The non‐agricultural
    fields were all excluded from IKONOS and ETM+ images by using the mask created
    in §4.1. Figure 4 SAM‐based classification procedure using integrated remote sensing–GIS
    technology. Steps with dashed‐line frames are remote sensing methods, and steps
    with solid‐line frames are GIS methods. Display full size 4.3 NDVI‐based classification
    Vegetation indices have been widely used for tracking green biomass, leaf area
    index of crop canopies, and fractional amount of net radiation (Hatfield et al.
    1984; Daughtry et al. 1990, Jackson and Huete 1991, Kustas et al. 1993). NDVI
    is one of the most widely used indices for indicating the amount of green vegetation
    present in a pixel—higher NDVI values indicate more green vegetation (Jensen 1986,
    Jackson et al. 1988; Pinter et al. 2003). The NDVI method transforms multi‐spectral
    data (bands 3 and 4 of ETM+) into a single image representing the vegetation distribution
    by using equation (1) : where b 3 and b 4 are band 3 and band 4 of the ETM+ image,
    respectively. Valid results fall between −1 and +1. The larger the pixel value,
    the higher the fraction of vegetation cover within the pixel. After using the
    relative atmospheric correction (dark subtraction) method, many threshold values
    were examined against ground data. A threshold NDVI of 0.15 was found to produce
    the highest classification accuracy for separating vegetation cover from other
    land covers. The work flow chart in figure 5 describes the NDVI‐based classification
    scheme with GIS (ArcGIS) and remote sensing software (ENVI). The process with
    the NDVI‐based method as described in this flowchart is more time efficient than
    the one with the SAM method (figure 4). Using the SAM method is time consuming
    since the selection for training sites is labour intensive and depends on professional
    experiences. The NDVI method is efficient since it does not require training site
    selection. It is also computation efficient (several hours for classifying one
    image compared with 2–3 days with the SAM method since selecting the training
    site is labour intensive and needs professional experience). Figure 5 NDVI‐based
    classification procedure using integrated remote sensing–GIS technology. Steps
    1–8 (dashed‐line frames) are remote sensing methods, and steps 9–15 (solid‐line
    frames) are GIS methods. Display full size 5. Classification results and accuracy
    assessment The results produced from both supervised (SAM) and NDVI‐based classification
    approaches on multi‐temporal ETM+ images covering a period of 3 years (29 September
    1999, 10 June 2000, 7 September 2000, 26 April 2001, and 15 July 2001) are illustrated
    in tables 3 and 4, respectively. Since one scene of ETM+ image covers the entire
    county''s agriculture area, the classification result should reflect the actual
    situation in an irrigation rotation. Table 3. Classification results from SAM‐based
    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table Table 4. Classification results from NDVI‐based
    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table The classification using the SAM method resulted
    in 42 374 acres of active crops and 4826 acres of fallow lands for the ETM+ image
    of 15 July 2001 (table 3). The confusion matrix and ground data information were
    employed to assess the accuracy of the classifications. This was the only adopted
    imagery whose acquisition time matched the first of the three field data. figure
    6( a) shows the ground investigation on the image of 15 July 2001 (field data
    on 25 July), and figure 6( a) is the SAM classification result. The number of
    total pixels in the ground data was 8495 (figure 6( a)). All of the pixels are
    crop lands; there were no fallow land during this time (figure 2( a) and (b)).
    Of these, 7954 were correctly classified as crop lands in figure 6( b). The accuracy
    is 93.63%, and unclassified is 6.37%. Figure 6 The ground data(a) and classification
    result (b) of the ETM+ image on 15 July 2001. (a) Ground data result, with white
    as crops (see figure 2( b)); (b) is the classification result, with light grey
    as crops. Display full size Using the NDVI classification method (table 4) for
    the same image acquired in 15 July 2001, 42 168 acres of active crops and 5032
    acres of fallow lands were classified. The results from NDVI differencing matched
    well to the results of SAM classification (with 93.63% overall accuracy). figure
    7 shows the comparison of classification results of crop lands and their percentage
    differences based on SAM and NDVI from the five images. The percentage difference
    is calculated by the equation: where acresNDVI and acresSAM are acres of active
    crops classified using the NDVI and SAM methods, respectively. From the figure,
    it is clear that by using the SAM and NDVI methods, the classification accuracies
    are almost the same. The percentage of differences between two methods are from
    the minimum of ∼0% for the image for 15 July 2001 to the maximum of ∼12% for the
    image for 26 April 2001. Similar accuracy suggests that the more complex supervised
    SAM method did not show significant advantage over the NDVI differencing. In other
    words, the NDVI method jointly with a pre‐classification processing is sufficient
    for separating between active crops and fallow lands. In addition to accuracy
    assessment, the NDVI method requires only threshold values for transformation
    from NDVI to ROIs and a process of excluding non‐agricultural fields blended with
    agricultural areas. Therefore, the NDVI method is more straightforward to use
    compared to the SAM method. The differences between SAM and NDVI method are (1)
    SAM uses all available spectral bands such as six bands for the ETM+ image and
    four bands for the IKONOS image, while NDVI uses only two bands (bands 3 and 4
    for both ETM+ and IKONOS); and (2) SAM is a supervised classification method,
    requiring selection of training sites before classification, while NDVI does not.
    SAM is very good for a hyperspectral image (spectral resolution 20 nm or better)
    where hundreds of spectral bands (wavelengths) are used for classification, while
    NDVI only uses two spectral bands or wavelengths (red and near‐infrared), which
    does not represent the whole spectral picture of an object. For a multi‐spectral
    image (spectral resolution 200 nm or worse), however, only six or four bands are
    available. So it does not make too much difference whether the SAM or NDVI method
    is used, however the SAM method is complex in three aspects: Figure 7 Comparison
    of classification results of crop lands from SAM and NDVI and their differences
    in percentages. Display full size It requires ground investigation for selection
    of training sites, which is not always possible or convenient. For example, it
    is impossible to conduct ground investigation for images acquired in past years.
    So selecting training areas when using old images depends completely on the experience
    of an interpreter. This is the case of this study: four ETM+ images (before 15
    July 2001) and all IKONOS images. Collection of endmembers with the N‐dimensional
    visualizer in ENVI is an interactive tool depending largely on the knowledge of
    experts. The threshold value (the maximum angle) in the SAM method is very sensitive
    to the classification results. The threshold value selection requires exhaustive
    searching and the experience of an interpreter. On the other hand, the NDVI method
    does not have above deficiencies for the purpose of classifying crop lands from
    fallow lands, and will perform the same for any image no matter whether current
    or old, because NDVI does not involve the selection of training sites and it does
    not require a very experienced interpreter. So NDVI could provide better, reliable,
    and consistent accuracy of classification results for the purpose of water management.
    Having carried out the above analysis, we should point out that the supervised
    SAM classification is adequate for classifying different crops such as cotton,
    corn, and alfalfa if proper spectral resolution imagery is used. However in this
    case, all these different crops will be grouped into one class: active crops.
    The remaining objects are in fallow land. In other words, these two classes are
    either green or non‐green, which was accurately separated by the NDVI method.
    However, without the mask previously built, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy
    of classification from both NDVI and SAM methods based on the ETM+ imagery. The
    results of using SAM classification on the entire mosaicked IKONOS image did not
    match the real situation very well, because 386 scenes of IKONOS images were acquired,
    spanning a time period of different irrigation rotations (August 2000 to February
    2001). As an example, figure 8 shows the classification result by using the SAM
    method on IKONOS images. It was visually observed that crops in a field are not
    homogeneous (figure 8( a)). The SAM classification (figure 8( b)) overlaying on
    the IKONOS image could identify bare areas (patches) inside agricultural fields.
    These holes (patches) represent that these crops are in poor condition: less water,
    less fertility, more pests, or salt accumulation. Miyamoto ( 2000) concluded that
    most of these holes are due to salt accumulation, because the soil in these fields
    is silt clay, which has features such as inadequate soil permeability and lower
    water infiltration, especially when the soil is compacted or affected by sodium.
    The information is very useful in farming management such as watering, fertilizing,
    identifying presence of pests, or assessing water quality. In other words, it
    is useful to achieve precision agriculture. A disadvantage is that these holes
    could cause mis‐classification between a crop land in poor conditions and a fallow
    land. This suggests that the higher resolution of IKONOS imagery does not guarantee
    higher classification accuracy in this case. The results based on ETM+ imagery
    may ignore these holes and obtain better classification results except for those
    holes bigger than 30 m. Figure 8 Classification catches these holes (bare areas)
    inside fields. (a) The IKONOS image and (b) the classification results overlaying

    method combined with pre‐processing to exclude non‐agricultural fields for mapping
    and measuring the acreages of active crop lands in order to improve irrigation
    management. The evaluation was based on Landsat ETM+ images and was through the
    comparison to a supervised classification method, namely SAM. The similar classification
    accuracies from the two methods demonstrated that the more advanced classification,
    the SAM approach, did not have a clear advantage compared to the method using
    NDVI at the level of distinguishing between active crops and fallow lands, except
    its potential to make more detailed classification, such as further classifying
    crops into corn, cotton and alfalfa. However, this potential capability of the
    SAM method came with the more complex processing (such as selection of training
    sites, N‐dimensional visualizer, selection of spectral endmembers, and post‐classification)
    and exhaustive searching for some proper threshold values (such as specifying
    the spectral angle threshold and sieve pixel threshold). The accurate classification
    from the relatively simple method of using NDVI differencing demonstrated that
    involving ancillary data in pre‐classification processing is an effective scheme
    for avoiding a complex classification method. Because it is accuracy‐reliable
    and cost‐effective, we recommend the NDVI method with pre‐processing to exclude
    some of the unwanted objects as a practical approach in mapping and measuring
    the acreage of active croplands for irrigation management and planning. A comparative
    test was also made to see if high spatial resolution remote sensing images would
    have significant advantages in extracting active crop lands from an agricultural
    region. By examining IKONOS and Landsat ETM+ images, it is clear that using ETM+
    instead of IKONOS high spatial resolution imageries is appropriate in this application.
    When using high resolution images it is difficult to handle the heterogeneity
    of agricultural fields, so salt and pepper effects are unavoidable (Yu et al.
    2006), such as wrong classification patches caused by water stress, by presence
    of pests, or by accumulation of salt. This result made this testing worthwhile,
    because using ETM+ would also have the advantage of avoiding the high cost of
    purchasing IKONOS images and would be an appropriate data source for irrigation
    management in arid or semi‐arid areas. The study provided valuable insights into
    selecting an appropriate classification method as well as a proper type of imagery
    for increasing classification accuracy, reducing complexity, enhancing computation
    efficiency, and maximizing the cost efficiency. Acknowledgements This project

  limitations: 'The study focused on a specific agricultural region and limited types
    of imagery (ETM+ and IKONOS). The generalizability of the findings to other regions
    or different types of imagery may require further investigation.


    The study did not evaluate the accuracy of the classification methods for identifying
    specific crop types, only for distinguishing between active crops and fallow lands.
    For more detailed crop classification, more advanced methods or additional data
    sources may be necessary.'

  title: Suitable remote sensing method and data for mapping and measuring active
    crop fields
  verbatim_quote1: '"In this study, we examined two land-use classification methods
    with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery for mapping and measuring
    the acreages of active crop lands. One is a complex supervised classification
    method, namely the spectral angle mapper (SAM), which is based on similarity of
    spectral characteristics of classes to training site (class). The other one is
    a simple classification method using the normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI) incorporating a pre-classification processing procedure. By comparing to
    the complex SAM method, this study can determine if the NDVI-based classification
    with a pre-processing procedure would be a suitable method for irrigation planning."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 93.63%. The
    results showed that the supervised classification did not have a clear advantage
    over the simple method using NDVI at the level of distinguishing between active
    crops and fallow lands."'
  verbatim_quote3: '"The result suggests that using ETM+ instead of IKONOS high spatial
    resolution imageries is appropriate because of the high cost of IKONOS imageries
    and image heterogeneity of agricultural fields. It was shown that pre-processing
    with a mask to exclude the non-agricultural objects blended with agricultural
    fields is critical."'

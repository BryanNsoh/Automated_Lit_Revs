    Get rights and content Highlights • Systematic literature review of IoT applications
    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    selected by application subdomain. 4.2. Answer to the second research question
    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:
    web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and
    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

  analysis: A methodology for phenotyping crop water use, provided by integrating
    process-based simulation models with spectral measurements of plant states, is
    developed and validated. The process involves merging efforts from experts in
    the ET remote sensing community with experts in the plant science community for
    multidisciplinary CWUE improvement. The validated methodology is then used to
    phenotype crop water use in a cotton breeding trial at Maricopa, AZ, USA in 2016
    and 2017, using ET estimates from a co-located irrigation management study to
    evaluate the approach.

    \ of crop water use efﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as crop yield per volume of\nwater\
    \ used, is an important goal for both crop management and breeding. While many\
    \ technologies\nhave been developed for measuring crop water use in crop management\
    \ studies, rarely have these\ntechniques been applied at the scale of breeding\
    \ plots. The objective was to develop a high-throughput\nmethodology for quantifying\
    \ water use in a cotton breeding trial at Maricopa, AZ, USA in 2016\nand 2017,\
    \ using evapotranspiration (ET) measurements from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    trial to evaluate the approach. Approximately weekly overﬂights with an unmanned\
    \ aerial system\nprovided multispectral imagery from which plot-level fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) was computed.\nThe fc data were used to drive a daily\
    \ ET-based soil water balance model for seasonal crop water\nuse quantiﬁcation.\
    \ A mixed model statistical analysis demonstrated that differences in ET and\n\
    CWUE could be discriminated among eight cotton varieties (p < 0.05), which were\
    \ sown at two\nplanting dates and managed with four irrigation levels. The results\
    \ permitted breeders to identify\ncotton varieties with more favorable water use\
    \ characteristics and higher CWUE, indicating that the\nmethodology could become\
    \ a useful tool for breeding selection.\nKeywords: breeding; drought; evapotranspiration;\
    \ modeling; phenomics; remote sensing; unmanned\naerial system\n1. Introduction\n\
    Drought stress arising from water deﬁcit is a leading cause of crop production\
    \ losses worldwide.\nSpeciﬁc regions of the world are also projected to experience\
    \ increases in the frequency and severity\nof future drought events due to effects\
    \ of climate change on precipitation patterns [1,2]. To maintain\nproductivity\
    \ and security of food, ﬁber, and other agricultural products, increasing crop\
    \ water use\nefﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as the ratio of crop yield and water consumption\
    \ volume, is an important\ngoal to ameliorate impacts of future drought. Increases\
    \ in CWUE can result both from improvements\nin agronomic management practices\
    \ [3] and by developing improved crop cultivars that yield highly\nunder water\
    \ deﬁcit conditions [4]. Although these pathways are often pursued independently\
    \ within\ndisciplinary boundaries, the most comprehensive solutions towards CWUE\
    \ improvement will be\nachieved through multidisciplinary efforts.\nAdoption of\
    \ information technologies for problem solving in the agricultural sciences has\
    \ been\nan especially pervasive occurrence in recent years. For example, precision\
    \ irrigation, where water\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682; doi:10.3390/rs10111682\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n2 of 19\napplications\
    \ are tuned based on the spatial and temporal crop need, is a primary technology\
    \ for\nimproving CWUE in crop production settings [5,6]. Other agronomic solutions\
    \ involve improved\nfertility management, optimizing sowing dates, using cover\
    \ crops or mulches, and choosing\nalternative crops or crop rotations [3]. In\
    \ the plant sciences, high-throughput plant phenomics,\nwhich involves deployment\
    \ of crop sensing systems for rapid phenotyping of breeding populations,\nhas\
    \ potential to guide crop improvement efforts toward cultivars with increased\
    \ tolerance to drought\nstress [4,7,8]. Information technologies in the form of\
    \ sensors, imagers, data loggers, sensor deployment\nvehicles, geographic information\
    \ systems, geostatistical methods, data management approaches,\nand engineering\
    \ control systems are central to the success of these technical solutions to improving\n\
    CWUE. However, further efforts are needed to solidify the role of information\
    \ technology for practical\nadvancement towards this goal.\nRemote sensing has\
    \ been used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) and predict drought stress\n\
    at multiple scales [9–13]. For example, Yebra et al. [14] combined vegetation\
    \ metrics derived from\nthe MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ satellite with the Penman-Monteith\nequation to estimate ET for evergreen and\
    \ deciduous broadleaf forests. At the agricultural ﬁeld scale,\nColaizzi et al.\
    \ [15] installed infrared thermometers on an overhead sprinkler irrigation machine\
    \ to\nestimate daily ET. They proposed that the approach could improve CWUE through\
    \ better irrigation\nscheduling. In addition, Hunsaker et al. [16] used multispectral\
    \ cameras aboard a manned helicopter\nto map the normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) of a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) ﬁeld,\nestimated basal crop\
    \ coefﬁcients from NDVI, and scheduled irrigation using an ET-based soil water\n\
    balance model [17]. Results for one growing season showed that the recommendations\
    \ from the\nscheduling model led to increased CWUE when NDVI was used to estimate\
    \ basal crop coefﬁcients.\nAdditional ﬁeld testing is needed to further realize\
    \ CWUE improvements using remote sensing to\nguide irrigation management decisions.\n\
    Leveraging the technology previously developed for precision agriculture applications,\
    \ remote and\nproximal sensing has recently become a highly popular tool for field-based\
    \ plant phenotyping,\nparticularly by integrating imaging equipment with unmanned\
    \ aerial systems (i.e., drones) to obtain very\nhigh resolution imagery of plant\
    \ breeding trials. For example, Zaman-Allah et al. [18] related nitrogen\nstress,\
    \ senescence, and yield for ten maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids to NDVI from multispectral\
    \ images\ncollected with a drone. In addition, Sankaran et al. [19] used a multispectral\
    \ camera with a drone to\nestimate seedling emergence and stand density for more\
    \ than 100 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\nvarieties in Washington State.\
    \ Condorelli et al. [20] measured NDVI with a drone-based multispectral\ncamera\
    \ over 248 durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) lines at different growth stages and\
    \ water regimes.\nA subsequent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified\
    \ 22 single quantitative trait loci (QTL)\nfor NDVI, particularly as related to\
    \ terminal drought stress. Although many important advancements\nhave been made,\
    \ moving remote sensing data analyses beyond the NDVI will enhance the quantification\n\
    of useful phenotypes.\nFew studies, if any, have aimed to directly phenotype crop\
    \ water use or CWUE for purposes\nof breeding or genomic analysis. Rather, the\
    \ focus has been to estimate related plant traits, such as\nspectral indices that\
    \ correlate with plant water status, under both well-watered and water-limited\n\
    conditions [21–24]. A key difference is that plant water status describes the\
    \ plant state at a singular\ntime point, whereas crop water use is a process that\
    \ occurs over time. For this reason, efforts to\nintegrate process-based simulation\
    \ models with spectral measurements of plant states may provide\nphenotypes that\
    \ better express the process-based nature of plant growth and water consumption\
    \ [25].\nAlthough the integration of remote sensing data with models of radiation\
    \ transfer, crop growth,\nand soil water balance has been widely studied for regional\
    \ and ﬁeld-scale mapping of crop water use,\nsuch techniques have not been applied\
    \ for ﬁeld-based, high-throughput plant phenomics.\nThe main goal of this study\
    \ was to develop a methodology for phenotyping crop water use\nand CWUE in a cotton\
    \ breeding trial, using ET estimates from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    study to evaluate the approach. It attempts to merge efforts from the ET remote\
    \ sensing community\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n3 of 19\nwith efforts in the\
    \ plant science community in a multidisciplinary effort toward CWUE improvement.\n\
    Speciﬁc objectives were to (1) estimate fractional vegetation cover (fc) from\
    \ multispectral images\ncollected over the cotton ﬁeld trials with a drone, (2)\
    \ use plot-level fc to derive crop water use\ncalculations from an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model, and (3) identify cotton cultivars with\nfavorable\
    \ yield, ﬁber quality and water use efﬁciency across treatments and growing seasons.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Field Experiments\nCotton ﬁeld experiments were\
    \ conducted at the University of Arizona’s Maricopa Agricultural\nCenter (MAC)\
    \ near Maricopa, AZ (33.079◦N, 111.977◦W, 360 m above sea level) during the 2016\n\
    and 2017 growing seasons (Figure 1).\nThe environment in central Arizona is arid\
    \ and hot,\nwith maximum daily air temperatures regularly exceeding 38 ◦C in July\
    \ and August. Growing\nseason precipitation from April through September amounted\
    \ to 42 and 51 mm in 2016 and 2017,\nrespectively. In comparison, short crop reference\
    \ ET during the same period was 1364 and 1404 mm in\n2016 and 2017, respectively.\
    \ Thus, cotton production required irrigation to meet evaporative demand.\n2014\n\

    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n4 of 19\nSoil variability at the 6-ha ﬁeld site was characterized\
    \ via a multi-year soil sampling effort at\n160 locations (not shown). A tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler (model 25-TS, Giddings Machine Co.,\nWindsor, CO, USA) was used\
    \ to collect cylindrical soil samples (0.04-m diameter × 0.4-m depth)\nat ﬁve\
    \ incremental soil proﬁle depths centered at 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4 and 1.8 m. Soil\
    \ texture analysis\nwas conducted in the laboratory using the hydrometer method\
    \ of Gee and Bauder [26], and the soil\nwater holding limits of each sample was\
    \ computed from texture data using the Rosetta pedotransfer\nfunctions [27]. For\
    \ ET estimation purposes (discussed below), ordinary kriging was used to spatially\n\
    interpolate soil water limits at the central location of each ﬁeld plot (Figure\
    \ 1). Geostatistics were\nconducted using the “geoR” package within the R Project\
    \ for Statistical Computing software. Primarily,\nsoil texture at the ﬁeld site\
    \ was sandy loam and sandy clay loam with drained upper limits between\n0.16 and\
    \ 0.22 cm3 cm−3 and lower limits between 0.08 and 0.11 cm3 cm−3.\nData from two\
    \ ﬁeld experiments (Experiment #1 and Experiment #2), each with a unique\nexperimental\
    \ design and purpose, were used to complete the objectives of this study. The\
    \ two ﬁeld\nexperiments were established on adjacent land areas (Figure 1), both\
    \ receiving irrigation from the same\noverhead, lateral-move sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system (Zimmatic, Lindsay Corporation, Omaha, NE, USA).\nAdvanced technology\
    \ on the irrigation machine permitted the application of variable irrigation rates\n\
    based on georeferenced irrigation maps uploaded to the machine’s control panel.\
    \ The variable-rate\nirrigation system permitted unique control of irrigation\
    \ rates from individual drop hoses, which were\nspaced 1.0 m apart and located\
    \ at the center of each interrow area. Nozzles were positioned to emit\nwater\
    \ less than 1.0 m above the soil surface. For uniform soil wetting prior to cotton\
    \ emergence, spray\npads giving a spray diameter of approximately 5.0 m were used.\
    \ After emergence, the pads were\nchanged to a “bubbler” style, which emitted\
    \ large droplets with a 0.3-m spray diameter at the center of\neach interrow area.\
    \ In addition to reducing water loss to evaporation, the bubbler pads increased\
    \ the\nspatial accuracy of irrigation applications relative to the intended application\
    \ areas delineated in the\ngeoreferenced irrigation maps. Spatial application\
    \ error with the variable-rate irrigation machine was\nestimated to be less than\
    \ 2.0 m. The overhead irrigation system with variable-rate capability permitted\n\
    both ﬁeld experiments to incorporate multiple irrigation rates as a primary treatment.\n\
    Experiment #1 tested cotton yield and water use responses to variable irrigation\
    \ rate and timing\nfor one commercial cotton variety (Deltapine 1549 B2XF, Monsanto\
    \ Company, St. Louis, MO, USA).\nTreatment plots were relatively large (12.2 m\
    \ (12 cotton rows) × 30.0 m) and required a majority of\nthe ﬁeld area (Figure\
    \ 1). The experimental design included four replications of sixteen irrigation\n\
    management treatments (64 plots), which involved all the possible combinations\
    \ of four irrigation\nrates applied during two distinct periods of the growing\
    \ season. The four irrigation rates were 60%,\n80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\
    \ provided by an irrigation scheduling tool based on the\nCSM-CROPGRO-Cotton agroecosystem\
    \ model [28]. The two irrigation periods were from ﬁrst square\nto peak bloom\
    \ (approximately the ﬁrst of June through mid-July) and from peak bloom to 90%\
    \ open\nboll (approximately mid-July through the ﬁrst week of September). The\
    \ various combinations of the\nfour rates during the two times resulted in sixteen\
    \ total irrigation treatments, which led to cotton\ngrown under a variety of soil\
    \ water status conditions. The entire ﬁeld area was disked and planed\nprior to\
    \ planting. Cotton was planted with a north-south row orientation on 25 April\
    \ 2016 (day of year\n(DOY) 116) and 18 April 2017 (DOY 108).\nOf highest relevance\
    \ to the present study, Experiment #1 incorporated weekly soil water content\n\
    measurements via a ﬁeld-calibrated neutron moisture meter (model 503, Campbell\
    \ Paciﬁc Nuclear,\nMartinez, CA, USA). After crop emergence, steel access tubes\
    \ were installed at the center of each\ntreatment plot (Figure 1) using the tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler. From mid-May to early October,\nthe neutron moisture meter was\
    \ deployed on a weekly basis (approximately 20 times per growing\nseason) to measure\
    \ soil water content from 0.1 to 1.9 m in 0.2-m incremental depths at each access\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n5 of 19\ntube. Soil water content data were used\
    \ to estimate ET and deep seepage (DS) between successive\nmeasurement events\
    \ using the soil water balance approach described by Hunsaker et al. [29]:\nET\
    \ =\n7\n∑\ni=1\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1) +\nn−1\n∑\nj=1\n(Rj + Ij) − DS,\n(1)\nDS = max\
    \ (0.0,\n10\n∑\ni=8\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1)),\n(2)\nwhere ET is the total evapotranspiration\
    \ and DS is the total deep seepage occurring from the\nbeginning of a given measurement\
    \ day (denoted as day j = 1) to the end of the day before the\nsuccessive measurement\
    \ date (denoted as j = n − 1), Di,1 and Di,n−1 are respectively the water depth\n\
    measurements at soil depth increment i at the beginning of day 1 and at the end\
    \ of day n − 1, and Rj\nand Ij are respectively the precipitation and net irrigation\
    \ depths received on day j. For the sake\nof practicality, soil water content\
    \ measurements collected on the morning of day n were used to\napproximate soil\
    \ water content at the end of day n − 1. Deep seepage was not permitted to be\
    \ negative,\nmeaning upﬂux from below the neutron access tube was considered negligible.\
    \ The seasonal ET\nestimates from neutron moisture meter data provided important\
    \ veriﬁcation that the ET estimation\nmethodology (discussed below) provided reasonably\
    \ accurate results.\nExperiment #2 was a breeding trial that tested the responses\
    \ of eight cotton cultivars (Table 1) to\ntwo planting dates and four irrigation\
    \ rates (Figure 1). The experimental design was a randomized\ncomplete block design\
    \ with planting date as the block and irrigation rate treatments nested within\n\
    the blocks. Each cultivar was replicated three times for each irrigation treatment,\
    \ totaling 96 plots\nper block. The first planting date treatment was sown on\
    \ 26 April 2016 (DOY 117) and 19 April 2017\n(DOY 109), and the second planting\
    \ date treatment was sown on 18 May 2016 (DOY 139) and 10 May\n2017 (DOY 130).\
    \ The four irrigation rates were 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\n\
    provided by a simulation tool for irrigation scheduling [28] and were administered\
    \ consistently from\nfirst square (early June) to 90% open boll (early September).\
    \ Irrigation rates were administered uniformly\nwithin spatial areas containing\
    \ 24 treatment plots (8 cultivars × 3 replications). Buffer areas with width\n\
    of 6.0 m (six cotton rows) and planted to a single commercial cotton variety were\
    \ incorporated centrally\nalong the boundaries of irrigation treatments to prevent\
    \ spatial error in the variable-rate irrigation\napplication from affecting cultivar\
    \ treatments. In 2016, the plot dimensions for cultivar treatments\nwere 3.0 m\
    \ (three cotton rows) × 4.6 m with a 1.5 m buffer area between plots. In 2017,\
    \ the plot size\nwas reduced to 2.0 m (two cotton rows) × 4.6 m, and the buffer\
    \ area between plots remained 1.5 m.\nDue to the relatively small size and large\
    \ number of treatment plots (i.e., 192 per growing season),\nplot-level ET estimation\
    \ via neutron moisture meter measurements and other common ET measurement\nmethodologies\
    \ was impractical. Thus, this study aimed to estimate ET by integrating plot-specific\n\
    remote sensing data and an ET-based soil water balance model with site-specific\
    \ soil parameterization,\nproviding an approach for high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of cotton water use in this breeding trial.\nTable 1. Summary of eight cotton\

    \ with a two-row picker on 1 November 2016\n(DOY 306) and 8 November 2017 (DOY\
    \ 312). Samples from each plot were bagged and weighed\nseparately in the ﬁeld.\
    \ Prior to the harvest date, 25 mature bolls were sampled from each plot and\n\
    ginned on a small research-scale cotton gin. Harvest weight, ﬁber turnout percentage,\
    \ and plot area\nwere used to compute cotton ﬁber yield (kg ha−1) for each plot.\
    \ Additionally, cotton ﬁber from the\n25 mature boll samples was sent to Cotton\
    \ Incorporated (Cary, NC, USA) for analysis of ﬁber quality\nvia High Volume Instrument\
    \ (HVI) methods.\n2.2. Multispectral Imaging\nRemote sensing surveys from an autopiloted\
    \ drone were conducted over the ﬁeld site on multiple\noccasions in 2016 and 2017\
    \ (Table 2). Images were collected either via a ﬁve-band multispectral\ncamera\
    \ (RedEdge, MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA) aboard a custom-built hexacopter or a\
    \ four-band\nmultispectral camera (Sequoia, Parrot, Paris, France) aboard a ﬁxed-wing\
    \ drone (eBee, SenseFly,\nCheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland). The bandwidths\
    \ and central wavelengths for the ﬁve-band\nRedEdge camera were 20 nm at 475 nm\
    \ (blue), 20 nm at 560 nm (green), 10 nm at 668 nm (red),\n10 nm at 717 nm (red\
    \ edge), and 40 nm at 840 nm (near infrared). For the four-band Sequoia camera,\n\
    bandwidths and central wavelengths were 40 nm at 550 nm (green), 40 nm at 660\
    \ nm (red), 10 nm\nat 735 nm (red edge), and 40 nm at 790 nm (near infrared).\
    \ Both cameras featured a global shutter\nfor multispectral image capture and\
    \ an upward facing sensor for solar irradiance characterization\nduring overﬂight.\
    \ The bit depth of images was 10 and 12 bits per channel for the Sequoia and\n\
    RedEdge cameras, respectively. Flight plans were designed for 80% image overlap\
    \ along ﬂight paths.\nImage spatial resolution at the ﬂight altitude of 75 m was\
    \ approximately 5 cm per pixel.\nTable 2. Multispectral image reconnaissance from\

    \ DAP1; days after the second planting, DAP2.\nOn the morning of remote sensing\
    \ surveys, four 8-m × 8-m calibration tarps (Group VIII\nTechnologies, Provo,\
    \ UT, USA) were positioned near the cotton ﬁeld. Concurrently with drone\nimage\
    \ acquisition, ground-based radiometric measurements of each calibration tarp\
    \ were collected\nwith a portable ﬁeld spectroradiometer (FieldSpec 3, Analytical\
    \ Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n7 of 19\nCO,\
    \ USA), which was sensitive to wavelengths between 350 and 2500 nm. Additional\
    \ radiometric\nmeasurements over a calibrated, 99% Spectralon panel (Labsphere,\
    \ Inc., North Sutton, NH, USA) were\nused to characterize incoming solar irradiance\
    \ and to compute spectral reﬂectance factors of each tarp\nduring overﬂight. Based\
    \ on the quantum efﬁciency and ﬁlter functions for the multispectral cameras,\n\
    the tarp spectral reﬂectance data were ﬁltered to provide singular reﬂectance\
    \ factors for each tarp,\ncorresponding to each channel of the multispectral cameras.\
    \ The ﬁltered tarp reﬂectance data were\nused for image calibration efforts.\n\
    A commercial photogrammetry software (Pix4DMapperPro, Pix4D S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland)\n\
    was used to stitch images for each channel of the multispectral cameras. Geographic\
    \ coordinates from\n21 ground control points around the ﬁeld area were surveyed\
    \ with a real-time kinematic (RTK) global\npositioning receiver and were incorporated\
    \ into the image processing for georeferencing purposes.\nThe Pix4D software was\
    \ set to use camera calibration information and measurements from the upward\n\
    facing solar irradiance sensor for initial image calibration. Additionally, the\
    \ software provided an\noption to input the known reﬂectance of one calibration\
    \ target. Because reﬂectance measurements\nwere available for the calibration\
    \ tarps, the darkest calibration tarp was used for the known reﬂectance\ninput,\
    \ instead of the typical reﬂectance panel supplied by the camera manufacturer.\n\
    Comparisons of the measured tarp reﬂectance data with the values from tarp pixels\
    \ in the\northomosaic suggested that additional image calibration was needed following\
    \ Pix4D image processing.\nFor each multispectral image band, linear regression\
    \ equations were developed to relate the measured\nreﬂectance of all four calibration\
    \ targets to the average pixel value of each target in the images.\nUsing the\
    \ band math function in a commercial remote sensing software (Environment for\
    \ Visualizing\nImages (ENVI), Version 5.5, Exelis Visual Information Solutions,\
    \ Boulder, CO, USA), the linear\nregression equations were applied to compute\
    \ reﬂectance for all pixels in the image. The set of four\n(Sequoia) or ﬁve (RedEdge)\
    \ calibrated multispectral image bands were then layer stacked, such that\nfalse\
    \ color composite images (e.g., Figure 1) could be inspected for accuracy of image\
    \ calibration\nand georeferencing.\nBased on spectral information in all image\
    \ channels, a supervised maximum likelihood classiﬁer\nwithin the ENVI software\
    \ was used to segment the composite images into bare soil and vegetation\ncomponents.\
    \ The classiﬁer was trained by manually selecting regions of interest associated\
    \ with the\ntwo classes. Due to the relatively high spatial resolution from drone-based\
    \ images, it was generally\nsimple to select multiple regions of interest that,\
    \ with high certainty, represented pure spectral data\nfor each class. The image\
    \ classiﬁcation result was used to produce a binary image with values of\n0 for\
    \ bare soil and 1 for vegetation. The binary image was loaded into a geographic\
    \ information\nsystem (QGIS, www.qgis.org) for calculation of zonal statistics\
    \ within the boundaries of each ﬁeld\nplot, as delineated with shapeﬁle polygons\
    \ (Figure 1). Based on the total vegetation pixels within\neach polygon, the fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) of each ﬁeld plot was computed for each ﬂight date\n(Table\
    \ 2).\n2.3. Fractional Cover Modeling\nTo facilitate calculations of cotton water\
    \ use for each ﬁeld plot (discussed below), daily fc estimates\nwere obtained\
    \ using a Kalman smoothing algorithm [30] to integrate drone-based fc measurements\n\
    with fc from a daily logistic growth model:\ndfc\ndt = r fc\n\x12\n1 −\nfc\nfc,max\n\
    \x13\n,\n(3)\nwhere r describes the growth rate (d−1) and fc,max is the maximum\
    \ value that fc attains. This differential\nequation has an analytical solution:\n\
    fc =\n \ncer(t−t0)\n1 +\nc\nfc,max er(t−t0)\n!\n,\n(4)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\
    \ 1682\n8 of 19\nwhere\nc =\nfc,max fc,0\nfc,max − fc,0\n(5)\nand fc,0 is fc at\
    \ the initial time (t0). The model was parameterized for each ﬁeld plot by adjusting\
    \ r,\nfc,0, and fc,max to minimize error between modeled fc and the drone-based\
    \ fc measurements. The t0\nterm was ﬁxed as the DOY for planting each plot. Subsequently,\
    \ Equation (3) with ﬁtted parameters\nwas incorporated into an unscented Kalman\
    \ smoothing algorithm to develop daily fc time series that\nconsidered uncertainty\
    \ in both the measured and modeled fc data. Kalman smoothing was especially\n\
    important for characterizing fc in plots where the imposed treatments caused atypical\
    \ growth patterns\n(Figure 2). To achieve reasonable time series as assessed visually,\
    \ the fc state transition variance was\nset to 0.0002 while the measurement variance\
    \ was set ﬁve times higher at 0.001. A Python script was\ndeveloped to conduct\
    \ this analysis, which incorporated a Nelder–Mead optimizer within the “scipy”\n\
    package for parameter ﬁtting and the “pykalman” package for unscented Kalman smoothing.\n\

    the 2017 growing season at Maricopa, AZ, USA.\n2.4. Crop Water Use Estimation\n\
    The daily fc time series from Kalman smoothing were rescaled to formulate basal\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\n(Kcb) time series, which were used to drive an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model as described\nin the Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ of the United Nations Paper No. 56 (FAO-56) [17]. Brieﬂy,\ndaily crop water\
    \ use (ETc) was calculated with the following equation:\nETc = (KcbKs + Ke) ETos,\n\
    (6)\nwhere ETos is the standardized short crop reference evapotranspiration [31],\
    \ Ke is the soil water\nevaporation coefﬁcient, and Ks describes the effect of\
    \ water stress on transpiration. Daily ETos was\ncomputed using data from an Arizona\
    \ Meteorological Network station (AZMET) approximately 1.2 km\nfrom the ﬁeld site.\
    \ Required meteorological measurements included the daily minimum and maximum\n\
    air temperature, dew point temperature, solar irradiance, and wind speed. Based\
    \ on recommended\ncomputations for maximum Kcb given environmental data for Maricopa,\
    \ the Kcb time series were\nrescaled from fc with a minimum value of 0.15 and\
    \ maximum value of 1.225. The coefﬁcients Ke and\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n\
    9 of 19\nKs were calculated as described in FAO-56. For Ks in particular, calculations\
    \ were based on a daily\nsoil water balance methodology, where soil water holding\
    \ limits deﬁne the total plant available water.\nUnder non-stressed conditions\
    \ with root zone soil water at the drained upper limit, Ks is 1.0 and has\nno\
    \ effect on ETc calculations (Equation (6)). As soil water is depleted, reductions\
    \ in Ks are calculated,\nwhich lead to decreased ETc from plant transpiration.\
    \ As mentioned above, the soil water holding\nlimits were speciﬁed uniquely for\
    \ each treatment plot based on soil sampling, soil texture analysis,\npedotransfer\
    \ function evaluations, and geostatistical calculations at the ﬁeld site. Thus,\
    \ the crop water\nuse calculations were based on plot-level, site-speciﬁc information\
    \ for both the soil water holding\nproperties and the plant growth impacts on\
    \ Kcb as characterized through drone-based fc. The soil\nwater status on day i\
    \ was calculated as follows:\nDi = Di−1 − Pi − Ii + ETci + DSi,\n(7)\nwhere D\
    \ is the depth of root zone soil water depletion from the drained upper limit\
    \ at the end of the\nday, P and I are the precipitation and irrigation received\
    \ on the day, ETc is the daily crop water use\nfrom Equation (6), and DS is the\
    \ water lost to deep seepage, which is calculated when water inputs\nexceed the\
    \ root zone soil water storage capacity. This ET-based soil water balance model,\
    \ as described\nin FAO-56 [17], was coded as a Python script for use in all cotton\
    \ water use calculations in this study.\nFor each treatment plot in both ﬁeld\
    \ experiments in both growing seasons, ETc calculations were\ninitiated on the\
    \ day of planting and terminated after crop maturity in the ﬁrst week of October.\n\
    To summarize the seasonal crop water use, daily ETc calculations were aggregated\
    \ over time.\nFor comparison to measured ETc data in the irrigation management\
    \ study (Equation (1)), daily ETc\ncalculations were aggregated from the ﬁrst\
    \ to the last neutron moisture meter measurement dates in\neach growing season.\
    \ For the cotton breeding trial, ETc data were aggregated over the entire calculation\n\
    period from planting to crop maturity. Furthermore, seasonal CWUE (kg m−3) was\
    \ calculated from\nthe ratio of measured cotton ﬁber yield and modeled seasonal\
    \ cotton ET. To eliminate the effect of\nsurface soil water evaporation, seasonal\
    \ water use efﬁciency was also computed considering only the\ntranspiration component\
    \ of ET (TWUE, kg m−3).\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical software (SAS\
    \ for Windows, ver. 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to ﬁt a\nlinear\
    \ model for each of eleven cotton traits in response to the experimental treatments\
    \ in the breeding\ntrial. The eleven cotton traits were ﬁber yield (FY, kg ha−1),\
    \ seasonal evapotranspiration (ET, mm),\ncrop water use efﬁciency (CWUE = FY:ET,\
    \ kg m−3), seasonal transpiration (T, mm), transpiration water\nuse efﬁciency\
    \ (TWUE = FY:T, kg m−3), micronaire (MIC, unitless), upper half mean ﬁber length\
    \ (UHM,\nmm), uniformity index (UI, mm mm−1), ﬁber strength (STR, HVI g tex−1),\
    \ ﬁber elongation at failure\n(ELO, %), and short ﬁber content (SFC, %). Mixed\
    \ model analysis of variance was conducted for each\ntrait using the SAS MIXED\
    \ procedure with the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method. In the\ncase\
    \ that more than one trait estimate was available per plot, the plot mean was\
    \ used as the dependent\nvariable. The statistical model for each trait (Y) was\n\
    Yijklmn = µ + αi + βj + γk + δl(k) + (αβ)ij + (αγ)ik + (βγ)jk + (αδ)il(k) + (βδ)jl(k)\n\
    +(αβγ)ijk + (αβδ)ijl(k) + ζm + (αζ)im + ϵn(ijklm),\n(8)\nwhere experimental year\
    \ (αi), cotton cultivar (βj), planting date (γk), irrigation treatment nested\
    \ within\nplanting date (δl(k)), and corresponding interaction terms were ﬁtted\
    \ as ﬁxed effects, and the replicate\n(ζm) and year by replicate interaction ((αζ)im)\
    \ were ﬁtted as random effects. To examine associations\namong traits, Pearson’s\
    \ correlation coefﬁcients (r) were determined using the SAS CORR procedure.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n10 of 19\n3. Results\n3.1. Crop Water Use Evaluation\n\
    Evaluation of seasonal cotton water use estimates from the drone-based ET modeling\
    \ approach as\ncompared to ET measurements from neutron moisture meters demonstrated\
    \ reasonable performance\nwith the modeling technique (Figure 3). The root mean\
    \ squared errors (RMSE) between measured and\nmodeled seasonal ET among 64 treatment\
    \ plots in the irrigation management study were less than 5%.\nIn both seasons,\
    \ the model underestimated ET for the four treatment plots with the highest ET\
    \ amounts.\nThese treatment plots received 120% of the recommended irrigation\
    \ rate over the whole season and\nwere therefore overwatered. One possibility\
    \ is that measured ET from the neutron moisture meters\nwas overestimated, which\
    \ is likely considering that deep seepage was estimated from soil moisture\nstates\
    \ typically one week apart (Equation (2)). In actuality, more water ﬂux to deep\
    \ seepage may have\noccurred for the overwatered plots, which would reduce estimates\
    \ for measured ET (Equation (1))\nif it could be accurately measured. For other\
    \ treatment plots, which were not overwatered for the\nentire season, the agreement\
    \ between measured and modeled ET was very good. In 2016 and 2017,\nmeasured deep\
    \ seepage ranged from 45 to 97 mm and from 21 to 63 mm, respectively (not shown).\n\
    Modeled deep seepage in both years ranged from 0 to 146 mm with a majority of\
    \ plots modeled as\nhaving zero seepage. On average, measured deep seepage was\
    \ less than 7% and 4% of ET in 2016 and\n2017, respectively, which demonstrates\
    \ the high importance of crop water use as a pathway for water\nloss from the\
    \ agroecosystem. Overall, the results show that the drone-based fc and soil water\
    \ balance\nmodeling approach could effectively estimate seasonal cotton water\
    \ use at this ﬁeld site.\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\nMeasured ET (m)\n\

    \ in 2017 at Maricopa, AZ, USA.\n3.2. Basal Crop Coefﬁcients\nThe basal crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kcb) time series for each plot in the breeding trial were variable\naccording\
    \ to the combined effect of planting date, irrigation rate, and cotton cultivar\
    \ on fc, as measured\nusing drone-based images (Figure 4). For example on DOY\
    \ 184 in 2016, which is approximately the\ndate of ﬁrst ﬂower, the Kcb among plots\
    \ in the ﬁrst planting varied from 0.40 to 1.09 (Figure 4a).\nThis means that\
    \ some plots were transpiring as low as 23% of full transpiration capacity on\
    \ this day,\nwhile others were transpiring as high as 88% of full capacity. As\
    \ compared to the standard trapezoidal\nKcb time series, which were computed based\
    \ on days after planting as recommended in FAO-56,\nmany plots reached full transpiration\
    \ capacity earlier than the standard, while others never reached\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n11 of 19\nfull transpiration capacity. The drone-based fc data\
    \ also suggested that late season Kcb remained\nhigher than the standard Kcb recommendation,\
    \ which may be true because cotton was traditionally a\nperennial plant and for\
    \ agronomic purposes requires defoliation by desiccant application to terminate\n\
    leaf growth and transpiration. Overall, to the extent that Kcb via drone-based\
    \ fc correlates to plant\ntranspiration rates, the data suggest highly variable\
    \ water use patterns among the treatments imposed\nin the cotton breeding trial.\n\

    \ trial for two growing seasons, two planting dates, and four irrigation\nrates.\
    \ Computations of seasonal ET with the drone-based fc and soil water balance modeling\
    \ approach\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n12 of 19\nranged from 661 to 1223 mm,\
    \ indicating that some plots used up to twice as much water as others.\nEstimates\
    \ of the seasonal transpiration component of ET ranged from 389 to 1069 mm. On\
    \ average,\n0.19 kg of cotton ﬁber was produced per m3 of water consumed (i.e.,\
    \ CWUE). Considering only\nthe transpiration component of ET, mean TWUE was 0.25\
    \ kg m−3, a 26% increase as compared to\ncalculations that included surface evaporation.\
    \ This establishes an upper limit on the potential for\nCWUE improvements through\
    \ management practices that reduce surface evaporation.\nThe ﬁber quality measurements\
    \ suggested desirable ﬁber characteristics in some cases and less\ndesirable characteristics\
    \ in others. With micronaire values above 4.3, none of the plots produced ﬁber\n\
    with micronaire in the range required for premium pricing (i.e., 3.7 to 4.2).\
    \ Upper half mean length\nranged from 26 to 32 mm, indicating medium to long ﬁber\
    \ lengths. Uniformity indices ranged from 79\nto 86 mm mm−1, indicating average\
    \ to high ﬁber length uniformity. Fiber strength ranged from 27 to\n40 HVI g tex−1,\
    \ indicating average to very strong ﬁbers. Elongation at failure ranged from 4.0%\
    \ to 7.6%,\nindicating very low to high ﬁber elongation and an overall wide range\
    \ for this study. With r equal to\n0.31 and 0.33 (not shown), CWUE and TWUE, respectively,\
    \ were correlated with ﬁber elongation at\nfailure. Thus, the plots with higher\
    \ water use efﬁciency tended to produce ﬁbers that could stretch\nmore before\
    \ breaking. In addition, with r equal to 0.30 and 0.34, seasonal ET and T, respectively,\
    \ were\ncorrelated with upper half mean ﬁber length. Thus, plots with higher water\
    \ use generally produced\nlonger ﬁbers. Fiber yield did not correlate with any\
    \ ﬁber quality metrics with r greater than 0.24. Thus,\nCWUE and TWUE were better\
    \ estimators of ﬁber quality metrics than ﬁber yield in some cases.\nTable 3.\

    0.0006\n3.4. Relevance to Breeding\nImproving CWUE via plant breeding requires\
    \ the identiﬁcation of cultivars that yield highly\nbut with reduced transpiration.\
    \ An important aspect of the modeling methodology is that the crop\ncoefﬁcients\
    \ (Equation (6)) permit partitioning of water use among plant transpiration and\
    \ surface\nevaporation components. Thus, for purposes of breeding, the results\
    \ can be discussed in terms of\nTWUE, the crop yield per volume of water transpired\
    \ because breeding will primarily improve CWUE\nthrough the transpiration component\
    \ of ET.\nPlots of ﬁber yield versus seasonal transpiration demonstrated a positive\
    \ correlation for all\ngrowing season and planting date combinations (Figure 5),\
    \ generally equating higher yield with higher\nwater use as commonly shown in\
    \ crop water production functions [3]. Coefﬁcients of determination (r2)\nbetween\
    \ ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration were higher with the second planting than\
    \ with the ﬁrst\nplanting, indicating water management was a stronger driver of\
    \ yield variability with later planting.\nBoth ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration\
    \ were reduced with the second planting as compared to the\nﬁrst planting. The\
    \ effect was due in part to a shorter growing season for the second planting because\
    \ it\nwas planted approximately one month later than the ﬁrst planting while irrigation\
    \ for both planting\ndate treatments was terminated at the same time in early\
    \ September. Extending the irrigation period\nlater into September may have increased\
    \ ﬁber yield and transpiration for the second planting.\nReduction in seasonal\
    \ transpiration for the second planting may also be due to environmental\ndifferences.\
    \ In central Arizona, the month of June (DOY 152 to 181) typically has high ambient\n\
    temperatures and low humidity, which leads to increased evaporative demand (i.e.,\
    \ ETos). In addition,\nas seen in Figure 4, the Kcb (i.e., transpiration rate)\
    \ during this period was much higher for the ﬁrst\nplanting than for the second\
    \ planting due to higher fc. Thus, water use in the month of June was\nmuch greater\
    \ for the ﬁrst planting (Equation (6)). With the second planting, the hot and\
    \ dry period in\nJune was largely avoided, and maximum Kcb was not attained until\
    \ July when the Arizona monsoon\nseason brought higher humidity, reduced ambient\
    \ air temperatures, and lower evaporative demand.\nThus, improvements in CWUE\
    \ may come from better timing of the maximum Kcb period with the\nArizona monsoon\
    \ season. Furthermore, because r2 between ﬁber yield and transpiration was greater\n\
    for the second planting, the Arizona monsoon season may provide a better environment\
    \ for selecting\nheritable traits that improve yield and CWUE and increase genetic\
    \ gain in breeding populations.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n14 of 19\n0.0\n\

    Data were collected as part of a cotton breeding trial conducted at Maricopa,\
    \ AZ, USA.\nThe calculated TWUE for each cotton variety in the breeding trial\
    \ showed signiﬁcant variation\namong planting dates and irrigation rates (Figure\
    \ 6). The TWUE for the ﬁrst 2017 planting at the\n60% irrigation rate was unreasonably\
    \ high (Figure 6c). This was likely due to errant irrigation\napplications to\
    \ those plots, which was supported by soil moisture measurements (data not shown).\n\
    After removing this treatment from consideration, DP1044B2RF (C3) and Arkot9704\
    \ (C2) demonstrated\nthe most consistent TWUE across years, planting dates, and\
    \ irrigation treatments. Furthermore, C3 was\nranked as the second highest yielding\
    \ line and also had consistent ﬁber quality traits across years\nand treatments.\
    \ This means producers should expect consistent yields with C3 and C2 over a range\n\
    of soil water status conditions. However, selecting on yield stability alone can\
    \ be unreliable due to\nthe effects of environmental variation across growing\
    \ seasons. Calculated TWUE may provide an\nalternative phenotype for selection\
    \ because aggregated environmental conditions are included in the\nestimate, thus\
    \ reducing selection error caused by environment or management variation. For\
    \ example,\nDP1044B2RF (C3) and FM958 (C5) consistently achieved higher TWUE at\

    A main advantage of the ET-based soil water balance model (Equations (6) and (7))\
    \ is its\npartitioning of crop water use into surface evaporation and plant transpiration\
    \ components via\ncrop coefﬁcients (Kcb, Ks, and Ke). As dictated by the model\
    \ equations [17], Ks and Ke are mainly\ninﬂuenced by soil water holding characteristics,\
    \ and Ke is additionally inﬂuenced by the irrigation\nsystem and ground cover.\
    \ Thus, reductions in crop water use via changes to these coefﬁcients can\nbe\
    \ achieved only through adjustments in management practices. Some options include\
    \ switching to\nsubsurface drip irrigation to limit surface evaporation, adopting\
    \ conservation tillage to increase ground\ncover, or using variable-rate irrigation\
    \ to adjust irrigation rates based on the site-speciﬁc soil water\nholding characteristics.\
    \ The remaining coefﬁcient, Kcb, is the primary driver of plant transpiration\
    \ in\nthe model. As such, reductions in crop water use via changes to Kcb can\
    \ be achieved mainly through\nplant breeding. The goal for breeding should be\
    \ to select varieties that yield highly while exhibiting\nKcb time series (Figure\
    \ 4) that reduce water use through transpiration. By incorporating models of\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n16 of 19\ncropping system processes into crop breeding\
    \ and management efforts, the improvements offered by\nmanagement versus breeding\
    \ can be better quantiﬁed.\nThe present study achieved high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of crop water use efﬁciency using\nrelatively simple imaging and modeling technologies.\
    \ Obviously, plant transpiration is dictated by\nprocesses with higher complexity\
    \ than can be described through fc time series alone. For example,\nthe processes\
    \ of root water uptake, water transport through the plant, leaf stomatal conductance,\n\
    and other plant water regulatory mechanisms are not considered in this study.\
    \ Incorporation of more\ncomplex models that consider plant water status in greater\
    \ detail may improve transpiration estimates,\nalthough models with higher complexity\
    \ often also increase the model parameterization requirements.\nTo be effective,\
    \ the model parameters would need to be accurately estimated, or perhaps phenotyped,\n\
    for each variety, which could be the subject of future studies. In this study,\
    \ a simpler model was\nchosen due to the relative ease of driving the model with\
    \ basic fc measurements from drone-based\nmultispectral imaging. A main contribution\
    \ is the use of time-series fc estimates with a simple soil\nwater balance model\
    \ to provide seasonal transpiration estimates for breeding trials at the plot-level.\n\
    As such, the relatively simple methodology provides a practical way to incorporate\
    \ information on\ncrop water use into decisions on breeding selection and may\
    \ be especially useful when the goal is to\nsimply determine which varieties to\
    \ keep in the breeding program.\nAs this study represents one of several initial\
    \ efforts with drone-based imaging at the Maricopa\nresearch station, much has\
    \ been learned over the duration of the study. Regarding the choice of\nsensors,\
    \ the commercial multispectral cameras (i.e., Micasense RedEdge and Parrot Sequoia)\
    \ were\npopular products marketed for the agricultural sector at the time of the\
    \ study, and they were therefore\ngiven primary focus for ﬂight hours. As such,\
    \ the data from these sensors more fully covered the\ngrowing season as required\
    \ for time-series fc estimates herein. An astute reader will note that fc time\n\
    series could perhaps be more easily attained from digital color (RGB) cameras,\
    \ which is a simpler\nand more pervasive imaging technology with greater commercial\
    \ options for choices of camera and\ndrone platform. Additionally, the image spatial\
    \ resolution is often higher for RGB cameras, and image\ncalibration methods are\
    \ simpler as compared to multispectral image calibration. Data from RGB\ncameras\
    \ were also collected over the ﬁeld site but with less frequency and consistency,\
    \ which made\nthese data less useful for the study. Because the Parrot Sequoia\
    \ camera collected both RGB and\nmultispectral data, efforts with this camera\
    \ in 2017 (Table 2) aimed to collect both types of data in\na single drone ﬂight.\
    \ However, the success of this approach was reduced by data reliability issues\n\
    with the camera and multiple crashes of the ﬁxed-wing drone for which the camera\
    \ was designed.\nHence, the MicaSense RedEdge camera on a custom hexacopter drone\
    \ was the favored conﬁguration\nherein. For future efforts to map fc time series,\
    \ an even better conﬁguration may be an RGB camera\non a copter-style drone, for\
    \ which there are now many commercial options. However, future studies\nshould\
    \ also further contrast the advantages and disadvantages of multispectral versus\
    \ RGB imaging\nfrom drone platforms.\nMissing from this study is the use of thermal\
    \ cameras to quantify differences in plant water status\namong varieties, which\
    \ again was related to giving primary focus for ﬂight hours to the multispectral\n\
    cameras. Incorporating canopy temperature information from thermal cameras into\
    \ the methodology\nhas great potential to improve transpiration estimates among\
    \ varieties. For example, Kullberg et al. [32]\nrecently described the use of\
    \ stationary infrared thermometry to adjust Ks in the ET-based soil water\nbalance\
    \ model (Equation (6)), applied to maize. Although their data was collected from\
    \ ground-based\nsystems rather than drones, their approach demonstrates the integration\
    \ of Kcb from RGB data and\nKs from thermal data into the ET-based soil water\
    \ balance model for quantifying maize water use.\nFuture efforts should evaluate\
    \ this data fusion technique for improved high-throughput phenotyping\nof crop\
    \ water use among crop varieties, likely using RGB and thermal data from drone-based\
    \ images\nor sensors mounted on ground-based phenotyping vehicles [25].\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n17 of 19\n5. Conclusions\nHigh-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of water use in 192 cotton breeding plots was achieved using\napproximately\
    \ weekly vegetation cover estimates from drone-based multispectral cameras to\
    \ drive\nbasal crop coefﬁcients in a daily soil water balance model. Differences\
    \ in water use estimates among\neight cotton cultivars were found via linear mixed\
    \ modeling, indicating that the approach can assist\nbreeders in the identiﬁcation\
    \ of cultivars with favorable water use characteristics. Combining the\nwater\
    \ use estimates with crop yield can quantify crop water use efﬁciency, allowing\
    \ breeders to\nselect varieties that maximize crop production per volume of water\
    \ used. Options for improving\nthe methodology include considering models with\
    \ greater complexity in crop water use processes,\nassessing alternative options\
    \ for drone-based image data collection, and incorporating other crop\nphenotypes\
    \ such as canopy temperature. Taken together, the study demonstrates a methodology\
    \ for\nhigh-throughput phenotyping of crop water use, providing breeders a tool\
    \ for water use quantiﬁcation\nand additional traits for consideration in selective\
    \ breeding.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.R.T. and A.L.T.; Methodology,\

  limitations: The study only investigates the use of two multispectral cameras (RedEdge
    and Sequoia) and does not compare the results to other multispectral or RGB cameras.
    Additionally, the study does not incorporate thermal cameras to quantify differences
    in plant water status among varieties.

  title: High-Throughput Phenotyping of Crop Water Use Efficiency via Multispectral
    Drone Imagery and a Daily Soil Water Balance Model
  verbatim_quote1: Few studies, if any, have aimed to directly phenotype crop water
    use or CWUE for purposes of breeding or genomic analysis.
  verbatim_quote2: Although the integration of remote sensing data with models of
    radiation transfer, crop growth, and soil water balance has been widely studied
    for regional and field-scale mapping of crop water use, such techniques have not
    been applied for field-based, high-throughput plant phenomics.

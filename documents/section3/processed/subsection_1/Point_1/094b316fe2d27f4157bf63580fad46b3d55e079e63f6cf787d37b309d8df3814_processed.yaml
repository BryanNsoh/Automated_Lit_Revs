    \ considered the most \nimportant factors for success. Therefore, numerous researchers\
    \ are involved \nin the field of managing these resources, particularly water\
    \ and consumed \npower. Moreover, the security side of these resources is considered,\
    \ \nparticularly the cyber-attacks. In this project, an optimized resource \n\
    management method is proposed for allocating the available resources in \na smart\

    \ \n \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \nCurrently, different techniques are used in irrigation\
    \ systems around the world as shown in Figure 1. \nMoreover, Table 1 illustrates\
    \ the benefits and limitations associated with these methods. Therefore, \ndeveloping\
    \ an optimal irrigation system is necessary to reduce cost, power, and water consumption\
    \ \ndepending on real physical information instead of predicted one [1]. Nowadays,\
    \ wireless sensor networks \n(WSN) have a significant role in many applications,\
    \ such as environmental monitoring, medical, agricultural, \nand others due to\
    \ their flexibility and ability of processing data in different environments with\
    \ easy \nprogramming [2]-[4]. The use of sensors in recent applications is not\
    \ limited to environmental sensing, \ncollecting data from the field, and sending\
    \ information to users depending on some situations [5], [6]. Power \nresources\
    \ in sensor nodes are batteries that have a limited lifetime and difficulty in\
    \ replacing or recharging \nthem. Thus, it is important to design an optimal power\
    \ consumption network to increase WSN life [7]-[10]. \nMoreover, irrigation in\
    \ agriculture consumes about 85% of the total consumed water in the world and\
    \ this \nwill increase rapidly with the increase in population, therefore it is\
    \ important to design an irrigation system \nwith optimized use of water resources\
    \ [11]-[13].  \nAt the other hand, security and cyber-security are important aspects\
    \ to be considered in developing \nsmart systems with WSN [14], [15], because\
    \ sensor nodes are used to collect specific and critical information \nto be sent\
    \ to an appropriate destination to take a decision. Therefore, the existence of\

    \ of irrigation system can lead to send a fault decision to the actuators resulting\
    \ in wasting water \nand harming crops [16]. Obviously, denial of service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are the most notable attacks in the field of \navailability that prohibit\
    \ clients from receiving the specific data with the right time [17]-[19]. In addition,\
    \ the \nuse of WSN for systems decision making requires the reliability, availability\
    \ and confidentiality which can be \nachieved using fault tolerance methods in\
    \ software engineering [20]. In this paper, an optimal, secured and \nreliable\
    \ smart irrigation system based on WSN is produced in the literature to manage\
    \ the resources in \nirrigation in optimal way. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Agricultural\

    \ Smart irrigation system based on WSN \nAs mentioned earlier, depending on the\
    \ functionality of the reviewed papers, 30 articles proposed a smart \nirrigation\
    \ system based on WSN to monitor and control irrigation process. In [22], an internet\
    \ of things (IoT) \nbased smart agrotech system was proposed to improve farm production\
    \ using efficient monitoring and \nscheduling irrigation process. The collected\
    \ data from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) \ncompared with\
    \ real data using comparative analysis and results showed an acceptable error\
    \ on the charge of \nlacking in coverage area. While in Liao et al. [23] developed\
    \ a smart drip irrigation system depending on \nreal-time soil moisture data in\
    \ a greenhouse tomato’s crop. A comparative study between the proposed system\
    \ \nand other irrigation systems was done with results approved that the giving\
    \ system is efficient to deal with food \nsecurity and water scarcity issues.\
    \ Abioye et al. [24] presented an efficient monitoring and data-driven \nmodelling\
    \ of the information influencing the irrigation of mustard leaf plant. At the\
    \ other hand, Torres et al. [25] \nsubmitted a multilevel data fusion architecture\
    \ to get an accurate sensor readings that lead to accurate decision \nmaking.\
    \ Three categories were involved in the proposed architecture: sensor data fusion,\
    \ event and decision \nmaking, and decision fusion based on multiple applications.\
    \ In [26], a smart agriculture system was developed \nwith an open source and\
    \ not expensive hardware components like built a WSN using Arduino and Raspberry\
    \ Pi \nto get a cost-effective system. The fuzzy logic control was used as a decision\
    \ method for the amount and \nduration of irrigation. An automated irrigation\
    \ system based on IoT was presented in [27]. This was done by \ndistributing different\
    \ sensors in the farm (soil moisture, temperature and humidity) and the reads\
    \ are entered \nto a machine learning algorithm. Sodhi and Saxena [1] proposed\
    \ a smart irrigation system based on \nmicrocontroller and used Bayesian analysis\
    \ hosted on IBM Waston platform to monitor the health of the crop, \nthe required\
    \ water to irrigation and every detected intrusion. The water pumps are activated\
    \ automatically when \nthe soil moisture level (measured by sensor nodes in WSN)\
    \ is less than a threshold value. Intelligent agent \nconcept was used in [28]\
    \ to design and implement a cyber-physical irrigation system. The physical data\
    \ \ncollected using WSN and a weather station while processing of these data is\
    \ done in a central station to \ndecide the irrigation status based on these data.\
    \ At last, a control signal is sent to the actuator system by the \nintelligent\
    \ agent to power on the solenoid valves for starting irrigation. Ali et al. [29]\
    \ and Tiglao et al. [30] \nconsidered the use of IoT and mesh WSN in designing\
    \ an irrigation system. Jaiswal and Ballal [31] proposed \nan automated drip irrigation\
    \ system using real-time fuzzy inference method and WSN implemented in \nLabVIEW.\
    \ In [32], a monitoring and control irrigation system was proposed based on multi\
    \ agent system. \nThe WSN gathered data from environment to evaluate the actual\
    \ need of water every five minutes and weather \nmap used to calculate the potential\
    \ evapotranspiration precisely. Karunanithy and Velusamy [33] presented an \n\
    automated drip irrigation with fertigation system based on WSN. The proposed system\
    \ utilizes soil moisture \ndata and evapotranspiration for prediction of required\
    \ water to irrigate the area. This system proposed also a \ntransmission method\
    \ between cluster head and a base station based on travelling salesman protocol\
    \ (TSP) to \nreduce power consumption in data transmission. results approved that\
    \ the proposed system used water efficiently. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 1693-6930\

    \ \n136 \nThe irrigation system proposed in [34] used dynamic sensor data and\
    \ real time weather information and static data \nlike plant and soil type to\
    \ decide the irrigation process. artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms have been\
    \ used for \ntraining and testing data. Barkunan et al. [35] suggested an automated\
    \ irrigation system based on sensing rain fall \nin a farm. The information is\
    \ transmitted using global systems for mobile/general packet radio service GSM/GPRS\
    \ \ntechnology to the farmers at anytime and anywhere to check the status of the\
    \ farm. In [36], a developed real-time \nagriculture application was presented\
    \ using multi-layered architecture containing three technologies (internet of\
    \ \nthings, cloud computing and context awareness). In [37], a smart irrigation\
    \ system based on WSN and fuzzy \nlogic was suggested. A comparison was made between\
    \ a crop irrigated with traditional irrigation and with \nproposed system showed\
    \ that the proposed system used quantity of water equals to half the required\
    \ quantity \nusing traditional method. Nawandar and Satpute [38] proposed a smart\
    \ irrigation system with low-cost target \nusing IoT platform to collect data,\
    \ neural network to make decisions for scheduling irrigation depending on \nthe\
    \ collected data and the user viewed the data remotely using message queuing telemetry\
    \ transport (MQTT) \nand hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) protocols. This system\
    \ is intelligent, cost effective and portable. \nAt the other hand, the smart\
    \ drip irrigation system proposed in [39] used smartphone to capture soil \nimage.\
    \ Calculations were made on the image to know the level of wetness and send the\
    \ data to a microcontroller \nto take an irrigation decision depending on the\
    \ captured image in smartphone and sensors output. \nMuangprathub et al. [40]\
    \ proposed a control system to control environmental parameters that affect the\
    \ crop \nproduction. Three parts included in the control system: hardware component,\
    \ web application and mobile \napplication. In [41], a low cost smart irrigation\
    \ system based on IoT and weather was developed to control \nirrigation process\
    \ automatically depending on moisture level value. While in [42], agricultural\
    \ physical \nsystem (ACPS) with solar irrigation facility was proposed to manage\
    \ irrigation process remotely. \nPhotovoltaic energy was used as a power source\
    \ in the proposed system and client-server architecture used to \nensure communication\
    \ in two directions between the executional level in the field WSN and managerial\
    \ level \nin the cloud.  \nSelmani et al. [43] presented a solar photovoltaic\
    \ watering system (SPVWS) with multithreading \ndesign and virtual timers. Raspberry\
    \ pi was used due to its efficient performance with real time applications. \n\
    By multithreading programming used in the system, controlling the system and HTTP\
    \ server job working \nconcurrently to give remote control of the irrigation system\
    \ and online monitoring of data. The proposed \nsystem in [44] used IoT to automate\
    \ controlling and monitoring of irrigation process. Sensor devices \ncollected\
    \ environmental data from the field and regression algorithm used this data to\
    \ determine water \nrequirements in a day. Mohapatra and Lenka [45] proposed a\
    \ watering system with future prediction of soil \nmoisture content using neural\
    \ network. The expectation strategy utilized the collected data from sensors such\
    \ \nas soil and weather parameters. In [46], an irrigation management system based\
    \ on WSN was developed to \nautomate irrigation process. Sensors gathered data\
    \ from field and sent it to the controller for irrigation \ndecision and to the\
    \ server for monitoring purpose. Khelifa et al. [13] proposed an automated irrigation\
    \ system \nbased on WSN to gather data for irrigation process decision. A web\
    \ application in smartphones also used to \ngive notifications when the soil is\
    \ dry or the level of the water in the tank is low. The WSN connected with \n\
    the server using 4G-LTE technology due to its flexibility. In [47], a smart irrigation\
    \ system is proposed to \ncontrol and monitor irrigation process using WSN and\
    \ fuzzy logic as a decision tool. Sensor nodes collected \ndata from a field,\
    \ decision support system used this data to schedule irrigation using fuzzy logic\
    \ methods and \nactuators to execute commands. Abdullah et al. [48] presented\
    \ a simulation model to a smart irrigation \nsystem based on WSN. In the proposed\
    \ model, WSN used cluster topology to ensure a scalable network and \nincrease\
    \ sensors life time. The proposed system used fuzzy inference system to irrigation\
    \ control. Simulation \nresults showed that the system performance is accurate\
    \ with economical use of water and power. In [49] a wireless \nsensor/actuator\
    \ network (WSAN) with an adaptable decision support system was integrated to get\
    \ an automatic \nirrigation system. To analyze data, a machine learning process\
    \ had been used to get new knowledge. To ensure \nthat the developed system is\
    \ effective, the performance of the system was compared with classical \nagricultural\
    \ exercises.  \n \n2.2.  Optimization with smart irrigation system  \nThe systematic\
    \ literature review protocol includes seven research articles that deal with optimization\
    \ \nproblem in irrigation system based on WSN. In [50], a reliable low-cost information\
    \ gathering protocol \n(RLCIG) was proposed for irrigation system with WSN. Clustering\
    \ techniques were used for data aggregation \nwith optimized power to increase\
    \ network life. For balanced clustering, conditional spider optimization (CSO)\
    \ \nalgorithm was used, while for optimal path selection, the system proposed\
    \ using flower-bee search (FBS) \nalgorithm. The proposed method was tested using\
    \ simulation and the results show an improvement in transmission \nrange, cost\
    \ and system lifetime. Briones et al. [51] suggested a new multi-agent system\
    \ (MAS) to get an automated \nmonitoring and controlled irrigation system for\
    \ potato crops. MAS was developed using a cloud computing \nplatform which can\
    \ collect information from WSNs to define factors and determine irrigation requirements.\
    \ \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control \n \n \n \nReview on cyber-security\
    \ for optimized and smart irrigation systems (Wid Badee Abdulaziz) \n137 \nThis\
    \ smart system has the potential to keep resources and upgrade the efficiency\
    \ of crop production systems, \nspecially in rustic areas. The intelligent irrigation\
    \ system presented in [52] was developed to decrease water \nconsumption by combining\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, and optimization techniques. The used optimization model\
    \ \nminimizes the consumed water efficiently. The efficiency of the suggested\
    \ approach, which minimizes \nirrigation water use, was proven by a comparison\
    \ of the recommended optimization-based control model \nwith the flow-based control\
    \ model \nOcampo and Dadios [53], a multi-objective optimization method using\
    \ an intelligent irrigation \nsystem was introduced to reduce the energy cost\
    \ of operating two water pumps that maintain the water \nrequired for farm’s irrigation.\
    \ It was significant to obsereve that the genetic algorithm was used to get the\
    \ \noptimal solution. To achieve optimal water consumption, the authors of [54]\
    \ suggested integrating the \nautomated irrigation system with an accumulative\
    \ neural network (ANN). The suggested system was \nsimulated using the MATLAB\
    \ Toolbox of neural network with feed-forward backpropagation ANN model. \nIn\
    \ addition, in Maurya and Jain [55], suggested an approach for designing WSN-based\
    \ automated irrigation \nsystems. All sensor nodes collect data on an ongoing\
    \ basis. However, just data with a recurrent timer is sent \nto the base station\
    \ or data that exceeds the threshold. To reduce the node’s power consumption for\
    \ each \ntransmission, fuzzy logic was utilized to locate the entire cluster head\
    \ in the existing round. Comparisons \nwith other routing protocols have shown\
    \ that it effectively minimizes power consumption at each \ntransmission and extends\
    \ the life of the entire network. In [56], a WSN-based intelligent irrigation\
    \ system \nwith optimal consumed power using the Lagrange multiplier method was\
    \ suggested. The aim was to partition \npower optimally and efficiently, while\
    \ optimally minimizing power and watering, depending on the plant’s \nwatering\
    \ needs and watering time. \n \n2.3.  Cyber-security with smart irrigation system\
    \ \nAs the security is important aspect in the field of information systems including\
    \ irrigation, different \nresearchers tackled this issue. While in cyber-security\
    \ side, there is a smaller number of research work due to \nnew entrance of irrigation\
    \ field. In [57], a smart irrigation system was proposed with the assistance of\
    \ an \nandroid application. Variety of sensors, soil moisture, air humidity, and\
    \ air temperature were used to collect \nphysical information. Once the data reached\
    \ the server, a fuzzy logic control was used for take decisions \ndepending on\
    \ the required irrigation. The block chains were used to provide the required\
    \ reliability in the smart \nsystem by limiting the access and control of the\
    \ suggested system to only authorized devises. The system was \nefficient for\
    \ handling the irrigation process securely. Saleem et al. [16] proposed a data\
    \ encryption method to \nensure the accuracy of collected information by WSN to\
    \ get an effective irrigation decision. The encryption \nmechanism had been inspired\
    \ by blood brain barrier (BBB) system to ensure efficient data transmission in\
    \ \nWSNs. The system was simulated using network simulator two (NS2) and the results\
    \ approved the efficiency \nof the proposed encryption method in protecting data\
    \ communication from various attacks. \n \n2.4.  Fault tolerance with smart irrigation\
    \ system \nAs the irrigation systems are considered as important parts of feeding\
    \ security around the world, it is \nnecessary to ensure the reliability and availability\
    \ of them through using fault tolerance techniques. Some \nresearchers adopted\
    \ the presenting of solutions to this aspect in the literature. Ramli et al. [58]\
    \ suggested an \nadaptive technique to achieve reliability in a smart farm using\
    \ two network protocols: LoRaWAN and IEEE \n802.11ac in a smart monitoring system.\
    \ The sensor data has a small data size with low energy, so LoRaWAN \nprotocol\
    \ is suitable for transmitting it. Moreover, transmitting video data was done\
    \ using IEEE 802.11ac that \nhad a higher data rate. Using two network protocols\
    \ helped in getting a reliable monitoring system in \ncomparison of using a single\
    \ protocol technique. In [59], a novel approach for the recovery from \nsimultaneous\
    \ failures was proposed for a large-scale multi-channel WSNs called simultaneous\
    \ failure \nrecovery based on relay node relocation (SFR-RNR). As a case study,\
    \ the authors chose precision agriculture \napplication because it had thousands\
    \ of thousands of sensors. The proposed approach aim was to rebuilt the \nconnection\
    \ and the network coverage after failures.  \n \n \n3. \nPROSPECTIVE SOLUTION\
    \ METHODOLOGY  \nAs mentioned in the reviewed papers of [1]-[59], the problem\
    \ of managing the resources (water and \npower) in the irrigation systems has\
    \ been tackled in different directions that dealt with security, optimization,\
    \ \nWSN management, or fault tolerance individually. Therefore, there is a real\
    \ need for finding a solution \nmethodology for finding a comprehensive scheme\
    \ that manages the irrigation systems. This scheme aims to \npropose a smart irrigation\
    \ system (dripped and sprinkler) that adopts a developed optimization, cyber-security,\
    \ \nfault tolerance methods. This is to present a comprehensive irrigation system\
    \ that can manage the available \nresource of water and power to achieve the aspects\
    \ of reliability, availability and confidentially. A diagram in \nFigure 3 shows\
    \ the structure of the proposed project based on the results of the systematic\
    \ review. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput\

    \ in Figure 3 shows the suggestion solution methodology, considered as \ncontributions.\
    \ These contributions are the results of the systematic review that sorts the\
    \ problems as a \nheretical from bottom to top. Ideas can be summarized as:  \n\
    1) \nDesigning and implementing of smart dripped and sprinkler irrigation system\
    \ based on clustered WSN. \nThe designed WSN is based on:  \n− Nodes of sensors\
    \ and a base-station for each cluster. \n− Irrigation systems that include water\
    \ pumps and actuators.  \n− The MQTT protocol is adopted in managing the data\
    \ transmission in the WSN as well as part of \nsecurity in terms of authentication.\
    \  \n2) \nProducing an optimized method for managing the consumed water and power\
    \ to be reduced efficiently. \nThis method can take care from availability of\
    \ the proposed system. The possible optimization methods \nthat can be adopted\
    \ include but not limited to swarm intelligent, ANN, gentic, fuzzy logic and Lagrange\
    \ \nmultiplier. These methods are multi-objective methods and based on finding-out\
    \ the optimal balancing \nfactors in the mathematical model of the proposed system.\
    \  \n3) \nIntroducing a cyber-security algorithm for detecting and tracking the\
    \ DoS attacks that can be occurred \nin the proposed management method and the\
    \ whole irrigation system. This algorithm guarantees the \nconfidentiality and\
    \ availability of the presented system. It includes two phases: \n− Physical phase:\
    \ it implemented in the WSN level to protect the data transmission between the\
    \ nodes, \nirrigation bumps and base-stations.  \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput\

    \ levels of hardware and \nsoftware that are considered for solving the mentioned\
    \ problems in managing power and water resources of \nirrigation systems. This\
    \ system can be briefly explained as: 1) sensor nodes and water bumps are connected\
    \ \nto a base-station to build a cluster in WSN. The base-station is responsible\
    \ of controlling irrigation process by \nsending power on and off commands to\
    \ water pumps with proper irrigation time depending on sensor’s \nreadings and\
    \ climatic conditions. Moreover, the base-station and related nodes as well as\
    \ bumps apply \nthe introduced cyber-security, water and power optimization, fault\
    \ tolerance and normal data transmission \nmethods; and 2) clusters of the WSN\
    \ are connected to the server throughout their base-stations with authentication\
    \ \nprotocols to monitor irrigation process as well as building data bases to\
    \ the proposed irrigation system. The server \napplies cyber-security, data saving\
    \ in the built database, fault tolerance, and normal data transmission. \n \n\

    A systematic literature reviews on the previous researches about smart irrigation\
    \ systems was \npresented in this paper to stand on their limitations and propose\
    \ solution methodology in terms of reliability, \noptimization and cyber-secured\

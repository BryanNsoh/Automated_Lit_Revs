    IoT is envisaged as the promising paradigm due to the plethora of research concentrated
    on enabling technologies of 5G that would effectively mean a pervasive interconnection
    of objects like sensors, Radio Frequency Identification Tag (RFID), actuators
    through wired and wireless communication technologies. This multitude of connection
    becomes smart, only when these objects have unique addressing scheme based on
    legacy protocols so that it could be managed through wide range of communication
    networks for new services and applications. Moreover, operating these devices
    in unlicensed band create spectrum shortage issues. To overcome this problem,
    we foresee CR as a feasible solution for IoT smartness. In view of this, the quality
    of wireless communication is of paramount importance to furnish accessibility
    to remote IoT devices. However, in practical scenarios wireless channel suffer
    from multipath fading and shadowing to hinder reliability of transmission. Here,
    the remedy is to use a relay temporarily for reliable communication. Hence, introducing
    cognitive relaying into IoT technology is the need of hour. In light of the above
    discussed issues, co-operative communications [1] has improved the system capacity
    and diversity for LTE-advanced systems. Some relaying protocols like Amplify and
    Forward (AF), Decode and Forward (DF), Compress and Forward (CF) have been discussed
    [2] to achieve cooperative diversity. Next, comparison of these protocols for
    multi-hop relay networks is studied [3]. Though they achieve better BER performance,
    the position of the relay may affect the performance of this cooperative model.
    So our motivation lies in employing the protocols AF and DF with Network Coding
    (NC) for proposed two path cognitive relaying scheme to enhance the diversity
    gain for IoT applications without the need of extra antennas. In order to achieve
    this, they harvest the advantage of NC in wireless systems by means of cooperative
    communication [4]. Such cooperative protocol provides joint time and power allocation
    for relays to minimize the outage probability. Power allocation problem has been
    formulated as convex optimization problem [5] for Device-to-Device (D2D) communications
    to improve the lifetime and localization accuracy of the cooperative cellular
    network. Similarly, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the probability
    of error and maximize the rate for two path relaying scheme [6, 7]. The power
    allocation strategy has been proposed by using water-filling algorithm [8] in
    order to avoid the inter user interference. Thus, it is known that amount of power
    allocated or water filled must be proportional to signal to noise ratio (SNR)
    of the channel. Just like the aforementioned examples, we study the power allocation
    problems through CVX modeling system to improve the capacity of the cooperative
    network. Meanwhile to achieve better data rates for different class of users,
    hierarchical modulation has been discussed [9,10,11]. In this context, PU bits
    are separated as high and low priority termed as basic information that is essential
    for the destination whereas along with additional secondary information, transmitter
    uses two modulation schemes namely 16QAM and QPSK respectively to obtain good
    data rates. It has been argued that Inter Relay Interference (IRI) is the main
    problem that degrades the performance of the cooperative communication. Full Interference
    Cancellation (FIC) [12] and Partial Interference Cancellation [13] have been proposed
    for IRI mitigation. In light of the above, the main contributions of the paper
    include. We propose a novel spectrally efficient cognitive two path relaying with
    hierarchical modulation transmission scheme that improves the data rate compared
    to conventional direct link transmission. This model enables the transmission
    of 2 PU and 1 SU data symbols with NC co-operation based on AF and DF protocols.
    Optimum power allocation is modeled as CO problem through disciplined programming
    called CVX to avoid the interference caused to PU network. Diversity order gains
    attained for this model is four for PU and one for SU. We ensure that our cooperative
    relaying scheme will be robust against errors caused due to interference of co-existing
    IoT devices. 2 System Model In this section, we consider a co-operative network
    that is composed of PU transmitter S acting as source, PU receiver as D for destination
    co-operating with the assistance of two SU relays A and B as transmitter and receiver
    respectively. Figures 1, 2, 3 indicates the cognitive two-path relaying scheme
    enabling the transmission of two PU symbol and one SU symbol in three time slots.
    Here, \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}(1)}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}(2)}\\)
    are the channel co-efficient between S and D in time slot one and two respectively.
    Similarly the gains from A and B to D are \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}\\) and
    \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}\\) respectively, \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}\\) are the channel coefficients from S to
    A and B respectively. The inter-relay channel gain in second time slot is represented
    as \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ab}}\\). In addition, we assume the transmission
    procedure of each node through a flat-faded Rayleigh channel. Fig. 1 Cognitive
    relaying in time slot 1 Full size image Fig. 2 Cognitive relaying in time slot
    2 Full size image Fig. 3 Cognitive relaying in time slot 3 Full size image Now,
    we review the operation of the cognitive relaying scheme in three time slots.
    In first time slot, S transmits its data symbol S1 to A, B and D with total power
    PS. The received signal at PU destination and both relays is represented in equations
    as below [14], 15] $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\rm{D}}^{(1)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\rm{S}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1} {\\mathrm{h}}_{\\rm{sd}(1)}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\rm{D}}^{(1)}$$
    (1) $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\rm{A}}^{(1)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\rm{S}}} {\\mathrm{S}}_{1}
    {\\mathrm{h}}_{\\rm{sa}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\rm{A}}^{(1)}$$ (2) $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1} {\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}$$
    (3) where,\\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(1)}\\),\\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{A}}^{(1)}\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}\\) are AWGN noise samples with zero mean
    and variance \\({\\upsigma }^{2}\\) in first time slot. The second time slot deals
    with the transmission of symbol \\(({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus {\\mathrm{S}}_{2})\\)
    by S to D, while the relay A transmits the received data in previous time slot
    after employing the Decode–Amplify and forward protocol (D-AF). The received signal
    at D and B respectively are given by $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(2)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}}
    ({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus {\\mathrm{S}}_{2}){\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}(2)}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(2)}$$
    (4) $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}} ({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus
    {\\mathrm{b}}_{1}){{\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ab}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}$$
    (5) where, \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(2)}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}\\)
    are respective AWGN samples and \\({\\mathrm{b}}_{1}\\) is the SU data symbol.
    Hereinafter, assuming that relay A transmits with power \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\uplambda
    {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\), we have the normalized amplification factor satisfying
    the power constraint \\({\\mathrm{E}|{\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus {\\mathrm{b}}_{1}|}^{2}\\le
    {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}\\) expressed as below $${\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{{\\mathrm{E}|{\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{A}}^{(1)}|}^{2}}$$
    (6) Similarly, $${\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{B}}=\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{{\\mathrm{E}|{\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}|}^{2}}$$
    (7) where, \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) is the transmit power of relay B
    and \\({\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}\\) is the received signal at B in first
    time slot. During the third time slot, both A and B transmits the decoded symbol
    \\({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\) to D received in previous time slots with amplification
    factor \\({\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}\\) and \\({\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) while
    S remains idle. Thus, the received signal at D is as follows $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(3)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1}{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}{\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}+\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1}{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}{\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{B}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(3)}$$
    (8) where, \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(3)}\\) is the noise term in third
    slot. Now, we combine the received signal through popular diversity scheme known
    as Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) since D has multiple copies of same symbol received
    in each time slot. So, using the instantaneous SNR for S-D, S-A-D and S-B-D as
    given below $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SD}}=\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}}}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}$$
    (9) $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SAD}}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}$$
    (10) $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SBD}}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}$$
    (11) where, \\({\\mathrm{N}}_{0}\\) is the noise power. The effective SNR of the
    combined MRC case is $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{MRC}}^{\\mathrm{D}}={\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SD}}+{\\upgamma
    }_{\\mathrm{SAD}}+{\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SBD}}$$ (12) If the perfect Channel State
    Information (CSI) is known at the receiver the Zero Forcing (ZF) estimate of the
    symbol vectors could be obtained from the below equations $${\\mathrm{Y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mathrm{G}({\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{N})$$
    (13) where,\\(\\mathrm{G}={\\left({\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\mathrm{H}\\right)}^{-1}{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\)
    is the pseudo inverse matrix and \\({\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\) is the channel
    gain matrix. 3 Problem Formulation In this section, our problem is to control
    the optimum power of relays to minimize the probability of error and to maximize
    the average achievable rate of transmission. To find the value of those parameters,
    optimum power allocation is formulated as convex problem. Here, we note that only
    in time slot 2 both S and A transmits simultaneously whereas in remaining slots
    either S or both relays transmits with power \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\),\\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) respectively.So, rate maximization is with
    respect to the optimal power that is allocated in time slot 2. It is obvious that
    average rate is a function of \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}},{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\)
    and\\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}\\).Thus, it is obtained at D through B, A and
    direct link communication from S represented respectively as below [16], 17] $${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}1}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{N}+1}\\right)*{\\mathrm{Blog}}_{2}\\left(1+\\mathrm{M}\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}\\right]\\right)$$
    (14) $${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}2}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{N}+1}\\right)*{\\mathrm{Blog}}_{2}\\left(1+\\mathrm{M}\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}\\right]\\right)$$
    (15) $${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}3}={\\mathrm{Blog}}_{2}\\left(1+\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)$$
    (16) Herewith, we consider the rate of PU as objective function and our goal is
    to maximize the rate such that. maximize \\(\\left\\{\\mathrm{min}({\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}1},{\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}2},{\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}3})\\right\\}\\)
    subject to: \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}<{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\) $${\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\le
    {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\le {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{max}}$$ where, \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\)
    is the total transmit power of the co-operative model, \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\)
    is the transmit power of the PU transmitter and B is the channel bandwidth. Finally,
    we transform the optimal power allocation as convex with two constraints solved
    by using CVX [18]. The value of the parameters obtained in time slot two are \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}=0.689\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.311\\) which ensures the optimum solution
    for rate maximization. 4 Numerical Results In this section, we discuss the numerical
    results of the proposed cognitive relaying scheme with single PU transmitter and
    receiver. SU relays A and B that are in middle between S and D assist in retransmitting
    the received symbol to destination. We validate the performance of the proposed
    scheme through Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation parameters are listed in
    Table 1.The cooperative transmission of data takes place in three time slots hence
    the bandwidth efficiency is considered as unity. Through network coded co-operation,
    two PU symbol are hierarchically modulated as high and low priority bits by QAM
    modulation. Table 1 Simulation parameters and values Full size table Meanwhile,
    A and B uses QPSK modulation thereby achieving diversity order gains for its cooperative
    transmission. In order to provide comparisons among various two path relaying
    schemes, we consider the case of optimum power allocation solved through CVX modeling
    system. Although the conventional power allocation schemes have greater impact
    on SU system, we here ensure the advantage of BER minimization for PU system in
    comparison with direct link transmission. 4.1 BER Performance Comparisons for
    PU Figure 4 shows the BER comparisons results for PU high and low priority data
    with direct link transmission. Note that the values in horizontal axis indicate
    the SNR between S and D. As we can infer from Fig. 4, the BER performance of hierarchically
    modulated PU data shows good performance that are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations.
    In view of this case, we have 2 dB SNR gain at 10–2 in comparison with direct
    transmission. But with the comparison of PU low priority data; there is a remarkable
    performance improvement for direct transmission. Even though S transmits its bits
    by QAM modulation for PU low priority and for direct link case, here the relay
    position with the end- to-end SNR knowing the CSI has impact on BER performance
    as shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 PU BER comparison for proposed method in terms of a)
    high priority data b) low priority data c) direct link transmission with different
    values of SNR Full size image 4.2 BER Performance Comparisons for SU As discussed
    from above BER performance of PU, SU performance comparison will not reflect the
    better since it avoids interference at D but inter-relay interference diverges
    it somewhat poorer in comparison with PU. So in this section, Fig. 5 depicts the
    proposed scheme with and without optimum power allocation.Based on the transmitting
    power obtained through CO i.e., \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.311\\) in time
    slot 2, it ensures that there will be no harmful interference for PU operating
    with \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}=0.689\\).Thus, below results confirms that
    only low data rates can be achieved through this BER but reliability of transmission
    is improved by operating with this optimal power which is very much needed for
    IoT devices. Fig. 5 BER comparison of SU with and without optimum power allocation
    Full size image 4.3 Rate Maximization Through Optimum Power Allocation From the
    Fig. 6, we can observe that when SNR is low, the average rate for the proposed
    scheme is good in agreement with the existing two path relaying. At SNR = 5 dB,
    we have 14% improvement for our scheme. However, after 10 dB, average rate performance
    is almost same. This is because, at low SNR levels the data symbols are perfectly
    decoded at D without interfering with SU data symbols since we use optimal power
    for transmission and in addition we use ZF equalizers to nullify the channel effects.
    But at high SNR regime, we have good channel condition. So, we could decode the
    low priority bits of PU and hence we could achieve better data rate. Fig. 6 SNR
    Vs Average Rate Full size image 5 Conclusion In this paper, spectrally efficient
    cognitive two path relaying is proposed considering network coding as a paradigm
    to achieve cooperative diversity. Through network coded co-operation, the transmission
    of 2 PU symbols and one SU symbol takes place. Here we consider CO problem to
    optimally allocate power to the transmitters by CVX modeling system thereby avoiding
    interference at destination for decoding process. We use MRC combiners so that
    the diversity order gains achieved for PU and SU is four and one respectively.
    As discussed from the numerical results, it can be inferred that the probability
    of error is minimized obtaining a SNR gain of 2 dB in comparison with direct link
    transmission. Furthermore, we obtained average rate maximization by 14% in comparison
    with the existing two path relaying scheme. On the other hand, this cognitive
    relaying approach will be an essential option that helps in achieving reliable
    data rates with optimal transmitted power enhancing the life time for battery
    operated IoT devices. Data Availability Data sharing not applicable to this article

    I. Introduction The U.S. Marine Corps relies heavily upon resilient communications
    technologies that leverage the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) to conduct maneuver
    operations [1]. Unmanaged radio frequency (RF) signatures result in the identification
    and targeting of forward deployed forces. Recent doctrine stresses the need for
    RF signature reduction technologies and resilient networking systems [2]. Future
    forces will require enhanced situational awareness (SA) for forward deployed troops,
    allowing them to execute distributed command and control (C2) over a diverse cyber-physical
    battlespace. The development pace of near peer adversaries in the electromagnetic
    spectrum operations (EMSO) domain has highlighted the need for technologies to
    augment traditional communications techniques. This has resulted in a contested
    maritime domain, both physically and with respect to EMS. Wireless communications
    links in an anti-access / area-denial (A2/AD) environment must be resilient and
    reliably transfer data over long distances to distributed forces. Mobile platforms
    within the A2/AD environment require uninterrupted communications to execute their
    mission and provide situational awareness. Satellite communications (SATCOM) may
    be disrupted through hostile interference or loss of assets. The A2/AD environment
    presumes the presence of intentional interference. Intentional interference techniques
    may include, but not be limited to: swept, partial band, and narrowband techniques
    that can be used singularly or in combinations. WHAC-A-MOLE (Wireless Heterogeneous
    Adaptive Communications Architecture for Multi-Waveform Obfuscation of Localizable
    Emissions) is an overlay protocol for multiple-transceiver, software-defined radio
    (SDR) platforms that has been implemented with a time-based emissions schedule
    of heterogeneous waveforms, dynamically allocated to an array frequency channels.
    The WHAC-A-MOLE concept is intended to disrupt the collection and signature identification
    by hostile forces as a means of obfuscating signal characteristics and localization
    of emissions. The location and characteristics of the RF emissions are constantly
    changing thus affecting the observability from the viewpoint of a passive RF detection
    system. RF signature management is achieved by avoiding detection by limiting
    power, visibility, range, talk-time (duty cycle), or a combination of them. These
    techniques are effective and continue to act as the controllable building blocks
    for effectively limiting emissions exposure. The emissions schemes are intended
    to be configurable such that daily, weekly, monthly secrets can be shared for
    network participants. These configurations control the transmissions over a given
    radio link within the overall network transmission schedule. The design assumes
    a platform with a number of independent receiver (or transceiver) chains to support
    simultaneous reception of diverse signals and modulations (i.e. waveforms). Frequency-hopping,
    a spread-spectrum technique, has been proven over the decades as an electronic
    counter-counter measure (ECCM) method for enhanced message security. Commercial
    applications (e.g., Bluetooth) reduce the effects of interference in increasingly
    crowded frequency bands. The technique explored in this work uses agile, pseudo-random
    waveform selection to augment traditional frequency hopping as a means to increase
    the difficulty of adversary targeting and signal characterization. Obscuring location
    is provided by rapidly varying waveform characteristics from constantly changing
    locations. Advances in electronics technology, including the development of SDRs
    using digital signal processing, and significant reductions in size, weight and
    power have resulted in radio platforms having multiple, simultaneous communications
    capabilities. Such multi-waveform platforms, including the Defense Advanced Research
    Projects Agency''s (DARPA) Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) platform [3] incorporate
    one or more transmitters and multiple receivers in a single package. Each receiver
    can be configured to support a particular waveform with the radio capable of simultaneous
    transmission and reception on any of its receivers. More recent platforms, including
    work conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory [4] have continued to develop
    similar technical capabilities. Multiple receivers within a radio allow a given
    transmitter to use a different waveform during successive transmissions (timeslots)
    to the other networked radios. An adversary, conditioned to expect frequency hopping
    but waveform consistency for network targeting, is offered additional confusion
    by the inconsistency of waveform. Such an agile radio network environment may
    appear to the enemy as many networks, each using a particular waveform. Put another
    way, for a given radio network message traffic load there are fewer transmissions
    using a particular waveform. While this paper doesn''t address targeting probabilities,
    it provides formulas for calculating the number of waveform-frequency pairings
    for timeslots for a given number of networked radios (nodes), number of available
    waveforms and number of available frequencies. It is shown that a very large number
    of distinct timeslot assignments can result from relatively few available waveforms
    and frequencies. As a result, it is postulated that changing waveforms as well
    as frequency in a sequence of timeslots provides increased anti-targeting robustness
    and increased signal security. A waveform-agile/frequency-agile military radio
    network can include an integrated scheduler that interfaces to commercial wireless
    infrastructure for dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) [5], [6] for shared spectrum
    access by both military and commercial assets. SECTION II. WHAC-A-MOLE Protocol
    A. Design Assumptions The WHAC-A-MOLE concept employs a shared schedule for waveform
    execution and time division multiple access (TDMA). Based on the number of transceivers
    additional layers of complexity can be added that can be tailored based on the
    emission threat profile. Allocating a receive asset for sensing provides the following
    advantages: (1) Sensing capabilities employed in the radios can be used to inhibit
    transmissions in congested frequencies, through a technique called excision. Excision
    is the inhibition of a schedule transmission due to anticipated congestion. (2)
    Excision can be further used to obfuscate the TDMA schedule. (3) A further application
    of sensing capabilities would be to influence the TDMA waveform utilization by
    periodically adjusting the profile of usable frequencies. In addition to these
    sensing concepts, the technique of slicing could be used as a further method of
    protecting the transmission. This method, borrowed from the work in [7], [8],
    employs a potential reserve time slot, at a different frequency/waveform, for
    protecting particular messaging. These variations on the employment structure
    depend on the configuration of the transceivers and availability of reserve Tx
    or Rx assets. The TDMA structure further supports the potential for DSS interoperability
    with commercial cellular providers, on the condition that access to the commercial
    scheduler is available. Non-TDMA methods have been discussed, but have not yet
    been pursued. A radio network consisting of a number of radios with both frequency
    and waveform agility is examined in terms of the number of waveform-frequency
    pairs available during a timeslot. In this paper a timeslot is defined as an increment
    of time during network operation, which supports the transmission and reception
    of message traffic using specific waveform-frequency pairings for transmitters
    and receivers. Expressions for the total number of timeslots possible without
    reuse of any waveform-frequency pair by any radio in a timeslot are formulated.
    A waveform-frequency pair is distinguished by frequency only; waveforms can be
    reused within a timeslot. The addition of waveform agility to that of frequency
    agility (frequency hopping) is intended to increase the difficulty in locating
    geographically-dispersed radios. The goal is to create an effect analogous to
    that of many dispersed fireflies blinking on and off. Radio mobility adds an additional
    layer of protection, but isn''t examined in the present discussion. The following
    definitions and operational rules are postulated governing the radio network:
    There is a total of N= n 1 , n 2 … n N radios (nodes). During a timeslot, a radio
    will either have one active transmitter (or transceiver in transmit mode) or be
    in listen-only mode. There are R= r 1 , r 2 … r R receivers (or transceivers in
    receive mode within a timeslot) per radio. W= w 1 , w 2 … ww waveforms are available
    for use by a transmitter or receiver with W≥R . F= f 1 , f 2 … f F frequencies
    are available for use by a transmitter or receiver with F≥R . All transmitters
    within a given timeslot are operating with distinct frequencies, but not necessarily
    distinct waveforms. The radios comprising the network are geographically dispersed,
    but are within communications range of one another, either directly or via routing
    to disadvantaged platforms. A particular waveform-frequency pair won''t be reused
    by a transmitter until all possible pairs have been exhausted. B. Network Configuration
    Overview The maximum number of simultaneous transmissions permissible in a timeslot
    is governed by the number of receivers (R) within a radio. A radio consists of
    a transmitter and R receivers per radio. All radios comprising the network are
    assumed to contain R receivers. For the general case in which R < N-1, the maximum
    number of active transmitters in a timeslot is limited to the value of R. For
    the special case when R≥N−1 , there can be N transmitters operating in a timeslot
    with each radio receiving message traffic on N-1 of its R receivers. Tables I
    and II provide respective examples of the general and special cases for a network
    of 4 radios (nodes). Table I shows that no more than two transmitters can be active
    in a timeslot with items in red being inactive during the timeslot. The configuration
    show in Table II allows for four simultaneous transmissions. In the following
    sections, two instances of the general case (fewer receivers per node than N-1
    nodes in the network) and special cases (equal or greater number of receivers
    per node compared to total network nodes) are considered. Table I. Two transmitters
    in a timeslot, N=4, R=2 Table II. Four transmitters in a timeslot, N=4, R=3 C.
    General Case (R<N−1) Without Waveform Reuse in a Timeslot Using the radio network
    shown in Table 1 with N=4,R= 2 and W=F=4 , the maximum number of active transmitters
    is limited to R for this case since R<N−1 . A total of W ∗ F= 16 waveform-frequency
    pairings is possible for the first transmitter (radio n 1 ). The second transmitter
    (radio n 3 ) cannot use either the waveform or frequency assigned to the first
    transmitter and thus has 3 ∗ 3=9 pairings from which to choose. The total number
    of pairings is 16 ∗ 9=144 . These 144 pairings can be permuted among the 4 radios
    resulting in 144 ∗ 4!=3456 total timeslots (TS). Two of any of the four transmitters
    in a timeslot will always remain idle. In terms of the variables and the preceding
    discussion this example may be expressed as: TS=( W ∗ F ) ∗ [(W−(R−1) ] ∗ [F−(R−1)
    ] ∗ N!=3456 (1) View Source Noting that the variables on the right in (1) may
    be rearranged as W ∗ (W−R+1 ) ∗ F ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! , an equation for any N,R<N−1,W≥R
    and F≥R may be formulated as W ∗ (W−1 ) ∗ (W−2 ) ∗ … ∗ (W−R+1 ) ∗ F ∗ (F−1 ) ∗
    (F−2 ) ∗ … ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! and expressed more compactly as shown in (2) where
    P denotes the permutation function: TS=W!/(W−R)!∗F!/(F−R)!∗N!=P( W R )∗P( F R
    )∗P( N N ) (2) View Source D. General Case (R<N−1) with Waveform Reuse in a Timeslot
    Removing the requirement for distinctive waveforms per radio per timeslot results
    in an increase in available waveform pairings using the same configuration values.
    Again using Table I, the first transmitter has a choice from any of 16 available
    waveform-frequency pairings while the second transmitter has 4 ∗ 3=12 choices.
    The total pairings per timeslot is 1  6 ∗ 12=192 . These 192 pairings can be permuted
    among the 4 radios resulting in 192 ∗ 4!=4608 total timeslots with the caveat
    that only two transmitters may be active within a timeslot. In terms of the variables
    this example equates to: TS=(W∗F)∗(W∗[(F−(R−1)]∗N!=4608 (3) View Source Noting
    that (3) can be written W ∗ W ∗ F ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! an equation assuming waveform
    reuse for any N,R<N−1,W≥ R and F≥R may be formulated as W ∗ W ∗ … ∗ W R ∗ F ∗  (F−1
    ) ∗ (F−2 ) ∗ …  ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! and expressed more compactly as: TS= W R ∗F!/(F−R)!∗N!=
    W R ∗P( F R )∗P( N N ) (4) View Source E. Special Case (R≥N−1) Without Waveform
    Reuse in a Timeslot 1) Maximum N Transmitters in a Timeslot Consider a radio network
    as in Table II in which N=4,R=N−l=3,W=F=4 and using distinct waveforms within
    a timeslot for each radio. Since in this example R=N−1,4 active transmitters are
    permitted per timeslot vice 2 as in the previous section. A total of W ∗ F=16
    waveform-frequency pairings are available to the first transmitter. The second
    transmitter can''t use either the waveform or frequency assigned to the first
    transmitter and thus has 3 ∗ 3=9 pairings from which to choose. The third transmitter
    has 2 ∗ 2=4 choices while the fourth transmitter gets the 1 ^{\\ast} 1 pairing
    leftover. The total number of pairings is 16 ∗ 9 ∗ 4 ∗ 1=576 . In addition, any
    of these 576 pairings can be permuted among the 4 radios resulting in 576 ∗ 4!=13,824
    total timeslots. The expression for any N, R≥N−1,W≥N and F≥N follows the configuration
    leading to (2) but with R replaced by N: TS=W!/(W−N)!∗F!/(F−N)!∗N!=P( W N )∗P(
    F N )∗P( N N ) (5) View Source 2) Less than N Transmitters in a Timeslot Assume
    a network that could support up to N transmitters in a timeslot, but with the
    operational restriction imposed that the number of transmissions (n) per timeslot
    be less than N. So n transmissions per timeslot would require n active receivers
    per radio per timeslot and the general case TS equation (2) applies with R replaced
    by n, and the R-n remaining receivers remain idle in a timeslot: TS=W!/(W−n)!∗F!/(F−n)!∗N!=P(
    W n )∗P( F n )∗P( N N ) (6) View Source F. Special Case (R≥N−1) with Waveform
    Reuse in a Timeslot 1) Maximum N Transmitters in a Timeslot With Table II again
    applicable, the first, second, third and fourth transmitters have a choice from
    16, 12, 8 and 4 waveform-frequency pairings, respectively, for a total including
    radio permutations of 16 ∗ 12 ∗ 8 ∗ 4 ∗ 4!=147,456 total timeslots and capability
    of 4 active transmitters per timeslot. The expression assuming waveform reuse
    for any N, R≥N−1,W≥N and F≥N follows the development leading to (4) but with R
    replaced by N: TS= W N ∗F!/(F−N)!∗N!= W N ∗P( F N )∗P( N N ) (7) View Source Note
    that removing the requirement for distinct waveforms in the general case results
    in a modest increase of 4608 ― 3456 =1152 timeslots whereas for the special case
    removal of this requirement results in an increase of 147,456−13,824= 133,472
    timeslots. The addition of one additional receiver per radio in the special case
    dramatically increases the number of timeslots as well as provides for increased
    message traffic handling per timeslot. 2) Less than N Transmitters in a Timeslot
    A restriction of n transmissions during a timeslot and allowing for waveform reuse
    results in a TS expression like that (4) of the general case but with R replaced
    by n: TS= W n ∗ F!/(F−n)! ∗ N!= W n ∗P( F n )∗P( N N ) (8) View Source Additional
    randomization is possible by varying what radio transmits first, second, etc.
    For an N-node network P( N n ) permutations of transmitter sequences are possible
    where n is the number of permitted transmissions in a timeslot. This provides
    added value combined with moving or stationary nodes in that a hostile receiver
    can''t stare at a location waiting for an occurrence of the same transmission
    type. Further obfuscation can occur by utilizing the DSS slotting in 5G to interoperate
    within the 5G transmission schedule. Additional variations can be conceived with
    the use of additional transmitter resources activated. The overall mechanism can
    be optimized base on prioritization of data transmission requirements vs. desire
    for greater obfuscation. The expressions (2), (4), and (5–8) for the total number
    of distinctive timeslots for the general and special cases with and without waveform
    reuse have been developed. These timeslots can be assigned in any pseudo-random
    order until all waveform-frequency pair assignments to a particular transmitter
    have been exhausted. The large number of possible waveform-frequency pairings
    for a timeslot creates the appearance of several heterogeneous radio networks.
    The next section discusses the laboratory implementation of three radios cycling
    through the pseudo-randomly generated timeslot sets provided by the scripts, keeping
    in mind that the randomness is from the observer point of view; the participating
    radios in the network are aware of past, current, and future timeslot assignments.
    SECTION III. Proof of Concept Implementation A. Laboratory Setup The WHAC-A-MOLE
    design is built upon a multi-transceiver radio platform suitable for running a
    diverse suite of software waveform applications. Such platforms were described
    briefly earlier in this report, and include commercial off the shelf (COTS) platforms
    as well as those designed specifically for military communications. To demonstrate
    the feasibility of the WHAC-A-MOLE concept in the laboratory, a cabled laboratory
    network of radios was setup. This network consisted of three radio nodes, to form
    a small network. A three node network was used as it fulfills the requirements
    for a network of radios beyond a single bidirectional link. Each radio node was
    created to mimic a multi-waveform platform, with one transmitter chain and two
    receiver chains. Thus, a single radio includes multiple independent RF front ends,
    each consisting of a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210, connected
    to a common computer for processing and handling data transmission and reception.
    The common processor allowed for rapid development of software prototyping and
    interfacing to three connected USRPs. For system operations and testing, a network
    of three nodes was created. Each node contained three separate software-defined
    radios. One radio was used as a transmitter, and two radios were used as receivers.
    The setup is depicted in Figure 1 below. Fig. 1. WHAC-A-MOLE laboratory setup
    Show All Three processing servers were used in the setup. Each server performed
    the signal processing and communications algorithms for each node, including one
    transmitter and two receivers. An additional server was used for graphical display.
    An Ethernet switch was connected to all SDRs and servers for convenient access.
    For RF connections, each node had a circulator to split the signal among the outgoing
    transmission and incoming receptions. Each node also had a three-way power divider
    to split the incoming signal to its two receivers. A five-way divider was used
    to split the signal among the three radio nodes. In addition, a spectrum analyzer
    was connected to the five-way divider to view the transmissions. B. Modulation
    Schedule A configuration schedule was created and implemented as shown by Table
    III below. Three frequencies at 1670, 1830, and 1940 MHz were used. In addition,
    the modulation schemes Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK), Gaussian Frequency
    Shift Keying (GFSK), and Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) were used. These three
    frequencies and modulations (waveforms) allowed for a total of 27 possible frequency-waveform
    combinations. For simplicity, only three combinations were used: GMSK at 1670
    MHz, GFSK at 1830 MHz and BPSK at 1940 MHz. These three combinations were chosen
    to span all modulation schemes and frequencies in the simplest way. The entire
    cycle, where all nodes transmit all three combinations, takes 90 seconds. Once
    the cycle ends, the schedule is repeated. The ninety-second interval is a convenient
    multiple of an hour, and there are 40 cycles in an hour. Therefore, the schedule
    starts on the hour and after 40 cycles, restarts on the next hour. For proper
    time synchronization, the network time protocol (NTP) was used. All three processing
    servers used the display server as the NTP clock server. Table III. Configuration
    schedule C. Software Architecture Each radio node in the network was instantiated
    in GNU Radio for the signal processing and conditioning blocks in the radio front
    end. The radio platforms were instantiated to support five modulation types for
    the purposes of the demonstration. These modulations included GMSK, GFSK, Differential
    Phase Shift Keying (DPSK), BPSK, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals.
    To demonstrate the concept and reduce the number of possible combinations, three
    of these modulations were used for the laboratory proof of concept. Implementation
    was performed on GNU Radio, a software development toolkit that provides signal
    processing blocks to implement software radios. GNU Radio provided transmitter
    and receiver blocks for the USRP. This hardware was the software-defined radio
    used for development and testing. GNU Radio also provided the modulation waveforms
    used, including GMSK, GFSK, and BPSK. In addition, GNU Radio provided scripts
    for packet transmission and packet reception. These scripts include benchmark_rx.py
    and benchmark_tx.py, which were useful for system testing and tuning. These scripts
    provided a foundation for the software, with waveform switching and timing added
    in the media access control (MAC) layer. 1) Physical Layer Three separate message
    sources were connected to the corresponding GMSK, GFSK, and BPSK modulation block.
    The message source block contained an internal queue used for interaction with
    the MAC layer. This setup gave the MAC layer the ability to transmit packets to
    the radio. The PSK modulation block contained two constellation points, thus employing
    BPSK. A selector block was used to choose the correct modulation scheme as output.
    A stream to tagged stream block was used to allow bursty transmissions. Without
    it, underflow warnings would have been issued by the USRP driver. A USRP Sink
    block was used to turn the complex IQ data into radio transmissions. For additional
    timing control, a USRP Async Msg Source was used. This block provided error information
    for every transmitted burst. That error information was stored in a message queue
    for the MAC layer. As a secondary benefit, the Async Msg Source blocks gave the
    MAC layer immediate feedback when the packet transmission had concluded. This
    feature was especially important given the timing and switching requirements implemented
    in the MAC layer. A packet framer routine was used to provide preamble, packet
    length and cyclic redundancy code (CRC). This routine was used by the MAC layer
    to add a frame to the original payload. Once the frame was created, the entire
    data was inserted into the queue of the message source for the desired modulation.
    The USRP Source block provided the receiver interface to the USRP. RF signals
    were converted to baseband complex samples. Next, a selector block was used to
    choose between various demodulators. The Correlate Access Code block was used
    to find the beginning of the frame. The framer sink stripped the header and CRC
    and stored the payload in a queue for the MAC layer. 2) MAC Layer The MAC layer
    operated outside of the GNU Radio flowgraph and was implemented with a python
    script that first created the flowgraph and then started it. Next, the python
    script initiated the MAC layer. The node number and transmission mode were set
    by command line arguments from the user. The MAC layer used the operating system''s
    time to determine its current state, including the cycle, transmit round, and
    transmit state. Based on this state, the MAC layer set up the flowgraph''s center
    frequency and selectors for the modulator and demodulator. If the transmission
    state was on, the MAC layer inserted 10 frames in the message source''s queue.
    The GNU Radio flowgraph read the frames in the queue and processed them as transmitted
    packets. The MAC layer continued indefinitely until the script was terminated
    by the user. D. Single Transmit Mode Each cycle is divided into three transmit
    rounds, where each transmit round takes 30 seconds. During the transmit round,
    there are three transmit periods with each period lasting 10 seconds. During the
    transmit period, radios are on for 5 seconds, and then off for 5 seconds. Table
    IV below shows the initially designed transmit round. Table IV. Single mode transmit
    round Figure 2 shows a spectrogram capture of single mode transmissions. The cycle
    began with GMSK transmissions at 1670 MHz. The spectrogram showed the corresponding
    energy at the top left corner. The next transmissions were BPSK at 1940 MHz, GFSK
    at 1830 MHz, an additional GFSK at 1830 MHz, and GMSK at 1670 MHz. These configurations
    matched the schedule shown in Table III. There was an abundance of empty space
    between each transmission. This implied that additional packets could be transmitted
    within the five-second transmission time for each node. The current algorithm
    limited the transmission to ten packets for simplicity. Fig. 2. Spectrogram capture
    of single mode transmissions Show All E. Normal Transmit Mode The single transmit
    mode demonstrated waveform switching in a simple, intuitive way. Each node took
    turns transmitting. The transmission window lasted for 5 seconds, followed by
    temporary silence for another 5 seconds. This setup, although intuitive, represented
    an underutilization of receiver resources. Such a scheduling case could be a response
    to an increased need for obfuscation. Each node had two receivers with only a
    single receiver being used at any time. For full receiver utilization, each transmit
    period required two nodes transmitting simultaneously. A schedule employing increased
    transmissions could be in response to an increased data requirement in a less
    contested environment. Table V below depicts the normal transmit mode. Table V.
    Normal mode transmit round During each transmit period, two nodes were transmitted
    simultaneously. The third node received packets from both transmitters. In addition,
    the transmitting nodes received packets from each other. Figure 3 shows the spectrogram
    output for normal mode transmissions. Every transmission period shows two different
    modulations at two different frequencies. Five transmit periods are seen. The
    image shows modulations in the following order: 1) GMSK at 1670 MHz and BPSK at
    1940 MHz, 2) GFSK at 1830 MHz and BPSK at 1940 MHz, 3) GMSK at 1670 MHz and GFSK
    at 1830 MHz, 4) GMSK at 1670 MHz and GFSK at 1830 MHz, and 5) GMSK at 1670 MHz
    and BPSK at 1940 MHz. The configuration schedule was implemented for both an underutilized
    single mode transmission and a fully utilized normal mode transmission. Fig. 3.
    Spectrogram capture of normal mode transmissions Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion
    and Future Work The WHAC-A-MOLE waveform switching system was designed and implemented
    in development radio hardware in order to explore the practical implications of
    such a scheme, and to allow for rapid prototyping. This work demonstrated a basic
    capability for establishing a time-division based overlay scheme to enable simultaneous
    communications using a diverse set of modulation types across multiple frequencies.
    The work established the baseline proof of concept, followed by initial steps
    in implementing a fully automated process. Using a simplified network structure,
    with limited nodes and total waveform-time-frequency combinations, basic automation
    was demonstrated to support waveform switching in the laboratory environment.
    The basic WHAC-A-MOLE implementation requires a radio platform with multiple transceivers,
    but the generalized algorithm supports multiple variations involving different
    utilization of transmitter and receiver resources. These variations range from
    fully occupying all transmitter resources, fully occupying all receiver resources
    without full transmitter utilization, and implementations that underutilize both
    transmitter and receiver resources, depending on the application. This configurability
    is included in the design to allow for tailoring the network loading, or number
    of transmissions, to allow for different obfuscation of the network traffic. In
    configurations with underutilized resources, the surplus transmitter and receiver
    chains can be used for other mission functions including sensing and segmentation
    of messages across waveforms. Future work, including additional software development,
    and implementation in modern radio hardware will allow the technology to mature.
    With the multitude of existing waveforms in existence, solutions are needed for
    obfuscated communications using the existing technologies in new ways. Dynamic
    switching across a set of disparate waveforms is one example of such technical
    direction. Beyond maturation of the development software and radio platform hardware,
    more work is needed to enable dynamic schedule adjustments. The incorporation
    of DSS technologies, including broadband spectrum sensing, and policy-based reasoning
    will further augment the WHAC-A-MOLE system to produce a multifunctional adaptive
    radio network. The network performance must be considered as the technology matures.
    More investigation is needed to evaluate the system in a larger scale network.
    Foreseeable challenges include network synchronization, network rejoin, data routing,
    message forwarding and relay, and network security, to name a few practical considerations.
    Not considered here are emissions directionality, a key capability for low observability,
    Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), link and network reliability. These factors
    warrant further investigation and are reserved for future work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    IEEE Conference Location: Las Vegas, NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction A Cognitive
    Radio Network (CRN) comprises devices that are capable of sensing their radio
    environment and adjusting operational parameters to communicate in an efficient
    manner while avoiding any interference with the licensed users of the spectrum,
    also known as Primary users (PU). The idea of Cognitive Radio (CR) was first presented
    in [1] which envisioned a CR as a fully cognitive device capable of observing
    and adjusting to all possible radio parameters. However recent research has primarily
    been focused towards spectrum sensing and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) in the
    TV bands. Numerous studies have shown that due to the fixed nature of spectrum
    allocation, large portions of this expensive and very limited resource are being
    under-utilized. One such study in the Chicago metropolitan area [2], carried out
    between 2008 and 2010 showed that the TV bands'' average occupancy was between
    30% and 52% for the three years with overall average spectrum occupancy for 30-3000
    MHz at 14%. In view of this precious yet under-utilized spectrum resource, FCC
    announced that TV channels 5-13 in the VHF band and channels 14-51 in the UHF
    bands could now be used for broadband Internet access [3] by un-licensed or Secondary
    Users (SU). It however requires that the SUs, while making use of the spectrum,
    do not cause interference for any PU''s activities. This opportunistic manner
    of communication opened up numerous exciting challenges to the research community
    resulting in research initiatives, testbeds e.g. [4] and projects such as the
    DoD''s Joint Tactical Radio System, DARPA''s Next Generation (XG) program, IEEE
    802.11af also known as White-Fi or super Wi-Fi and IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional
    Area network (WRAN) [5], [13]. IEEE 802.22 WRAN is a promising technology which
    is expected to see widespread deployment especially in the rural areas or areas
    lacking communications infrastructure. It is designed to operate in TV bands from
    54-862 MHz with 47 TV channels. These frequency bands allow long range communication
    from 17-30 km with a maximum range of 100 km. The network is organized in a Point-to-Multipoint
    configuration called a Cell with a fixed Base Station (BS) and up to 512 simultaneously
    associated fixed subscribers or customer premises equipment (CPE) per Cell. Majority
    of the research efforts in CRNs have been directed towards the Physical (PHY)
    and Medium Access (MAC) layers of the protocol stack while the upper layers, especially
    the transport layer, have not received that much attention. Unlike traditional
    radio technologies and protocols, much closer interaction among transport layer
    and the MAC/PHY layers is required in cognitive radio network, mainly because
    of network-wide quiet periods, opportunistic/dynamic spectrum access, and nondeterministic
    operation of PUs. These factors can have a devastating impact on the overall throughput
    and increase retransmission overheads significantly. Facing this challenge, in
    this paper we present solutions having close interaction between the transport
    and MAC/PHY layers in order to improve the communication efficiency in a CRN.
    Specifically we have made the following contributions in this paper: Carried out
    an analysis of the impact of DSA on TCP performance in the context of an IEEE
    802.22 based WRAN (simply called a WRAN from here on). Identified the factors
    that result in TCP performance degradation in a WRAN. Proposed two schemes to
    enhance TCP performance. Implemented and evaluated the proposed schemes. Figure
    1. Network Architecture used for Performance Evaluation and Proposed Solutions
    Show All The typical architecture of an IEEE 802.22 WRAN is shown in figure-1,
    which is also the basis for our proposed cross-layer solutions for TCP performance
    enhancement. In our solutions, the BS which is also the WRAN''s gateway to Internet,
    continuously monitors all TCP traffic and takes appropriate measures to mitigate
    the impact of PU activity, spectrum sensing and packet losses in the WRAN. Simulation
    results show that with our proposed schemes, significant performance gains can
    be achieved in a WRAN while hiding packet losses and delays in the cognitive radio
    link due to DSA from the sender. In this paper, the terms WRAN and CRN are used
    interchangeably since we only study WRAN that is built on cognitive radio technology.
    Rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II gives the motivation for
    our work. Section III presents the proposed solutions for TCP performance boost
    in WRANs. Some typical results from the simulation of our proposed solutions are
    given in Section IV, Section V presents related work in the transport layer for
    CRNs and Section VI concludes the paper. SECTION II. Motivation for Cross Layer
    Solutions in CRN In this section, we discuss how TCP congestion control algorithm
    and hence network''s throughput may suffer in the context of Cognitive Radio based
    WRAN. The features of a CRN that could impact TCP performance are: (i) quiet period
    duration, time that is used for spectrum sensing (ii) the amount of PU activity
    in the region of a WRAN and (iii) the accuracy of detecting PU''s presence by
    CRN. A. Quiet Period for Spectrum Sensing In order to protect the incumbent PUs
    from harmful interference, a CRN has to enforce quiet periods in the network to
    effectively sense the spectrum for its availability. The length of these quiet
    periods and spectrum sensing can vary depending on the algorithm used [11]. On
    the other hand, users in a WRAN would expect the same level of QoS (e.g. max delay
    of 20 msec in case of voice traffic) as in any other network. The IEEE 802.22
    WRAN standard therefore, employs a two-stage quiet period management scheme as
    shown in Figure 2, where the stages are fast sensing (∼9-20 μsec) and fine sensing
    ( ∼0.3-160 msec) [17]. The network is synchronized and every time slot (160 msec)
    is called a Channel Detection Time (CDT). Every CDT can have one or more fast
    sensing periods and at most one fine sensing period. However, the BS decides to
    go into fine sensing along with its duration based on the outcome of fast sensing
    periods. The fine sensing period may occupy a whole time slot. TCP uses RTT measurements
    for estimating available bandwidth and calculating a suitable Retransmission Timeout
    (RTO) interval for a particular connection, which is further used in its congestion
    control algorithm [16]. As per standard TCP Timer management [15], RTO values
    should be at least 1 sec and implementations must never be more aggressive by
    selecting smaller values. However, if smaller values of RTO are used e.g. 500
    msec in [10] or 200 msec as in [12] as well as Linux, the RTO values will become
    comparable to WRAN''s fine sensing times. In that case, whenever a packet is delayed
    in WRAN because of fine sensing duration, the source TCP will have a good chance
    to have premature timeout, erroneously attributing it to congestion and will resort
    to un-necessary retransmissions, resulting in increased overheads and decreased
    throughput. Figure 2. Two-stage spectrum sensing in IEEE 802.22 WRAN Show All
    Our simulation study presented in section IV, clearly shows the significant impact
    of CRN''s fine sensing on the performance of TCP communication. For the sake of
    this paper, we call the probability for BS to decide to conduct fine sensing in
    a CDT slot as Fine sensing Probability. The simulation results are shown in Figure
    3, which shows file transfer completion time (Y-axis) for a file size of 4 MB,
    in an FTP application at three different fine sensing probabilities and for fine
    sensing durations kept from 0 to 20% of TCP RTO interval (X-axis). As concluded
    in [12], spectrum sensing quiet periods are most debilitating for TCP performance
    in a DSA network. We believe that a transparent mechanism is therefore needed
    to monitor the interaction of TCP RTO interval and spectrum sensing quiet periods
    in the WRAN and take appropriate measures for DSA not to affect TCP congestion
    control. This would result in boosting TCP throughput while minimizing retransmission
    overheads and if possible, the end-to-end semantics of TCP connections. B. Primary
    User Activity The two-stage quiet period and spectrum sensing mechanism of IEEE
    802.22 WRAN as shown in figure-1, is intended to strike a balance in ensuring
    that the PUs are protected from harmful interference from the un-licensed use
    of their resource i.e. the spectrum, and efficient utilization of it, in the absence
    of PUs. During every time slot, called Channel Detection Time (CDT), every node
    in the WRAN (CPE) carries out fast sensing across a specified number of channels
    and reports its measurements to the BS. Based on these measurements, the BS may
    decide not to resort to fine sensing if it concludes that PU''s presence on a
    specific channel is not detected, or it may ask the CPEs to go into fine sensing
    period, if it suspects presence of a PU and needs further confirmation. Clearly,
    the two stage sensing mechanism is intended to carry out fine sensing of the spectrum
    in each CDT slot only if it is necessary, as it would result in the waste of a
    large chunk of spectrum resource, if the PU was not utilizing the spectrum. Figure
    3. Effects Fine Sensing Probability on TCP Throughput Show All As it is clear
    that the more the PU activity is observed, the WRAN will spend more of its time
    in fine sensing of the spectrum. This would result in the network quiet periods
    adversely affecting TCP RTO calculation and therefore degraded throughput. Simulations
    have confirmed that as the PU activity grows in the WRAN, nodes spend more and
    more time in spectrum sensing thereby adversely affecting TCP throughput. Figures
    4 and 5 show the performance of TCP under various packet loss rates, fine sensing
    durations and fine sensing probabilities. For this reason, a mechanism is needed
    that would monitor the level of PU activity in the WRAN and not let it affect
    TCP congestion control mechanism. C. Primary User Detection Accuracy Another factor
    that will have adverse effects on TCP performance in a CRN is the accuracy of
    PU detection scheme(s). On one hand, false alarms in detection of PU''s signal
    will result in wasted spectrum opportunities. On the other hand, if a PU is transmitting
    in a spectrum band and the CRN is unable to detect its activity, then it will
    result in harmful interference to the PU as well as packet losses for the CRN.
    If the probability of not detecting PU''s presence is high then there will be
    significant amount of packet losses in the CRN due to this false spectrum sensing.
    In a recent study, probability of PU detection in an IEEE 802.22 WRAN was found
    out to be 0.9 while the probability of a false alarm as 0.1 for all signal types
    [13]. Increase in packet loss probability will further deteriorate the already
    error prone nature of wireless communications. Therefore, a CRN must have a robust
    mechanism to recover from packet losses due to spectrum sensing errors. Figure

    SOLUTIONS FOR PERFORMANCE BOOST IN WRAN In this section, we present the details
    of our proposed solutions for throughput boost in an IEEE 802.22 WRAN. These solutions
    are transparent because all the proposed enhancements are implemented at the WRAN
    base station (BS) and no changes are required at source or the destination of
    a TCP connection. The reasons for this choice are: (i) On one hand, BS is “controller”
    of all WRAN operations and therefore responsible for scheduling spectrum sensing
    and usage by CPEs, while on the other hand, it also is the gateway to Internet,
    as shown in figure-2. It therefore has the capability to transparently improve
    TCP throughput. (ii) Implementing enhancements at the BS only, and not at the
    sender or receiver, resolves the issue of scalability in the context of Internet,
    and facilitates smooth transition in upgrading BS incrementally. In this section,
    we first explain the network architecture and then present details of the two
    proposed solutions for enhancement of TCP performance. A. Local Loss recovery
    by Base station The first of our proposed solutions to mitigate the effects of
    increased packet losses and errors in CRN wireless medium is local loss recovery
    by the WRAN BS. Specifically, the BS continuously monitors all traffic to/from
    the host(s) in the Internet. It does so by implementing a Loss Recovery Module
    (LRM) which restricts its actions, which are transparent to both the sender and
    the receiver, within the context of WRAN only. The LRM records information regarding
    all TCP traffic traversing through it in both directions and their associated
    TCP state which includes sequence numbers and advertised window sizes as well
    as timers. The LRM restricts the number of un-acknowledged packets sent to the
    CPE, to a parameter ADV_WIN, which represents the current size of the receiver''s
    advertised window. It however, does not implement TCP congestion control mechanism
    because it has little significance within the context of the one-hop WRAN. For
    the lifetime of TCP connections, the BS maintains separate duplicate buffers used
    to maintain copies of all un-acknowledged packets of a particular TCP connection.
    Packet loss is detected if an acknowledgement ACK is not received before expiration
    of the local timer or 3 duplicate acknowledgements of a TCP packet are received.
    Duplicate copy of a lost packet is retransmitted for local recovery of the loss
    and this is repeated for a maximum of MAX_RETRY times. While any packet loss is
    recovered locally, any duplicate ACKs from the receiver are dropped at the BS.
    Values for the retransmission timers at the BS are kept at values selected to
    ensure that these are large enough so that un-necessary retransmissions are avoided
    if the ACKs are delayed due to spectrum sensing, but small enough to ensure that
    packet losses within the WRAN are recovered locally and the sender''s RTO interval
    does not expire. The main advantage of this approach is that the sender''s congestion
    control mechanism does not oscillate unnecessarily, due to losses that occur in
    the WRAN. Pseudo-code for the algorithm implemented in LRM is shown in figure-6.
    The LRM maintains duplicate copies of all TCP packets forwarded to receivers in
    the WRAN and removes the copies for which ACKs have been received and relayed
    to the sender in the Internet (lines 10, 11 and 13 of Process_ ACKS). It however
    keeps track of duplicate ACKs and if 3 duplicate ACKs are received or its local
    timer expires, it is treated as an indication of a lost packet resulting in appropriate
    packets being retransmitted out of duplicate buffer. Sending of new or duplicate
    packets is kept within the limit of advertised window size of the receiver (lines
    4,7, 9 of BS_Process). The Fast Retransmit option enables the BS to recover from
    a packet loss without the expiry of its local timer. B. Split TCP Connection Our
    second approach to boost TCP throughput for data transfers across a WRAN is to
    implement what we call a split TCP. Differences between existing split TCP mechanisms
    [19], [20], [21] and our approach are Our approach does not require modifications
    in either the source or the destination; It is specifically designed for IEEE
    802.22 WRANs; It pre-acknowledges TCP packets to shield the sender from unusually
    large spectrum sensing delays. The BS implements this scheme with a module similar
    to LRM, which Pre-Acknowledges TCP packets received at the BS, on behalf of the
    receiver in WRAN, effectively sending spoofed ACKs to the sender. This module
    is called the Pre-Acknowledgement Module (PAM). PAM maintains the state of all
    TCP connections traversing the BS, and just as the LRM, maintains a duplicate
    buffer for every TCP connection to ensure delivery of all of its packets. PAM
    also does not implement the complete TCP and its congestion control mechanism;
    however it restricts the number of packets transmitted to the receiver''s advertised
    window size along with local timers for reliable delivery. Unlike LRM, values
    for PAM''s retransmission timers are not associated with the sender''s RTO interval
    because in this case the sender''s transmissions are independent of losses or
    delays in the WRAN. Therefore, PAM''s local timers can be configured to suit the
    requirements of WRAN. Figure 6. Pseudo-code for LRM algorithm at Base Station
    Show All Algorithm of PAM is similar to LRM as shown in figure-6, with following
    exceptions: (i) whenever new packets are received at the BS from a sender in the
    Internet, an Acknowledgement is immediately sent to sender, and (ii) when an ACK
    is received from the receiver in WRAN, it is dropped and corresponding duplicate
    packets are dropped from duplicate buffer. Packet retransmissions out of duplicate
    buffer are triggered when the BS''s local timer expires or with the receipt of
    3 duplicate acknowledgements to trigger Fast Retransmission. Figure 7. Performance
    of Proposed Solutions at various Show All C. Discussion and limitations of proposed
    approaches The split TCP connection approach for boosting TCP performance uses
    spoofed acknowledgements by the BS which essentially breaks the end-to-end semantics
    of a TCP connection since a packet is acknowledged to its sender whereas it might
    not have been received by its intended receiver. This situation may not be acceptable
    to certain applications that work on the guarantees from TCP regarding actual
    delivery of a packet that is acknowledged. However, in situations where TCP RTO
    interval is comparable to fine sensing duration of the WRAN, pre-acknowledgement
    might be the only option for preventing the TCP congestion control algorithm to
    timeout repeatedly and incorrectly attributing it to congestion. On the other
    hand, local recovery of lost packets by the BS preserves end-to-end semantics
    of TCP connections and provides a throughput boost as well. Therefore, the solution
    with pre-acknowledgements by BS may be selected for applications such as file
    transfer that may not be concerned with preserving end-to-end semantics while
    local loss recovery may be selected for the rest. The main advantage of our schemes
    is that they provide throughput boost transparently i.e. without any need for
    changes in the end systems making them ideal for initial deployment of a WRAN.
    SECTION IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Simulation Setup In this section, we evaluate
    the performance of our proposed solutions to boost TCP throughput in the context
    of a WRAN. Specifically, we consider a file transfer application in which a node
    in an IEEE 802.22 WRAN communicates with an FTP server in the Internet. We have
    developed a simulator to model a WRAN in which the BS and its associated CPEs
    resort to DSA to communicate with each other while the BS acts as gateway to Internet
    for the WRAN. Every node (CPE) in the network is equipped with a single radio
    transceiver that can be tuned to one channel at a time, however all nodes in the
    network are tuned to the same channel and the use or switching to/from a specific
    channel is controlled by the BS. The TCP module of our simulator implements slow
    start, congestion avoidance and fast retransmission schemes. However, since there
    have been various values for RTO interval for TCP implementations, we have also
    studied the impact of varying its values in our simulations. The downlink bandwidth
    from BS to CPEs is 1.5 Mbps downlink and uplink bandwidth per CPE is 384 kbps
    [13], [17]. The receiver of a TCP packet never delays an outgoing ACK for piggybacking
    i.e. it sends one ACK for every packet received. Bandwidth between the WRAN BS
    and FTP server is assumed to be 10 Mbps and file size for FTP transfer is 4 MB.
    Measurements for every data point were recorded by averaging the results of 1000
    simulation runs. Figure 8. Performance of Local Loss Recovery at various Loss
    Rates Show All Figure 9. Performance of Split TCP (Pre-ACK) at various Loss Rates
    Show All Figure-7 shows the performance of our proposed solutions in comparison
    with TCP where the figure shows TCP performance at packet loss rates of 0.5% and
    2% for the WRAN link whereas our proposed schemes were run with 10% packet loss
    rate in the WRAN. As it is evident, our proposed schemes increase the throughput
    by 20 times. Figures 8 and 9 show the performance of our proposed schemes individually
    where the simulations were run for packet loss rates from 0.5% to 10% and the
    overall file transfer times (y-axis) were recorded against varying fine sensing
    probabilities (x-axis) form 0 to 90%. The difference in performance of local loss
    recovery and pre-acknowledgement schemes can be observed because in case of local
    recovery, the sender does not send new packets unless the losses in WRAN have
    been recovered by the BS, whereas for pre-acknowledgement, the sender can send
    new packets at the full capacity of the Internet link and is not restricted due
    to losses and delays in the WRAN. In this way, losses in the WRAN have some impact
    on the overall throughput of local loss recovery mechanism but none for pre-acknowledgement
    scheme. Figures 10 and 11 show a comparison of TCP''s performance with our proposed
    solutions, at fine sensing durations 5% and 15% of TCP RTO intervals respectively,
    where the packet loss rate is kept constant at 0.2% for WRAN and 0.01 % for Internet.
    In addition to preventing the fine sensing periods to interfere with TCP RTO interval,
    our schemes provide better throughput even when there are no fine sensing periods,
    because they are also able to recover from packet losses without having the sender
    TCP being affected by them. Our proposed solutions perform up to 20 times better
    than TCP in scenarios where TCP flows suffer heavy packet losses and the sender
    has to invoke its congestion control mechanism very frequently. On the other hand,
    our solutions shield the sender from adverse effects of losses in the WRAN. When
    compared with each other, the two proposed solutions exhibit different performance
    as well. Split TCP connection with Pre-Acknowledgements has better performance
    than the local loss recovery by BS, but may be a less favorable option when it
    comes to preserving the end-to-end semantics of a TCP connection. However, we
    propose that the choice of selecting a transfer mechanism other than TCP, be negotiated
    by CPEs with the BS at the time of joining the WRAN or for specific TCP flows.
    SECTION V. Related Work Researchers have only recently started to lay down the
    requirements for CRNs [6], [7] and novel platforms e.g. [8] are being developed
    for advanced research in software defined cognitive radios. Development of transport
    layer protocols for CRNs is largely an un-explored area with a few exceptions.
    TP-CRAHN [9] is a protocol designed for use within ad hoc CRNs. It incorporates
    a cross-layer design with explicit feedback from every node between the source
    and destination nodes, regarding their sensing schedules and the length of quiet
    periods intended for detecting PUs through spectrum sensing. Its transport protocol
    also interacts with physical layer''s channel information, link layer''s buffer
    management as well as a mobility prediction framework to cater for varying parameters
    and network dynamics. TCPE [10] protocol is designed for heterogeneous networks
    involving CRNs and the wired Internet. It aims to achieve better throughput through
    available bandwidth estimation and round-trip-time (RTT) difference between successive
    TCP segments. It assumes packet delays to have been caused by spectrum sensing
    if the difference between successive RTTs is more than 90% of spectrum sensing
    duration (SSD). The study does not present any results if the source is in the
    Internet and destination node is located in a CRN, in which case the source node
    would have to know the SSD for destination node''s network, which can vary by
    technology [11]. Figure 10. Performance comparison at Fine Sensing Duration 5%
    of TCP RTO Show All Figure 11. Performance comparison at Fine Sensing Duration
    15% of TCP RTO Show All An approach similar to ours, based on local loss recovery,
    has been employed in [18], but the main difference from our approach is that the
    above scheme is designed for Cellular networks to mitigate the effects of losses
    due to high bit-errors and handoffs whereas our scheme is specifically designed
    to cater for additional packet losses and delays that occur due to DSA. Unlike
    [18], our scheme does not require the use of Explicit Congestion Notifications
    (ECN) or Negative Acknowledgements (NACK). If a sender is located in the WRAN,
    then it would be aware of spectrum sensing schedules and its associated delays
    and would therefore be able to discern packet losses or delays due to quiet periods
    from those caused due to factors other than DSA. On the other hand, if the sender
    is in the Internet and packets arrive successfully at BS but losses or delays
    occur within the WRAN due to DSA, then there is no need to use ECN or NACK with
    the sender when the loss can be recovered locally by BS. The use of ECN or NACKs
    is therefore of little use in the context of DSA which would also require modifications
    to both the source and the destination, thereby introducing the problem of scalability
    of the solution. I-TCP [19] was proposed to split a TCP connection at the BS into
    two separate connections, to alleviate TCP poor performance in wireless networks.
    It however required special devices called Mobility Support Routers in the wireless
    network and also required modification to the TCP code in mobile hosts. In [20],
    a split connection approach is proposed for ad hoc cognitive networks to mitigate
    the effects of TCP un-fairness towards nodes that are relatively farther away
    from the source node. It works by forming a chain of suitably selected nodes to
    act as TCP proxies between the source and destination of a connection, both of
    which lie within the ad hoc network. A Semi-Split TCP has been proposed in [21],
    in which a BS never pre-acknowledges a packet, rather it buffers the ACKs received
    from the receiver in cognitive network and controls the amount of ACKs relayed
    back to the sender in order to throttle the sender and to prevent the BS''s buffers
    from starvation. Performance analysis of various flavors of TCP in DSA links is
    presented in [12]. The study concludes that the most dominant factor in TCP throughput
    reduction is spectrum sensing duration and not the PU detection errors. SECTION
    VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we have shown that TCP performance is affected adversely
    due to PU activity in a WRAN, DSA by the un-licensed users and associated quiet
    periods that can be comparable with RTO interval of the sender''s TCP, a scenario
    which can trigger TCP''s congestion control mechanism un-necessarily and fruitlessly.
    We have shown that our solutions transparently remedy this situation by coping
    well with packet losses that are inherent to the wireless medium as well as resulting
    from inaccuracies in detection of PUs and network-wide quiet periods for spectrum
    sensing. To the best of our knowledge, there is however, no work that analyses
    TCP performance in the context of an IEEE 802.22 WRAN, or proposes solutions that
    would result in throughput boost for these networks. Currently we are investigating
    the impact of DSA in a multi-hop cognitive radio network such as IEEE 802.11af.

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Spectrum crowding will continue to increase
    as the demand for higher data rates grows and the number of wireless applications
    and users increases. From an assigned spectrum perspective, a cursory glance at
    the FCC''s spectrum allocation chart can lead one to believe that spectrum is
    scarce [1]. However, recent studies suggest that spectrum congestion is mainly
    due to inefficient spectrum usage rather than spectrum scarcity [2]. Two techniques
    are being considered within the research community to address improved spectrum
    efficiency, including Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR).
    DSA approaches can be broadly categorized as being based on one of three models,
    including 1) dynamic exclusive use, 2) open sharing (spectrum commons) or 3) hierarchical
    access [3], [4]. The dynamic exclusive model basically follows present policy
    and governing regulations. Spectrum property rights and dynamic spectrum allocation
    are two methods within this model that add flexibility for spectrum efficiency.
    Under spectrum property rights, a primary user (licensee) is allowed to sell and/or
    trade spectrum and can dictate the employed technology. As introduced under the
    European DRIVE project, the goal of dynamic spectrum allocation is to improve
    spectrum efficiency via dynamic spectrum assignment utilizing spatial and temporal
    statistics of various users. The open sharing model, which is also known as spectrum
    commons, employs sharing among peers as the basis to manage spectral regions.
    This model basically gains support from the success of wireless services operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) frequency band. Finally,
    under the hierarchial access model interactions between primary and secondary
    users are considered to achieve spectrum efficiency. The basic idea here is to
    open up the licensed spectrum to secondary users while inducing minimum acceptable
    interference into the primary users. Spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay are
    two approaches commonly considered to accomplish this. Spectrum overlay allows
    unlicensed secondary users to utilize unused spectrum simultaneously with primary
    users on a non-interference basis. This overlay approach was first adapted by
    [5] and subsequently researched under DARPA''s Next Generation (XG) program as
    an “opportunistic spectrum access” approach. Similarly, spectrum underlay allows
    unlicensed secondary users to simultaneously operate in primary user bands but
    under strict transmit power constraints. Of all spectrum access models presented,
    the hierarchical access model is perhaps the most compatible with current FCC
    policies and legacy wireless systems. As proposed in [2], [6], CR technology fits
    within the hierarchial access method. Even though the present CR definition only
    considers overlay approaches, the research trend suggests that a hybrid technique
    combining overlay/underlay concepts can be employed to maximize spectral efficiency
    by using both white and gray spectral regions [3], [7]. Therefore, CR techniques
    can be further categorized as being either overlay-CR or underlay-CR depending
    on the spectral region being used. The choice of physical layer transmission is
    very important in CR implementation. Parameters influencing CR physical layer
    waveform design includes power, frequency, modulation, symbol rate, pulse or spectrum
    shaping and coding to name a few. Multi-carrier modulations such as OFDM and MC-CDMA
    are hailed as promising candidates [8]–[11] for realizing CR applications. The
    work in [9] adopted OFDM modulation for implementing a proposed spectrum spooling
    method to enhance spectrum efficiency. The goal of spectrum spooling is to enhance
    spectral efficiency of mobile radio systems by overlaying secondary mobile radio
    systems. A variant of the OFDM scheme in which arbitrarily selected subcarriers
    are disabled or de-activated to avoid interference to the primary user bands is
    termed as discontiguous or non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
    (NC-OFDM, i.e., non-contiguous OFDM). Work in [12], [13] has proposed and implemented
    a hardware prototype demonstrating the NC-OFDM concept, while work in [14]–[16]
    has considered other physical layer parameters in NC-OFDM such as power, modulation
    and coding to optimize the CR physical layer. While a majority of early research
    focused on OFDM multi-carrier modulation as a suitable candidate for CR applications,
    basic OFDM is generally not utilized in practical applications due to its performance
    degradation in frequency selective fading [17]. Furthermore, the basic OFDM technique
    is more suitable for broadcast only type scenarios such as cellular down links
    or digital audio broadcast applications [16]. To address these problems and help
    satisfy high data rate requirements, while improving spectrum efficiency and avoiding
    interference to primary and other secondary users, other multi-carrier modulations
    such as MC-CDMA [18], CI/MC-CDMA [19], [20] and TDCS [21] have been proposed as
    possible CR candidate waveforms [22]–[26]. Software defined radio (SDR) is another
    promising DSA enabling technology where the radio transceivers perform baseband
    processing in software. SDR has the ability to quickly reconfigure its operating
    parameters, which is a fundamental requirement in the CR scenarios. The synergistic
    union of these two DSA technologies is termed “CR-based SDR”. That is, the SDR
    provides the software controlled communication vehicle (core technology for air
    interface and waveform generation), the control and application of which is based
    on CR principles guided by spectral monitoring to achieve efficient spectrum usage
    [27]. Driven by SDR principles, a general analytic framework was developed to
    encompass a myriad of multi-carrier signals. The framework is applicable to a
    broad class that is called Spectrally Modulated, Spectrally Encoded (SMSE) signals
    [27]–[29]. Depending on CR user needs, various multi-carrier waveforms can be
    generated using this framework, e.g., OFDM, MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS. Since
    this original SMSE framework employed hard decision frequency allocation, its
    applicability is limited to overlay-CR signals. To extend its applicability and
    maximize spectrum efficiency by utilizing both unused and underused regions, a
    soft decision SMSE (SD-SMSE) framework was subsequently developed to realize overlay-CR,
    underlay-CR and hybrid overlay/underlay CR signals [30]. This paper expands upon
    previous work and presents a novel multi-function SD-SMSE framework that exploits
    both unused and underused spectrum to maximize CR spectrum efficiency. It is shown
    that the proposed SD-SMSE framework can be utilized to support current cognitive
    radio waveforms, including overlay-CR, underlay-CR, and novel hybrid overlay/underlay
    CR technique that exploits both unused spectrum holes (white space) and underused
    spectrum bands (gray space) to improve the performance and CR spectrum efficiency.
    More specifically, the proposed hybrid technique employs systematic channel coding
    whereby information bits are transmitted using an overlay waveform over unused
    spectrum holes and redundant parity check bits are transmitted using an underlay
    waveform over underused spectrum bands. This novel hybrid scheme significantly
    improves BER performance of the current cognitive radio scheme. Analytic BER performance
    evaluation of both overlay-CR and underlay-CR waveforms is derived. Simulation
    results for an AWGN channel are provided to demonstrate and validate performance
    enhancement of the hybrid overlay/underlay cognitive radio system. The remainder
    of this paper presents a brief overview of the SMSE framework followed by a more
    detailed description of the extended SD-SMSE framework and its components. The
    design of overlay-CR, underlay-CR and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms that are
    suitable for a “CR-based SDR” platform are then presented. Next, analytic expressions
    for BER performance of cognitive radio centric waveforms are presented. Finally,
    each of the three waveform designs are evaluated via simulation in the context
    of CR applicability. SECTION II. SMSE Overlay Framework Previous work provides
    a general analytic framework for SMSE signals that accommodates multi-carrier,
    CR-based waveforms [27]. Specifically, an arbitrary CR waveform can be expressed
    in terms of its amplitude ( A ), phase (Θ) and frequency ( F ) characteristics.
    These three factors aid in SMSE waveform design through six design variables,
    namely Data modulation ( d ), Code ( c ), Window ( w ), Orthogonality ( o ) and
    two frequency allocation variables. An in-depth treatment of the SMSE analytic
    development and the family of SMSE waveforms is provided in [17], [27]. Considering
    N f total frequency components, the coding c=[ c 1 , c 2 ,…, c N f ], c i ∈C data
    modulation, d=[ d 1 , d 2 ,…, d N f ], d i ∈C , and windowing, w=[ w 1 , w 2 ,…,
    w N f ], w i ∈C vectors account for component-by-component amplitude and/or phase
    variations. A phase only =[ o 1 , o 2 ,…, o N f ], o i ∈C is used for orthogonality
    between symbol streams and facilitate multiple access. The analytic SMSE framework
    development begins by considering data, code and window variables. The m th frequency
    component of the k th symbol is given by S k [m]= c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k +
    θ c m + θ w m ) , (1) View Source where m=0,1,…, N F −1 is the frequency index
    and c m , d m are magnitude and phase design variables. The expression in (1)
    is next modified to incorporate frequency and orthogonality variables. Frequency
    component selection is a function of two factors, including an available variable
    a=[ a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N f ], a i ∈{0,1} and a use variable u=[ u 1 , u 2 ,…, u N
    f ], u i ∈{0,1} . Given an N f -point fast Fourier transform (FFT) process, N
    f frequency components or spectral bands are available for waveform design. It
    is important to note that the frequency assignment variable takes on binary values
    0 or 1 indicating the spectrum availability for secondary users. As a direct result,
    this pool of frequencies is reduced by component selection to create a number
    of CR available frequencies and usable frequencies. The m th component of the
    k th CR symbol corresponds to S k [m]= a m u m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ
    c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) , (2) View Source where the product a i u i ∈{0,1} . The
    discrete time domain SMSE waveform is obtained by taking the Inverse Discrete
    Fourier Transform (IDFT) of (2) according to s k [n] = 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1
    a m u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) }, (3)
    View Source where t k ≤ t n ≤ t k +T, f m = f c +mΔf,T is the symbol duration
    and Δf=1/T is the frequency resolution [27]. A. OFDM via SMSE Analytic Expression
    The OFDM transmission analytic expression can be derived from the SMSE framework
    by setting variables u i = a i , w i =1 , and θ w i =0 ∀ i : S k [m]= { a m d
    m,k e −j( θ d m,k ) } N f −1 m=0 , (4) View Source Substituting for d i ∈C, d
    m,k e −j θ d m,k =( α m,k +j β m,k ) yields to (5). α m,k and β m,k depend on
    the data modulation being used, e.g., α m,k , β m,k ∈{±1} for QPSK and α m,k ,
    β m,k ∈{±1,±3} for 16-QAM. Finally, applying an IFFT to (5) results in the discrete
    time domain OFDM expression given in (6) [28]. s k [n]= S k [m]={( α m,k +j β
    m,k ) } N f −1 m=0 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 ( α m,k +j β m,k ) e j(2π f m t n )
    } (5) (6) View Source B. MC-CDMA via SMSE Analytic Expression The MC-CDMA analytic
    expression can be derived from the SMSE framework by setting the variables w i
    =1 , θ w i =0 ∀ i, θ o i =0 ∀ i , and the data variable only depends upon k because
    of the spectral spreading: S k [m]= { a m u m c m d k e −j[ θ c m + θ d k ] }
    N f −1 m=0 . (7) View Source Spectral spreading is accomplished using a random
    application of phases, 0 or π , such that c i =1 and θ c i ∈{0,π} ∀ i . For a
    m u m =1 , this further simplifies equation (7) to S k [m]= { d k e −j[ θ c m
    + θ d k ] } N f −1 m=0 . (8) View Source For complex data modulation d k e −j
    θ d k ( α k +j β k ) , (8) can be rewritten as S k [m]= {( α k +j β k ) e −j[
    θ c m ] } N f −1 m=0 , (9) View Source where α k and β k depend on the modulation
    type being employed. After an IFFT operation on (9), the discrete transmitted
    MC-CDMA signal is given by s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 ( α k +j β k ) e j(2π
    f m t n + θ c m ) }. (10) View Source SECTION III. Extended Overlay/Underlay SD-SMSE
    Framework The SMSE framework provides a unified expression for generating and
    implementing a host of multi-carrier type waveforms (e.g., OFDM, MC-CDMA, CI/OFDM,
    TDCS, etc) and satisfies current CR goals of exploiting unused spectral bands.
    However, it does not exploit underused spectrum. This section re-visits the original
    SMSE framework development and the frequency assignment variables to exploit both
    unused and underused spectrum to generate both overlay-CR and underlay-CR type
    waveforms. Figure 1 illustrates a conceptual view of the unused and underused
    spectrum utilization using an arbitrary interference threshold (IT). IT is assumed
    to be a limit set forth by the primary users based on the measured power spectrum
    density in a given bandwidth. Two cases of under utilized spectrum are demonstrated:
    1) when the spectral assignment is based on a binary decision the bands adjacent
    to the primary users are unavailable to overlay-CR users and 2) primary users
    bands below the IT are unavailable to CR users as well. A soft decision CR (SDCR)
    will be able to exploit these underused frequency bands to improve spectral efficiency
    and increase channel capacity. To support the envisioned SDCR system, the original
    SMSE framework is extended to account for both unused and underused frequency
    bands. Fig. 1. Identification of primary users, unused and underused spectral
    region Show All The proposed SD-SMSE framework is first illustrated using Fig.
    2 and Fig. 3, then the design variables are re-defined to extend the SMSE expression
    to account for both unused and underused spectrum. Figure 2a and Fig. 2b show
    how the current CR framework identifies the used and unused spectrum based on
    binary decisions. Figure 2c shows the weighted spectrum estimation resulted from
    spectrum sensing block in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, I T represents the interference threshold,
    P U and S U are the accumulated signal strengths from all the primary users and
    all the secondary users respectively, and N represents the total observed noise.
    The weighted spectrum estimate (WSE) ( a ) is further processed taking into account
    inputs from the IT estimator, primary users, other secondary users requirements
    and channel conditions. Specifically, the weighted spectrum estimate provides
    a metric of the allowable transmission power density at each and every frequency
    component in the entire bandwidth. Hence, the WSE divides the entire bandwidth
    into unused ( u ) and underused ( b ) frequency components and both the unused
    and underused spectrum can be exploited. Notice in Fig. 2 that different underused
    frequency components have different allowable CR transmission power densities.
    It is envisioned that a CR-based SDR will have the option to choose an overlay-CR,
    underlay-CR or hybrid overlay/underlay waveform to improve performance based on
    the scenario, situation and need. Fig. 2. Spectrum parsing using weighted spectrum
    estimation in realization of SD-SMSE waveform. Show All Fig. 3. Block diagram
    representation of SD-SMSE framework [30]. Show All The first step in SD-SMSE framework
    development is to reexamine the design variables in the original SMSE framework.
    For the SD-SMSE development, frequency related factors are termed primary variables
    while amplitude and phase related factors are termed secondary variables. Since
    the objective here is to optimize the spectrum usage, only frequency components
    related design variables are considered. From this point forward the SD-SMSE framework
    development is based on the scenario depicted in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2c,
    the weighted spectrum estimate represents all frequency components which can be
    utilized for secondary user applications. It is represented by variable a with
    the range changed from binary values (hard decision) to real values (soft decision),
    i.e., a=[ a 0 , a 1 ,…, a N f −1 ],0≤ a m ≤1. (11) View Source From the weighted
    spectrum estimate a , the unused spectrum vector u can be derived as u=[ u 0 ,
    u 1 ,…, u N f −1 ], (12) View Source where, u m ={ 1 0 if a m =1 else m=0,1,⋯
    N f −1 (13) View Source The original SMSE hard decision CR design transmits over
    the unused spectrum specified by u . Now introducing a new design variable b to
    account for the underused spectrum, b=[ b 0 , b 1 ,…, b N f −1 ], (14) View Source
    where, b m ={ 0 a m a m =1 a m ≠1 (15) View Source for m=0,1,⋯, N f −1 . Note
    that when a m =1 the value of b m =0 . This is because when a m =1 the spectral
    component is being unused and accounted for in the assignment of u m , It is obvious
    that if one frequency component is underused it cannot also be counted as unused
    and vice versa, i.e., u m =0 if b m >0 and b m =0 if u m =1 . The remaining waveform
    design variables, i.e., code ( c ), data ( d ), window ( w ) and orthogonality
    ( o ), remain unchanged from the original SMSE framework. Applying all these design
    variables, the m th component of the k th data symbol of the SD-SMSE can be expressed
    as S k [m]= a m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) ={ u m c
    m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) b m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d
    m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) a m =1 a m ≠1 (16) View Source The expression in
    (16) can be decomposed into unused and underused SMSE waveform representing the
    new SDCR architecture shown in Fig. 3. Applying the IDFT to (16) results in the
    discrete time domain waveform given by: s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 a m c
    m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } s k [n]= 1 N
    f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m
    +θ o m,k ) } + 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 b m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k
    + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } (17) (18) View Source where the first summation in
    (18) represents the unused frequency components and the second summation accounts
    for underused frequency components. The SMSE expression in (17) was demonstrated
    by applying it to a number of OFDM based multi-carrier signals [27]–[29]. The
    process of generating these waveforms can be viewed as a two step approach 1)
    generating the frequency related primary variables and 2) applying the secondary
    variables such as the code code, data modulation, windowing and orthogonality
    to the frequency vector. Since the SD-SMSE only focused on manipulating the primary
    variables, all the OFDM based multi-carrier modulations expression such as NC-OFDM,
    NC-MC-CDMA, NC-CI/MC-CDMA and NCTDCS are applicable to both overlay-CR and underlay-CR
    scenarios. A. SD-SMSE Overlay Waveform Current CR techniques commonly employ an
    overlay waveform to exploit unused spectral bands and thus represent a special
    case (subset) of soft decision CR with no underused frequency components being
    exploited. In the SMSE framework, forcing the underused variable b to be zero
    and the frequency assignment variable a to take on binary values results in, b=[0,0,…,0]
    a=[ a 0 , a 1 ,…, a N f −1 ], a m ∈{0,1} (19) (20) View Source where the second
    summation in (18) is eliminated and reduces to current hard decision CR overlay:
    s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ
    c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) }. (21) View Source B. SD-SMSE Underlay Waveform Unlike
    overlay-CR waveforms that only operate in unused spectrum bands, underlay-CR waveform
    operates in underused spectrum regions. An underlay-CR waveform spreads its signal
    over a wide bandwidth to minimize interference to existing primary users and to
    achieve the required processing gain to improve its own performance. Underlay-CR
    approaches have been generally associated with UWB technology. By definition,
    a signal is defined as UWB if it occupies a bandwidth that is greater than 500
    MHz. Therefore, not all underlay-CR waveforms can be classified as UWB per this
    definition. For example, a low data rate underlay waveform used as a control channel
    might only require a few mega hertz of bandwidth. In the SD-SMSE context, UWB
    is a special implementation of an underlay-CR waveform. An UWB transmission uses
    underlay waveform which operates across all spectral components while minimizing
    interference to primary users by limiting its transmission power spectral density.
    Hence, its allowable transmission power spectral density is dictated by the primary
    user (among all those present) that is most sensitive to interference. In this
    case, all frequency components are treated as underused components. Hence, by
    setting u=[0,0,…,0] b=[K,K,…K],0<K<1 (22) (23) View Source The first summation
    in (18) can be eliminated which results in a CR underlay waveform corresponding
    to an UWB transmission:   s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 K d m,k w m e j(2π f
    m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) }. (24) View Source where K is a constant
    obtained by taking the minimum value of the weighted power spectral density shown
    in Fig. 2. Note that b was assumed constant for simplicity, in general each underused
    spectral components can have different spectral weights capable of employing adaptive
    baseband modulations. C. Hybrid Overlay/Underlay For the proposed soft decision
    CR, the waveform achieves benefits of both overlay-CR and underlay-CR waveforms
    by exploiting both unused and underused spectral regions. This is done by employing
    soft decision criteria at each distinct frequency component while minimizing the
    interference to primary users [12], [22], [31]. The expression in (18) represents
    the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform utilizing the SD-SMSE framework. SECTION
    IV. Performance Analysis of Overlay/Underlay Waveforms This section begins by
    considering application of the general SMSE and SD-SMSE frameworks to typical
    multi-carrier modulations including OFDM and MC-CDMA. It has been shown that these
    multi-carrier modulations can be readily adapted to a non-contiguous spectrum
    environment by deactivating undesired subcarriers that are interfering with primary
    user bands [12], [22], [24], [25], [31]. Here, the BER performance of overlay-CR
    and underlay-CR waveforms is evaluated. The total received signal in a CR environment
    under AWGN channel conditions is given by r(t)= ∑ k=1 K S p k (t)+ ∑ l=1 L S s
    l (t)+n(t) (25) View Source where K is the total number of primary users, L is
    the total number of secondary users, S p k (t) represents the k th primary user''s
    signal, S s l (t) is the l th secondary user''s signal, and n(t) represents the
    additive Gaussian noise. Figure 4 illustrates such a dynamic spectrum access scenario
    containing two primary users occupying two non-contiguous frequency bands and
    two spectrum holes that are available for secondary user transmissions. Assuming
    the k th primary user transmits an OFDM signal with BPSK modulation over M k subcarriers,
    the k th primary user''s signal corresponds to S p k (t)= E b k T − − − − √ Re{
    ∑ i=0 M k −1 b (k) i e j2π f k i g(t)} (26) View Source where E b k is the k tk
    user''s bit energy, b (k) i is the k th user''s i th bit, f k i is the i th subcarrier
    of the k th user, g(t) is a rectangular waveform of unity height which time-limits
    the code to one symbol duration T , and the subcarrier bandwidth Δf= f k i − f
    k i−1 =1/T . Fig. 4. Performance of non-contiguous overlay waveform under AWGN
    channel conditions. Show All A. Performance Analysis of Overlay Waveforms When
    the secondary user employs an overlay waveform for transmission, only spectrum
    holes are used. We assume here that only one secondary user is transmitting over
    all available spectrum holes. The signal corresponding to the secondary user waveform
    employing NC-OFDM can be written as: S s (t)= E b s T − − − − √ Re{ ∑ i=0 M h
    −1 b (s) i e j2π f h i t g(t)} (27) View Source where E b s is the secondary user''s
    bit energy, b (s) i is the secondary user''s i th bit, f h i is the i th subcarrier
    of the spectrum holes, and M h is the total number of subcarriers of all spectrum
    holes. Similarly, a secondary user employing NC-MC-CDMA can be written as S s
    (t)= E b s M h T − − − − − √ Re{ b (s) ∑ i=0 M h −1 β i e j2π f h i t g(t)} (28)
    View Source where β i is the i th component of the spreading code of the secondary
    user. Since the secondary user''s transmission is assumed to be synchronized in
    time with the primary users'' transmission, and the secondary user only transmits
    over spectrum holes, there is no interference from the secondary user to primary
    users and vice versa. Hence, the BER performance of the secondary user (and the
    primary users) is simply [32], P(e)=Q( 2 E b N 0 − − − − √ ) (29) View Source
    for BPSK modulation and P(e)= 2 3 Q( 6 E b N 0 − − − − √ sin π 8 ) (30) View Source
    for 8PSK modulation with Gray coding. B. Performance Analysis of Underlay Waveforms
    When underlay waveform is employed by the secondary users for transmission, the
    transmission occupies the entire bandwidth instead of only the spectrum holes.
    Here, multiple secondary users can be accommodated using MC-CDMA. The total secondary
    users'' signal corresponds to: S s (t)= ∑ l=1 L S s i (t) = E b s N f T − − −
    − − √ Re{ ∑ l=1 L b (l) ∑ i=0 N f −1 β (l) i e j2π( f c +iΔf)t g(t)} (31) View
    Source N f is the total number of subcarriers over the entire bandwidth, β (l)
    i is the i th component of l th user''s spreading code. The received signal is
    first decomposed to N f subcarriers then recombined to create the final decision
    variable for the desired secondary user. Specifically, the n th secondary user''s
    decision variable is: R (n) = ∑ i=0 N f −1 r (n) i (32) View Source When one subcarrier
    is in a spectrum hole, there is no primary user''s signal: r (n) i = E b s N f
    − − − − √ b (n) + E b s N f − − − − √ ∑ l=1,l≠n L b (l) β (l) i β (n) i + n i
    (33) View Source where the first term is the desired signal, the second term is
    the MAI (multiple access interference), and the third term represents the additive
    Gaussian noise. However, if one subcarrier is not in a spectrum hole, the secondary
    users'' signal coexists with one primary user''s signal: r (n) i = E b s N f −
    − − − √ b (n) + E b s N f − − − − √ ∑ l=1,l≠n L b (l) β (l) i β (n) i + E b k
    − − − √ b (k) i + n i (34) View Source When orthogonal spreading codes are employed
    for secondary users, the n th secondary user''s decision variable after recombining
    now corresponds to: R (n) = ∑ i=0 N f −1 r (n) i = N f E b s N f − − − − √ + ∑

    Source SECTION V. Simulation Results Performance of the overlay-CR, underlay-CR
    and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms is demonstrated via simulation under AWGN
    channel conditions. Perfect synchronization is assumed between the primary and
    secondary user. Analytic versus simulated P(e) versus E b / N 0 is used as a performance
    metric to validate these waveforms. When the secondary user is perfectly synchronized
    with the primary user, there is no interference from the secondary user to primary
    user when secondary user employs overlay waveform, hence, the performance of the
    non-contiguous overlay waveform secondary user follows the theoretical performance
    under AWGN channel conditions. A. Overlay Simulation Results In current CR methods
    only the unused spectrum is allocated for secondary users. The overlay spectrum
    allocation scenario is assumed to have 64 subcarriers where only 32 non-contiguous
    subcarriers are available for secondary CR users. Performance of four non-contiguous
    overlay waveforms is demonstrated in Fig. 4. The results demonstrate that with
    perfect synchronization between primary and secondary users, non-contiguous waveforms
    such as NC-OFDM, NCMCCDMA, NC-CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS with BPSK modulation and 8PSK
    modulation respectively, match the theoretical expressions under AWGN channel
    conditions. B. Underlay Simulation Results A CR underlay waveform utilizes the
    underused portion of the spectrum, operating on top of the other primary user
    waveform. In the previous overlay case, since perfect synchronization is assumed
    there was no interference between the primary user and the overlay-CR secondary
    user. Whereas in the underlay-CR case, the primary user and secondary underlay
    user will be interfering with each other causing mutual performance degradation.
    Three scenarios are considered to get some insight and understanding of the mutual
    interference. The first two scenarios examine an underlay-CR waveform with a primary
    user as the interference and the third scenario analyzes primary user performance
    with an underlay-CR waveform as the interference. In the first scenario, the primary
    user is modeled as OFDM with BPSK modulation using a contiguous N=32 subcarrier
    spectrum. The underlay waveform is modeled as MC-CDMA with BPSK modulation. The
    underlay waveform uses much lower power and will spread its spectrum while maintaining
    its own performance requirements and minimizing its interference to the primary
    user. Figure 5 illustrates the performance of an underlay secondary user under
    AWGN channel conditions with primary user interference. In Fig. 5, the underlay
    waveform is operating at −30 dB transmission power relative to that of the primary
    user. It can be seen that as the underlay waveform spectrally spreads its performance
    improves and approaches to the theoretical baseline at N=1024 . Fig. 5. Performance
    of Underlay NC-MC-CDMA BPSK as a secondary user. Primary to secondary user power
    ratio is 30 dB. Show All The second scenario also models the primary user as OFDM-BPSK
    consisting of N=32 contiguous subcarriers. In this case, the underlay spread length
    is fixed to N=512 and the secondary to primary power ratio is set at −20 dB. In
    the previous scenario there was just one single primary user in the entire underlay
    spread bandwidth, where as in this case the entire bandwidth is populated with
    multiple primary users, each operating over 32 subcarriers. It is evident from
    Fig. 6 that as number of primary users increases underlay performance goes down,
    prompting the underlay to use other means such as spread further or add channel
    coding to improve the performance. Fig. 6. Performance of underlay NC-MC-CDMA
    BPSK as a secondary user in the presence multiple primary users. Show All Results
    in Fig. 7 enable a comparison of theoretical and simulated BER performance for
    a secondary user using an underlay waveform. Figure 7 shows results when the secondary
    user''s transmission power is 30 dB lower than that of the primary user. In Figure
    7, the solid lines represent the theoretical BER performance of the secondary
    user specified by (39), the circles represent the simulation results when the
    secondary user spreads to N=256 subcarriers, the stars represent the simulation
    results when the secondary user spreads to N=512 subcarriers, and the squares
    represent the case of N=1024 subcarriers. As seen in these figures, the simulation
    results are well predicted by the theoretical analysis presented in Section V.

    BER performance and the simulation results of the secondary user using underlay

    same transmission power and each primary user occupies 32 subcarriers. The solid
    lines in Fig. 8 represent the theoretical curves, the circles represent the simulation
    results when one primary user is present, the stars represent the simulation results
    with two primary users, the squares represent the simulation results with four
    primary users, and the diamonds represent the simulation result with eight primary
    users. It is evident from these curves that the simulation results perfectly match
    the theoretical analysis described in Section V. Fig. 8. Comparing analytic with
    simulated results for underlay secondary user performance with multiple primary
    users. Show All C. Overlay/Underlay Simulation Results To maximize both spectrum
    efficiency and channel capacity, we have to take advantage of both unused and
    underused portion of the spectrum. In this section we demonstrate performance
    enhancement utilizing both unused and underused spectrum using a hybrid underlay/overlay
    waveform. The block diagram representation in Fig. 9 illustrates the conceptual
    view of the hybrid overlay/underlay approach. Systematic block channel coding
    is introduced to demonstrate the performance improvement gained by combining overlay
    and underlay techniques. Two popular block codes, namely a (7,4) Hamming code
    with t=1 error correction capability and a (15,5) BCH code with t=3 error correction
    capability were chosen for demonstration purposes. In general, channel coding
    improves performance by adding redundant or parity bits. For a given communication
    system this translates into increased transmission bandwidth or a decrease in
    effective data rate. For example, a fixed bandwidth overlay system experiences
    a k/n reduction in effective date rate where k and n represent the number of output
    encoded and input information bits, respectively. Fig. 9. Block diagram of hybrid
    overlay/underlay technique using channel coding. Show All However, in the proposed
    hybrid overlay/underlay system shown in Fig. 9, the information bits are transmitted
    using an overlay waveform (over unused frequency bands) while the redundant bits
    are transmitted using an underlay waveform (over underused frequency bands). Thus,
    both unused and underused frequency bands are exploited. When compared with a
    pure overlay system, the hybrid overlay/underlay system achieves channel coding
    gain without sacrificing data rate. More importantly, the hybrid overlay/underlay
    system possesses an increased degree of flexibility in receiver design: if preferred,
    no channel decoding has to be implemented and the receiver could simply demodulate
    the data from the overlay transmission; on the other hand, with channel decoding
    implemented the overlay/underlay receiver can significantly improve performance.
    Figure 10 shows the simulation results of overlay and overlay/underay concept
    illustrated in Fig. 9. The top solid line represents the OFDM-BPSK overlay system
    without channel coding. The bottom two solid lines represents OFDM-BPSK overlay
    systems using H(7,4) and BCH(15,5) channel coding respectively. The dashed lines
    represent the overlay/underlay combinations. The underlay waveform spread length
    was at N=512 . It is evident from results in the figure that applying channel
    coding improves performance significantly but at the cost of reduced effective
    data rate. Performance of the proposed overlay/underlay system approaches that
    of the channel coded overlay system without experiencing the reduced data rate.
    Fig. 10. Performance of hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms in AWGN channel Show
    All SECTION VI. Conclusion To improve spectrum efficiency and maximize channel
    capacity both unused (white) and underused (gray) spectral regions need to be
    exploited. Using a previously developed SMSE framework based on hard decision
    spectrum usage, an extended soft decision SMSE framework (SD-SMSE) is presented
    for physical layer waveforms that are well-suited for “CR-based SDR” applications.
    Given an established set of SD-SMSE design variables, the “CR-based SDR” is capable
    of dynamically generating overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms
    based on a user requirements. Each of these three waveforms were evaluated using
    the SD-SMSE framework in a CR context under AWGN channel conditions. In general,
    the underlay-CR waveform is associated with UWB technology. However, results here
    demonstrate that the underlay-CR waveform is able to adapt its bandwidth based
    on user requirements and environmental conditions. It was also demonstrated that
    the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform can be used to improve spectrum efficiency.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chicago, IL, USA SECTION II. Introduction
    With an ever increasing demand for higher data rates, coupled with an increase
    in new applications and the number of users, spectrum crowding and congestion
    continue to increase. At first glance by looking at the FCC''s fully allocated
    spectrum chart it seems like there is a spectrum scarcity [1]. Recent studies
    have suggested that spectrum congestion is mainly due to the inefficient use of
    the spectrum rather than its scarcity [2]. Two terminologies, namely Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR), are used within the research community
    in the context of improved spectrum efficiency. Fig. 1. Dynamic Spectrum Access
    scenarios [3], [4]. Show All As illustrated in Fig. 1, each DSA approach can be
    broadly categorized as being based on one of three models, including 1) dynamic
    exclusive use, 2) spectrum commons (open sharing) or 3) hierarchical access [3],
    [4]. The dynamic exclusive model basically follows the present policy and regulations.
    Spectrum property rights and dynamic spectrum allocation are two methods introduced
    within this model to add flexibility for spectrum efficiency. Under spectrum property
    rights, a primary user (licensee) is allowed to sell and/or trade spectrum and
    can choose the technology. Under dynamic spectrum allocation which was introduced
    by the European DRiVE project, the goal is to improve spectrum efficiency via
    dynamic spectrum assignment utilizing spatial and temporal statistics of various
    users. The open sharing model, which is also known as spectrum commons, employs
    sharing among peers as the basis to manage a spectrum region. This model basically
    gains support from the success of wireless services operating in the unlicensed
    industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band. Finally, under the hierarchical
    access model interactions between primary and secondary users are considered to
    achieve spectrum efficiency. The basic idea here is to open up the licensed spectrum
    to secondary users while inducing minimum acceptable interference to the primary
    users. Spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay are two approaches under consideration
    to accomplish this. Spectrum overlay allows unlicensed secondary users to utilize
    unused spectrum simultaneously with primary users on a non-interference basis.
    This overlay approach was first adopted by [5] and subsequently researched under
    DARPA''s Next Generation (XG) program as an “opportunistic spectrum access” approach.
    Similarly, spectrum underlay allows unlicensed secondary users to simultaneously
    operate in primary user bands but under strict transmit power constraints. Of
    all the spectrum access models presented, the hierarchical access model is perhaps
    the most compatible with current FCC policies and legacy wireless systems. As
    proposed in [2], [6], CR technology fits within the hierarchical access method.
    Even though the present CR definition only considers overlay approaches, the research
    trend suggests that a hybrid technique combining overlay/underlay concepts can
    be employed to maximize spectral efficiency by using both white and gray spectral
    regions [3], [7]. Therefore, we can further categorize CR as being either overlay-CR
    or underlay-CR depending on the spectral region being used. The choice of physical
    layer transmission is very important in CR implementation. Multi-carrier modulations
    such as OFDM and MC-CDMA are hailed as promising candidates [8] for realizing
    CR applications. To satisfy high data rate requirements, improve spectrum efficiency
    and at the same time avoid interference to primary and other secondary users,
    non-contiguous multi-carrier waveforms have been proposed [9], [10], [11], [12].
    Software Defined Radio (SDR) is another promising DSA enabling technology where
    the radio transceivers perform baseband processing in software. SDR has the ability
    to quickly reconfigure its operating parameters, which is a fundamental requirement
    in the CR scenarios. The synergistic union of these two DSA technologies is termed
    “CR-based SDR”. That is, the SDR provides the software controlled communication
    vehicle (core technology for air interface and waveform generation), the control
    and application of which is based on CR principles guided by spectral monitoring
    to achieve efficient spectrum usage [13]. Driven by SDR principles, a general
    analytic framework was developed to encompass a myriad of multi-carrier signals.
    The framework is applicable to a broad class of signals that are called Spectrally
    Modulated, Spectrally Encoded (SMSE) signals [13], [14], [15]. Depending on CR
    user needs various multi-carrier waveforms can be generated, e.g., OFDM, MC-CDMA,
    CI/MC-CDMA or TDCS, using this SMSE framework. Since this original SMSE framework
    employed hard decision frequency allocation, its applicability is limited to overlay-CR
    signals. To extend its applicability and maximize spectrum efficiency by utilizing
    both unused and underused regions, a soft decision SMSE (SD-SMSE) framework was
    subsequently developed to realize overlay-CR, underlay-CR and hybrid over-lay/underlay
    CR signals [16]. The remainder of this paper presents a brief overview of the
    SMSE framework followed by a more detailed description of the extended SD-SMSE
    framework and its components. The design of overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay
    waveforms that are suitable for a “CR-based SDR” platform are then presented.
    Each of these three waveform designs are evaluated via simulation in the context
    of CR applicability. SECTION III. Original SMSE Overlay Framework Previous work
    provides a general analytic framework for SMSE signals and accommodates multi-carrier
    based CR waveforms [13]. Specifically, an arbitrary CR waveform can be expressed
    in terms of its amplitude (A) , phase (Θ) and frequency (F) characteristics. These
    three factors aid in SMSE waveform design through six design variables, namely
    Data (d) , Code (c) , Window (w) , Orthogonality (o) and two frequency allocation
    variables. An in-depth treatment of the SMSE analytic development and the family
    of SMSE waveforms is provided in [13]. The coding, c = [ c 1 , c 2 ,…, c N f ],
    c i  ∈ C , data modulation, d = [ d 1 , d 2 ,…, d N f ], d i  ∈ C , and windowing
    function, w = [ w 1 , w 2 ,…, w N f ], w i  ∈ C account for component-by-component
    amplitude and/or phase variations. A phase only variable ∅=[ o 1 , o 2 ,…, o N
    f ], o i  ∈ C is used for orthogonality between symbol streams and to facilitate
    multiple access. The analytic SMSE framework development begins by considering
    data, code and window variables. The m th frequency component of the k th symbol
    is given by: S k [m]= c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m ) (1) View Source
    where m=0,1,…, N F −1 is the frequency index and c m , d m are magnitude and phase
    design variables. The expression in (1) is next modified to incorporate frequency
    and orthogonality variables. Frequency component selection is a function of two
    factors, including an available variable a = [ a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N f ],  a i  ∈
    {0,1} and a use variable u = [ u 1 , u 2 ,…, u N f ],  u i  ∈ {0,1} . Given an
    N f -point fast Fourier transform (FFT) process, N f frequency components or spectral
    bands are initially available. It is important to note that the frequency assignment
    takes on binary values 0 or 1 indicating the availability of the spectrum for
    secondary users. As a direct result, this pool of frequencies is reduced by component
    selection to create a number of CR available frequencies and usable frequencies.
    The m th component of the k th CR symbol corresponds to S k [m] =  a m u m c m
    d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) (2) View Source where the product
    a i u i  ∈ {0,1} . The discrete time domain SMSE waveform is obtained by taking
    the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of (2): s k [n]  =  1 N f Re{ ∑
    m=0 N f −1 a m u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o
    m,k ) } (3) View Source . where t k  ≤  t n  ≤  t k + T sym ,  f m = f c +mΔf
    , and Δf is the frequency resolution [13]. SECTION IV. Extended Overlay/Underlay
    SD-SMSE Framework The original SMSE framework provides a unified expression for
    generating and implementing a host of multi-carrier type waveforms (e.g., OFDM,
    MC-CDMA, CI/OFDM, TDCS, etc) and satisfies current CR goals of exploiting unused
    spectral bands. However, it does not exploit underused spectrum. This section
    re-visits the original SMSE framework development and the frequency assignment
    variables to exploit both unused and underused spectrum to generate both overlay
    and underlay type waveforms. Fig. 2 illustrates a conceptual view of the unused
    and underused spectrum utilization using an arbitrary interfernce threshold (IT).
    IT is assumed to be a limit set forth by the primary users based on the measured
    power spectrum density in a given bandwidth. Two cases of under utilized spectrum
    are demonstrated: 1) when the spectral assignment is based on a binary decision
    the bands adjacent to the primary users are unavailable to overlay CR users and
    2) primary users bands below the IT are unavailable to CR users as well. A soft
    decision CR (SDCR) will be able to exploit these underused frequency bands to
    increase channel capacity and improve performance. To support the envisioned SDCR
    system, the original SMSE framework is extended to account for both unused and
    underused frequency bands. Fig. 2. Identification of primary users, unused and
    underused spectral region. Show All We first illustrate the proposed SD-SMSE framework
    using Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, then re-define the design variables to extend the SMSE
    expression to account for both unused and underused spectrum. Fig. 3a and Fig.
    3b show how the current CR framework identifies the used and unused spectrum based
    on binary decisions. Fig. 3c shows the weighted spectrum estimation resulted from
    spectrum sensing block in Fig. 4. The weighted spectrum estimate (WSE) (a) is
    further processed taking into account inputs from the IT estimator, primary users,
    other secondary users requirements and channel conditions. Specifically, the weighted
    spectrum estimate provides a metric on the allowable transmission power density
    at each and every frequency component in the entire bandwidth. Hence, the WSE
    divides the entire bandwidth into unused (u) and underused (b) frequency components
    and both the unused and underused spectrum can be exploited. Notice in Fig. 3
    that different underused frequency components have different allowable CR transmission
    power densities. It is envisioned that any CR-based SDR will have the option to
    choose overlay, underlay or hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms to improve performance
    depending on the scenario, situation and need. Fig. 3. Spectrum parsing using
    weighted spectrum estimation in realization of SD-SMSE waveform. Show All Fig.

    step in SD-SMSE framework development is to re-examine the design variables in
    the original SMSE framework. For the SD-SMSE development, frequency related factors
    are termed primary variables while amplitude and phase related factors are termed
    secondary vari-ables. Since the objective here is to optimize the spectrum usage,
    only frequency components related design variables are considered. From this point
    forward the SD-SMSE framework development is based on the scenario depicted in
    Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3c, the weighted spectrum estimate represents all frequency
    components which can be utilized for secondary user applications. It is represented
    by variable a with the range changed from binary values (hard decision) to real
    values (soft decision), i.e.: a = [ a 0 , a 1 ,…, a N f −1 ],0≤ a m ≤1 (4) View
    Source From the weighted spectrum estimate a , the unused spectrum vector u can
    be derived as u = [ u 0 , u 1 ,…, u N f −1 ] (5) View Source where, u m ={ 1 0
    if a m =1 else m=0,1,⋯ N f −1 (6) View Source The original SMSE hard decision
    CR design transmits over the unused spectrum specified by u . We now introduce
    a new variable b to account for the underused spectrum, i.e., b = [ b 0 , b 1
    ,…, b N f −1 ] (7) View Source where, b m ={  0   a m  if a m =1 else m=0,1,⋯
    N f −1 (8) View Source Note that when a m =1 the value of b m =0 , because when
    a m =1 the spectral component is termed as unused and is assigned to u m . It
    is obvious that if a particular frequency component is underused, it cannot also
    be accounted as unused and vice versa, i.e., u m =0 if b m >0 and b m =0 if u
    m =1 . The remaining waveform design variables, i.e., code (c) , data (d) , window
    (w) and orthogonality (o) , remain unchanged from the original SMSE framework.
    Applying all these design variables, the m th component of the k th data symbol
    of the SD-SMSE can be expressed as S k [m] =  a m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k +
    θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) ={ u m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o
    m,k )   b m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) ifm=1 else (9)
    View Source The expression in (9) can be decomposed into unused and underused
    SMSE waveform representing the new SDCR architecture shown in Fig. 4. Applying
    the IDFT to (9) results in the discrete time domain waveform given by: S k [n]
    =  1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 a m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m +
    θ w m +θ o m,k ) } S k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f
    m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } + 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 b m c m
    d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } (10) (11) View
    Source where the first summation represents the unused frequency components and
    the second summation accounts for the underused frequency components. The SMSE
    expression in (11) was demonstrated by applying it to a number of OFDM based multi-carrier
    signals [13]. The process of generating these waveforms can be viewed as a two
    step approach 1) generating the frequency related primary variables and 2) applying
    the secondary variables such as the code, data modulation, windowing and orthogonality
    to the frequency vector. Since the SD-SMSE only focuses on manipulating the primary
    variables, all the OFDM based multi-carrier modulations expression such as NC-OFDM,
    NC-MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and NC-TDCS are applicable to both overlay and underlay
    scenarios. A. SD-SMSE Overlay Waveform Current CR techniques only employ overlay
    waveforms that exploit unused spectral bands. It is apparent that current CR transmission
    is just a special case of the soft decision CR when no underused frequency components
    are exploited. In the SMSE framework, if we force the underused variable b to
    be zero and the frequency assignment variable a to be binary: b=[0,0,…,0] a=[
    a 0 , a 1 ,…, a N f −1 ], a m  ∈ {0,1} (12) (13) View Source The second summation
    in (11) is eliminated and it reduces to current hard decision CR overlay: s k
    [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 u m c m d m,k w m  e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c
    m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } (14) View Source . B. SD-SMSE Underlay Waveform Unlike
    the overlay waveforms which only operate in the unused bands of the spectrum,
    the underlay waveform operates in the underused portions of the spectrum. An underlay
    waveform spreads its signal over a wide bandwidth to minimize its interference
    to the existing primary users and also to achieve the required processing gain
    to improve its performance. In general, UWB technology has been associated with
    underlay approaches. By definition, a signal is defined as UWB if it occupies
    a bandwidth that is greater than 500 MHz. Therefore, not all underlay waveforms
    are UWB by this definition. For example, a low data rate underlay waveform used
    as a control channel might only require a few MHz of bandwidth. In the SD-SMSE
    context, UWB is a special implementation of an underlay waveform. An UWB transmission
    uses underlay waveform which operates across all spectral components but minimizes
    its interference by limiting its transmission power spectral density to avoid
    interference to all primary users. Hence, its transmission power spectral density
    is determined by the primary user who is most sensitive to interference. In this
    case, all frequency components are treated as underused components. Hence, by
    setting u=[0,0,…,0] b=[K,K,…,K],0<K<1 (15) (16) View Source we can eliminate the
    first summation in (11) and the CR underlay signal corresponds to a UWB transmission:
    S k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 K d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m +
    θ w m +θ o m,k ) } (17) View Source . where K is a constant obtained by taking
    the minimum value of the weighted power spectral density shown in Fig. 3. Note
    that b was assumed to be constant for simplicity purpose, in general each underused
    spectral components can have different spectral weights capable of employing adaptive
    baseband modulations. C. Overlay/Underlay In our proposed soft decision CR, the
    waveform achieves benefits of both overlay and underlay waveforms by taking advantage
    of both unused and underused spectrum. This is done by employing soft decision
    criteria at each and every frequency component while minimizing the interference
    to primary users [9], [10], [11]. The expression shown in (11) represents the
    hybrid overlay/underlay utilizing the SD-SMSE framework. SECTION V. Analysis of
    Overlay/Underlay Waveforms This section starts with the applications of the general
    SMSE and SD-SMSE framework to a number of multi-carrier modulations such as OFDM,
    MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS. It has been shown that these multi-carrier modulations
    can be easily adapted to a non-contiguous spectrum environment by de-activating
    undesired sub carriers interfering with the primary user bands [9], [10], [11],
    [17]. Performance of all three overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms
    is demonstrated via simulation under AWGN channel conditions. Perfect synchronization
    is assumed between primary and secondary user. Analytic versus simulated P b versus
    E b / N 0 is used as a performance metric to validate these waveforms. If the
    secondary user is perfectly synchronized with the primary user, there is no interference
    from the secondary user to primary user when secondary user employs overlay waveform.
    Hence, the performance of the non-contiguous overlay waveform secondary user follows
    the theoretical performance under AWGN channel conditions. As mentioned earlier,
    the primary focus of SD-SMSE was to manipulate the variables related to spectrum
    allocation. The secondary variables such as code, data modulation, windowing and
    orthogonality related to the amplitude and phase of a waveform are kept the same
    as in the original SMSE framework. Applying the secondary variables to the primary
    spectrum allocation variables results in expressions for OFDM and MC-CDMA as shown
    in (18) and (19). Similar expressions for CIIMC-CDMA and TDCS are shown in [13],
    [14] respectively. One of the main differences between MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and
    TDCS is the phase values used in the spreading codes. MC-CDMA employs binary phase
    coding whereas CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS use polyphase coding. S k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑
    m=0 N f −1 ( α m,k +j β m,k ) e j(2π f m t n ) } S k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f
    −1 ( α k +j β k ) e j(2π f m t n + θ c m ) } (18) (19) View Source Fig. 5. Spectrum
    response for scenario with non-contiguous spectrum available for CR users. Show
    All A. Overlay Simulation Results In current CR methods only the unused spectrum
    is allocated for secondary users. The overlay spectrum allocation scenario is
    illustrated in Fig. 5. The spectral bins having a value of 1 identify secondary
    user bands and the zeroed-out bins identify primary user bands. It is assumed
    that at any given time, 32 non-contiguous subcarriers will be available for secondary
    CR users. Performance of four non-contiguous overlay waveforms is demonstrated
    in Fig. 6. The results demonstrate that with perfect synchronization between primary
    and secondary users, non-contiguous waveforms such as NC-OFDM, NC-MC-CDMA, NC-CI/MC-CDMA
    and TDCS with BPSK and 8-PSK modulations, match the theoretical expressions of
    BPSK and 8-PSK, respectively, under AWGN channel conditions. B. Underlay Simulation
    Results A CR underlay waveform utilizes the underused portion of the spectrum,
    operating on top of the other primary user waveform. In the previous overlay case,
    since we assumed perfect synchronization there was no interference between primary
    and CR overlay secondary user. Whereas in the CR underlay case, primary and secondary
    underlay user will be interfering with each other causing performance degradation
    to each other. To get an insight and understanding of the mutual interference
    to each other, we have considered three scenarios. The first two scenarios examine
    CR underlay waveform with primary user as interference and the third scenario
    analyzes primary user performance in the presence of CR underlay as interference.
    Fig. 6. Performance of non-contiguous overlay waveform under AWGN channel conditions.
    Show All Fig. 7. Performance of underlay NC-MCCDMA BPSK as a secondary user. Primary
    to secondary user power ratio is 20dB. Show All In the first scenario, the primary
    user is modeled as OFDM with BPSK modulation using a contiguous 32 sub-carrier
    spectrum. The underlay waveform is modeled as MC-CDMA with BPSK modulation. The
    underlay waveform uses much lower power and will spread its spectrum while maintaining
    its own performance requirements and minimizing its interference to the primary
    user. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 illustrate the performance of an underlay secondary user
    under AWGN channel conditions with primary user interference. In Fig. 7, the underlay
    waveform is operating at −20dB transmission power relative to that of the primary
    user. It can be seen that as the underlay waveform spectrally spreads, its performance
    improves and approaches the theoretical baseline at N = 512 . Similarly, in Fig.
    8 the underlay waveform operating at −30dB relative to the primary user has to
    increase its spreading length to N = 1024 to improve its performance to come close
    to the theoretical expression. Fig. 8. Performance of Underlay NC-MCCDMA BPSK
    as a secondary user. Primary to secondary user power ratio is 30dB. Show All The
    second scenario also models the primary user as OFDM-BPSK consisting of 32 contiguous
    sub-carriers. In this case the underlay spread length is fixed to N=512 and the
    secondary to primary power ratio is set at −20dB. In the previous scenario there
    was just one single primary user in the entire underlay spread bandwidth, whereas
    in this case the entire bandwidth is populated with multiple primary users, each
    operating over 32 sub-carriers. It is evident from Fig. 9 that as number of primary
    users increases, underlay performance goes down, prompting the underlay waveform
    to use other means such as spread further or add channel coding to improve the
    performance. The first two scenarios examined the effects of primary user interference
    to the secondary underlay waveform. In Fig. 10 the effect of secondary underlay
    interference to the primary user is shown. As in the previous cases primary user
    is modeled as length 32 sub-carrier OFDM-BPSK and secondary underlay is modeled
    as MC-CDMA BPSK with length N = 512 , Orthogonal Hadamard-Walsh codes are used
    to support the multi-users using MC-CDMA underlay waveform. It can be seen from
    Fig. 10 that as the number of secondary user increases to 10 (at primary to secondary
    power ratio of −20dB) the primary user performance severely degrades and at that
    point the secondary underlay users drop their power level to −30dB to lessen interference
    to the primary user. Fig. 9. Performance of underlay NC-MCCDMA BPSK as a secondary
    user in the presence multiple primary users. Show All Fig. 10. Performance of

    technique using channel coding. Show All C. Overlay/Underlay Simulation Results
    To maximize both spectrum efficiency and channel capacity, we have to take advantage
    of both unused and underused portion of the spectrum. In this section we demonstrate
    performance enhancement utilizing both unused and underused spectrum using a hybrid
    under-lay/overlay waveform. The block diagram representations in Fig. 11 and Fig.
    12 illustrate the conceptual view of the hybrid overlay/underlay approach. Systematic
    block channel coding is introduced to demonstrate the performance improvement
    gained by combining overlay and underlay techniques. Two popular block codes,
    namely, a (7,4) Hamming code with t = 1 error correction capability and a (15,5)
    BCH code with t = 3 error correction capability were chosen for evaluation. In
    general channel coding improves performance by adding redundant or parity bits.
    For a given communication system this translates to increase in transmission bandwidth
    or decrease in effective data rate. Hence, the overlay system experiences a reduction
    in effective date rate by a factor of k/n where k and n represent the number of
    output encoded bits and input information bits, respectively. However, in our
    proposed overlay/underlay system shown in Fig. 12, the information bits are transmitted
    via overlay waveform (over unused frequency bands), and the redundant bits are
    transmitted via underlay waveform (over underused frequency bands). This way,
    we take advantage of both the unused frequency bands and the unused frequency
    bands. Compared to pure overlay system, the new overlay/underlay system exploits
    channel coding gain without sacrificing data rate. More importantly, the overlay/underlay
    system possesses an increased degree of flexibility in receiver design: if preferred,
    no channel decoding needs to be implemented and the receiver simply demodulates
    the data from the overlay transmission; on the other hand, with a channel decoder
    present, the overlay/underlay receiver can improve the performance significantly.
    Fig. 13. Performance of Hybrid Overlay/Underlay Waveform. Show All Fig. 13 shows
    the simulation results of overlay and overlay/undelay concept illustrated in Fig.
    11 and Fig. 12. The top solid line represents the OFDM-BPSK overlay system without
    channel coding. The bottom two solid lines represent OFDM-BPSK overlay systems
    using H(7,4) and BCH(15,5) channel coding respectively. The dashed lines represent
    the overlay/underlay combinations. The underlay waveform spread length was at
    N = 512 . It is evident from these results that applying channel coding improves
    performance significantly but at the cost of reduced effective data rate. The
    proposed hybrid overlay/underlay system performance approaches the performance
    of the channel coded overlay system without experiencing data rate reduction.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion To maximize spectrum efficiency and channel capacity, both
    unused (white) and underused (gray) spectral regions need to be exploited. Using
    a previously developed SMSE framework based on hard decision spectrum usage, we
    have presented an extended soft decision SMSE framework (SD-SMSE) for physical
    layer waveforms that are suitable for “CR-based SDR” platforms. Given a set of
    SD-SMSE design variables, the “CR-based SDR” will be capable of dynamically generating
    overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms based on users'' needs.
    All three SD-SMSE waveform types were evaluated in the CR context under AWGN channel
    conditions. In general, the CR underlay waveform is associated with UWB technology.
    However, we have shown that CR underlay has the ability and intelligence to adapt
    its bandwidth based on user requirements and environmental conditions. We have
    also demonstrated that the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform improves the BER performance
    without reducing the throughput. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This material is based upon work

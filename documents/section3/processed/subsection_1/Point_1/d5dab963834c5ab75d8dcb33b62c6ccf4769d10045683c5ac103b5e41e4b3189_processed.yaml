    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    40 mW/4 W 128 bit As can clearly be seen in Table 2, IoT wireless communications
    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    and content Highlights • Light intensity, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity,
    and air temperature were selected as input neurons. • A 4-8-1 back propagation
    (BP) neural network yielded the MSE equal to 0.00857724 and R equal to 0.98963.
    • Used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to simulate the shapes of a
    comb, fish bone and the letter H. • The drip irrigation pipe network in the H-shaped
    arrangement was more suitable for field crop irrigation. Abstract There is a global
    shortage of fresh water to meet the clean production of field crops. Water-saving
    irrigation can increase the production of field crops, but under certain conditions
    it can be overly water-saving and unsustainable, particularly in complex terrains
    in China where there is already a shortage of water resources. In light of the
    insufficient water resources and partial inequality in China, several investigators
    in China and abroad have researched irrigation nozzles and pumps, but there is
    little information on the impact of the environment on crop irrigation. The purpose
    of this study was to provide a fast and effective crop water demand prediction
    model to estimate the water requirement during the growth period of crops, to
    achieve the purpose of applying water according to the demand of the crops, and
    to optimize the irrigation network to determine the optimal network structure
    in order to reduce irrigation energy consumption in the process. Specifically,
    this study analyzed the environmental factors, namely, the soil moisture, soil
    electrical conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity, affecting the physiological
    water demand of field crops. Relevant sensors were used in the field, and environmental
    information was collected. This study used the collected environmental data to
    build a water demand prediction model based on the back propagation (BP) neural
    network. It also carried out optimized layout and hydrodynamic analyses of the
    drip irrigation network and identified the best pipe network arrangement. On the
    basis of the BP neural network, the remarkable R amount of 0.98963 was obtained
    for the water demand prediction model. The mean square error (MSE) value was 0.00857724.
    We also found that the drip irrigation pipe network in the H-shaped arrangement
    was more suitable for field crop irrigation than the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped
    arrangements. This study employed the common field crops in China as the research
    object, used the wireless sensing technology to obtain the field environment information
    quickly, and constructed a water demand prediction model with high prediction
    accuracy. Finally, this study realized the precise control of field crop irrigation,
    reduced the waste of agricultural water, and achieved sustainable field crop production.
    Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Field cropWater demand
    predictionIrrigation scheme optimizationPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Water
    is an indispensable element for crop growth. However, there are significant differences
    in the response mechanisms of field crops at different stages of growth and development
    to water (Chukalla et al., 2017). Presently, agricultural irrigation accounts
    for approximately 70% of total freshwater in the world, and this value is even
    higher in many developing countries (He et al., 2014) The annual agricultural
    irrigation water shortage exceeds three thousand M (million) cubic meters, and
    approximately one hundred M mu of irrigated area is not irrigated due to the lack
    of water in China (Li et al., 2014). On the other hand, the utilization ratio
    of irrigation water is low in China, and the effective utilization index of the
    entire region is less than 40% (Chen et al., 2014). In order to produce more food
    under limited resources, such as water and soil, it is necessary to achieve clean
    production by efficient water-saving technologies. To achieve precise irrigation,
    many investigators have tested crop water demand prediction methods. The fuzzy
    prediction method predicts water quality results to ensure the use of high quality
    water for crop production (Nadiri et al., 2018). The multi-scale relevance vector
    regression method decomposes the historical time series of the daily water supply
    into different scales to realize the accurate prediction of urban daily water
    demand (Eslamian et al., 2016). A parallel global optimization model was proposed
    to optimize the hyper parameters of support vector machine (SVM) regression and
    to provide accurate water demand prediction in a short-term range (Ghalehkhondabi
    et al., 2017). Although each water demand prediction method has its own advantages,
    there are disadvantages that cannot be eliminated under certain conditions. With
    the development of computer technology, artificial neural networks can effectively
    improve these situations. The artificial neural network is an algorithmic mathematical
    model that mimics the behavioral characteristics of animal neural networks and
    processes distributed parallel information (Taghavifar et al., 2016). The application
    of neural networks is mostly concentrated in the fields of urban management, meteorology,
    and resource monitoring. The data sources in these fields are relatively simple
    to obtain, and the implementation departments are sufficiently funded. The water
    company combines the neural network technology and a Fourier time series process
    to construct a near-real water demand model, which strengthens the management
    of the water resources (Brentan et al., 2017). According to the historical monthly
    rainfall and climate index, a rainfall prediction model based on a mixed wavelet
    neural network was established, which improved the accuracy of the monthly rainfall
    forecast in Australia (He et al., 2015). The Korea Meteorological Administration
    has established an effective deep learning neural network model using remote sensing
    satellite data, which can quickly realize soil drought on the Korean Peninsula
    (Lee et al., 2019). In cases of an irregular relationship between the input and
    output layers of the neuron, and a sufficient sample size of the training, the
    artificial neural network algorithm can completely solve the problem of the disordered
    relations in a wide range of fields (Feng et al., 2016). Because the farmland
    environment is complex and changeable, it is difficult to obtain environmental
    information, so the neural network technology is seldomly used in agriculture.
    This study used wireless sensing technology to remotely collect and transmit field
    environmental information and the BP neural network method to predict the water
    demand of field crops and to improve the shortcomings of the traditional BP neural
    network that employed the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm. Several studies
    reported improvements in the irrigation of field crops. Soil dynamics during the
    growth of each crop under conditions of reclaimed drip irrigation have been investigated.
    It was found that the shortening of the irrigation period and the increasing of
    the drip irrigation depth improved the crop yield and the efficient use of water
    (Lu et al., 2016). The overall irrigation uniformity of the irrigation system
    was also improved by optimizing the structural design of the nozzle (Ji et al.,
    2017). Combining photovoltaic technology with irrigation pump design, the problems
    of large consumption energy and low efficiency of the traditional irrigation pump
    were improved (Hossain et al., 2015). For studies on irrigation nozzles and pumps,
    it is very profitable to improve the irrigation of field crops, but there are
    issues relating to prolonged research periods and high promotion costs. This study
    will optimize the design of the most basic pipe network layout, explore the optimal
    layout form of pipe network, and improve the uniformity of irrigation. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Analysis of the water requirement law for field crops Wheat,
    maize, and rice are the main field crops suitable for growth in China. Crops at
    different stages of growth require different amounts of water. This is determined
    by the meteorological conditions, crop characteristics, soil properties, and agricultural
    technical measures in the current season. This study accumulated water demand
    data from field crops for each reproductive period from many years of research
    at the Tongzhou Experimental Station (39°42′14.44″N, 116°41′20.07″E). The experimental
    station was situated in a continental monsoon climate zone. It was affected by
    winter and summer monsoons, and it had the characteristics of drought and wind
    conditions during the spring, heat and rain conditions during the summer, bright
    conditions during the autumn, and cold and dry conditions during the winter. The
    annual average temperature was 11.3 °C, and the precipitation was approximately
    620 mm. The most widely used current crop water demand calculation was the Penman-FAO
    formula. This formula can calculate the crop water demand with standard meteorological
    data with high accuracy and good comparability (Liu et al., 2017). In this study,
    the water demand of the crop was estimated by the Penman-FAO formula using the
    previous year''s meteorological data recorded by the experimental station. The
    freshwater used for irrigation completely conformed to the water quality standards
    for farmland irrigation in China. The trend of changes in the water demand for
    the main field crops of spring wheat, summer maize, and summer rice are shown
    in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (246KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Changing demand of field crops for water. The changing demand of
    field crops for water showed an increasing trend, followed by a decreasing trend.
    At the early stages of crop growth, the seedlings grew slowly, and the water demand
    was low. After the growth of the plants and expansion of the root system, the
    water demand increased sharply, peaking at the middle and late stages of fertility.
    At the late stages of crop growth, the plant stems and leaves withered, and the
    water demand decreased. During the cold winter months when metabolic processes
    and enzymatic reactions were suppressed, the water demand was low. 2.2. Analysis
    of environmental factors in the field Crops have specific requirements, including
    light, temperature, water, fertilizer, gases, and other environmental factors,
    for growth (Biernath et al., 2011). In this study, the effects of these environmental
    factors on the water demand of field crops were analyzed in view of the fact that
    this information may provide new insights on improving crop production. Environmental
    factors that affected the water demand of field crops are shown in Fig. 2. Download

    Common environmental factors in the field. (a) Temperature indirectly affected
    the uptake of water by affecting leaf transpiration in plants. With increasing
    temperatures, enzymatic reactions accelerated, and the water demand increased.
    Only in this way can field crops meet the need for normal metabolic activities.
    Furthermore, the effect of temperature on leaf transpiration increased with the
    increase of water in the soil. (b) Water in the soil also affected the demand
    of field crops for water. Soils are graded according to their ability to retain
    moisture, namely, minimum humidity, maximum humidity, and optimum humidity (Jemai
    et al., 2013). At the most suitable humidity range, crop growth was robust. At
    the lowest and highest humidity ranges, enzymatic activity and plant growth was
    reduced or halted. (c) Light intensity is a manifestation of solar radiation.
    The longer the exposure time of the field crops to solar radiation, the higher
    the temperature of the crops and soil and the higher the rate of leaf transpiration,
    which increased the demand for water. Solar radiation also increased the kinetic
    energy of the water in the field crops, thereby activating the water molecules
    and increasing their diffusion. (d) Electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil is
    a measurement of the total concentration of soluble minerals. High conductivity
    was indicative of a high concentration of soluble minerals. Reverse osmosis occurred
    when the electrical conductivity of the soil matrix was too high, which replaced
    the water in the roots and turned the root tips dry or brown. Fluctuating moisture
    levels further worsened the high salt content, thereby causing serious damage
    to the roots and affecting their ability to absorb water and nutrients. (e) Other
    factors included the carbon dioxide concentration, wind speed, and soil pH. The
    carbon dioxide concentration induced a significant increase in the number of stomata,
    thereby increasing the rate of leaf transpiration and the demand for water. Wind
    speed increased the airflow, which intensified the diffusion of water molecules,
    the evaporation of soil water, and the transpiration of water from leaves. It
    also increased the demand for water. The soil pH affected the concentration of
    nutrients and indirectly affected the absorption of water by the roots of the
    field crops. 2.3. Study on the environmental factor acquisition and transmission
    scheme in the field Excluding the environmental factors that had little effects
    on the water demand of field crops, and taking into consideration the hardware
    constraints of the test base, this experiment used a sensor-integrated instrument
    developed by us to measure the soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, air
    temperature, and light intensity in the field (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res

    The collected environmental data was transmitted to the cloud server via wireless
    sensor technology, a general packet wireless service, and the Internet, which
    allowed the data to be viewed by real-time monitoring of the field environment
    (Xiao et al., 2017). The data transmission scheme was carried out using ZigBee
    and GPRS wireless transmission methods (Fig. 4). The ZigBee wireless sensor network
    used the 2.4 GHz direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) physical layer frequency
    band to support a rate of 250 kb/s in the air. If the transmission distance was
    long, it was expanded with multiple ZigBee routers. The GPRS wireless sensor network
    was mainly used for data transmission between the aggregation terminal and the
    server. The coordinator was connected to a computer through a wireless communication
    protocol, and the collected real-time environmental data was uploaded to the web
    terminal server. Download : Download high-res image (422KB) Download : Download

    test of the packet loss rate for sensor acquisition and transmission In the actual
    field layout, the environment was relatively harsh, and the long-term unattended,
    data transmission distance was far, so this study tested the remote transmission
    loss rate of the sensors in the experimental field. The test results are shown

    in Table 1, the sensor had a large packet loss rate in the months of March and
    April, and the packet loss rate of the soil moisture sensor and the soil EC value
    sensor reached 39.02%. At the test field, the soil moisture sensor and the soil
    EC value sensor were scattered on the ground and failed to be correctly inserted
    into the ground. After re-commissioning, the packet loss rate of the four sensors
    was significantly reduced, which met the stability and reliability of the wireless
    transmission requirements. Each sensor was arranged for eight in the field to
    ensure that the sensor was not contaminated and did not cause system errors. 3.
    Prediction model of water demand for field crops 3.1. Fusion processing of collected
    data Accurate and reliable data collection ensures the precise prediction of water
    demand in the field. Data is often discontinuous due to the variety and the large
    amount of data collected. The joint Kalman filter algorithm uses the principle
    of information allocation to realize the optimal synthesis of multi-sensor information,
    so that the entire system has both high precision and certain fault tolerance,
    which ensures the best possible performance. Therefore, we adopted fusion processing
    and used the joint Kalman filter algorithm (Fig. 5), which calculates the magnitude
    of the data immediately after the sensor node obtains the data (the data remains

    processing structure. After selecting the appropriate joint Kalman filter algorithm,
    the fusion process goes through three stages. (a) Setting thresholds for the environmental
    parameters: The optimal humidity for field crop growth was in the range of 50–70%.
    For example, the soil moisture content was measured, and the value was set as
    the threshold for data fusion processing. If the collected data was not within
    the threshold range, the targeted culling of the data was not fused. If the collected
    data was within the threshold range, the data was de-noised by the Kalman filter
    algorithm, and then transmitted to the end of the aggregation. (b) Constructing
    the joint Kalman filtering mathematical model (S. J. Majumdar et al., 2001): The
    local state of the filter was expressed as Eq. (1): (1) The local measurement
    was expressed as Eq. (2): (2) was the time-varying state transition matrix, was
    the state vector at time k, and was the system interference matrix. was the model
    noise vector. It was considered as Gaussian white noise with zero mean and a variance
    matrix of . In the formula, was the observation vector at time k, was the observation
    matrix, and was the measurement noise vector. The local filter algorithm was expressed
    as Eqs. (3), (4), (5), (6), (7)). (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Eqs. (3), (4), (5), (6),
    (7)) represent the recursion calculation method of the local filter. was the gain
    matrix at the moment k+1, was the filter value of the covariance matrix of the
    state vector at the moment k+1, and was the state filter value at the moment k+1.
    Eqs. (8), (9)) represent the main filter algorithms. Xm and Pm are the final global
    filtering values. (8) (9) (c) Reprocessing of the weighted average fusion data:
    After filtering the data, we used the weighted average algorithm to carry out
    the two data fusion. The weighted average method was expressed as Eq. (10): (10)
    zi was the data value requiring weighted fusion, wi was the corresponding weight,
    and y was the weighted average value, which was the final data transmitted by
    the soil moisture sensor. Utilizing the same data fusion processing process, the
    fused soil moisture, air temperature, light intensity, and soil EC values were
    obtained. The fused data were transferred to the server database to construct
    the subsequent water demand prediction model. 3.2. Construction of the BP neural
    network water demand prediction model based on L-M improvement To address the
    lack of irrigation quantity control in the planting of field crops, this study
    applied a more appropriate BP neural network method to predict the field crop
    water demand on the basis of the combined Kalman Filter Fusion processing of the
    multi-sensor acquired and monitoring data. In light of the shortcomings of the
    traditional BP neural network algorithm, which included a slow convergence speed,
    an easy to fall into local minimum, and a difficulty in determining the optimized
    network structure, we constructed an improved BP neural network water demand prediction
    model based on L-M algorithm optimization (Kermani et al., 2005). The objective
    function of the L-M improved algorithm was expressed as Eq. (11): (11) The gradient
    formula of f(x) was expressed as Eqs. (12), (13)): (12) (13) The weight adjustment
    formula of the L-M algorithm was expressed as Eq. (14): (14) In Eq. (14), e was
    the error vector, J was the Jacobi matrix of error for the weight differential,
    and it was a scalar. Upon its increase, it approached the steepest descent method
    with a slower learning rate. Upon its decrease to zero, the algorithm became a
    smooth harmonic between the Gauss-Newton methods. The BP neural network, which
    was markedly improved by the L-M algorithm, reduced the oscillation, increased
    the convergence of the network, and optimized the connection weights and thresholds
    between the layers. The improved BP algorithm that processed the flow by the L-M

    design of the BP network based on L-M improvement In this study, we used MATLAB
    to normalize the input data. On the basis of the normalized data range, the S
    and PURELINE functions were selected as the transfer functions between the layers,
    and TRAINLM was selected as the training function. NEWFF was used to establish
    the prediction model for the water demand of the field crops. The complete BP
    network design process is shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image

    The field crop planted at the Tongzhou Experimental Station in 2018 was mainly
    maize, and it was harvested from May 18th to September 24th for a total of 130
    days. Therefore, we used maize to construct the BP neural network structure. The
    light intensity, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and air temperature
    was collected and used as the neurons of the input layer of the BP network. Thus,
    the number of neurons in the input layer was four. During the irrigation test,
    the amount of irrigation water was determined according to the crop water demand
    calculated by the Penman-FAO formula. The water demand of the field crops was
    used as the nerve element of the output layer of the BP network input layer, so
    the number of neurons in the output layer was one. The data are shown in Table
    2. Table 2. Training sample of maize growth period (partial data). Collection

    141 68 1497 30.1 214 Because the sample training data had maximal and minimal
    values, the linear function was used to normalize the data to the same dimension
    in this study. The normalized formula was expressed as Eq. (15): (15) The sample
    values ranged from 0.1 to 0.9, and the reference value fell within this range.
    Thus, the TANSIG function was adopted to determine the transfer function of the
    input layer of the BP network. At present, there is no best method for determining
    the precise number of hidden layer neurons. Based on the Kolmogorov theorem, this
    study calculated the range of the number of neurons of the hidden layer in combination
    with the known number of input layers and output layer neurons (Ismailov, 2014).
    The verification was trained one by one in this range to determine the optimal
    number of hidden layer neurons. The initial calculation range of the number of
    neurons in the hidden layer was between 2 and 13. The trial and error method was
    used to determine the number of neurons in the hidden layer (Table 3). Table 3.

    and the mean variance was the lowest when the number of hidden layer neurons was
    8. Thus, the number of hidden layer elements in the BP neural network was 8, and
    the structure of the BP neural network with 4-8-1 in the process of maize growth
    was determined (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download :

    and 15% for training, test, and validation sets, respectively, and the network
    structure was trained until it was stopped by the best effect. The training performance,

    full-size image Fig. 9. BP neural network training information. Fig. 9 shows that
    the BP neural network model based on the L-M improvement had fewer training iterations,
    a faster convergence rate, and samples with smaller errors. The mean square error
    (MSE) value was 0.00857724, and the overall network structure training effect
    was good. In addition, correlation and regression analyses of the BP neural network
    model were based on the L-M improvement (Fig. 9(d)). The correlation coefficient
    between the BP neural network output and target output in the maize growth period
    was 0.98963, and the corresponding water demand prediction model in the maize
    growth period showed high precision. A new set of data verified the predicted
    and actual irrigation values. The collection time was from July 2, 2018 to July
    31, 2018. This period belonged to the jointing stage of maize, as the field irrigation
    time was longer. The field environmental acquisition indicators were light intensity,
    soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and air temperature, and they were
    collected at 10:00 a.m. each day. The new data was imported into the model for
    calculation, and comparisons between the water demand prediction value and the
    actual field irrigation value are shown in Table 4. The simulation results are
    shown in Fig. 10. To predict the water demand in the jointing stage of maize,
    the maximum relative error was 11.47%. The minimum relative error was 0.1%. The
    average relative error was 2.11%. The correlation coefficient R2 was 0.963. Thus,
    the predicted water demand was accurate and reliable. Table 4. New data collected

    prediction value and the actual field irrigation value of maize. In practical
    applications, the input parameters of the crop water demand prediction model were
    the environmental parameters of the field. The input parameters in this study
    were light intensity, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and air temperature.
    The output parameter of the model was the crop water requirement. In order to
    know the water demand of the crop in the next period, it was necessary to input
    the environmental parameters corresponding to the next time, so the field had
    to be equipped with the environmental data acquisition equipment. This will slightly
    increase the cost of crop production. Regardless, the established water demand
    model can be applied to areas with stable climates. For fields with too many climate
    differences or for those that are too far away from the experimental site, it
    will be necessary to re-collect the field data of the area for modeling to achieve
    the forecasted crop water requirement according to local conditions. 5. Optimization
    analysis of the irrigation scheme based on water demand forecasting 5.1. Irrigation
    process design Water is a physiological need of all field crops, and irrigation
    represents the amount of water applied to field crops. Theoretically, the amount
    of irrigation should equal the predicted water demand. Due to the hierarchical
    layout of the irrigation pipe network, there was a loss in irrigation, and the
    amount of water delivered to the roots of the field crops was smaller than the
    predicted amount in the field. The optimized irrigation process is shown in Fig.

    Fig. 11. Field irrigation process based on water demand prediction. The BP neural
    network water demand prediction model was used to calculate the predicted value,
    which served as the reference. The manual or automatic irrigation mode was selected.
    Taking into account the loss of head during the irrigation process, we set the
    irrigation amount to 110% of the predicted water demand based on expert or empirical
    values. For the manual irrigation mode, the irrigation volume was manually entered,
    and then the irrigation valve was opened. For the automatic mode, it was necessary
    to determine whether the current water demand value was greater than the historical
    water demand value. If the historical water demand value was greater, the irrigation
    amount was automatically generated, and then the irrigation valve was opened.
    If the historical water demand value was smaller, the system continued to compare
    the current water demand value with the historical water demand value. The status
    of the water volume predicted the value. The irrigation value was closed when
    the controlled irrigation amount was reached. 5.2. Drip irrigation pipe network
    planning optimization Drip irrigation is presently used in field settings. Based
    on the area and aspect ratio of the irrigated field, we scaled the drip irrigation
    pipe network structure and used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to
    simulate the shapes of a comb, fish bone and the letter H (Fig. 12). The three
    drip irrigation pipe networks were arranged on a flat field, and the water flow
    was under equal gravity conditions in the irrigation pipe. Thereafter, we analyzed
    the changes in the velocity and pressure of the water flow in the irrigation pipes,
    compared the energy loss of the three irrigation pipe layouts, and selected the
    best drip irrigation pipe network layout for planning and optimization. Download

    Three types of drip irrigation pipe networks. 6. Results and discussion Three
    types of drip irrigation pipe network layouts were selected for CFD analysis of
    the equal proportional scaling structure. The inlet speed was 3 m/s, the main
    stream diameter was 5 mm, and the outlet fluid conditions were set to static pressure.
    The tributary diameter was 3 mm, the eight outlets were numbered according to
    the distance from the entrance, and the mesh partition unit was a tetrahedron.
    The three irrigation units were meshed using ANSYS software. The meshing effect

    irrigation units were simulated using the (SST) k – ω turbulence model. The velocity
    vector was calculated, and the velocity cloud and pressure cloud maps of the water
    flow in the three layouts were generated (Fig. 14). The velocity vector direction
    of the comb-shaped pipe network was the worst and that of the H-shaped pipe network
    was the best. With regard to the velocity, the high-speed concentration area of
    the fish bone-shaped pipe network was the largest, and that of the H-shaped pipe
    network was the smallest. With regard to the pressure, the number of negative
    pressure zones in the comb-shaped pipe network was the largest, and that of the
    H-shaped pipe network was the smallest. Download : Download high-res image (355KB)

    of the eight outlets were linearly fitted and analyzed (Fig. 15). Fig. 15 shows
    that the slope and residual norm of the velocity fitting equation at the exit
    of fish bone-shaped pipe network was the largest, indicating that the velocity
    uniformity of the eight outlets was the worst. Furthermore, the slope and residual
    norm of the velocity fitting equation at the exit of the H-shaped pipe network
    was the smallest, indicating that the velocity uniformity of the eight outlets
    was the best. In terms of the pressure variations, the slope of the pressure fitting
    equation at the outlet of the comb-shaped pipe network and the residual norm was
    the largest, indicating that the pressure uniformity at the eight outlets was
    the worst. The pressure at the outlet of the H-shaped pipe network was 0, indicating
    that the pressure uniformity at the eight outlets was the same. Download : Download

    outlet velocity and pressure. For internal flow fluid and outlet velocity analyses
    of the three types of pipe network layouts, the velocity vector direction of the
    H-shaped pipe network was consistent, the high-speed concentrated area was small,
    and the number of negative pressure zones was also small, which reduced energy
    consumption during irrigation. At the same time, the uniformity of the velocity
    and pressure at the outlet of H-shaped pipe network was good, which better guaranteed
    the scheduled irrigation and improved its efficiency. Because the experimental
    field belonged to the flat terrain, the drip irrigation pipe network with the
    H-shaped arrangement was more suitable for field crop irrigation in the flat field
    area. For field crop irrigation in the hilly fields and hillside topography in
    southern China, the advantages of the H-shaped drip irrigation pipe network layout
    need to be verified. 7. Conclusion With the increasing demand for field crop production,
    the demand for agricultural water is gradually increasing. To address the issue
    of supply and demand, the Chinese government has promulgated the 13 No 1 Central
    Document, which requires water-saving irrigation as a major strategic move. In
    light of this, we proposed precision irrigation as a sustainable water-saving
    approach for the production of field crops in China focusing on water demand prediction
    and irrigation scheme optimization. This study showed that the remarkable R amount
    of 0.98963 was obtained for the water demand prediction model based on the BP
    neural network. The mean square error (MSE) value was 0.00857724. Thus, the model
    can be applied to regions with stable climates, and it has a good application
    effect. For fields with too many climate differences or for those that are too
    far away from the experimental site, it is necessary to re-collect the field data
    of the area for modeling to achieve the forecasted crop water requirement according
    to local conditions. The velocity vector direction of the H-shaped pipe network
    was consistent, and the high-speed concentrated area and the negative pressure
    zones were small, which reduced energy consumption during irrigation. The uniformity
    of the velocity and pressure at the outlet of H-shaped pipe network was good,
    indicating that it could better guarantee the scheduled irrigation effect and
    improve the irrigation efficiency. It can be applied to flat terrains in most
    parts of China. For field crop irrigation in the hilly fields and hillside topography
    in southern China, the advantages of H-shaped drip irrigation pipe network layout
    need to be verified. How to make use of the limited farmland to meet the increasing
    food demand of mankind at the lowest environmental cost is key to solving today''s
    problem of food scarcity in the world. The application of the BP neural network
    and CFD technology has shown great potential in solving the problem of precision
    irrigation and pipe network optimization. The results of the optimal design of
    the irrigation pipe network obtained from the CFD technology are also exploratory.
    To achieve the clean production of field crops, further research should be carried
    out to evaluate the amount of application as well as to introduce advanced unmanned
    aerial vehicle, spectral, and image recognition technologies. Acknowledgements

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\
    \ Table 2 summarizes the list\nof sensors along with their functionalities which\
    \ can be widely utilized in the ﬁeld of\nprecision agriculture.\nTable 2. Sensors\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\

    \ Epic\nis shown in Figure 7. SensorNet platforms, like most embedded systems,\
    \ are tightly\ncoupled to their applications and this can also be incorporated\
    \ over parallel programming\nparadigm to enhance processing and reduce execution\
    \ time [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic\nis the support of prototyping and reusability\
    \ using composable hardware architecture.\nThe research and development of Epic\

    of Irene Mote was carried out at Computer Science Division, University of California,\n\
    Berkeley, in 2009 [163–165]. Figure 8 shows the pictorial representation and illustration\
    \ of\nIrene Mote.\nFigure 8. Pictorial description and illustration of Irene Mote\

    \ and is equipped\nwith a universally usable sensor and actuator platform [169,170].\
    \ Figure 10 pictorially\nrepresents the Preon32 sensor. Preon32 is incorporated\
    \ with Cortex-M3 controller which is\ncompatible with IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency\
    \ module. In addition, this module enables\ndevelopers to develop the wireless\
    \ module codes using an object-oriented programming\nlanguage like Java [169].\
    \ It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,\nUSB,\
    \ CAN, and SPI, etc. [164,169].\nFigure 10. Preon32 sensor [170].\nThe Mica2 Mote\

    \ of the second and third century. In combination with the CC1000/CC2420\nRF Module,\

    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    to the high-end sensor with similar measurement accuracy and better precision.
    The study analyzed the data using statistical analysis and mathematical formulas
    to assess the accuracy and limitations of the sensor device in measuring water

    suggest that the low-cost sensor can potentially serve as a cost-effective alternative

    \ for real-time monitoring of ﬁeld water level would greatly\nfacilitate the application\
    \ of alternate wetting and drying (AWD), an irrigation water management\ntechnique\
    \ proven to result to signiﬁcant water savings and reduced methane emissions in\
    \ lowland\nrice production systems. However, most of the commercially available\
    \ wireless sensors are generally\ncostly. This study developed a low-cost wireless\
    \ sensor that can perform real-time monitoring of\nwater depth and surface temperature\
    \ in lowland rice ﬁelds under an AWD irrigation regime. The\nsensor is composed\
    \ mainly of an ultrasonic depth sensor, a waterproof temperature sensor, a humidity\n\
    sensor, and a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller enclosed in a PVC cap that can be\
    \ mounted in AWD\npipes. The sensor was tested under laboratory, pseudo-ﬁeld conditions\
    \ and actual ﬁeld conditions.\nResults showed a relatively high degree of agreement\
    \ between sensor and manual measurements\nof water depth under all testing conditions,\
    \ with the error ranging from only 5.2% to 6.6% and\nRMSE of 5.0 mm to 13.5 mm.\
    \ The performance of the low-cost sensor also proved to be comparable\nwith that\
    \ of the high-end sensor, exhibiting practically similar measurement accuracy\
    \ and higher\nprecision. The wireless sensor developed in this study can provide\
    \ a low-cost alternative to the\nhigh-cost and high-end sensors and other commercially\
    \ available counterparts for efﬁcient irrigation\nwater management in lowland\
    \ crop production systems during water-scarce conditions induced by\nclimate change\
    \ and climate variability.\nKeywords: low-cost wireless sensor; alternate wetting\
    \ and drying; irrigation water management\n1. Introduction\nLowland rice irrigation\
    \ systems are known to consume a considerable amount of\nfreshwater resources,\
    \ comprising a 34–43% share of the world’s total irrigation water\nand 24–30%\
    \ of the world’s developed freshwater resources [1]. Rice cultivation is also\n\
    identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant source of methane emissions (CH4) due to anaerobic process\n\
    brought about by its ﬂooding nature, accounting for about 10% of the global non-CO2\n\
    emissions in agriculture [2]. In the face of climate uncertainties and hydrological\
    \ extremes,\nit is therefore imperative that we adopt efﬁcient water management\
    \ practices in countering\nwater scarcity issues to carry on with the production\
    \ of food staple of about half of the\nglobal population [3]. Among the many alternative\
    \ water saving techniques developed\nis the alternate wetting and drying (AWD)\
    \ technology, a form of irrigation management\nwhere the ﬁeld water level is being\
    \ brought to a water level threshold in the soil subsurface,\nwith 15 cm being\
    \ the safe maximum, before triggering another irrigation event [4]. The\nWater\

    Water 2022, 14, 4128\n2 of 17\nAWD has been proven to be effective in reducing\
    \ irrigation water consumption without\nsigniﬁcant yield compensations [5–7].\
    \ It was also reported to reduce CH4 emissions [8–14],\nand is therefore considered\
    \ as a promising option in mitigating global warming potential\nfrom rice cultivation.\n\
    Aside from the increased water productivity and environmental beneﬁts, the appli-\n\
    cation of the AWD irrigation has also been known to reduce labor requirements\
    \ with less\nfrequent irrigation [15], although the tradeoff brings about the\
    \ challenge in constantly\nmonitoring the ﬁeld water level, often done manually,\
    \ to ensure that the level will never get\nbelow the safe threshold. The advent\
    \ of sensor technology and its application in irrigation\nhas greatly alleviated\
    \ this challenge by enabling remote monitoring. Recent developments\nin real-time\
    \ monitoring of ﬁeld water level have aided farmers and researchers alike in\n\
    coming up with sound and efﬁcient irrigation water management plans and decisions.\n\
    Wireless sensors applicable for irrigation water management in rice ﬁelds have\
    \ evolved\nin recent years. Most of the previously developed sensors are capable\
    \ of monitoring ﬁeld\nwater level [16–19], together with soil moisture [20,21]\
    \ and other climatic variables [22,23].\nThe developed technologies greatly vary\
    \ in the usage of sensor types, communication\nprotocols, and system architecture.\
    \ While a number of wireless sensors have been devel-\noped, most of them are\
    \ costly, especially those that make use of high-end hardware and\ncutting-edge\
    \ technologies. Other sensor development studies of the low-end type, on the\n\
    other hand, did not include rigorous sensor testing or published sensor performance\
    \ results,\nthus failing to unravel potential problems associated with ﬁeld implementation.\
    \ Some\nother sensors are not user-friendly such that widespread adoption may\
    \ become a challenge.\nWith the availability of open-source software, different\
    \ sensor types and wireless communi-\ncation protocols, the opportunities remain\
    \ vast in coming up with a variety of options for\naffordable, user-friendly,\
    \ and effective monitoring systems for real-time water information.\nThis study\
    \ aimed to develop an alternative to existing costly sensors for real-time\nmonitoring\
    \ of water level in lowland crop production systems employing AWD. This\npaper\
    \ presents the details of the sensor development and rigorous testing under laboratory,\n\
    pseudo-ﬁeld, and actual ﬁeld conditions. Ultimately, the sensors developed in\
    \ this study\nare intended to facilitate the wider application of AWD in lowland\
    \ crop production systems\nin order to address issues of water scarcity and inequitable\
    \ water distribution induced by\nclimate change and climate variability.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\n2.1. Sensor Development\n2.1.1. Hardware\nThe sensor unit was enclosed\
    \ in a 4′′-diameter PVC cap that was mounted on top\nof a 4′′-diameter AWD pipe.\
    \ The low-cost sensor is composed mainly of four sensor\nmodules: HC-SR04 ultrasonic\
    \ distance sensor, DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor,\nDHT11 temperature/humidity\
    \ sensor, and the microSD card adapter module. Data from\nthe sensor modules are\
    \ integrated by the ESP8266 microcontroller which sends data to\nthe online database\
    \ through Wi-Fi. The sensor unit was also equipped with two Li ion\nbatteries,\
    \ a solar charger, and two mini solar panels. Figure 1 shows the connection of\
    \ the\nsensor circuitry.\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n3 of 17\nWater 2022, 14, x FOR\

    \ of the circuit, the Wemos D1 mini Pro was used. It is Ar-\nduino-compatible\
    \ and has 11 digital input/output (I/O) pins. It has a built-in ESP8266\nWi-Fi\
    \ module that enables the microcontroller to connect to the Wi-Fi network. With\n\
    this, the sensor data can be accessed via the cloud. A microSD card adapter module\
    \ was\nalso integrated into the circuit to contain data in a text file for manual\
    \ retrieval. The\nDS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor was used to monitor the\
    \ soil surface tempera-\nture that could handle the field’s day-to-night temperature\
    \ fluctuations very well. The\nsensor has a 4.7 kΩ resistor connected in parallel\
    \ between the power cable and data ca-\nble for the sensor to work properly. For\
    \ the measurement of the field water level, the\nHC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor\
    \ was used. Since the microcontroller has an operating\nvoltage of 3.3 V while\
    \ the distance sensor works on 5 V, voltage dividers were placed in\nthe form\
    \ of 1.2 KΩ and 2.2 KΩ resistors. This is to ensure that the output voltage coming\n\
    out from the echo pin is in the voltage level that the microcontroller can safely\
    \ handle\nAdditionally, since the Wemos D1 mini Pro board has a very limited number\
    \ of I/O pins\nthe distance sensor was configured to perform under a single pin\
    \ operation with the use\nof the NewPing library function. Accuracy of distance\
    \ readings was improved through\niterations. For the power source, one TP4056\
    \ battery charger was used to charge two 3.7\nV–2100 mAh 18650 Li-ion batteries\
    \ connected in parallel, while two IN5819 diodes were\nused to prevent backflow\
    \ current from the batteries to the solar panels. A 180 KΩ resis-\ntor was installed\
    \ between the analogue pin (A0) and 5 V pin to serve as a battery gauge\nThe voltage\
    \ readings of the sensor measured from the analogue pin were successfully\nvalidated\

    \ Since the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between\nitself and the target\
    \ surface, the reference elevation follows the relative height of the sensor\n\
    from the soil surface where it is being mounted. Thus, necessary adjustments have\
    \ to be\nmade to properly reﬂect the safe AWD depth threshold in sensor readings\
    \ with respect to\nthe soil surface. A 1 cm allowance was also given before the\
    \ safe AWD threshold to set\na grace time period between the time of warning and\
    \ the supposed irrigation schedule.\nAs for the battery, the voltage threshold\
    \ was set to 3.2 V. An even lower voltage level may\nalready compromise the sensor\
    \ performance since the Wemos D1 mini Pro requires a 3.3 V\noperating voltage.\
    \ And lastly, the alert system informs the user if a speciﬁc sensor has\nfailed\
    \ to send data beyond its expected reading time. Once a new sensor data has entered\n\
    the database, the script will log the latest datetime of entry and update the\

    \ After such, the script will\nevaluate if the current date and time has exceeded\

    \ setup was made from\nreadily available and low-cost materials. The 8 cm deep\
    \ soil was placed in a 6 L plastic\ncontainer with perforations at the bottom,\
    \ equipped with graduations on the side, while\nthe sensor was positioned on top\
    \ using a leveled platform. The container was placed above\na catchment basin\
    \ that was designed to accommodate the water percolation losses. See\nFigure 6a\
    \ for reference.\nWater 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n7 of 20 \n \n \nThe AWD\
    \ threshold level exemplified in the code, i.e., 15 cm, is the safe threshold\
    \ \nusually adopted in most studies. Since the ultrasonic sensor measures the\
    \ distance be-\ntween itself and the target surface, the reference elevation follows\
    \ the relative height of \nthe sensor from the soil surface where it is being\
    \ mounted. Thus, necessary adjustments \nhave to be made to properly reflect the\
    \ safe AWD depth threshold in sensor readings \nwith respect to the soil surface.\
    \ A 1 cm allowance was also given before the safe AWD \nthreshold to set a grace\
    \ time period between the time of warning and the supposed irri-\ngation schedule.\
    \ As for the battery, the voltage threshold was set to 3.2 V. An even lower \n\
    voltage level may already compromise the sensor performance since the Wemos D1\
    \ mini \nPro requires a 3.3 V operating voltage. And lastly, the alert system\
    \ informs the user if a \nspecific sensor has failed to send data beyond its expected\
    \ reading time. Once a new \nsensor data has entered the database, the script\
    \ will log the latest datetime of entry and \nupdate the next reading time of\
    \ the sensor by adding 1 h from the current date and time. \nAfter such, the script\
    \ will evaluate if the current date and time has exceeded the ex-\npected reading\
    \ time of the other sensors in the database. If a sensor has failed to send \n\
    data for several consecutive hours, manual inspection on the field site is therefore\
    \ rec-\nommended. \n2.2. Sensor Testing \n2.2.1. Laboratory Test \nThe setup for\
    \ the initial sensor testing was designed in such a way that the water \nlevel\
    \ sensor can capture the receding water level through time. The setup was made\
    \ \nfrom readily available and low-cost materials. The 8 cm deep soil was placed\
    \ in a 6 L \nplastic container with perforations at the bottom, equipped with\
    \ graduations on the side, \nwhile the sensor was positioned on top using a leveled\
    \ platform. The container was \nplaced above a catchment basin that was designed\
    \ to accommodate the water percola-\ntion losses. See Figure 6a for reference.\

    \  \nFigure 6. Experimental setup of the sensor testing under (a) laboratory condition,\
    \ (b) pseudo-ﬁeld\ncondition, and (c) actual ﬁeld condition.\nThe container was\
    \ periodically ponded with water of about 6 cm deep whenever the\nsurface water\
    \ recedes to the soil surface. Two low-cost sensors were tested consecutively,\n\
    with each test taking place for at least a week. Manual measurements were also\
    \ taken\nhourly, at the same time the sensor data is transmitted to the cloud.\
    \ Adequate manually\nobserved data were collected during the test run to achieve\
    \ decent comparisons. The test\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n8 of 17\nrun was performed\
    \ in an open space where the sensor can sufﬁciently access a reliable\ninternet\
    \ connection and experience no physical obstruction from sunlight. Sensor data\
    \ and\nmanual observations were then compared and plotted through time.\n2.2.2.\
    \ Pseudo-Field Test\nA 2 m × 1.5 m × 0.9 m micropaddy plot, as shown in Figure\
    \ 6b, was established to\nserve as a test site for the low-cost sensor. The plot\
    \ is situated inside the campus of the\nUniversity of the Philippines Los Baños,\
    \ with sufﬁcient exposure to sunlight, managed\nwith suitable pest control management,\
    \ and has adequate access to the water distribution\nsystem. The borders of the\
    \ micropaddy were completely sealed and made up of reinforced\nconcrete. The plot\
    \ soil structure was designed to resemble actual paddy ﬁeld settings.\nThe soil\
    \ proﬁle was composed of several layers: a 15 cm-thick loose clay soil at the\
    \ top,\nfollowed by a 30 cm deep compacted clay layer, and a 5 cm-thick gravel\
    \ at the very bottom.\nA drainage pipe was also equipped at the bottom corner\
    \ of the micropaddy box to enable\nsoil-water percolation, so as to simulate the\
    \ water level ﬂuctuations in the actual paddy ﬁeld\nconditions. The drainage pipe\
    \ also facilitated the release of excess water during excessive\nrainfall occurrences.\
    \ Two AWD pipes were installed in the plot. One was used for manual\nobservation\
    \ while the other one was for automated measurement. Prior observations\nsuggested\
    \ that the ultrasonic sensor no longer performs reliably when mounted on pipes\n\
    with lengths beyond 30 cm. This could most likely be due to the tendency of sound\
    \ waves\nto bounce off on the sides of the pipe. When the ultrasonic transmitter\
    \ is activated, the\nsound signal is being thrown at a certain beam angle whose\
    \ edges can get in contact with\nthe pipe perimeter. When this happens, the distance\
    \ measured is the traversed distance\nmade by the sound wave between the sensor\
    \ and the point of contact, which completely\nmisrepresents the ﬁeld water level.\
    \ Manual water level measurements were taken relative\nto the top of the pipe,\
    \ similar to how the low-cost sensor measures the water level depths.\nDuring\
    \ the implementation of the AWD irrigation, two sets of test runs were com-\n\
    pleted using two different units of low-cost sensors. One was performed during\
    \ the early\nwet season (June to July) while the other test was executed during\
    \ the early dry season\n(November to December). Each test run comprised about\
    \ 15 days’ worth of observation\ndata. Since the sensor is not ﬂood-proof, it\
    \ was elevated at 15 cm above the soil surface as a\nprecautionary measure. Despite\
    \ the occurrences of frequent rainfall and the application of\nmanual irrigation,\
    \ sufﬁcient drying cycles were achieved nonetheless to enable testing of\nthe\
    \ sensor performance under the AWD irrigation regime in this setup.\n2.3. Actual\
    \ Field Deployment\nThe actual ﬁeld deployment was performed in one of the paddy\
    \ ﬁelds in a rice\nproduction area located in Brgy. San Roque, Victoria, Laguna,\
    \ Philippines, situated 700 m\nfrom Laguna Lake. The area is characterized by\
    \ predominantly clayey soils, and has an\nintensive production of rice that is\
    \ regularly cultivated during the wet and dry cropping\nseasons. The rice ﬁeld\
    \ is irrigated using a shallow tube well (STW). The application of\nAWD is more\
    \ compelling in this system as the farmers can greatly reduce fuel costs in STW\n\
    pumping through less frequent irrigation during the dry cropping season. The ﬁeld\
    \ setup\nwas composed of a 14 × 44 m2 basin plot. Five AWD pipes equipped with\
    \ low-cost sensors\nwere evenly spaced along the plot’s middle horizontal transect\
    \ in line with the irrigation\ninlet. The manually observed pipe was installed\
    \ in a highly accessible location within the\nplot, about a meter away from the\
    \ bund to avoid measurement bias. A rain gauge was\nalso installed in the ﬁeld\
    \ to monitor water inputs in the basin aside from irrigation water.\nThe sensors\
    \ were set to read water level data for every hour using Wi-Fi, while manual\n\
    observations were made twice a day, i.e., at 8:00 am and 2:00 pm. A Wi-Fi modem\
    \ and\na 5 km-range Wi-Fi extender powered up by batteries were installed in the\
    \ pump house\nlocated 30 m away from the plot. The sensor deployment was continuous\
    \ within two weeks,\nexcept during the three consecutive days of a storm that\
    \ transpired within the experimental\nperiod. Figure 6c shows a photo of the sensor\
    \ testing done under actual ﬁeld conditions.\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n9 of 17\n\
    2.4. Performance Comparison between the Low-Cost Sensor and the High-End Sensor\n\
    After several test runs, the performance of the low-cost sensor was compared with\n\
    a commercially available high-end sensor (Submersible Water Level Transducer).\
    \ This\ntest was done under pseudo-ﬁeld conditions during the dry cropping season.\
    \ The high-\nend sensor considered was a submersible probe that estimates water\
    \ level based on the\nhydrostatic pressure. It was initially calibrated in a 1\
    \ L graduated cylinder by subjecting the\nsensor under different water level heads,\
    \ both in descending and ascending manner, until\na representative calibration\
    \ equation was obtained. The low-cost sensor and a high-end\nsensor were deployed\
    \ simultaneously in separate AWD pipes in the same micropaddy plot.\nA separate\
    \ AWD pipe was also allotted for manual measurements. Observation time lasted\n\
    for approximately 10 days. Several drying cycles were achieved in the micropaddy\
    \ plot\nover the observation period to generate sufﬁcient number of data points\
    \ for comparison\npurposes under both wetting and drying conditions in the micropaddy\
    \ plot.\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nThe performance of the low-cost sensor was\
    \ evaluated using various statistical indices\nsuch as percentage error, coefﬁcient\
    \ of determination R2, and root mean square error\n(RMSE). The distribution of\
    \ errors was also analyzed. Preliminary analysis using the\nShapiro–Wilk test\
    \ showed that the error distribution between sensor and manual readings\nwere\
    \ nonuniform in most cases. Thus, the Gaussian kernel density function (KDF) was\n\
    used in generating the probability curve of error distribution. Gaussian KDF estimates\n\
    the probability density function of random variables in a nonparametric way. The\
    \ mode\nwas used as a more appropriate representation of central tendency, which\
    \ was estimated\nby determining the maxima of the KDF curve. Other statistical\
    \ parameters used were\nthe standard deviation (σ) in assessing the data dispersion\
    \ and sensor precision, and the\narithmetic mean error (µ) in determining the\
    \ measurement bias.\nAdditional analysis was also made in an attempt to estimate\
    \ the optimum number of\nlow-cost sensors within the rice basin during the actual\
    \ ﬁeld test. The equation used was\nN =\n\x12CV\nε\n\x132\n(1)\nwhere N is the\
    \ optimum sensor density, CV is the coefﬁcient of variation of sensor values,\n\
    and ε is the maximum allowable percentage of error. This simple optimization equation\n\
    is similarly used in optimizing the number of rain gauges in a catchment basin.\
    \ The\nestimation of ﬁeld water level in a paddy ﬁeld basin and precipitation\
    \ in catchments were\ntaken in a similar context since both parameters are hydrologic\
    \ in nature, have perimetrical\nboundaries, and require at least a millimeter\
    \ range of accuracy.\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe following sections present\
    \ the test results under different conditions in which the\nsensors were subjected\
    \ in laboratory, pseudo-ﬁeld, and actual ﬁeld. To enhance clarity, the\nlow-cost\
    \ sensors were labeled with a number to identify the sensor unit being referred\
    \ to in\nthe discussion.\n3.1. Laboratory Test Condition\nResults from the laboratory\
    \ tests are presented in Figures 7 and 8. Sensor 1 exhibited\nerror of 3.28% and\
    \ RMSE of 0.46 cm, while sensor 2 had error of 6.62% and RMSE of\n0.42 cm. Correlation\
    \ between manual measurements and sensor measurements proved to\nbe excellent\
    \ for both sensors (R2 = 0.92 for Sensor 1 and R2 = 0.98 for Sensor 2). They also\n\
    displayed the same degree of dispersion (σ = 0.35 cm), signifying that both demonstrate\n\
    similar precision. However, the two sensors exhibited different tendencies when\
    \ estimating\nthe water level. Sensor 1 mostly overestimated the actual values\
    \ with mode Mo = −0.28 cm\nand mean bias error µ = −0.29 cm, while Sensor 2 mostly\
    \ underestimated the actual\nWater 2022, 14, 4128\n10 of 17\nvalues with mode\
    \ Mo = 0.29 cm and mean bias error µ = 0.24 cm. Even though the\nstatistical parameters\
    \ of both sensors were nearly identical in magnitude, both of their\ncentral tendencies\
    \ were on the opposite side of the error distribution. A closer examination\n\
    of the observed and sensor depth values from both test runs (Figures 7 and 8)\
    \ indicates\nthat Sensor 2 measured relatively shallow depths, between 3 cm up\
    \ to 10 cm, compared to\nSensor 1 with water level ranges between 7 cm to 16 cm.\
    \ It is important to note that the\nHC-SR04 ultrasonic water level sensor used\
    \ in fabricating the low-cost sensor measures\ndistances relative to where the\
    \ sensor is located. Since the sensor is mounted at the top\nof the container,\
    \ the reference elevation is the top of the container itself. Shorter sensor\n\
    distance values mean deeper water levels in reference to the soil surface, while\
    \ larger sensor\ndistance values imply the opposite.\n \nferred to in the discussion.\
    \ \n3.1. Laboratory Test Condition \nResults from the laboratory tests are presented\
    \ in Figures 7 and 8. Sensor 1 exhibit-\ned error of 3.28% and RMSE of 0.46 cm,\
    \ while sensor 2 had error of 6.62% and RMSE of \n0.42 cm. Correlation between\
    \ manual measurements and sensor measurements proved \nto be excellent for both\
    \ sensors (R2 = 0.92 for Sensor 1 and R2 = 0.98 for Sensor 2). They al-\nso displayed\
    \ the same degree of dispersion (σ = 0.35 cm), signifying that both demon-\nstrate\
    \ similar precision. However, the two sensors exhibited different tendencies when\
    \ \nestimating the water level. Sensor 1 mostly overestimated the actual values\
    \ with mode \nMo = −0.28 cm and mean bias error \U0001D707\U0001D707 = −0.29 cm,\
    \ while Sensor 2 mostly underestimated \nthe actual values with mode Mo = 0.29\
    \ cm and mean bias error \U0001D707\U0001D707 = 0.24 cm. Even though \nthe statistical\
    \ parameters of both sensors were nearly identical in magnitude, both of \ntheir\
    \ central tendencies were on the opposite side of the error distribution. A closer\
    \ ex-\namination of the observed and sensor depth values from both test runs (Figure\
    \ 7 and \nFigure 8) indicates that Sensor 2 measured relatively shallow depths,\
    \ between 3 cm up to \n10 cm, compared to Sensor 1 with water level ranges between\
    \ 7 cm to 16 cm. It is im-\nportant to note that the HC-SR04 ultrasonic water\

    \ One investigator claimed these instabilities to be due to the lack of monotonicity,\n\
    an occurrence of miscommunication between the components of the internal circuitry\

    \ since the\nsensor processor tends to miss out faint peak signals from the comparator,\
    \ resulting in\nlonger duration before the echo pin signal goes low. This anomaly\
    \ consequently results\nin longer travel time of sound, which further results\
    \ to overestimation of measurements.\nHowever, the range of critical values was\
    \ never established in the investigation. Having\nsufﬁcient time for the sound\
    \ waves to travel between the sensor and the target surface is\nhighly advised\
    \ in minimizing the occurrence of this anomaly. In this study, most of the\noverestimates\
    \ were observed in ranges above 9 cm, while underestimates mostly occurred\nin\
    \ even shorter ranges (less than 9 cm). Nevertheless, the sensor performance still\
    \ remains\nto be acceptable from the economic viewpoint. The performance values\
    \ of the low-cost\nsensor are also comparable to the water level sensor developed\
    \ by Xiao et al. [21] and IRRI\nand PhilRice [19], which they claimed to be also\
    \ suitable in paddy ﬁeld conditions.\nWater 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n12 of\

    Results of the pseudo-field test runs are presented in Figures 10 and 11. The\
    \ per-\nformance of both Sensor 3 (5.48% Error and RMSE = 1.35 cm) and Sensor\
    \ 4 (3.79% error \nand RMSE = 0.79 cm) proved to be reasonably acceptable with\
    \ respect to manual meas-\nurements. Both sensors incurred a very high R2 above\
    \ 0.97, suggesting an excellent corre-\nlation between sensor and manual measurements.\
    \ The modes of both sensors in the er-\nror distribution (−0.16 cm and −0.03 cm\
    \ for Sensor 3 and Sensor 4 respectively) imply \nthat the sensors mostly estimate\
    \ the water level at a high level of accuracy. Comparative-\nly, the statistical\
    \ performance indicators for Sensor 4 were better than for Sensor 3. The \nRMSE\
    \ of Sensor 4 may be deemed acceptable from the practical standpoint. However,\
    \ \nthe performance of Sensor 3 greatly deviated from the initial sensor test\
    \ under laborato-\nry conditions (RMSE = 0.46 cm, σ = 0.35 cm and RMSE = 1.35\
    \ cm). This may largely be \ndue to a relatively greater number of data points\
    \ collected during low water levels, \nwhich comprised a fine portion of the dataset\
    \ used to compare with the sensor values. \nFigure 10 shows an apparent pattern\
    \ of consecutive underestimation of water level val-\nues at deeper levels, which\
    \ is a complete disagreement from the observations in labora-\ntory tests. While\
    \ the internal circuit anomaly affects the sensor accuracy, the presence of \n\
    successive underestimated values is indicative of an involved systematic factor.\
    \ Albeit \nhaving Mo = −0.16 cm, the series of underestimated depths resulted\
    \ in the dispersion of \nerror on the positive side of the error distribution\
    \ plot, consequently yielding a positive \nmean bias error of 0.41 cm. This occurrence\
    \ may imply a possible problem posed by sed-\niment accumulation at the bottom\
    \ of the pipe in the actual field deployment, as had been \nobserved during the\
    \ implementation of the experiment in the micropaddy. The sedi-\nments may not\
    \ affect the ultrasonic sensor readings at higher water levels [23], but the \n\
    effect can manifest itself during low water level conditions. Unlike the automated\
    \ pipe \nwith a sensor on top, the free exposure of the manually observed pipe\
    \ to the atmospher-\nic conditions provide a faster rate of surface evaporation\
    \ with direct sunlight and free air \ncirculation, thereby reducing the residence\
    \ time of shallow waters suspended with sed-\niments at the bottom of the pipe\

    \ standpoint. However, the performance of Sensor 3\ngreatly deviated from the\
    \ initial sensor test under laboratory conditions (RMSE = 0.46 cm,\nσ = 0.35 cm\
    \ and RMSE = 1.35 cm). This may largely be due to a relatively greater number\n\
    of data points collected during low water levels, which comprised a ﬁne portion\

    \ of the\npipe may have also inﬂuenced the pipe recession, resulting to sensor\
    \ measurement offsets\nfrom the manual observations.\n3.3. Actual Field Deployment\n\
    The results of the performance of the low-cost sensors installed under actual\
    \ ﬁeld\nconditions are presented in Figure 12. Sensor measurements exhibited a\
    \ good correlation\nwith manual measurements (R2 = 0.75) and showed an acceptable\
    \ RMSE (0.90 cm). The\naverage error (5.22%) also did not differ largely from\
    \ the determined percentage errors in\nlaboratory and pseudo-ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ The mode from the error distribution (Mo = 0.38)\nsigniﬁes that the sensors\
    \ ﬁnely underestimated the actual depth in most cases, but the\noccasional overestimates\
    \ were relatively large enough to draw the mean bias error (−0.27)\ninto the negative\
    \ side of the error distribution. The error dispersion (σ = 1.15 cm), how-\never,\
    \ may be the combined effect of many elements, including the tendency of the sensor\n\
    itself to overestimate water levels at deeper depths, and the environmental factors\
    \ in the\nactual ﬁeld conditions. It may also be the reﬂection of slight water\
    \ level variation in the\nﬁeld, considering the relative distances and placements\
    \ of the sensors from one another.\nMoreover, a relatively low CV of 4.46% suggests\
    \ that the data variation is highly acceptable.\nUsing the same value of CV and\
    \ assuming a 10% maximum allowable error, the optimum\nnumber of sensors N for\
    \ the plot size considered becomes 0.20, which if rounded up to\na practical value\
    \ of N = 1 suggests that a single sensor is sufﬁcient to monitor the ﬁeld\nwater\
    \ level in the 14 × 44 m2 plot to generate at least 90% accuracy. It should be\
    \ noted,\nhowever, that the optimum N may also vary with microtopographic variations\
    \ and bund\nintegrity among other factors, along with the desired accuracy of\
    \ measurement. Further\ninvestigations are therefore recommended to establish\
    \ the relationships between N and the\naforementioned factors.\nWater 2022, 14,\

    \ sensor\ndeveloped in this study can be used in the analysis of water ﬂuxes and\
    \ water balance in\nthe ﬁeld.\n3.4. Performance Comparison between the Low-Cost\
    \ Sensor and High-End Sensor\nThe performance comparison between the low-cost\
    \ sensor developed in this study\nand a selected commercially available high-end\
    \ sensor was performed in the micropaddy\nplot to facilitate measurements. Results\
    \ are shown in Figure 13. Both sensors exhibited\nexcellent correlation with the\
    \ observed values (R2 = 0.96 for high-end and R2 = 0.98 for\nlow-cost sensor)\
    \ and relatively low RMSE (1.31 cm for high-end and 0.80 cm for low-cost\nsensor).\
    \ Results further revealed that both the low-cost sensor and the high-end sensor\n\
    mostly tend to reﬂect the actual water level, with Mo of 0.03 cm and 0.06 cm,\
    \ respectively.\nBased on the previous sensor tests done, these modes are exceptionally\
    \ accurate. However,\nthe two sensors exhibited different error dispersion, with\
    \ the high-end sensor (σ = 1.11 cm)\nshowing wider spread than the low-cost (σ\
    \ = 0.65 cm). The error dispersion of the high-end\nsensor resulted in less superior\
    \ performance (%Error = 6.86; RMSE = 1.31 cm) than the\nlow-cost (%Error = 5.16;\
    \ RMSE = 0.80 cm). The high-end sensor’s data dispersion may be\ndue to the extreme\
    \ sensitivity of the sensor to pressure changes, particularly in higher water\n\
    levels. The water turbidity may also have a direct inﬂuence on this sensitivity,\
    \ although\nfurther investigations are necessary. On the other hand, there is\
    \ still a tendency for the\nlow-cost sensor to underestimate water level on shallow\
    \ depths, with a local maximum of\n1.10 cm. Nevertheless, Mo = 0.06 cm remains\
    \ more dominant, suggesting a higher tendency\nfor accurate readings. While further\
    \ tests under actual ﬁeld conditions may be necessary,\nthe results from this\
    \ test under pseudo-ﬁeld conditions further prove that the performance\nof the\
    \ low-cost wireless sensor developed in this study is practically at par with\

    The use of noncontact-type sensors, such as the ultrasonic sensor of the low-cost,\
    \ in\nmeasuring ﬁeld water depths has the advantage in the paddy ﬁeld setting.\
    \ In contrast to the\nprobe type sensors, the low-cost sensor is not prone to\
    \ corrosion and hardware malfunction\ndue to sedimentation problems. This was\
    \ further supported by Chiu and Reba [15] in their\nﬁndings. The low-cost sensor\
    \ also makes use of less wires exposed outside of the sensor\ncase, thus it is\
    \ less likely to be damaged by ﬁeld pests such as rodents. The sensor is also\n\
    easy to use and maintain. The database system and alert messaging services can\
    \ also be\naccessed free for as long as the Wi-Fi connection is available. Affordability\
    \ is also one of the\nlow-cost sensor’s most distinctive advantages over high-end\
    \ sensors.\nWhile the low-cost wireless sensor exhibits several advantages in\
    \ terms of performance\nand costs, it still has a number of limitations. Firstly,\
    \ the low-cost sensor does not have a\nreal-time clock due to limited I/O pins;\
    \ hence, the data encoded in the text ﬁle have no\ndate and time stamps. However,\
    \ manual data sorting can still be done by holding on to\nthe logic of hourly\
    \ sensor reading and comparing the data log entries in the text ﬁle with\nthe\
    \ online database entries. Secondly, the low-cost sensor is Wi-Fi-based, which\
    \ makes the\nsensor range limited. Its application in rice ﬁeld areas situated\
    \ in off-grid communities\nwould therefore pose a challenge. Obviously, the low-cost\
    \ sensor, such as the high-end\nsensors, can only be effective in agricultural\
    \ areas with a power source and Wi-Fi or at\nleast signal extenders. Thirdly,\
    \ the quality of Wi-Fi connection in the ﬁeld may be affected\nby the rice canopy\
    \ if the low-cost sensor is not placed strategically in the ﬁeld. Fourthly,\n\
    the low-cost sensor is not ﬂood-proof, which makes it more viable to use during\
    \ the dry\ncropping season. These identiﬁed limitations could serve as a basis\
    \ for further research\nand development.\n4. Conclusions\nThe low-cost wireless\
    \ sensor developed and tested in this study can provide reliable\ninformation\
    \ of paddy ﬁeld water level in real-time to facilitate the application of AWD\
    \ in\nrice production systems. Laboratory tests and analysis showed that the sensors\
    \ developed\ncan generate accurate readings. The pseudo-ﬁeld test additionally\
    \ revealed the inﬂuence of\nsedimentation and pipe settlement in sensor readings,\
    \ causing measurement offsets from\nmanual observations. When applied under actual\
    \ ﬁeld conditions, the low-cost sensor\nperformed reasonably well from the practical\
    \ standpoint, in spite of several environmental\nfactors affecting the sensor\
    \ accuracy. The performance of the low-cost sensor also proved to\nbe comparable\
    \ with that of the high-end sensor, exhibiting practically similar measurement\n\
    accuracy and higher precision. Considering the low-cost sensor’s tested performance\
    \ and\neconomic edge, it can prove useful in the efﬁcient irrigation water management\
    \ in lowland\nrice crop production systems in developing countries, particularly\
    \ during the dry season\nand under water-scarce conditions as a result of climate\
    \ change and climate variability. Ulti-\nmately, the low-cost sensor can serve\
    \ as a tool for climate change adaptation and mitigation\nstrategies in lowland\
    \ rice crop production systems through the AWD technology.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction In China, at present, irrigation is carried
    out in many areas in the agricultural production process, and irrigation method
    is still dominated by diffusion irrigation, so the water resource consumption
    is very huge and the overall utilization rate is not high. Agriculture occupies
    a large proportion of water in China’s industrial and agricultural production.
    The total amount of water used for agriculture accounts for 70% of the country’s
    total water consumption. Therefore, it has become a long-term and arduous task
    to increase the effective utilization rate of irrigation water, improve soil environment
    and crop yield, and become the key to the development of agriculture in China
    at the present stage. With strong support from the government, some areas have
    begun to implement automatic irrigation systems, which play an important role
    in saving time, manpower and cost in agricultural production. At the same time
    automatic irrigation system also has the same outstanding contribution to the
    flower planting industry, the future application prospect is very broad. At present,
    people hope to have a green living environment, many people will plant a variety
    of flowers in the home, to achieve the goal of improving indoor air quality. At
    present, plant vegetable on the balcony also very welcome, such people can afforest
    the environment in the home again can eat the green healthy vegetable that oneself
    grows in the home. Yet the hectic pace of life often makes office workers miss
    out. Especially when we meet the holidays or visit the elderly relatives, flowers
    and vegetables are not watered in time, people often see a withered after returning
    from a long holiday. Therefore, people urgently need a self-made intelligent irrigation
    device to timely solve the irrigation problem of crops such as flowers and vegetables
    [1]. At present, the automatic control of irrigation system in China is still
    immature. In addition, the connection accessories and water valve required by
    the intelligent irrigation system are all substitute products, and the compatibility
    of the whole irrigation system is poor. In this design, the single-chip computer
    control system is added to the traditional irrigation system. Through accurate
    measurement to conduct watering, real-time soil moisture detection can be achieved
    perfectly, and the system can determine whether watering is needed according to
    the measured humidity. If the test results show that the soil is about to run
    out of water, the system will automatically start watering, ensuring soil moisture
    and keeping the plants growing normally. MCU is small in size, but powerful in
    function and very low in power consumption. It can expand various sensors for
    different control. MCU can carry out the development of various types. 2 Design
    Background 2.1 Development of IoT Technology The Internet of Things [2] literally
    means the Internet is connected to things. The Internet of things was proposed
    in this century, and the main principle is to connect other sensors via radio
    frequency identification (RFID) [3] to form a distributed network. With the Internet
    as the core, the world Internet of things is an extended application of the Internet,
    realizing multi-network communication and achieving the connection between things
    and things, people and things. With the constant development and maturity of IoT
    technology, IoT technology is called the third wave of the information industry,
    and is one of the greatest technologies in this century. At present, the development
    of IoT has been involved in all aspects of our life, including agriculture, education,
    medical care, transportation and so on. 2.2 Agricultural Internet of Things and
    Intelligent Irrigation Agricultural Internet of things (IoT) is a technology that
    brings convenience to agricultural production on the basis of the Internet of
    things, which is also a technology that technology changes the world. Agriculture
    is the foundation of human survival, and how to expand agricultural production
    is a research topic of tireless efforts of all countries. The growth of crops
    needs to be taken care of carefully, but the large area of farmland is difficult
    to be managed manually. At this time, the introduction of IoT technology can greatly
    improve the efficiency, reduce human cost and finally improve the production of
    crops. The development and use of the Internet of things has brought great changes
    to agricultural development, especially intelligent irrigation systems for farmland.
    The concept of intelligent irrigation have been proposed for many years, the main
    is a micro controller, sensor, automatic watering and other parts, is the collection
    many kinds of technology management system, at present our country’s intelligent
    irrigation system is still in the preliminary stage of development, a lot of technology
    is not mature enough, in recent years, some developed countries have been introduced
    into China the advanced irrigation control devices, but due to various factors
    such as high price, the maintenance difficulties, it is mainly used in institutions
    of higher learning, scientific research units and agricultural demonstration zone,
    and is not in conformity with the Chinese characteristics of the application of
    soil [4]. Therefore, it is very important for China to perfect the control of
    plant planting environment through scientific and technological means. It is inevitable
    for future development to replace manpower with low-cost and powerful control
    system. 2.3 Intelligent Irrigation System of Balcony Flowers Based on Internet
    of Things In the development of the Internet of things technology [5] and intelligent
    greenhouse irrigation systems, inspired by the ideas of the Internet of things
    and abstracted model of intelligent greenhouse irrigation system, the study design
    a set of balcony flowers intelligent irrigation system, using the sensor measurement
    of soil moisture and temperature, the proper irrigation by microcontroller control
    irrigation system, to ensure that the plant enough moisture is appropriate, the
    system can not only guarantee the optimal growth of plants, also can maximum level
    of saving water [6]. 3 System Design 3.1 Overall System Planning The intelligent
    balcony flower irrigation system based on the Internet of things takes MSP430F5438A
    single chip computer [7] as the core micro controller, including the lower machine
    part and the upper machine part. The lower part mainly includes information acquisition
    system and irrigation control system. As shown in Fig. 1, the information collection
    system mainly consists of soil temperature and humidity sensor and collection
    card, which is responsible for the collection of various data to prepare for the
    later control. Irrigation control is mainly composed of LED display module, electromagnetic
    valve, pump, MSP430 MCU module and GPRS module. The upper computer is mainly composed
    of server and client. Fig. 1. Overall system structure diagram Full size image
    3.2 Main Controller Microcontroller, namely microcontroller, is the most core
    part of the system design. Therefore, choosing appropriate microcontroller is
    the primary task of the design. At present, the most common microcontroller is
    the 51 series. Although the functions of the 51-series MCU have been very perfect
    at present, there are still some deficiencies. The internal hardware resources
    of the 51-series MCU are relatively few and the power consumption is relatively
    large. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the peripheral circuits to achieve
    the purpose of users. Based on the design for real-time acquisition of flower
    soil data, considering the actual power consumption and specific functions, a
    relatively low power microcontroller was selected for design. The manufacturer
    of MSP430 series MCU is Texas instruments (TI), a famous microprocessor company.
    MSP430 has the characteristics of ultra-low power consumption, and the power supply
    voltage is 1.8–3.6 v [8]. By compared with other microcontroller, MSP430 MCU integrates
    a variety of functional modules, including 3 16-bit timers, analog comparator,
    12 DAC, a 12 bit ADC, analog comparator, DMA controller and so on, also including,
    asynchronous I/O ports, I2C bus to accept/send device (UART), serial peripheral
    interface (SPI) three multi-function serial interface, the watchdog timer use
    watchdog (WDT) & constant ramp/LCD drive, USB hardware multiplier, 2 KB–10 KB
    of RAM, and a variety of the interrupt function. The single chip microcomputer
    can be programmed in time online. Only when the single chip microcomputer is connected
    with the JTAG simulator, the program can be simulated and debugged in time. This
    technology can save a lot of development time and improve efficiency for development.
    The program after debugging through JTAG can be directly downloaded to the FLASH
    memory of the single chip. The four wire system is adopted, and the specific pin
    interface is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. The interface way of JTAG Full size image
    3.3 Information Acquisition System 3.3.1 Acquisition Card DAM-3000 DAM-3000 supports
    the EIA-485 communication protocol, which USES the bidirectional balanced circuit
    standard to achieve true multi-point two-way communication. The DAM-3000 can connect
    8 different signal sources, support 8 different signals, read the voltage or current
    signal generated by the sensor, and convert the data that the user wants to measure
    through the 16 bit ADC on the DAM-3000, which satisfies the diversity of the sensor.
    The eight channels of DAM-3000 can be respectively set as different data acquisition
    modules, while one module can be achieved through DAM-3000, saving hardware costs.
    DAM-3000 is applicable to various working environments, and the working temperature
    of the product module is −10 ~+70°. DAM-3000 series of modules are all made of
    industrial-grade components, and the products can work at the limit temperature
    of −40 ~+85°. At the same time, 10–30 VDC power input range is provided, which
    has very high reliability and security, meeting the field needs of various applications.
    In addition, excellent control software is built into the modules, and users can
    easily use the software to control the system I/O modules. 3.3.2 The Sensor In
    normal growth of crops, air temperature and humidity, as an important environmental
    factor, play a very important role. Plants cannot grow without water, sunlight
    and inorganic salts, and the proper temperature is an important factor, but the
    growth of plant temperature and humidity are not fixed in a value, but there is
    one of the most suitable growth temperature, minimum and maximum temperature between
    a best temperature, in the best temperature range is most suitable for plant growth
    and reproduction of [9]. At the same time, soil moisture and crop can grow normally
    important environment factor, the soil humidity is small, if enough abundance
    of soil water content, then plants will have enough water to participate in all
    metabolism, especially the transpiration of water is plentiful, can moments for
    plants absorb nutrients from the soil, the growth of plants can be better. However,
    if the humidity in the air is too high in the environment where the plant grows,
    the biological activities inside the plant will be restricted, resulting in the
    growth limitation. If the relative humidity is too low, the soil will become dry
    and even the atmosphere will become dry. When the temperature is higher and the
    water is less, the plant will start its own protection system to protect the water
    in the body from evaporation and thus stop growing. In conclusion, we can understand
    how important temperature and humidity are to the growth of plants. Air temperature
    and humidity and soil moisture (also known as soil moisture content) are two important
    preconditions for automatic irrigation system. Therefore, a sensor for measuring
    air temperature and humidity and two soil moisture sensors for measuring humidity
    are designed in this design. The measurement sensor selected in this system design
    is a sensor based on FDR frequency domain reflection technology. High-frequency
    electronic technology is widely used in soil moisture measurement [10], and has
    become one of the most popular humidity measurement methods in the world at present
    due to its high-precision and high-sensitivity characteristics [11]. Its measurement
    distance is that electromagnetic pulse will have different frequency in soil with
    different water content, and the proportion of water in the total volume can be
    obtained by measuring the frequency, so as to reflect the soil moisture and measure
    the volume percentage of soil moisture, so as to obtain the soil temperature and
    humidity status through the inversion of a certain corresponding relation. 3.4
    GPRS Signal Transmission Module GPRS communication technology relative to its
    bricks and networking communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, radio
    frequency communication technology such as RF and WIFI, GPRS communication technology
    the most suitable for use in a sudden, intermittent or frequent small amounts
    of data transmission, and the communication technology to support the data transfer
    rate will be higher, in the practical application of limit peak of 115 kbps, can
    also be applied to the occasional big data transmission. GPRS communication technology
    is a wireless communication transmission technology based on TCP/IP protocol [12].
    GPRS system is mainly composed of the main entity, logical structure, protocol
    structure and channel of GPRS network. In practical operation, the data transmitted
    by GPRS module has two parts, one is the measured data, which belongs to user
    data, and the other is the control signaling to control and provide transmission
    support for user data. The main function of the GPRS communication module is to
    set up the data transmission channel between the upper computer and the lower
    computer to complete information processing communication [13]. Core chip adopts
    H7210 DTU. The modules of H7200 series have high reliability and wide range of
    use, and are the best choice for wireless communication of many systems [14].
    As the most commonly used wireless communication module, its internal built-in
    PPP and TCP/IP protocol stack, to meet most of the wireless communication protocol
    requirements; Can support fixed IP address and domain name; There are three different
    communication modes: TCP, UDP and SMS. Able to support private networks using
    mobile operator APN; In order to ensure the network patency and reduce power consumption,
    it also has idle offline and timed offline functions; SMS number support international
    area code and local number two modes; Debugging information can be set via a serial
    port. 3.5 Irrigation System Design Irrigation systems are divided into manual
    and automatic systems. The control circuit mainly controls the opening and closing
    of the pump by relay. When the system works, the soil moisture sensor begins to
    detect the current soil moisture [15]. The data measured by the soil moisture
    sensor is converted into digital signals and transmitted to the microcomputer
    through AD conversion. MCU compares the acquisition value with the set value.
    When the collected value is less than the humidity lower limit set, the control
    relay is connected to the pump to water the flowers and plants. When the pump
    is turned on, if the measured value is greater than the set humidity upper limit
    or reaches the maximum watering time, the pump is closed [16, 17]. In the watering
    process, if the measured value of soil temperature and humidity is greater than
    the set value of humidity upper limit, the control relay closes the water pump.
    Its workflow is shown in Fig. 3. When switched to manual, the relay is automatically
    closed and the pump is closed for manual watering. Fig. 3. Workflow diagrams Full
    size image 4 The System Test Due to the limitations of time and conditions in
    the system design, field testing and debugging were not carried out. All tests
    and debugging were carried out in the laboratory. Experiments were conducted through
    the established simulation model: (1) In the display module of the system, the
    upper and lower limits of humidity, watering duration and other relevant parameters
    are set manually, which gives the water demand of flowers and plants. Then, the
    command is transmitted to the downward machine to test whether the water pump
    can be opened normally for irrigation and shut down automatically after irrigation
    is completed. (2) The soil moisture sensor is inserted into the dry soil to test
    whether the water pump can be automatically opened for irrigation, and then inserted
    into the wet soil to test whether the water pump can automatically shut off irrigation.
    (3) After power on, the system can automatically detect the soil temperature and
    humidity, and timely control the water pump for irrigation according to the collected
    data. After the design is completed, the system is tested and debugged through
    the actual test. The actual test results show that the system designed in this
    design can work normally and independently, and the effect is good. It achieves
    the expected design effect and can effectively conduct intelligent irrigation.
    5 Conclusion In the system design, based on consulting a large number of relevant
    data and documents, and combining the actual requirement of the design to carry
    on the design, encountered many problems during, but have been conducted to solve
    the guidance of the teacher carefully, after two months of efforts finally according
    to the design requirements expected only irrigation system are designed. The whole

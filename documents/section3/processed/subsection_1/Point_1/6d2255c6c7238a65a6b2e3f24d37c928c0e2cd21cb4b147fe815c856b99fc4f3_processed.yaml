  analysis: '**Types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical
    sources**


    The types of data most applicable to irrigation management are:

    * **Soil moisture data:** This data provides information about the amount of water
    in the soil, which is essential for determining when and how much to irrigate.
    Soil moisture data can be collected using a variety of sensors, such as tensiometers,
    moisture probes, and neutron probes.

    * **Weather data:** This data includes information about temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation. Weather data can be used to predict crop water
    requirements and to schedule irrigation accordingly. Weather data can be collected
    from a variety of sources, such as weather stations, satellites, and numerical
    weather models.

    * **Crop data:** This data includes information about the type of crop being grown,
    its stage of growth, and its water requirements. Crop data can be used to determine
    how much water to apply and when to irrigate. Crop data can be collected from
    a variety of sources, such as farmers, agricultural advisors, and crop models.

    * **Irrigation system data:** This data includes information about the type of
    irrigation system being used, the flow rate of the water, and the duration of
    the irrigation event. Irrigation system data can be used to ensure that the irrigation
    system is operating efficiently and that the water is being applied uniformly.

    These are just a few of the many types of data that can be used for irrigation
    management. The specific types of data that are most applicable to a particular
    irrigation system will depend on the specific needs of the system and the crops
    being grown.


    **Current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation
    management systems**


    Real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems are still in their
    early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the
    way that irrigation is managed. These systems use sensors and other data collection
    devices to collect data about soil moisture, weather, crops, and irrigation system
    performance. This data is then used to automatically adjust the irrigation schedule,
    ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time.


    Real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems offer a number of
    benefits over traditional irrigation methods, including:

    * **Increased water savings:** Automated irrigation systems can help to save water
    by only irrigating when necessary and by applying the right amount of water. This
    can lead to significant savings on water costs.

    * **Improved crop yields:** Automated irrigation systems can help to improve crop
    yields by ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time.
    This can lead to increased profits for farmers.

    * **Reduced labor costs:** Automated irrigation systems can help to reduce labor
    costs by eliminating the need for manual irrigation. This can free up farmers
    to focus on other tasks.

    * **Improved environmental sustainability:** Automated irrigation systems can
    help to improve environmental sustainability by reducing water use and runoff.
    This can help to protect water resources and reduce the impact of agriculture
    on the environment.


    The future of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems is
    bright. As these systems become more sophisticated and affordable, they are likely
    to become more widely adopted by farmers. This could lead to significant improvements
    in water use efficiency, crop yields, and environmental sustainability.'

    \ (Y.B.)\nAbstract: In recent years, technology has advanced to the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution (Industry 4.0),\nwhere the Internet of things (IoTs), fog computing,\
    \ computer security, and cyberattacks have evolved\nexponentially on a large scale.\
    \ The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms\ngenerate\
    \ enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security.\
    \ Arti-\nﬁcial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods\
    \ for addressing cybersecurity\nthreats and providing security. In this study,\
    \ we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that\ncategorize, map and survey\
    \ the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks\n\
    in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation\
    \ on most AI trending\ntechniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions.\
    \ A systematic search was performed on various\nelectronic databases (SCOPUS,\
    \ Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out\nof the identiﬁed\
    \ records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed\
    \ and\ncarefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine\
    \ learning (ML) tech-\nniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in\
    \ detecting attacks. However, several studies\nhave proposed smart intrusion detection\
    \ systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks\nusing AI to overcome\
    \ the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector\n\
    machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to\
    \ high accuracy\ndetection another reason may be efﬁcient memory. In addition,\
    \ other methods also provide better\nperformance such as extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent\nneural networks (RNN). This analysis\
    \ also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats\nbased on attack\
    \ categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.\n\

    \ (IoT) in recent years has contributed\nto a signiﬁcant increase in fog computing,\
    \ smart cities, and Industry 4.0, all of which\nexecute the complex data processing\
    \ of conﬁdential information that must be protected\nagainst cybersecurity attacks.\
    \ Cybersecurity attacks have increased rapidly in various\ndomains, such as smart\
    \ homes, healthcare, energy, agriculture, automation, and industrial\nprocesses\
    \ [1]. As a result of their wide range of services, IoT device sensors generate\
    \ large\namounts of data that requires authentication, security, and privacy.\
    \ Previously, traditional\nmethods and frameworks were used to ensure the security\
    \ of IoT. However, the application\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11020198\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n2 of 27\n\
    of different artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods for detecting cybersecurity attacks\
    \ has\ngained in popularity over the years.\nIoT comprises interconnected devices\
    \ that are increasingly developed on a large scale,\ntaking into account various\
    \ characteristics through cloud and fog computing, where the\nprocessing of real-time\
    \ applications can be enhanced [2]. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are\nintegrated\
    \ technologies such as healthcare IoT, industrial IoT (IIoT), smart cities IoT,\
    \ AI and big\ndata, that are part of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry\
    \ 4.0), and are used for innovation\nin smart industries to promote data transmission\
    \ between networks [3,4]. To overcome the\nsecurity issues that threaten the IoT,\
    \ several researchers have developed IDSs based on various\nAI approaches. Kurte\
    \ et al. [5], for example, introduced a distributed service framework that\nsupports\
    \ the development of trustworthiness and privacy protection for multidirectional\n\
    data aggregation for edge computing enhancement [6]. Diro and Chilamkurti [7]\
    \ proposed a\ndetection system using deep learning (DL) methods to detect cybersecurity\
    \ attacks in IoT. They\ncompared the DL model with traditional machine learning\
    \ (ML) approaches. Farivar et al. [8]\nidentified AI for the detection of malicious\
    \ attacks in CPS and IIoT and proposed a hybrid\nintelligent classic control approach\
    \ for the reconstruction of cyberattacks on the input data of\nnon-linear CPS\
    \ through shared networks.\nSecurity in the IoT requires additional considerations\
    \ to protect connected smart\ndevices from threats and other vulnerabilities using\
    \ effective AI techniques towards moni-\ntoring [9–11]. In addition, IoT security\
    \ systems are designed using AI enhanced encryption\nalgorithms to archive privacy\
    \ [12,13]. For example, Obaidat et al. [14] investigated in-depth\nIoT attacks,\
    \ threats and vulnerability through classiﬁcation based on severity impact, also\n\
    providing a multi-faceted method to countermeasure those security concerns. Li\
    \ et al. [15]\nproposed a novel privacy prevention of ML training with classiﬁcation\
    \ process through a\nsecurity framework based on a homomorphic encryption scheme\
    \ over a matrix ring, which\nalso supports ciphertexts homomorphic comparison.\
    \ Sarica and Angin [16] provided ex-\nplainable security in IoT networks by proposing\
    \ a real-time automated intrusion detection\napproach using ML classiﬁers in software-deﬁned\
    \ networking (SDN) application layer to\ndetect an attack. Aleem et al. [17] provide\
    \ security concerns for data warehouse (DWH)\nwith each type of security approach.\
    \ Furthermore, it includes a new and unique CPS if the\ncountermeasure is insufﬁcient\
    \ [18]. Patil et al. [19] proposed a virtual machine-assisted\nlightweight agent-based\
    \ malware detection framework for securing a virtual machine in\ncloud computing,\
    \ while, Dang et al. [20] proposed an authentication method for securing\ncloud\
    \ servers in IoT environments. In addition, Moustafa [21] proposed a new IoT network\n\
    distributed architecture using an AI-based security system.\nOwing to their IDSs,\
    \ AI methods are widely used for providing security to IoT devices\nand networks\
    \ to overcome the challenges, security issues and abnormalities [22]. Recent\n\
    studies by Ghosh et al. [23] claimed that the application of AI in IoT is a breakthrough\n\
    for reducing human effort in providing security. More recent evidence was reported\
    \ by\nBland et al. [24]; they proposed ML cyberattack and defense strategies using\
    \ reinforcement\nlearning algorithms to improve the ability to detect cybersecurity\
    \ attacks. Rathore and\nPark [25] used a semi-supervised learning-based distribution\
    \ attack detection framework\nfor IoT, where they introduced a fog-based attack\
    \ detection framework and proposed an\nextreme learning machine (ELM)-based semi-supervised\
    \ fuzzy method to achieve adequate\ngeneralization performance at a fast detection\
    \ rate. Kasongo and Sun [26] adopted a\nDL method and developed an approach for\
    \ wireless IDS using wrapper-based feature\nextraction for wireless networks based\
    \ on a feed-forward deep neural network.\nHowever, certain limitations exist because\
    \ the use of AI in cybersecurity detection\nintroduces considerable exposure to\
    \ IoT devices and networks. In addition to the develop-\nment of IoT, several\
    \ centralized attack detection mechanisms have been proposed to detect\nattacks\
    \ in the IoT using a supervised ML algorithm. In spite of this, these mechanisms\
    \ have\nfailed to achieve signiﬁcant results because of the distinct requirements\
    \ of devices, such\nas scalability and distribution, [25]. However, there’s a\
    \ need for IoT security guidelines\nto evaluate the existing methods [27]. Previous\
    \ systematic reviews have made signiﬁcant\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n3 of 27\n\
    contributions to the cybersecurity ﬁeld. The work of [28] investigated and analyzed\
    \ the\nimportance of artiﬁcial immune systems in IoT environments by evaluating\
    \ and identifying\nthe performance of empirical research on the approaches to\
    \ secure IoT environments.\nIn this review, we intend to explore and analyze both\
    \ ML and DL methods used for\nthe detection of cybersecurity attacks in IoT devices\
    \ and networks by formulating and\naddressing research questions, and ﬁlling the\
    \ current research gaps in the area of IoT\nsecurity by attempting to overcome\
    \ limitations in the existing work.\nIDSs, particularly those designed using AI\
    \ such as anomaly-based, are preferred for\ndetecting cybersecurity attacks in\
    \ mobile devices with integrity veriﬁcation schemes for\ncloud storage in an endpoint\
    \ environment [2,29–31]. In this study, we analyze the research\npublished on\
    \ IoT security and identify the best possible solutions under different scenarios,\n\
    including detection algorithms, frameworks, architectures, and models. Previously,\
    \ arti-\nﬁcial immune systems have been reviewed to secure IoT via fog orchestration\
    \ [28,32–34].\nHerein, we mapped the literature to identify past learnings and\
    \ discuss potential future\nscenarios. To this end, we formulated three research\
    \ questions.\nThis SLR (systematic literature review) consists of ten sections\
    \ and is organized as\nfollows. Section 1 introduction, Section 2 provides metasurvey,\
    \ Section 3 presents survey\nmethodology, Section 4 presents results, Section\
    \ 5 presents SLR major ﬁndings based on the\nresearch questions, Section 6 presents\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence roadmap, Section 7 presents a\ndiscussion, Section 8\
    \ presents limitations of the study, Section 9 presents recommendations\nfor future\
    \ investigations and Section 10 is the conclusion.\n1.1. Huge Network Trafﬁc Dataset\
    \ and Imbalanced Dataset\nIoT IDSs using AI have challenges of the huge amount\
    \ of datasets from network trafﬁc\nwhich leads to high false alarm and low detection\
    \ rates [35]. This can be addressed using\nfeature reduction technique. Singh\
    \ et al. [35] proposed a technique for IDS based on online\nsequential extreme\
    \ ML which proﬁling less time complexity while irrelevant features are\nexcluded\
    \ using correlation, consistency feature selection. Figure 1 show data imbalanced\n\
    problem from multi-classes relationship between more complex and classes. In addition,\n\
    the ML IDSs face challenges due to imbalanced datasets when processing/training\
    \ entire\ndata, while this can be addressed by identiﬁcation of intrusion through\
    \ network trafﬁc\nbehavior and reassembling imbalanced datasets.\nFigure 1. Two\
    \ possible class imbalance scenarios: (left) binary imbalanced problem and (right)\n\
    multi-class imbalanced problem [36].\n1.2. Research Contribution\nSeveral research\
    \ studies address the importance of AI in IoT cybersecurity. In this\nstudy, we\
    \ investigate the use of AI methods in the detection of a cybersecurity attack\
    \ in the\nIoT. The research contribution for this SLR includes the following:\n\
    •\nWe formulate and answer three research questions using existing empirical studies\n\
    that use AI methods in IoT.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n4 of 27\n•\nWe review\
    \ the current uses of AI methods in detecting IoT threats by evaluating the\n\
    approach using datasets.\n•\nWe present a classiﬁcation of studies based on ML\
    \ Algorithms, DL algorithms, model\nperformance, IDSs and types of threats.\n\
    •\nWe also discuss the limitations of the study and recommendations for future\
    \ studies.\n2. Metasurvey\nIn this section, related works have been reviewed based\
    \ on literature review studies.\nThe existing studies related to AI algorithm-based\
    \ technique has been used to detect cyber-\nattacks and anomaly activities in\
    \ IoT nowadays, through developing smart, secure and\nprovide, IoT infrastructure\
    \ which can detect the abnormal, vulnerability from cyber-attack\nautomatically,\
    \ the ML, DL algorithms was the best to protect the systems than normal\ntraditional\
    \ method when it is in an abnormal state. For such reason, the goal is to identify\n\
    what are the most effective AI methods to detect an attack, threats in IoT environment\n\
    and investigate the available practice to reduce those attacks using effective\
    \ techniques. In\naddition, IoT is subjected to serious risk of cyber security\
    \ attack due to its huge amount of\ndata generated through the network and communication\
    \ layers of ﬁeld devices such as\nsensor data and actuators which are usually\
    \ used for real-time monitoring and predictions.\nAhmad et al. [37] conducted\
    \ a comprehensive analysis of different DL models which\ninclude CNN, RNN, LSTM\
    \ using IoT-Botnet 2020 dataset to propose an efﬁcient anomaly\ndetection using\
    \ mutual information (MI) by considering deep neural network (DNN) for\nan IoT\
    \ network. Similar study by Ali and Choi [38] presents a comprehensive review\n\
    on state-of-art AI techniques for distributed smart grids with aims to support\
    \ the inte-\ngration of renewable energy resources security. Tahsien et al. [39]\
    \ present a survey of\nML-based solutions for IoT security in terms of different\
    \ types of possible attacks. Alsouﬁ\net al. [40] present a review analysis on\
    \ anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in IoT\nusing several DL techniques.\
    \ Echeverría et al. [41] investigated in-depth on cybersecurity\nmodel based on\
    \ hardening to secure IoT using a model of sequence consist seven steps\nto minimize\
    \ the attack surface through executing hardening processing. However, new\nconcern\
    \ about cybersecurity issues are rising in IoT infrastructure Djenna et al. [42]\
    \ presents\na critical analysis of the most recent cybersecurity issues for IoT-based\
    \ critical infrastruc-\ntures. Another progressive research on IoT security by\
    \ Mahbub [43] presents an exhaustive\nanalysis based on perspective protocols,\
    \ vulnerabilities and preemptive architectonics.\nThis review focuses on AI techniques\
    \ used between 2016 and 2021. However, before\n2016, AI has played a role in cybersecurity.\
    \ The dominant techniques during this time\ninclude genetic algorithms, fuzzy\
    \ logic and neural networks where many researchers\nproposed IDSs and intelligence\
    \ architecture frameworks based on AI. For example, in\n2015, Dilek et al. [44]\
    \ provided a comprehensive review on AI techniques to combat\ncybercrimes with\
    \ efﬁcient methods for detecting and preventing cyber-attacks. In addition,\n\
    Greensmith [45] provided how artiﬁcial immune systems (AIS) can maintain and secure\
    \ IoT\nnetworks using advanced AIS. Moreover, the authors provide its challenges\
    \ and limitations.\nIn 2011, Morel [46] provided a broad overview of AI as a feature\
    \ of cybersecurity based on\nits different approaches.\nTable 1 shows comparison\

    \ developed to identify the relevant studies. To this end, a systematic computerized\n\
    search was finalized using three database sources, namely SCOPUS, Science Direct,\
    \ IEEE\nXplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI. We developed a search strategy\
    \ to identify relevant\nliterature following the Preferred Reporting Items for\
    \ Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n(PRISMA) guidelines during all stages\

    3.6. Quality Assessment\nQuality assessment was based on original research and\
    \ a few review articles. To\nmaintain the quality of the review, all duplicate\
    \ records were thoroughly checked. In\nparticular, the abstracts of all research\
    \ articles included in the review process were checked\nin detail and ﬁltered\
    \ to ensure their quality and relevance. A careful evaluation of each\nresearch\
    \ paper was performed at a later stage. Another exclusion criterion was to limit\
    \ the\narticles to those published in the English language. Consequently, six\
    \ articles in non-English\nlanguages were excluded from the study.\n3.7. Data\
    \ Extraction\nSelected studies were placed into a data extraction spreadsheet\
    \ using Microsoft Excel\n2019. The data extracted from the studies were: author(s),\
    \ year, AI type, algorithm used,\nperformance focus, model performance, number\
    \ of predictive features, types of cybersecu-\nrity attacks and data sources.\
    \ The data extraction was performed by two authors of this\nstudy (N.A. and S.J.A).\n\
    4. Results\nIn this section, we summarize the results of the screening and search\
    \ processes based\non the PRISMA guidelines. First, we describe the characteristics\
    \ of selected research studies\nby presenting their data quantitatively, which\

    \ classiﬁcation of the studies based on ML algorithms used in\nthe detection of\
    \ IoT threats. The table includes article authors, year, description of their\n\
    work, datasets, and ML algorithms used. ML methods are the most promising for\
    \ ensuring\nsecurity within the IoT environment, whereas framework models, IDSs,\
    \ techniques, and\nintelligent architectures have been proposed by various researchers\
    \ to detect threats and\nattacks in IoT devices and fog-based systems. According\
    \ to the summary of studies,\nSVM, SVR, DT, RF, NB classiﬁer, LR, KNN, and fuzzy\
    \ algorithms are commonly used to\naddress cybersecurity-related issues. The ML\
    \ algorithms were categorized into supervised,\nunsupervised, and semi-supervised\
    \ learning-based methods. Furthermore, certain studies\ncombined different methods\
    \ to compare their performances, which are referred to as\nintelligent hybrid\
    \ models.\n4.2.2. Summary of Studies Classiﬁed Based on DL Algorithms\nTable 5\
    \ summarizes the classiﬁcation of the studies based on the DL algorithms\nused\
    \ in the detection. The table includes article authors, year, description, datasets,\
    \ and\nDL algorithms used. DL is a subsection of ML that is based on a neural\
    \ network and\nplays a vital role in cybersecurity within the IoT environment.\
    \ Most researchers have\nproposed smart IDSs, framework models, techniques, intelligent\
    \ architectures, and fog-\nbased methods to detect threats in the identiﬁcation\
    \ systems of IoT devices and networks.\nAccording to the selected studies, most\
    \ researchers used deep autoencoders (DA), recurrent\nneural networks (RNN), convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNN), deep neural networks\n(DNN), multi-layer perception neural\
    \ networks, and deep belief networks (DBN) to address\ncybersecurity issues. Certain\
    \ studies combined different DL models to compare their\nperformances, which are\
    \ referred to as hybrid models. Additionally, most studies’ datasets\nare KDD,\
    \ which has limitations due to it being outdated in the IDS community.\nElectronics\

    \ trafﬁc categorization\n5. Major Findings Based on the Research Questions\n5.1.\
    \ RQ1: What Are the Existing Cybersecurity Attacks and Threats in the IoT Environment?\n\
    To identify the existing cybersecurity attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities in\
    \ IoT (RQ1),\nour study conﬁrmed the existence of DoS, DDoS, malicious, ransomware,\
    \ blackhole, sink-\nhole, reconnaissance, and wormhole attacks (Table 7) in IoT\
    \ environments. Additionally,\nWang et al. [62] proposed a network attack detection\
    \ model of power grid disturbances to\nidentify cyberattacks. Rathore and Park\
    \ [25] introduced fog-based attack detection consid-\nering the attack categories\
    \ of the IoT ecosystem, namely DoS, probe, user-to-root (U2R),\nand remote-to-local\
    \ (R2L) attacks. Dovom et al. [61] introduced ransomware and malware\nattack detection\
    \ in IoT. Li et al. [60] evaluated the performance of false alarm reduction to\n\
    enhance collaborative intrusion detection in IoT environments, and Azmoodeh et\
    \ al. [68]\nproposed non-malicious applications to detect ransomware by monitoring\
    \ the energy\nconsumption patterns based on the power consumption of Android devices.\
    \ Furthermore,\nour study explores IoT security by identifying existing features\
    \ and fault identiﬁcation,\nwhich are a vulnerability of IoT that leads to unreliable\
    \ network and data communication.\nVulnerabilities in IoT are increasing rapidly\
    \ owing to the complexity of network trafﬁc,\nthe addition of network communication\
    \ protocols, weak credentials, privacy, and insecure\nnetworks. Additionally,\
    \ Diro and Chilamkurti [7] reported unauthorized access to local\nuser accounts\
    \ and a spy breaking into the system to obtain conﬁdential information as\nvulnerabilities\
    \ in the IoT with internet message access protocol (IMAP); these attacks can\n\
    be categorized as R2L. Rashid et al. [70] added that vulnerabilities can occur\
    \ through\nzero-day attacks by exploiting different protocols in the IoT. Therefore,\
    \ when vulnerable\ndata/information leaks are subjected to cybersecurity threats,\
    \ the IoT becomes compro-\nmised by providing false results that lead to a sophisticated\
    \ attack. Lastly, Table 8 illustrates\nthe types of attacks within the IoT environment.\n\

    \ Attacks in the IoT?\nWe believe that support vector machines (SVM) and random\
    \ forest (RF) are mostly\nused because of high accuracy detection another reason\
    \ may be efﬁcient memory. The\nstudy [58,59,61,63–66,68–70] used SVM and RF due\
    \ to their classiﬁers effectiveness. They\nare widely implemented in various domains\
    \ such as anomaly intrusion detection systems\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n17 of\
    \ 27\nin IoT environments because of their most efﬁcient features from others\
    \ ML algorithms\ntowards identiﬁcation of attacks with better performance. In\
    \ addition, they are used for\nfeature selection techniques to achieve high accuracy\
    \ performance. However, they have\nlimitations such as long CPU time from SVM\
    \ and ineffective real-time predictions from\nRF. The studies from Alrashdi et\
    \ al. [67] used the random forest method to propose a\nsystem for anomaly detection\
    \ in IoT (AD-IoT), and Rahman et al. [58] used a support vector\nmachine to address\
    \ the limitations of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices.\nThey proposed\
    \ two techniques, namely semi-distributed and distributed, which combine\nhigh-performance\
    \ feature extraction and selection with potential fog-edge coordinated\nanalytics.\
    \ Furthermore, DL methods based on artiﬁcial neural networks are commonly\nused\
    \ for cybersecurity detection (Table 5).\nIn addition, we find out that HaddadPajouh\
    \ et al. [71] used a recurrent neural network\nfor detecting and hunting malware\
    \ in IoT. Diro and Chilamkurti [7] used the DL method\nfor cybersecurity to enable\
    \ the detection of attacks in the social IoT based on a distributed\napproach,\
    \ and Meidan et al. [76] used deep autoencoders to propose a novel network-based\n\
    anomaly detection method for detecting unusual network traffic from exploited\
    \ IoT devices.\nOther studies combine various AI methods for cybersecurity in\
    \ IoT, which serve as hybrid\nmethods. Additionally, Smys et al. [75] used a hybrid\
    \ IDS for IoT, wherein the proposed IDS\ndetected different types of attacks based\
    \ on a hybrid convolutional neural network model.\nHowever, with the rapid development\
    \ of ML and DL such as LSTM, XGBoost,\nCNN, NN, TCN, models provide efﬁcient classiﬁcation\
    \ with high accuracy. We found\nthat [72,74,77,79,83] used LSTM techniques with\
    \ potential of RNN to hunt IoT malware and\nOpCodes sequence. The LSTM model is\
    \ capable of learning on dependencies with input\ndatasets. In addition, the advancements\
    \ models techniques classiﬁcation, prediction time\nseries data to detect cybersecurity\
    \ attacks within IoT environment. The LSTM structure\nhas memory that stores previous\
    \ time step information similar to blockchain technology.\nXGBoost techniques\
    \ signiﬁcantly improved based on boosting algorithms in cybersecurity\nsuch as\
    \ to detect power grid cyber-attacks [62]. However, most studies from literature\n\
    used single model technique with evaluating the model using NSL-KDD, KDD99 datasets.\n\
    While at the current stage those datasets are outdated, we suggest using updated\
    \ detests\nfrom real-world, real-time IoT systems. Multiple models can be combined\
    \ to archive better\nresults, performance and high detection techniques.\n5.3.\
    \ RQ3: What Are the Available Practices to Reduce Cybersecurity Attacks for IoT\
    \ Using\nAI Approaches?\nWe found that many AI approaches have been proposed by\
    \ researchers to tackle,\nreduce cybersecurity attacks in IoT systems. The available\
    \ methods include smart intrusion\ndetection systems, anomaly detection techniques,\
    \ and intelligent architectural frameworks.\nAn efﬁcient DL based classiﬁcation\
    \ and technique has been used to detect cyber-attacks in\nIoT networks communications\
    \ through the development of new autonomous DL classiﬁ-\ncation systems using\
    \ CNN [10]. AI-based data encryption enhances intermediates nodes\nof IoT systems\
    \ [12]. In addition, AI approaches explore IoT data features extraction and\n\
    provide intrusion detection systems with feature extractions for smart cities\
    \ based on deep\nmigration learning model [74]. However, the current AI techniques\
    \ have limitations such\nas long training time due to large input datasets and\
    \ high computational complexity. In\naddition, we suggest improving efﬁciency\
    \ of AI models with a combination of models for\nbetter performance and high detection\
    \ techniques.\n6. Artiﬁcial Intelligence Roadmap\nIn this section, we provide\
    \ an AI roadmap with brief overview of its development in\ndetecting cybersecurity\
    \ attacks within IoT systems. The methods have been categorized\nbased on the\
    \ cybersecurity threats they identify such as Probe, U2R, R2L and DoS as shown\n\
    in Figure 8.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n18 of 27\nFigure 8. Illustration of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence methods based on attacks categories.\n6.1. AI for Detecting Probe\
    \ Attack\nProbe attacks aim to obtain data based on target external network sources\
    \ such as\nportsweep and IPsweep. The effects of probe attacks make data vulnerable\
    \ within peer\nnetworks which gives an attacker the ability to spy, access, or\
    \ gather information. This\nattack can be detected using AI-based techniques.\
    \ For example, Zhang et al. [86] proposed\nan IDS model based on genetic algorithm\
    \ (GA) and deep belief network (DBN) to achieve\na high detection rate in IoT\
    \ systems. In addition, a fast intrusion detection system was\nproposed using\
    \ hybrid AI techniques such as RF, Naïve Bayes, C4.5, REPTree algorithm to\ndetect\
    \ attacks [87].\n6.2. AI for Detecting U2R Attack\nUser to root (U2R) attack aims\
    \ to have access into systems as normal account such\nattacks include perl and\
    \ xterm. The effects of U2R attacks include manipulating, spying\nor interrupting\
    \ normal system behavior. In Bagaa et al. [88], a novel SVM model was\nproposed\
    \ based on a security framework to enable mitigating different threats such as\
    \ U2R\nin IoT systems. In addition, a GA has been proposed for generating rules\
    \ to detect U2R\nthreats [89].\n6.3. AI for Detecting R2L Attack\nRemote to user\
    \ (R2L) attacks occur when a user sends packets to system which do\nnot have legal\
    \ access such as xclock and guest password. The effects of R2L attacks\nexploit\
    \ system privileges. AI methods for detecting R2L attacks include Chatterjee and\n\
    Hanawal [90]. In the paper, a federated learning IDS was proposed based on a probabilistic\n\
    hybrid ensemble classiﬁer (PHEC) using KNN and RF to centralize IoT security.\
    \ Moreover,\na GA was proposed for generating rules to detect R2L attacks [89].\n\
    6.4. AI for Detecting DoS Attack\nDenial of services (DoS) attack is among the\
    \ most common, due to its easy execution.\nIt can be performed by disturbing the\
    \ network trafﬁc such as DDoS and UDP storm. The\neffects of DoS attacks make\
    \ system resources very busy to serve networking genuine\nrequests. An AI detection\
    \ model has been proposed using various ML/DL techniques\nwhich include CNN, RNN\
    \ and SVM to detect DoS attacks in IoT Botnets datasets [88,91].\n7. Discussion\n\
    In this section, we discuss our study ﬁndings in terms of the research questions\n\
    presented in Section 1. We summarize the major ﬁndings and explain the limitations\
    \ of\nour systematic literature review (SLR). Finally, recommendations for future\
    \ investigations\nare presented. Our analysis and evaluation from empirical studies\
    \ revealed that several\nvulnerabilities and threats that can lead to attacks\
    \ exist in the IoT environment. Moreover,\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n19 of 27\n\
    these attacks compromise the integrity of the IoT, which behaves abnormally during\
    \ event\nprocessing owing to malicious activities. With the rapid increase in\
    \ the number of IoT\ndevices resulting from the emergence of Industry 4.0, security\
    \ aspects must be prioritized.\nAI methods are the most promising approach for\
    \ overcoming these security issues through\nthe detection and identiﬁcation of\
    \ threats and attacks using smart IDSs and intelligent\narchitectural frameworks.\
    \ Moreover, the AI methods vary for different types of ML/DL in\nterms of event\
    \ processing performance in an IoT environment.\nAs shown in Table 9, we indicate\
    \ some selected AI models currently trending. The\nOIE contribute towards model\
    \ extracting information from unstructured data for valuable\ncyber threat information\
    \ when analyzing cybersecurity report [92]. In natural language\nprocessing, transformer-based\
    \ models are most effective towards detecting misinformation,\nmachine translation,\
    \ text summarization on large scale with less human effort to generate\nfake cyber\
    \ threats intelligence text description with transformed based-model [93]. XGBoost\n\
    model based on gradient boosting library also among high efﬁcient models towards\n\
    decision making, XGBoost have used for security modelling to detect cyber security\
    \ based\non abnormalities and multi-attacks [94]. The LSTM models play a vital\
    \ role among AI\nmodels for classiﬁcation, prediction on time series data based\
    \ on a recurrent neural network,\nLSTM technique have been used to introduce a\
    \ deep frequency decomposition model to\nachieve stock prediction [95]. EBM model\
    \ provides generative model from statistical\nphysics used self-supervised learning\
    \ based on EBM for equilibrium thermodynamics\ndue to its softmax layer and mapping\
    \ energies to probabilities [96]. In prediction research\nespecially during the\
    \ coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As it is been spreading within\ncountries\
    \ such as used ISI model for proposing COVID-19 prediction to estimate the\ninfection\
    \ variety for analyzing transmission laws with development trends [97]. However,\n\
    the AI model has been providing a classiﬁcation of misconceptions, myths and desired\n\
    where the authors elaborate more on the most popular AI models with statistical\
    \ methods\nrepresenting characteristics models which include NN, ES, HMM, AB,\
    \ and GLM [98].\nLastly, all AI models presented are effective, efﬁcient in performance\
    \ towards various\napplications for decisions, classiﬁcation, and statistics with\
    \ many more.\nTable 9. List of some selected trends for artiﬁcial intelligence\

    \ summarizes the empirical studies using only 80 research\narticles based on a\
    \ search strategy by examining several databases, including SCOPUS,\nScience Direct,\
    \ IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI. Consequently, certain related\n\
    studies may not be included as the search was performed considering journal papers\n\
    published over ﬁve years (2016–2021). Moreover, non-English studies were excluded.\
    \ In\naddition, some database searches are excluded such as Springer.\nAfter a\
    \ critical analysis, we determined that several proposed frameworks are weak\n\
    in terms of methodology and data analysis, which leads to an outcome with low\
    \ accuracy.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n22 of 27\nAdditionally, each proposed\
    \ system has certain problems that have not yet been solved.\nAlthough the results\
    \ of certain studies are in different metric performances, we focused\nmore on\
    \ results in terms of accuracy (%) when analyzing IoT security using AI methods.\
    \ In\naddition, it is worth mentioning that several studies did not report the\
    \ predictive features\nof their datasets. Finally, our paper has some potential\
    \ extensions and further applications\nbut we are unable to investigate several\
    \ threats which include fault injection, jamming in\nthe IoT environment.\n9.\
    \ Recommendations for Future Investigations\nOwing to the rapid development and\
    \ increase in the use of IoT devices in various\nsectors, which include IIoT,\
    \ medical IoT, energy IoT, and CPS, we recommend further\ninvestigation of the\
    \ existing AI algorithms by introducing next-generation approaches\nin IoT security\
    \ and privacy. Additionally, search databases other than SCOPUS, Science\nDirect,\
    \ IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI should be analyzed.\nOur results\
    \ reveal that different AI approaches have been proposed and implemented by\n\
    researchers based on ML/DL algorithms, including hybrid methods that combine different\n\
    algorithms. This implies that improving the existing intelligent architectural\
    \ frameworks can\naid in introducing different AI methods of ML/DL with better\
    \ performance.\nOur results also, verify the existence of different types of cybersecurity\
    \ attacks, such\nas DDoS, sinkhole, wormhole, and ramping attacks, in the IoT\
    \ environment. Although\nthese attacks are categorized as DoS, probe, R2L, and\
    \ U2R attacks, researchers can explore\nvulnerabilities beyond these categories.\
    \ Moreover, the most vulnerable layer in IoT needs\nto be identiﬁed.\nFurther\
    \ work also needs to be performed in improving the detection accuracy as\nwell\
    \ as concentrating on the availability of recent real-world datasets in order\
    \ to detect\nnew types of IoT threats. Finally, we anticipate our SLR results\
    \ will encourage further\ninspiration in developing new IDS/AI models to secure\
    \ the IoT environment against\ncybersecurity threats and attacks.\n10. Conclusions\n\
    In this paper, we present a systematic review of cybersecurity detection attacks\
    \ in\nthe IoT using AI methods. Due to their rapid development in the various\
    \ domains, large\namounts of data are constantly being generated, which requires\
    \ an increased focus on\nprivacy and security. Attacks in IoT can be categorized\
    \ into Probe, R2L, U2R, and DoS. If\nthese attacks succeed, IoT performance can\
    \ be compromised in many ways such as giving\nfalse information. While in the\
    \ past, traditional methods have been used for improving IoT\nsecurity, due to\
    \ the rapid evolution of cyber threats. As a result of industrial 4.0, the AI\n\
    approach can be considered one of the most promising methods.\nWe summarized,\
    \ categorized, and mapped the existing literature on AI methods for the\ndetection\
    \ of cybersecurity attacks in IoT environments using formulated research questions.\n\
    The survey was conducted using the PRISMA method, wherein eighty studies from\
    \ 2016 to\n2021 were carefully selected and evaluated. However, the SLR validates\
    \ that AI approaches\nare a promising method for providing security and privacy\
    \ in IoT environments.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.A. and Y.B.;\

  verbatim_quote1: '**Types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their
    typical sources**


    The types of data most applicable to irrigation management are:

    * **Soil moisture data:** This data provides information about the amount of water
    in the soil, which is essential for determining when and how much to irrigate.
    Soil moisture data can be collected using a variety of sensors, such as tensiometers,
    moisture probes, and neutron probes.

    * **Weather data:** This data includes information about temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation. Weather data can be used to predict crop water
    requirements and to schedule irrigation accordingly. Weather data can be collected
    from a variety of sources, such as weather stations, satellites, and numerical
    weather models.

    * **Crop data:** This data includes information about the type of crop being grown,
    its stage of growth, and its water requirements. Crop data can be used to determine
    how much water to apply and when to irrigate. Crop data can be collected from
    a variety of sources, such as farmers, agricultural advisors, and crop models.

    * **Irrigation system data:** This data includes information about the type of
    irrigation system being used, the flow rate of the water, and the duration of
    the irrigation event. Irrigation system data can be used to ensure that the irrigation
    system is operating efficiently and that the water is being applied uniformly.

    These are just a few of the many types of data that can be used for irrigation
    management. The specific types of data that are most applicable to a particular
    irrigation system will depend on the specific needs of the system and the crops
    being grown.'

    Real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems are still in their
    early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the
    way that irrigation is managed. These systems use sensors and other data collection
    devices to collect data about soil moisture, weather, crops, and irrigation system
    performance. This data is then used to automatically adjust the irrigation schedule,
    ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time.'

  analysis: '**Types of Data Most Applicable to IoT Security Management and their
    Typical Sources**


    * **IoT application scenario**: The type of IoT application (e.g., smart home,
    industrial IoT, healthcare) can influence the types of data that are most relevant
    for security management. For example, smart home applications may generate data
    on device usage patterns, while industrial IoT applications may generate data
    on production processes.

    * **Approach to DDoS Mitigation**: The approach used to mitigate DDoS attacks
    (e.g., filtering, rate limiting, traceback) can also affect the types of data
    that are most relevant. For example, filtering approaches may require data on
    packet headers, while rate limiting approaches may require data on traffic volume.

    * **Mitigation strategy**: The specific mitigation strategy that is implemented
    (e.g., blacklisting, whitelisting, graylisting) can also affect the types of data
    that are most relevant. For example, blacklisting approaches may require data
    on malicious IP addresses, while whitelisting approaches may require data on trusted
    IP addresses.

    * **IoT Device Type**: The type of device that is being used in the IoT application
    can also affect the types of data that are most relevant for security management.
    For example, sensors may generate data on environmental conditions, while actuators
    may generate data on device actions.


    **Example of Relevant Data for IoT Security Management**


    The following are some examples of relevant data for IoT security management:


    * **Device Identifiers**: Device identifiers (e.g., IP addresses, MAC addresses)
    can be used to identify and track devices on the network. This data can be used
    to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the network.

    * **Trafﬁc Patterns**: Traffic patterns (e.g., volume, frequency, duration) can
    be used to identify and prevent DDoS attacks. This data can also be used to optimize
    network performance.

    * **Device Behavior**: Device behavior (e.g., power consumption, response time)
    can be used to detect and prevent device compromise. This data can also be used
    to identify and troubleshoot device issues.

    * **Environmental Conditions**: Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity)
    can be used to detect and prevent physical threats to devices. This data can also
    be used to optimize device performance.

    * **User Activity**: User activity (e.g., logins, logouts, file access) can be
    used to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the network. This data can also
    be used to identify and investigate security incidents.'

    \ Things (IoT) has attracted much attention from the Information and\nCommunication\
    \ Technology (ICT) community in recent years. One of the main reasons for this\n\
    is the availability of techniques provided by this paradigm, such as environmental\
    \ monitoring\nemploying user data and everyday objects. The facilities provided\
    \ by the IoT infrastructure allow\nthe development of a wide range of new business\
    \ models and applications (e.g., smart homes,\nsmart cities, or e-health). However,\
    \ there are still concerns over the security measures which need\nto be addressed\
    \ to ensure a suitable deployment. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks\
    \ are\namong the most severe virtual threats at present and occur prominently\
    \ in this scenario, which can be\nmainly owed to their ease of execution. In light\
    \ of this, several research studies have been conducted\nto ﬁnd new strategies\
    \ as well as improve existing techniques and solutions. The use of emerging\n\
    technologies such as those based on the Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN) paradigm\
    \ has proved\nto be a promising alternative as a means of mitigating DDoS attacks.\
    \ However, the high granularity\nthat characterizes the IoT scenarios and the\
    \ wide range of techniques explored during the DDoS\nattacks make the task of\
    \ ﬁnding and implementing new solutions quite challenging. This problem\nis exacerbated\
    \ by the lack of benchmarks that can assist developers when designing new solutions\n\
    for mitigating DDoS attacks for increasingly complex IoT scenarios. To ﬁll this\
    \ knowledge gap,\nin this study we carry out an in-depth investigation of the\
    \ state-of-the-art and create a taxonomy that\ndescribes and characterizes existing\
    \ solutions and highlights their main limitations. Our taxonomy\nprovides a comprehensive\
    \ view of the reasons for the deployment of the solutions, and the scenario\n\
    in which they operate. The results of this study demonstrate the main beneﬁts\
    \ and drawbacks of each\nsolution set when applied to speciﬁc scenarios by examining\
    \ current trends and future perspectives,\nfor example, the adoption of emerging\
    \ technologies based on Cloud and Edge (or Fog) Computing.\nKeywords: Distributed\
    \ Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS); Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN);\nInternet\

    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [1] is expected to cause more changes in the way technology\n\
    permeates society and the economy. IoT allows everyday objects to be connected\
    \ to devices that\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078; doi:10.3390/s20113078\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n2 of 28\ncommunicate with each other or with other systems\
    \ via a network. By doing so, IoT enables\nhyper-connected environments, e.g.,\
    \ in homes, factories, and hospitals, to be leveraged to provide new\ntypes of\
    \ services [2]. However, to ensure the maximum beneﬁts can be derived from this\
    \ technology,\nmany challenges have to be addressed, particularly in terms of\
    \ security and privacy [3].\nIn a typical IoT scenario, there are several smart\
    \ devices (e.g., sensors, household items,\nand personal items) that interact\
    \ with remote applications by collecting and sending data from\nthe environment\
    \ (e.g., weather information, vital patient data, and trafﬁc information) [4].\n\
    Hence, these applications may be vulnerable to the actions of malicious agents\
    \ that aim to make\nthem unavailable, or even use the IoT devices themselves as\
    \ a launching pad for attacks on different\ndomains [5].\nOne of the aggravating\
    \ factors in this scenario is the lack of embedded security\nmechanisms, which\
    \ is often due to the limited processing capacity of the IoT devices [6].\nIn\
    \ addition, the large-scale dissemination of new smart devices connected to the\
    \ Internet is\nleading to the emergence of increasingly complex IoT infrastructures\
    \ with heterogeneous features and\nrequirements [7,8]. It is estimated that around\
    \ 29 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by\nthe year 2022 [9].\
    \ These factors make the process of detecting and mitigating virtual threats much\n\
    more complex and require new defense mechanisms to maintain specialized skills\
    \ in order to provide\nan appropriate level of protection.\nOne of the leading\
    \ virtual threats today that poses risks to the operation of IoT applications\
    \ is the\nDistributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) [10]. This type of attack\
    \ often occurs on the Internet due to\nits ease of execution (some companies offer\
    \ DDoS attacks as a service) [11]. In addition, DDoS attacks\ncan threat the availability\
    \ of a target in seconds. Reports from specialized security companies have\nrevealed\
    \ a gradual expansion in the scope of DDoS attacks carried out in recent years.\
    \ The severity of\nthis growth has caused substantial ﬁnancial losses to corporations\
    \ and can further affect millions of\nusers worldwide [12]. The most signiﬁcant\
    \ DDoS attack ever recorded was directed at the servers of\nGithub in 2018. The\
    \ attack exploited an area of vulnerability in an application layer protocol that\
    \ was\ndesigned to deliver 129 million requests per second and reach a total volume\
    \ of trafﬁc of 1.35 Tbps [13],\nfollowing in the footsteps of the most signiﬁcant\
    \ attack recorded in 2016 that involved 1.2 Tbps [14].\n1.1. Problem Statement\n\
    In light of this, there is a need for new technologies that are capable of providing\
    \ more efﬁcient\nways of protecting the network against DDoS attacks. These attacks\
    \ are usually carried out on a large\nscale from botnets formed by IoT devices\
    \ and are mainly aimed at devices that can be exploited [15].\nOne of the main\
    \ examples in this regard is the Mirai botnet [16], which in 2016 halted a signiﬁcant\n\
    subset of the Internet, impacting several countries. Mirai used an enormous number\
    \ of geo-distributed\nIoT devices to orchestrate the attacks. This technique signiﬁcantly\
    \ increased the effectiveness of the\nattack, as it made it difﬁcult to locate\
    \ the attacker. A recent report [17] shows that in the third quarter of\n2019,\
    \ the United States and the Netherlands had the highest rate of devices owned\
    \ by botnets that were\nused for launching DDoS attacks. This problematic situation\
    \ has required a great effort on the part of\nthe scientiﬁc community to investigate\
    \ new strategies for improving security for IoT infrastructures,\nintending to\
    \ mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks.\nIn this scenario, the advent of new network\
    \ technologies, such as those brought about by the\nSoftware-Deﬁned Networking\
    \ (SDN) paradigm [18], can be viewed as one of the main advances\nfor reducing\
    \ the complexity of managing traditional networks [19]. This is made possible\
    \ through\nthe opportunities provided by the SDN paradigm to design a ﬂexible\
    \ infrastructure assisted by the\ncapabilities of a programmable control plane.\
    \ This means that the (network and security) functions\nthat were previously operated\
    \ individually on each of the network switch can now be carried out and\nmanaged\
    \ in a uniﬁed manner through the resources provided by the control plane. Communication\n\
    between the controller and other network elements is usually carried out through\
    \ an API that enable\nthe reconﬁguration of the system at runtime. Thanks to its\
    \ (logically) centralized approach, the SDN\ncontroller can monitor and manage\
    \ the entire underlying network infrastructure, and thus provide\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3078\n3 of 28\na holistic view of the network. Concerning security, the\
    \ devices provided by the SDN architecture\ncan maximize the detection and capacity\
    \ to contain virtual threats, and thus devise more efﬁcient and\nprogrammable\
    \ mechanisms [20].\nRecently, several studies have adopted SDN in the design of\
    \ techniques for providing security\nin several sectors, such as access control\
    \ [21], reliable data communication [22], and malware\ndetection [23,24], among\
    \ others. Regarding DDoS attacks in particular [25], the solutions that made use\n\
    of the resources provided by the SDN architecture, proved to be effective in detecting\
    \ and mitigating\nattacks, owing to the beneﬁts of programmability introduced\
    \ through softwarization techniques [26].\nThese techniques lead to the development\
    \ of more efﬁcient models that are capable of supporting the\nconstantly evolving\
    \ DDoS attacks [27].\nThus, there have been several research endeavors aimed at\
    \ ﬁnding new solutions for mitigating\nDDoS attacks on IoT infrastructures [28].\
    \ However, these solutions are tailored on speciﬁc situations\n(e.g., small network\
    \ infrastructures composed by domestic IoT devices) which prevents these\nmechanisms\
    \ from being widely adopted in heterogeneous environments where the requirements\n\
    are constantly changing. For this reason, it is important to have a holistic understanding\
    \ of the\ncurrent DDoS mitigation solutions in the literature. Studies of this\
    \ nature give insights to both\nnetwork operators seeking an appropriate mitigation\
    \ system for their infrastructure and to developers\nconcerned with implementing\
    \ new mitigation mechanisms. Recent surveys fail to focus on the ﬁeld of\nmitigating\
    \ DDoS attacks harnessing SDN. This knowledge gap hinders our ability to research\
    \ novel\nand effective solutions driven by SDN features. Aside from that, the\
    \ knowledge gap also limits the\nunderstanding about the effects of defense mechanisms\
    \ in the face of certain threat situations resulting\nfrom the wide diversity\
    \ of IoT environments.\nThe herein above-elicited issues motivate our investigations\
    \ on chasing to close such a knowledge\ngap. Hence, the main goal of this paper\
    \ is to enable security-enhanced IoT environments so that\nmitigating DDoS attacks\
    \ through the assistance of SDN features. In light of this main goal, it is\n\
    imperative to follow several key objectives: (i) in-depth investigation proposing\
    \ a taxonomy that\ncovers several dimensions related to defense strategies in\
    \ network infrastructures; (ii) extensive\nanalysis covering the most common application\
    \ scenarios and include a comparative and qualitative\ndiscussion; (iii) correlation\
    \ of types of both mitigation approaches adopted and mitigation strategies\nthrough\
    \ the inclusion of a few comparison parameters. To accomplish the objectives mentioned\
    \ above,\nwe have employed a methodology to support the entire research process,\
    \ which ranges from the\nreview method to the establishment of the taxonomy. The\
    \ following sections provide a full description\nof each of the methodological\
    \ procedures. It is worth mentioning that practical analysis regarding\nimplementation\
    \ and simulation of attacks is out of the scope of the present paper, but is a\
    \ key task in\nour future research directions.\n1.2. Contributions\nThe main research\

    \ 2 we introduce some concepts of\nrelated technologies. In Section 3 we examine\
    \ key research studies that are related to this paper and\ndraws attention to\
    \ what is contributed to by our research. In Section 4 we deﬁne methodologies\
    \ and\nresearch techniques employed in the review, followed by Section 5, where\
    \ we carry out an in-depth\ninvestigation of the state-of-the-art. In Section\
    \ 6 we propose our taxonomy on DDoS attack mitigation\nstrategies employing SDN\
    \ techniques in IoT environments. Finally, in Section 7 we conclude our report\n\
    with some ﬁnal considerations and give some suggestions for future work in this\
    \ area.\n2. Theoretical Background\nWe begin this section by providing key deﬁnitions\
    \ concerning security issues in the Internet of\nThings. We then give an overview\
    \ of Distributed Denial of Service attacks and conclude the section by\nexplaining\
    \ how Software-Deﬁned Networking can be employed for mitigating DDoS attacks.\n\
    2.1. IoT Security\nDespite existing prospects for revolutionizing the current\
    \ computing paradigm, there are still\nseveral IoT security issues that require\
    \ investigation. One of these is the lack of security mechanisms\nin the devices\
    \ embedded in the IoT ecosystem. In particular, their restrictions in terms of\
    \ static\nconﬁgurations and computational resources. These limitations make these\
    \ devices easy targets for\nvarious threats that can be found on the Internet\
    \ [29]. Currently, the most severe security threat in\nthe IoT is that from DDoS\
    \ attacks [30], which remains a signiﬁcant challenge in terms of detection\nand\
    \ mitigation.\nThe wide range of IoT application scenarios has led to several\
    \ different security requirements, and\nit is a difﬁcult task to meet all of them.\
    \ Bawany and Shamsi [31] suggests that the security requirements\nfor IoT applications\
    \ should be assessed in terms of the impact of the DDoS attacks. Table 1 describes\n\
    the effects of DDoS attacks on particular types of IoT applications and summarizes\
    \ the security\nrequirements for each application context [31].\nTable 1. Classiﬁcation\

    \ should be proactive and highly effective in chasing the\nprevention of any type\
    \ of service disruption events. Although they have signiﬁcant social implications,\n\
    applications such as location systems, agricultural automation, and industrial\
    \ systems have a higher\nfault tolerance than essential services (e.g., smart\
    \ grids and healthcare). Furthermore, applications for\nhome automation, water\
    \ supply, and parking control do not need such strict security standards as the\n\

    \ an Internet service) and thus make it impossible for legitimate users\nto access\
    \ it. In this way, DDoS attacks entail seizing control of various devices and\
    \ making use of them,\nto send numerous requests to the victim or to exploit known\
    \ vulnerabilities [28]. DDoS attacks can\nbe divided into three (3) types: (i)\
    \ application-layer attacks; (ii) resource exhaustion attacks; and (iii)\nvolumetric\
    \ attacks [32].\n2.2.1. Application Layer Attacks\nAttacks on the application\
    \ layer attempt to take advantage of vulnerabilities that are present in an\n\
    application or service and can cause instability, thus making it unfeasible for\
    \ legitimate users to gain\naccess. These attacks are often mistaken for implementation\
    \ errors, as low rates of malicious trafﬁc are\nneeded to reproduce the behavior\
    \ of legitimate customers. Thus, these attacks go unnoticed by most\nof the conventional\
    \ detection mechanisms [26].\nA typical attack on the application layer is the\
    \ Slowloris [33]. In this situation, incomplete requests\nare sent to a web server\
    \ at predeﬁned intervals, to keep several connections open for the longest\npossible\
    \ time and, hence, reach the limit for connections that the server can maintain.\
    \ This means\nthat shortly after the attack begins, the server becomes unable\
    \ to receive new connections and then\nbecomes unavailable to legitimate users.\
    \ To ensure it is effective, the Slowloris attack uses the smallest\namount of\
    \ bandwidth possible, which allows it to go unnoticed by detection mechanisms\
    \ triggered by\nanomalies [34] in network trafﬁc.\n2.2.2. Resource Exhaustion\
    \ Attacks\nAttacks in this category aim to deplete hardware resources such as\
    \ memory, CPU, and storage, and\nthus make servers unavailable by exploiting vulnerabilities\
    \ in protocols that are usually implemented\nat the network layer. Therefore,\
    \ exhaustion attacks not only rely on the volume of trafﬁc used but on\nthe combination\
    \ of speciﬁc messages [32].\nThe principal resource exhaustion attacks involve\
    \ exploiting the characteristics of the TCP\ncommunication protocol. A typical\
    \ example of this attack is the TCP SYN Flood, which establishes a\nthree-way\
    \ connection of the TCP protocol to exhaust the space for managing connections\
    \ (backlog).\nTCP SYN Flood is performed by sending SYN messages to the victim,\
    \ using spoofed source\naddresses [35], and thus always making the target establish\
    \ a new connection for the malicious\ncustomer. Then, the target server waits\
    \ for conﬁrmation from the client to complete the establishment\nof the connection,\
    \ which never occurs. Finally, it causes a depletion of the backlog and, hence\
    \ makes it\nimpossible to open new connections.\n2.2.3. Volumetric Attacks\nVolumetric\
    \ attacks aim to make a system unavailable by saturating the communication links\
    \ used\nto access the victim. For this reason, volumetric attacks are much more\
    \ expressive concerning the\namount of trafﬁc generated during their execution\
    \ when compared to application layer attacks and\nresource exhaustion or protocol\
    \ exploitation [36].\nThe most common volumetric attacks exploit any excessive\
    \ increase in packet size using the\nUDP protocol. Well-known examples of volumetric\
    \ attacks are ampliﬁcation attacks [37], which send\nrequests to servers on the\
    \ Internet to alter the source address ﬁeld with the victim’s address. In essence,\n\
    this causes the responses to be ampliﬁed by the servers and thus exhaust the bandwidth\
    \ of the target.\nFor this reason, NTP and DNS servers are mainly used as enablers,\
    \ as they allow high rates of response\nampliﬁcation [38].\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    The beneﬁts introduced by the SDN paradigm, such as the programmability of the\
    \ control plane\nand the ubiquitous management of the network, is encouraging\
    \ the development of new techniques\nfor mitigating virtual threats. The following\
    \ sections describe the main strategies for mitigating DDoS\nattacks that employ\
    \ the SDN paradigm.\n2.3.1. Flow Filtering\nThe ﬂow ﬁltering strategy is implemented\
    \ natively in OpenFlow-compliant devices, which makes\nit the most straightforward\
    \ approach that can be adopted for SDN-based mitigation solutions [39].\nThis\
    \ strategy takes into account the ﬁelds present in the headers of packages that\
    \ arrive at OpenFlow\ndevices to block ﬂows classiﬁed as malicious. Among the\
    \ main parameters that can be used during the\nﬁltering process are: (i) the source\
    \ address; (ii) destination address; (iii) port of origin; (iv) destination\n\
    port; and (v) network layer protocol [40]. Although it is one of the most practical\
    \ alternatives to\nimplement, it still depends on the gathering of statistics\
    \ by the controller as well as on the inspection of\npackets. This approach can\
    \ result in a considerable increase in delay while detecting the DDoS attack,\n\
    which could create a bottleneck in the controller communication interface [41].\n\
    2.3.2. Honeypots\nThis strategy involves using systems in isolated and monitored\
    \ environments that simulate\nthe characteristics of a legitimate target so that\
    \ information can be collected to update the current\ndetection and mitigation\
    \ policies. A honeypot is made available on the Internet, which can be hacked\n\
    by malicious agents who think they are attacking a real target. Although this\
    \ is a traditional attack\nmitigation technique, it can be used in combination\
    \ with SDN, to assist the controller in gathering\ninformation about malicious\
    \ trafﬁc [42].\n2.3.3. Rate Limiting\nA network may become unavailable as a result\
    \ of overload in its communication links, which is\nusually caused by injecting\
    \ a large amount of malicious trafﬁc, as in the case of volumetric attacks.\n\
    In this scenario, the SDN controller can deﬁne a maximum limit for the volume\
    \ of trafﬁc that can\nbe processed by the network without the network becoming\
    \ overloaded. If it reaches the threshold,\nthe network rejects all subsequent\
    \ packages. Furthermore, security applications usually adopt this\nstrategy in\
    \ conjunction with Deep Package Inspection procedures [25].\n2.3.4. Moving Target\
    \ Defense\nThe Moving Target Defense approach entails using techniques to dynamically\
    \ and continuously\nreconﬁgure/update the characteristics of a network or system\
    \ based on a set of random values\nto attempt to prevent attackers from making\
    \ the target system unavailable [43]. One of the main\ntechniques used is the\
    \ randomization of IP and MAC addresses, which makes it difﬁcult to discover\n\
    information about hosts and services on the network during the process and prevent\
    \ possible DDoS\nattacks. Although the use of MTD techniques has been broadly\
    \ adopted to mitigate DDoS attacks [43],\nsome gaps related to these mechanisms\
    \ are considered critical [44], such as the impact in terms of\nperformance and\
    \ cost caused by the deployment of MTD mechanisms on large-scale networks.\n2.3.5.\
    \ Traceback\nTraceback uses the information in packet headers to deﬁne an attacker’s\
    \ real origin. In traditional\nnetworks, the process is complicated because the\
    \ network switches are unable to identify the origin\nof the packets because the\
    \ source address ﬁeld has been falsiﬁed. However, the beneﬁts provided by\nthe\
    \ holistic view of the SDN control plane show the value of ﬁnding mitigation solutions\
    \ based on\ntraceback [45].\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n7 of 28\n2.3.6. Request Prioritization\n\
    In this strategy, a priority value is deﬁned for processing the ﬂows that reach\
    \ the network.\nThe priority works by assigning a default reliability value to\
    \ the source hosts for each new packet-in\nthat arrives at the SDN controller.\
    \ The reliability value is based on the trafﬁc history of each host.\nThis value\
    \ may vary over time as a result of suspicious activity (e.g., when a large number\
    \ of ﬂows\nis generated in short time intervals), and this results in a reduced\
    \ reliability value. In addition,\nif the source has a low conﬁdentiality value\
    \ (which is deﬁned by the system administrator), its ﬂows\nare rejected.\n3. Related\
    \ Work\nThe literature reveals that many studies have been carried out in recent\
    \ years to foster discussion\non general and speciﬁc security issues in IoT networks.\
    \ In the following, we encourage discussion on a\nset of recent studies in this\
    \ regard and raise our ﬁndings on the analysis.\nKouicem et al. [46] conducted\
    \ a study on general aspects of IoT security, i.e., conﬁdentiality,\nprivacy,\
    \ availability, and mitigation of DDoS attacks. In this study, the authors highlighted\
    \ speciﬁc\napplications in e-health scenarios, smart grids, and smart cities.\n\
    As a result of their analyses,\nthe solutions reviewed were classiﬁed, and took\
    \ into account factors based on the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies such as\
    \ blockchain and SDN.\nIn Cherian and Chatterjee [29], the authors reviewed several\
    \ mechanisms designed to solve\nproblems related to general aspects of information\
    \ security, and also examined emerging technologies\nsuch as SDN, blockchain,\
    \ and Machine Learning [47].\nFarris et al. [48] analyzed several attacks that\
    \ can compromise the security of IoT devices, such as\nthe spreading of malicious\
    \ code, DDoS attacks, and attacks on routing devices. In addition, there is a\n\
    comprehensive discussion of the beneﬁts provided by the Network Function Virtualization\
    \ (NFV) and\nSDN technologies for ﬁnding solutions for the mitigation of the investigated\
    \ threats.\nThe reviews carried out in Kalkan and Zeadally [49] and Kanagavelu\
    \ and Aung [27] provide\nan overview of solutions that use SDN to protect IoT\
    \ infrastructures. The authors held discussions\nabout the analyzed studies and\
    \ examined the question from the perspective of making a comparison\nbetween their\
    \ advantages and disadvantages.\nLohachab and Karambir [28], Vishwakarma and Jain\
    \ [26], and Salim et al. [50] created taxonomies\nthat examine existing DDoS attacks,\
    \ and assessed their impact in different layers of the IoT\ninfrastructure. In\
    \ addition, the studies reviewed several mechanisms for detecting and mitigating\n\
    DDoS attacks with a focus on schemes that address technologies such as machine\
    \ learning, blockchain,\nand SDN.\nThe analysis of the related literature reveals\
    \ that several previous studies have dealt with\nthe question of how to mitigate\
    \ DDoS attacks in IoT scenarios by employing SDN technologies.\nHowever, the authors\
    \ decided to conduct their studies in a more all-inclusive context and ignored\n\
    speciﬁc features of the scenario under investigation. Table 2 summarizes the contributions\
    \ made by\nprevious studies and compares them with the proposal outlined here.\
    \ The comparison is made based\non four (4) parameters that are deﬁned in line\
    \ with the related studies to ensure a fair comparison.\nThe comparative items\
    \ are described below:\n1.\nNumber of solutions reviewed: the higher the number\
    \ of mitigation solutions included in a study,\nthe more the sample can form the\
    \ basis of information necessary to assist in understanding the\npattern of current\
    \ mitigation solutions;\n2.\nClassiﬁcation of mitigation solutions: the classiﬁcation\
    \ of solutions provides a means of\nmaking it easier to understand how each solution\
    \ implements its mitigation process and, hence,\ncan characterize the current\
    \ mitigation of DDoS attacks in IoT scenarios;\n3.\nComparison of mitigation solutions:\
    \ a comparison of mitigation solutions is essential for selecting\nthe mechanisms\
    \ that can be best adapted to the needs of heterogeneous scenarios;\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3078\n8 of 28\n4.\nIdentiﬁcation of future trends: the identiﬁcation of\
    \ promising strategies for the development of\nfuture mitigation mechanisms helps\
    \ researchers who are concerned with ﬁnding new mitigation\nsolutions to select\
    \ the techniques that best suit their speciﬁc needs.\nTable 2. Analysis of contributions\

    \ results shown in Table 2 reveal a signiﬁcant disparity between the related works\
    \ about\nthis scheme. It is evident that the main objective of previous studies\
    \ was not to carry out a\ncomprehensive study of DDoS mitigation measures in IoT\
    \ environments that make use of SDN\ntechnologies. Furthermore, none of these\
    \ previous studies encouraged any extensive discussion of\nhow to provide a classiﬁcation\
    \ and create a taxonomy capable of describing and characterizing the\nsolutions\
    \ under investigation.\n4. Review Research Method\nThe search strategy used in\
    \ this work followed the method employed by Aleesa et al. [52],\nas outlined in\
    \ Figure 1. This includes the following four (4) stages:\n1.\nSelection of the\
    \ appropriate digital libraries to carry out the search;\n2.\nDeﬁnition of a search\
    \ term based on keywords related to the subject under study;\n3.\nSelection of\
    \ studies recovered automatically from digital libraries. The decision to include\
    \ and\nexclude each work retrieved is based on their titles and abstracts;\n4.\n\
    Selection process in which each study retrieved from the initial selection is\
    \ fully read\nand analyzed.\nOther factors that may be noted when conducting a\
    \ literature review, such as the research question,\nwere not regarded as essential\
    \ for carrying out this work and have, therefore, not been included in the\nmethodology.\
    \ The searches were conducted between February 2019 and March 2020. Figure 1 outlines\n\
    the steps taken to follow the search strategy adopted for this study. The results\
    \ are shown in Figure 1\nalso include the number of studies selected in each stage.\
    \ For a fuller understanding, in the following\nsection, we provide details about\
    \ how the research strategy was implemented.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n9 of 28\n\
    Figure 1. Flowchart for the selection of papers.\n4.1. Selecting Digital Libraries\n\
    As shown in Figure 1, the search process has been conducted in the most relevant\
    \ digital libraries\nin computer science and engineering, namely:\n1.\nACM Digital\
    \ Library (https://dl.acm.org/);\n2.\nIEEE Xplore (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/);\n\
    3.\nScience Direct (https://www.sciencedirect.com/);\n4.\nScopus (https://www.scopus.com/);\n\
    5.\nSpringer Link (https://link.springer.com/);\n6.\nWeb of Science (https://apps.webofknowledge.com/);\n\
    7.\nWiley (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/);\nIn addition to the studies from\
    \ the above mentioned digital libraries, there are other relevant\nstudies have\
    \ been identiﬁed using the following automatic search engines:\n1.\nDblp (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/);\n\
    2.\nGoogle Scholar (https://scholar.google.com);\nThe criterion for source selection\
    \ was the relevance of the open bibliographical information\nin major areas of\
    \ computer science, as well as engineering journals and conference proceedings,\n\
    where high-impact scientiﬁc production can be found [39,53].\n4.2. Search Term\
    \ Used for the Filter\nThe search term used in this work has been deﬁned on the\
    \ basis of a combination of keywords\nrelated to the subject under study. The\
    \ generic form of the search term was based on the acronyms\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 3078\n10 of 28\n“IOT” AND “SDN” AND “DDOS”, used to retrieve the maximum number\
    \ of potential key studies.\nThis term was ﬁnally translated into the formats\
    \ accepted by each library.\n4.3. Filtering Based on Titles and Abstracts\nThe\
    \ titles and abstracts of all the documents from digital libraries and search\
    \ engines were\nanalyzed during the initial selection process based on a set of\
    \ study selection criteria. This set includes\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria\
    \ described below:\n•\nInclusion criteria: (i) studies reporting IoT network security\
    \ approaches using SDN; (ii) studies\naddressing DDoS attacks on IoT-SDN networks;\n\
    •\nExclusion criteria: (i) studies that cannot be validated in full text; (ii)\
    \ previous versions of more\ncomplete studies; (iii) studies unrelated to the\
    \ subject of this research; (iv) studies published in\nany language other than\
    \ English.\nThe ﬁrst inclusion criterion is more comprehensive than the second\
    \ criterion. This ﬁrst criterion\nallows the search to cover studies that address\
    \ a broader scope of network security in IoT-SDN\nscenarios, including but not\
    \ limited to DDoS. In this case, the concluding remarks and related work\nsections\
    \ were further analyzed to determine whether a study should be included or excluded.\n\
    4.4. Selection Based on Full Reading\nThe second selection process involved reading\
    \ and analyzing each pre-selected study. During the\nreading stage, all the relevant\
    \ information was extracted from the study, including contextualization,\nproblem\
    \ deﬁnition, proposed solution, and evaluation method.\nFinally, a qualitative\
    \ analysis\nof the extracted data was carried out, and the main ﬁndings were used\
    \ as input to outline the\nproposed taxonomy.\n5. Comprehensive Review of Selected\
    \ Publications\nAn appropriate selection of the mitigation strategy to be adopted\
    \ in the design of a scheme for\nmitigating DDoS attacks is of the utmost importance\
    \ since it determines the pattern of behavior of\nthe solution. For this reason,\
    \ the following sections examine the solutions reviewed by this study,\ncategorized\
    \ according to the mitigation strategies employed, namely: (i) Cosine Similarity;\
    \ (ii) Flow\nFiltering; (iii) Rate Limiting; (iv) Moving Target Defense; (v) Traceback;\
    \ (vi) Request Prioritization;\nand (vii) Collaboration Between Multiple Mitigation\
    \ Strategies.\n5.1. Cosine Similarity\nYin et al. [54] introduce the SD-IoT framework.\
    \ SD-IoT employs an algorithm based on the cosine\nsimilarity technique to carry\
    \ out DDoS attack mitigation. The algorithm in question compares the rate\nof\
    \ packets arriving at the controller at predetermined time intervals with a pre-established\
    \ ideal limit.\nThis approach enables the classiﬁcation of devices sending several\
    \ packets that exceed the amount\nallowed by the network. This solution proved\
    \ to be effective in mitigating DDoS attacks based on high\ntrafﬁc rates.\n5.2.\
    \ Flow Filtering\nXu et al. [55] discuss the constraints imposed on the use of\
    \ a single controller to manage\nIoT infrastructures. Furthermore, the authors\
    \ argue that this centralized approach jeopardizes the\nscalability of the network.\
    \ A clear example of this is the fact that each new packet that arrives at the\n\
    switches must be sent to the controller for the conﬁguration of ﬂow rules. However,\
    \ if the number of\nrequests is high, the control link between switch and controller\
    \ can become overloaded. As a result,\nthe controller is not able to process new\
    \ ﬂow requests and, consequently, the entire network becomes\nunavailable. The\
    \ authors designed the Smart Security Mechanism (SSM) to overcome this problem.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n11 of 28\nThis mechanism collects statistics regarding\
    \ the rate of unmatched ﬂows at each switch over time.\nThe collected statistics\
    \ allow the values for the correspondence limits to be deﬁned. Switches with\n\
    values below the limit ar classiﬁed as suspect. Following this, trafﬁc from the\
    \ suspicious switches is\nsent to a security middleware that is responsible for\
    \ blocking malicious ﬂows.\nÖzçelik et al. [56] present the Edge-Centric Software-Deﬁned\
    \ IoT Defense (ECESID) architecture.\nECESID was designed to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ originating from IoT devices infected by malicious\nagents, such as the Mirai\
    \ botnet. According to the authors, the closer to the source, the lower the\n\
    cost incurred for detecting and mitigating attacks. For this reason, the architecture\
    \ is based on the\ndeployment of small infrastructures close to the protected\
    \ networks. These infrastructures can analyze\nall outgoing trafﬁc and check if\
    \ there are any infected devices. This task is carried out through the\nThreshold\
    \ Random Walk employing the Credit-Based Rate Limiting (TRW-CB) algorithm. TRW-CB\n\
    is based on the number of unsuccessful connection attempts per second. Then, trafﬁc\
    \ from infected\ndevices is completely blocked.\nSalva-Garcia et al. [40] and\
    \ Molina Zarca et al. [57] introduce a security architecture for large-scale\n\
    wireless networks based on three (3) planes: (i) Admin Plane; (ii) Security Orchestration\
    \ Plane;\nand (iii) Security Enforcement Plane. The mitigation process implements\
    \ policies deﬁned by the\nnetwork administrator through the Admin Plane. These\
    \ policies are then translated into low-level\nconﬁgurations and forwarded to\
    \ the Security Orchestration Plane. The Security Orchestration Plane is\nalso\
    \ responsible for monitoring the network, detecting attacks based on a trafﬁc\
    \ signature database,\nand selecting the appropriate security policy to mitigate\
    \ the attack. After selecting the mitigation policy,\nthe Security Enforcement\
    \ Plane installs it on the SDN switches located at the edge of the network.\n\
    Another group of studies proposes architectures with a focus on mitigating DDoS\
    \ attacks\non large-scale networks. These solutions, proposed by Yan et al. [42],\
    \ Nguyen et al. [58],\nand Rathore et al. [59], use distributed controllers to\
    \ address the centralized management limitations\nof the traditional SDN architecture.\
    \ These architectures are divided into the following:\n•\nEdge: composed of devices\
    \ responsible for ensuring access control, secure data communication,\nand the\
    \ application of security rules for managing local area networks;\n•\nFog: composed\
    \ of SDN controllers responsible for detecting threats, deﬁning the appropriate\n\
    mitigation policies, and sending them to the devices at the edge layer. In addition,\
    \ they periodically\nreport the records of events that have occurred to the cloud\
    \ layer;\n•\nCloud: contains a holistic view of all managed IoT domains and is,\
    \ therefore, able to identify\nattack patterns from different domains. In this\
    \ way, mitigation policies at the global level can\nbe established.\nYang et al.\
    \ [60] propose a distributed mitigation architecture that makes use of SDN-based\
    \ IoT\ngateways deployed at the edge of the network. The gateways are designed\
    \ with enhanced capabilities\nfor detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. SDNIGWs\
    \ are composed of three (3) modules: (i) Learning\nModule; (ii) Detection Module,\
    \ and; (iii) Flow Management Module. The Learning Module collects\nﬂow statistics\
    \ and uses them to train the machine learning-based classiﬁcation algorithm. The\
    \ Detection\nModule performs the classiﬁcation of malicious ﬂows and, if so, sends\
    \ the source addresses to be\nblocked using the ﬁlter rules deﬁned by the Flow\
    \ Management Module.\nRaﬁque et al. [61] address the problem of control-link overhead\
    \ between switches and controllers,\nas discussed in Xu et al. [55]. In this context,\
    \ the authors introduce the SDIoT-Edge Security (SIESec)\nframework. SIESec makes\
    \ use of the Edge Computing [62] paradigm to deploy cloudlets close to IoT\nnetworks.\
    \ Each cloudlet implements an instance of SIESec and carries out the detection\
    \ and mitigation\nof DDoS attacks by reducing the processing load on the IoT infrastructure.\
    \ SIESec is composed of six (6)\nmodules: (i) Collector; (ii) Packet Inspector;\
    \ (iii) Feature Extraction; (iv) Classiﬁer; (v) Status Analyzer;\nand (vi) Rule\
    \ Generator. Initially, the Collector module continuously monitors the trafﬁc\
    \ at each switch\nand sends trafﬁc statistics to the Packet Inspector and Feature\
    \ Extraction. These modules pre-process\neach ﬂow and then send samples from the\
    \ trafﬁc to the Classiﬁer, which uses the Self Organization\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 3078\n12 of 28\nMaps (SOM) algorithm to classify each ﬂow as either malicious\
    \ or benign. The Status Analyzer then\nforwards the benign ﬂows to their destination,\
    \ and the malicious ﬂows to be analyzed by the Rule\nGenerator, which is responsible\
    \ for deﬁning which appropriate ﬁltering rules should be applied.\nKrishnan et\
    \ al. [63] set out a multi-layer architecture called Advanced MultiplAne SecuRity\n\
    Framework for Software Deﬁned Networks (VARMAN), which is designed for the detection\
    \ and\nmitigation of DDoS attacks in SDN-based IoT data centers. The detection\
    \ of malicious ﬂows is aided\nby several machine-learning algorithms and takes\
    \ place during the selection and classiﬁcation stages.\nThe mitigation process\
    \ makes use of NFV features that assist in the deployment of several virtual\n\
    nodes with ﬁltering capabilities. Moreover, VARMAN architecture provides load\
    \ balancing between\nSDN controllers.\nBawany and Shamsi [31] introduce the SDN-Based\
    \ Secure and Agile Framework for Protecting\nSmart Applications (SEAL). The primary\
    \ purpose of the SEAL is to provide security for IoT application\ndata centers.\
    \ SEAL can prioritize the mitigation of DDoS attacks for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on\ntheir security requirements and their assessment of the impact that\
    \ would be caused by their failure.\nSEAL is also designed to prevent DDoS attacks\
    \ on the SDN architecture itself. The framework consists\nof three (3) key modules:\
    \ (i) A-Defense; (ii) C-Defense; and (iii) D-Defense. The A-Defense module\ndetects\
    \ and mitigates DDoS attacks at the application level. It takes account of the\
    \ individual trafﬁc\ndesigned for each IoT application and prioritizes the applications\
    \ by their security requirements, which\nmight be critical, moderate, or low.\
    \ An entropy-based detection algorithm assists in the mitigation\nprocess to determine\
    \ which malicious ﬂows must be blocked. C-Defense is responsible for performing\n\
    the load balancing between controllers. Finally, D-Defense is responsible protect\
    \ the data plane and\nuses a model based on trafﬁc statistics for this task.\n\
    Ravi and Shalinie [64] employ cloud computing techniques in conjunction with SDN\
    \ to mitigate\nDDoS attacks on IoT servers. They have introduced a new mechanism\
    \ called Learning-Driven\nDetection Mitigation (LEDEM), which detects DDoS attacks\
    \ with the aid of a semi-supervised machine\nlearning algorithm. The machine learning\
    \ algorithm is responsible for identifying all the malicious\nﬂows that reach\
    \ the network and informing the controller of the addresses of the customers that\n\
    can be classiﬁed as malicious. Based on this information, the controller can deﬁne\
    \ the appropriate\nﬁltering rules.\nNair et al. [65] devise a mitigation mechanism\
    \ that draws on information about the relationship\nbetween IP and MAC addresses\
    \ to determine the occurrence of DDOS attacks in a short time.\nThe mechanism\
    \ checks whether a source MAC address is linked to more than one source IP address,\n\
    as this can indicate the existence of malicious clients with a forged IP. As well\
    \ as this, the mechanism\nuses other parameters such as packet delay time, the\
    \ number of entries in the ﬂow tables, and the\naverage time needed for the receipt\
    \ of the packets (per second) by the controller to deﬁne a threshold\nvalue that\
    \ determines the existence of a DDoS attack.\nHouda et al. [66] employ blockchain\
    \ in conjunction with SDN to design Co-IoT, a secure, low-cost,\nﬂexible, and\
    \ efﬁcient collaboration scheme against DDoS attacks in IoT environments. Co-IoT\
    \ relies on\nsmart contracts [67] as a way of sharing information about DDoS attacks\
    \ between underlying SDN\ndomains in a secure and decentralized way. Initially,\
    \ each SDN domain has to create and make use of a\ncollaboration agreement, which\
    \ is carried out through a simpliﬁed process. After this, two (2) or more\nSDN\
    \ domains establish a trust agreement and set up a network of authorized domains.\
    \ In this way,\nwhenever one of the domains is the victim of a DDoS attack, it\
    \ transfers a list of malicious addresses to\nthe domain of origin of the attacks\
    \ to block these devices.\nGaleano-Brajones et al. [68] explore the OpenState,\
    \ an extension of the Openﬂow protocol that\nprovides SDN switches with the ability\
    \ to store information about ﬂows already processed, in addition\nto storing the\
    \ rules existing in the ﬂow tables. Thus, part of the intelligence related to\
    \ containing\nDDoS attacks on IoT networks is transferred to the switches, reducing\
    \ the controller load. In addition,\nthe authors use the entropy technique to\
    \ identify malicious trafﬁc by the controller, which deﬁnes the\nappropriate ﬁltering\
    \ rules to mitigate the attack.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n13 of 28\n5.3. Rate Limiting\n\
    Sharma et al. [69] put forward the ShSec, an architecture for protecting small\
    \ IoT networks.\nThis mechanism is designed to mitigate volumetric DDoS attacks\
    \ and perform its detection process\nbased on ﬂow samples collected from the network\
    \ edge SDN switches. This strategy reduces the\namount of trafﬁc sent to the controller\
    \ and assists in preventing overloads. In addition, ShSec uses\nbuffers on each\
    \ switch as an additional strategy to mitigate the number of legitimate packets\
    \ dropped\nin the wake of a DDoS attack.\n5.4. Moving Target Defense—MTD\nKrishnan\
    \ et al. [70] introduce a distributed and hierarchical architecture for large-scale\
    \ networks,\nconsisting of four (4) layers, namely: (i) Cloud; (ii) Edge; (iii)\
    \ SDN; and (iv) IoT. High-level management\nis conducted from the cloud layer,\
    \ which deﬁnes security policies and forwards them to the edge\nlayer. In the\
    \ border layer, there are gateways with SDN support, which forward the trafﬁc\
    \ to the SDN\nlayer. In turn, the SDN layer processes trafﬁc from external domains.\
    \ The authors carried out a case\nstudy on the use of this architecture against\
    \ HTTP Flooding DDoS attacks. Mitigation takes place by\nexcluding illegitimate\
    \ connections and changing the target’s IP address. A message is sent to all the\n\
    customers with advice about the redirection, along with a CAPTCHA-like computational\
    \ challenge.\nSince malicious agents are instructed employing pre-deﬁned commands,\
    \ they are unable to decode the\ncomputational challenge and continue to attack\
    \ the old address. In this way, only legitimate customers\nremain connected.\n\
    5.5. Traceback\nChen et al. [45] provide an architecture that is capable of identifying\
    \ and mitigating DDoS\nattacks targeted smart city infrastructures as close as\
    \ possible to their source. The main purpose of\nthe scheme is to create an algorithm\
    \ that is capable of collecting ﬂow statistics from base stations\nthrough a conventional\
    \ operation. These statistics are then used to deﬁne an acceptable trafﬁc limit.\n\
    Thus, devices that may be generating trafﬁc above the threshold established for\
    \ a short period are\ntreated as suspicious and added to an anomaly tree. Then,\
    \ an additional stage of checking the anomaly\ntree is performed to determine\
    \ whether the suspect devices are malicious or not. The devices that are\nclassiﬁed\
    \ as malicious may have their trafﬁc blocked, depending on the mitigation strategy\
    \ selected by\nthe network administrator.\n5.6. Request Prioritization\nSarwar\
    \ et al. [71] present FlowJustiﬁer, a request prioritization algorithm based on\
    \ a trust return\nvalue list, which seeks to mitigate the DDoS attacks that target\
    \ the SDN-based IoT infrastructure control\nplane. The list employs conﬁdence\
    \ values to classify users according to their level of conﬁdentiality,\nwhich\
    \ is established based on the records of each user’s network activities. This\
    \ means that whenever a\nuser’s ﬂow request reaches the controller, the list of\
    \ conﬁdence values is checked to deﬁne the degree of\npriority required for processing\
    \ that user’s request. The trust list values are updated by the controller\nin\
    \ real-time whenever a new ﬂow request is processed. Thus, it is also possible\
    \ to block a sender’s\nﬂows if the sender starts sending more requests than usual.\n\
    5.7. Collaboration between Multiple Mitigation Strategies\nIn addition to the\
    \ use of specialized techniques for particular scenarios, the related literature\n\
    revealed the adoption of solutions based on collaboration between different mitigation\
    \ strategies.\nThrough this kind of integration, it is possible to offer a series\
    \ of beneﬁts, including more ﬂexible\nsolutions and the ability to mitigate a\
    \ signiﬁcantly greater number of DDoS attacks. Concerning this,\nthe main strategies\
    \ adopted are Trafﬁc ﬁltering, Machine Learning, and Trafﬁc redirection.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 3078\n14 of 28\nBull et al. [72] set out a distributed, ﬂexible, and\
    \ modular SDN architecture capable of mitigating a\nwide range of DDoS attacks\
    \ at the edge of the network. The architecture is composed of the following\n\
    layers: (i) IoT Access; (ii) Distribution Layer; and (iii) Control Layer. The\
    \ IoT Access layer consists of\nseveral IoT devices arranged in different domains.\
    \ In turn, the Distribution Layer is formed of SDN\nswitches that are responsible\
    \ for monitoring the trafﬁc coming from the devices in the IoT Access layer.\n\
    At the top of the architecture is the Control Layer, which has a pool of controllers\
    \ capable of managing\ntrafﬁc statistics from all protected IoT domains. The Control\
    \ Layer is also responsible for deﬁning\npolicies to contain malicious ﬂows, and\
    \ Rate Limiting and Flow Filtering strategies are used together\nto achieve this\
    \ goal.\nBhunia and Gurusamy [25] design the SoftThings, a distributed architecture\
    \ for mitigating a wide\nrange of DDoS attacks on small networks. The SoftThings\
    \ architecture is segmented into four (4) layers:\n(i) IoT devices; (ii) SDN switches;\
    \ (iii) SDN cluster controller; and (iii) SDN master controller. A set of\nIoT\
    \ networks represents a cluster. Each cluster is assigned an SDN cluster controller\
    \ that is responsible\nfor its management and for deﬁning local mitigation policies.\
    \ In this way, each SDN cluster controller\nmust periodically compile a report\
    \ on the trafﬁc statistics of the managed networks and send it to\nthe SDN master\
    \ controller, which is the central entity of SoftThings and has an overview of\
    \ the entire\ninfrastructure. This means it is in a position to deﬁne policies\
    \ based on Flow ﬁltering that will be\napplied globally.\nSahay et al. [73] introduce\
    \ a mechanism for protecting communication systems on ships\n(i.e., a satellite\
    \ navigation system) that is capable of detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks.\
    \ The system\nworks through a high-level language used to specify mitigation policies\
    \ that can be eventually selected\nby the network administrator and is applicable\
    \ to several types of DDoS attacks. Filtering and\nredirection of malicious trafﬁc\
    \ are available as some of the policies that can be implemented.\nRaﬁque et al.\
    \ [74] put forward CFADefense, a mechanism for mitigating Crossﬁre DDoS attacks.\n\
    The CFADefense architecture is implemented in three (3) modules: (i) Link Selection;\
    \ (ii) Attack\nDetection; and (iii) Malicious Flow Interception. In seeking to\
    \ mitigate the ﬂows from Crossﬁre\nAttack, CFADefense monitors the trafﬁc on each\
    \ link in the network and selects those with the highest\nutilization rate so\
    \ that they can be analyzed by Attack Detection. In turn, Attack Detection calculates\n\
    various statistics associated with the selected links, such as packet loss, jitter,\
    \ RTT, and throughput\nto determine the level of congestion. Once a Crossﬁre attack\
    \ has been detected, the Malicious Flow\nInterception redirects the trafﬁc on\
    \ the target link and enforces the blocking of malicious ﬂows.\nLuo et al. [75]\
    \ provide a defense method based on SDN, MTD, and honeypots that are capable\n\
    of protecting IoT environments against DDoS attacks. This method implements an\
    \ MTD strategy,\nwhich keeps changing the IP address of the devices to make it\
    \ difﬁcult for attackers to discover active\nhosts. As well as this, a second\
    \ mechanism manages several SDN-based honeypots and replicates the\nbehavior of\
    \ legitimate IoT devices to discover the activities of the attackers. By this\
    \ means, the SDN\ncontroller can use the information provided by the honeypots\
    \ to detect and block trafﬁc coming from\nattackers in real-time.\n6. Taxonomy\
    \ of DDoS Attack Migitation Approaches—Supported Featured by SDN Devices\nFacilities\
    \ to Defend IoT\nIn this section, we introduce our taxonomy intending to describe\
    \ and characterize DDoS attack\nmitigation approaches to assist the SDN defense\
    \ of IoT environments. First, there is a compiled\nclassiﬁcation that includes\
    \ the following: technology, granularity, a mitigation strategy, and IoT use\n\
    case. Each scheme is compared on an individual basis with a set of selected parameters\
    \ from the\ncurrent literature. From this point on, we outline how solutions need\
    \ to be improved and examine\nsome of the main factors that have not been addressed.\
    \ Following this, we describe the main trends in\nthe current state-of-the-art\
    \ on DDoS mitigation. Finally, we make some suggestions for future research.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n15 of 28\n6.1. Classiﬁcation of Reviewed Studies\nIn an\
    \ attempt order to compile deﬁne an appropriate classiﬁcation for the solutions\
    \ reviewed in\nthe previous section, this section establishes a taxonomy based\
    \ on how each study forms a plan for\nperforming the mitigation of a DDoS attack.\
    \ The following characteristics are taken into account:\n1.\nWhether the mitigation\
    \ strategy is implemented collaboratively by distributed network elements\nor\
    \ a single controller is responsible for the identiﬁcation, containment, and remediation\
    \ stages of\nDDoS mitigation management. The setting for distributed transactions\
    \ provides greater reliability\nas having a centralized controller is a notable\
    \ point of failure in the network and therefore a target\nfor attackers [76];\n\
    2.\nWhether other technologies, apart from SDN, have been used in the DDoS mitigation\
    \ strategy.\nFog computing, for example, has aroused considerable interest in\
    \ the network security community,\nsince it provides an opportunity to bring mitigation\
    \ resources closer to the place where the attack\nis launched;\n3.\nThe type of\
    \ mitigation strategy recommended;\n4.\nWhether the solution has been planned\
    \ for a particular IoT scenario, in works where the authors\ndo not clearly deﬁne\
    \ an IoT scenario, it can be assumed that the designed solution is intended to\n\
    be used in any IoT application scenario.\nFigure 2 outlines these characteristics\
    \ by creating a taxonomy for the classiﬁcation of DDoS\nsecurity solutions in\
    \ IoT-SDN networks. For a further understanding, the main features of this\ntaxonomy\
    \ are outlined as follows:\n•\nNon-collaborative solutions: there is no sharing\
    \ of information (e.g., trafﬁc statistics and malicious\nsource addresses) between\
    \ network elements (e.g., controllers, IoT gateways with SDN support)\nthat supply\
    \ the intelligence needed to deﬁne and enforce mitigation policies in the SDN-based\n\
    IoT network;\n–\nPure SDN: follows a “pure” (fully-centralized) SDN approach,\
    \ where a single controller is\nresponsible for responding to DDoS threats;\n\
    –\nHybrid SDN-Fog: combines centralized SDN and distributed fog computing in a\
    \ hybrid\ndesign that selects the best features of the two (2) paradigms.\n•\n\
    Collaborative Solutions: the controller must exchange information with external\
    \ systems to\nimplement a coordinated DDoS mitigation strategy.\n–\nHybrid SDN-Fog-Cloud:\n\
    establishes a multi-layer architecture that encompasses\ncloud-computing and fog-computing\
    \ layers.\nThe fog-layers provide an infrastructure\nto mitigate attacks near\
    \ the edge of the network that is being defended.\nIn addition,\nthese fog-layers\
    \ send information about security incidents and network trafﬁc to the cloud\n\
    layer. The cloud layer uses this information to deﬁne the global mitigation policies\
    \ that the\nfog-layers must implement.\n–\nHybrid SDN-Blockchain: leverages blockchain\
    \ technology to implement DDoS mitigation\nin a decentralized and reliable manner.\
    \ The smart contract mechanism ensures that there is\na secure collaboration between\
    \ the distributed SDN controllers and enables them to block\nmalicious ﬂows as\
    \ close to their source in the network as possible.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n\

    To provide an adequate comparison between the mitigation solutions reviewed in\
    \ the previous\nSection 5, we established items considered of high relevance to\

    \ of internal and external incidents: while it is essential to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ from\nexternal domains, mitigation solutions must identify compromised devices\
    \ on their network,\nespecially to prevent from malicious agents to use these\
    \ devices for performing DDoS attacks\ntargeting domains on the Internet;\n2.\n\
    Mitigation of multiple DDoS attacks types: solutions for mitigating DDoS attacks\
    \ in IoT\nenvironments must consider both conventional attacks (volumetric) as\
    \ well more sophisticated\nattacks that aim to exhaust beyond the bandwidth several\
    \ other computational resources, such as\nmemory and processing of the target\
    \ applications;\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n18 of 28\n3.\nSupporting the SDN control\
    \ plane to prevent overloads: despite providing several beneﬁts for\nmitigating\
    \ DDoS attacks in IoT environments, the SDN control plane can become the target\
    \ of\nDDoS attacks directed to exhausting its resources, such as (i) link bandwidth\
    \ between switch and\nSDN controller; and (ii) the number of rules stored in the\
    \ ﬂow tables, overloading the TCAM\nmemory of the OpenFlow switches;\n4.\nCollaborative\
    \ mitigation: performing DDoS mitigation using only a single controller can\n\
    cause issues regarding network scalability and fault tolerance.\nFor this reason,\
    \ it is of\nimmense importance to distribute the mitigation process among several\
    \ entities that can make\nmitigation collaboratively to improve performance efﬁciency\
    \ and avoid single points of failure in\nthe network.\nObserving Table 3, none\
    \ of the conducted studies are able to match all the elicited items.\nThe solutions\
    \ that employ cloud and fog computing paradigms, in conjunction with SDN, were\n\
    the that reached closest. In contrast, the solutions that perform the mitigation\
    \ only at the edge-side of\nthe network, leveraging the traditional SDN approach,\
    \ are the ones that most limited and do not meet\nthe requirements deﬁned in the\
    \ present study.\n6.3. Overview of the DDoS Attack Mitigation Scenario Harnessing\
    \ SDN in IoT Environments\nThe adoption of the SDN paradigm to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ in IoT environments is a relatively\nnew research topic. According to studies\
    \ available in the literature, researchers published the ﬁrst\nSDN-IoT mitigation\
    \ solution in 2016 [72]. Since then, the community has been developed several\n\
    mitigation mechanisms in this context. In this way, the ﬁrst solutions developed\
    \ attempted to address\nfrequent and well-explored attacks in the literature,\
    \ such as the mitigation of volumetric attacks using\nthe traditional SDN architecture.\
    \ However, since 2019 solutions have evolved substantially, and new\nmechanisms\
    \ based on the fog computing paradigm have started to be employed on the development\n\
    of distributed architectures capable of mitigating new types of DDoS attacks based\
    \ on low trafﬁc rates.\nIn light of this, Table 4 summarizes the DDoS types considered\
    \ by the analyzed solutions.\nAccording to Table 4, we note that volumetric and\
    \ exhaust attacks received much more attention\nfrom mitigation solutions when\
    \ compared to attacks on the application layer. In this regard, it is crucial\n\
    to consider that volumetric and exhaustion DDoS attacks are mainly based on directing\
    \ large amounts\nof malicious trafﬁc to the target network. This characteristic\
    \ facilitates its identiﬁcation by mechanisms\nthat use more uncomplicated mitigation\
    \ strategies, such as those that establish limits for trafﬁc arriving\non the\
    \ network (whether malicious or not). In addition, attacks aimed at the application\
    \ layer are\nbased on sending fragmented requests in different parts, such as\
    \ DDoS attacks with slow requests and\nresponses, which are easily able to disguise\
    \ themselves between legitimate trafﬁc due to the use of low\ntrafﬁc rates during\
    \ its execution. Consequently, this feature allows circumventing mechanisms based\n\
    on the identiﬁcation of anomalies in network trafﬁc, making the identiﬁcation\
    \ of this type of attack\nmore complex.\nAttacks aimed at the application layer\
    \ are undertaken by sending fragmented requests in different\nparts, such as DDoS\
    \ attacks with slow requests and responses; however, these are easily distinguished\n\
    from legitimate trafﬁc because they rely on low trafﬁc rates during their execution.\
    \ Hence, this feature\nallows circumventing mechanisms to be put into effect that\
    \ is based on their ability to detect anomalies\nin network trafﬁc, and thus make\
    \ the identiﬁcation of this type of attack more complex.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n\

    \ the analysis of network ﬂow statistics to detect anomalous actions\nare efﬁcient\
    \ in containing volumetric attacks, which are based on high trafﬁc rates [80].\
    \ Concerning\nthis, there are solutions based on the following strategies: rate\
    \ limiting, cosine similarity, traceback,\nand ﬂow prioritization, as outlined\
    \ in Table 5. However, when there is a need to mitigate DDoS attacks\nbased on\
    \ the dispatch of small trafﬁc fees to exploit particular vulnerabilities in the\
    \ services offered by\nthe IoT infrastructure, techniques based on statistical\
    \ analysis are ineffective. The main reason for this\nineffectiveness is that\
    \ they are based on anomalous behavior in the network trafﬁc and thus unable to\n\
    trigger the mitigation process. Only Krishnan et al. [63] and Raﬁque et al. [61]\
    \ were able to mitigate\nDDoS attacks with low rates through trafﬁc ﬁltering and\
    \ by adopting machine learning algorithms.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n20 of 28\n\

    Figure 3 shows the distribution of mitigation solutions for IoT scenarios. It\
    \ seems that more\nthan half of the reviewed solutions were not found for a speciﬁc\
    \ IoT scenario. For organizational\npurposes, we decided to classify mitigation\
    \ solutions as “generic” when the authors did not clearly\ndeﬁne which IoT scenario\
    \ they were applied to. It was found that mitigation solutions that focused\n\
    on the SDN control plane and smart homes represented 88% of the solutions reviewed.\
    \ On the other\nhand, some IoT scenarios, that had been less explored by the scientiﬁc\
    \ community, had only a single\nmitigation solution, namely: (i) IoT Data Centers;\
    \ (ii) Industrial IoT; and (iii) Maritime Communication\nInfrastructure. As a\
    \ result, the solutions that focused on these scenarios were grouped as “Other\n\

    \ consider low trafﬁc rate attacks\n6.3.2. Generic\nThese solutions employ a wide\
    \ range of methods and architectures to combat different types of\nresource exhaustion\
    \ DDoS attacks, as well as mechanisms to detect devices compromised by malicious\n\
    agents in the local network. In light of this, Özçelik et al. [56] provide an\
    \ architecture for mitigating\nDDoS at its origin by adopting fog computing approaches.\
    \ The adoption of decentralized mitigation\napproaches that implement secure methods\
    \ of communication between nodes through emerging\ntechnologies such as Blockchain\
    \ [59] features prominently among the other strategies in this category.\n6.3.3.\
    \ SDN Control Plane\nThe SDN control plane can itself become the target of DDoS\
    \ attacks that are aimed at exploiting\nvulnerabilities in its components and\
    \ make the underlying IoT applications unavailable. In this\nscenario, the studies\
    \ carried out in [55,61,63,71,74] put forward mechanisms that are capable of\n\
    mitigating DDoS attacks that target both the data plane and the SDN control plane.\n\
    Based on the results summarized in Tables 3 and 4, it is possible to determine\
    \ the beneﬁts offered\nby these means of providing security to the SDN control\
    \ plane that is responsible for accessing\nIoT applications. In light of this,\
    \ attention should be drawn to the fact that: (i) the solutions are\nevaluated\
    \ against DDoS attacks at low and high trafﬁc rates; and (ii) machine learning\
    \ approaches are\nmore efﬁcient in detecting malicious ﬂows than conventional\
    \ mitigation approaches that depend on\ndynamically-deﬁned trafﬁc limits. These\
    \ ﬁndings corresponded to the solutions by Krishnan et al. [63]\nand Raﬁque et\
    \ al. [61].\nIn this case, the principal drawback of these solutions that are\
    \ designed to mitigate DDoS attacks\nis their fully-centralized approach at the\
    \ edge of target networks. The main reason for this is that the\ncontroller may\
    \ become unavailable because there is a need to process a huge amount of malicious\n\
    ﬂows that exceed its computational capacity. Furthermore, solutions in this category\
    \ were validated in\nsmall-scale scenarios. These solutions were only designed\
    \ to address trafﬁc mitigation from external\nnetworks, and all processing of\
    \ requests and decision-making is centralized in the SDN controller.\n6.3.4. Smart\
    \ Homes\nIn this category, it should be noted that the main research endeavors\
    \ are to provide security for\nboth internal and external incidents on the network\
    \ by using lightweight mechanisms implemented\nwith low-cost hardware (e.g., Raspberry\
    \ Pi). Among the limitations found in the solutions applied\nin this scenario\
    \ are: (i) the mitigation process is implemented centrally at the edge of the\
    \ network\nwithout due concern for the overhead controller; and (ii) the lack\
    \ of mechanisms capable of mitigating\nDDoS attacks based on low trafﬁc rates.\
    \ The use of distributed controllers to perform the mitigation\nprocess should\
    \ be noted as a means of overcoming these limitations in a satisfactory way. In\
    \ addition,\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n22 of 28\nthe use of machine learning techniques\
    \ can be regarded as a feasible alternative, since they are useful\nin mitigating\
    \ DDoS attacks based on low trafﬁc rates [63].\n6.3.5. Other Scenarios\nThe mitigation\
    \ solutions for (i) IoT data centers, (ii) industrial IoT, and (iii) maritime\n\
    communication infrastructure, have features in common, despite being designed\
    \ for different scenarios.\nFor this reason, the main beneﬁt offered by solutions\
    \ in this category is the ability to prioritize the\nmitigation of DDoS attacks,\
    \ while taking into account the particular security requirements for each IoT\n\
    application, as discussed by Bawany and Shamsi [31]. On the other hand, Yan et\
    \ al. [42] recommend a\ndistributed and scalable architecture that is capable\
    \ of detecting malicious devices in the protected IoT\nnetwork itself. The solution\
    \ found by Sahay et al. [73] rely on trafﬁc ﬁltering based on a static amount\n\
    of trafﬁc to mitigate DDoS attacks in maritime communication systems. In general,\
    \ it has been seen\nthat solutions in this category have characteristic limitations,\
    \ such as (i) their failure to take note of\nattacks with low trafﬁc rates; and\
    \ (ii) restrictions on collaboration and maintenance caused by the fact\nthat\
    \ they were designed for a particular segment.\n6.4. Open Research Challenges\n\
    While the use of the SDN paradigm provides several beneﬁts to mitigate DDoS attacks,\
    \ in IoT\nscenarios, several underlying problems have not yet been addressed,\
    \ namely:\n6.4.1. Evaluation of Solutions Based on Realistic Scenarios\nAccording\
    \ to a recent report [17], DDoS attacks carried out in the third quarter of 2019\
    \ reached\nrates of up to 1Tbps, which shows a sharp rise in the volume of trafﬁc\
    \ subject to attacks, depending\non their type and purpose. Given this, the new\
    \ schemes must be evaluated in environments capable\nof replicating as many real\
    \ conditions as possible, both in terms of trafﬁc and infrastructure. The\ncombination\
    \ of these factors is crucial to ensuring the scalability of solutions in the\
    \ face of increasing\ndemand for trafﬁc and the heterogeneity of network infrastructures,\
    \ currently made up of both physical\nand virtual elements [19].\n6.4.2. Flexibility\
    \ to Meet Different Security Requirements\nIoT ecosystems are made up of a number\
    \ of applications with different communication and\nsecurity requirements (e.g.,\
    \ health and disaster recovery applications, trafﬁc control, and smart\nhomes).\
    \ As a result of the growing demand for mission-critical applications, often sharing\
    \ resources\nfrom general-purpose infrastructures, mitigation mechanisms must\
    \ be able to identify and prioritize\nmalicious ﬂows intended for this area. In\
    \ this way, detection and mitigation policies, for example,\ncan be reconﬁgured\
    \ at runtime.\n6.4.3. Mitigation of DDoS Attacks Based on IoT Protocols\nThe diversity\
    \ of the IoT ecosystem offers numerous opportunities for exploring protocols\n\
    (e.g., MQTT and CoAP), which have been specially designed to meet the demands\
    \ of new applications.\nFor instance, the CoAP protocol can be used for ampliﬁcation\
    \ attacks. Thus, several IoT devices can\nhave their IP addresses spoofed so that\
    \ attacks can be launched on different domains.\n6.5. Trends and Opportunities\n\
    This section highlights some emerging technologies that provide an opportunity\
    \ to assist the SDN\nparadigm in overcoming certain limitations and be able to\
    \ ﬁnd more efﬁcient and robust solutions to\nmitigate DDoS attacks in IoT environments.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n23 of 28\n6.5.1. Network Function Virtualization\nNetwork\
    \ Function Virtualization (NFV) [81] is a promising technology when integrated\
    \ with\nthe SDN paradigm for designing new solutions to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ in IoT environments.\nNFV introduces a new degree of ﬂexibility and scalability\
    \ by creating on-demand virtual network\nappliances such as ﬁrewalls, Intrusion\
    \ Detection Systems (IDS), and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)\nSystems. This feature\
    \ ensures that multiple instances of a speciﬁc mitigation mechanism can be\nimplemented\
    \ precisely at different locations on the network and address the constraints\
    \ imposed\nby the occurrence of malicious events [48]. Among the solutions obtained\
    \ from the use of the\nintegrated SDN and NFV to mitigate DDoS attacks are the\
    \ schemes employed by Zhou and Guo [82]\nand Krishnan et al. [63].\n6.5.2. Fog\
    \ Computing\nFog computing is a new architectural concept extending cloud computing,\
    \ which raise extensive\ncapabilities in affording the discovery of new SDN-based\
    \ mitigation solutions. Employing fog\ncomputing technology allows to access the\
    \ services offered by the public cloud at a faster data\nprocessing speed. Moreover,\
    \ the deployment of small clouds close to the vicinity of the end-user\ncan improve\
    \ conﬁdentiality while reduced latency at the same time. The strategies provided\n\
    in Yan et al. [42] and Özçelik et al. [56] are examples of solutions that harness\
    \ SDN-based architectures\nand fog computing to mitigate DDOS attacks in IoT environments.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nThis study created a taxonomy to describe and characterize strategies\
    \ to mitigate DDoS attacks\nharnessing SDN technologies in IoT environments. As\
    \ a result, we provide the following contributions:\n(i) a comprehensive review\
    \ of the state-of-the-art about DDoS attack mitigation strategies featured\nby\
    \ SDN technologies in IoT scenarios; (ii) a new classiﬁcation guide for the mitigation\
    \ strategies,\nwhich consider several relevant parameters; (iii) a full overview\
    \ of the existing mitigation techniques\nfor the IoT scenario; (iv) a comparative\
    \ analysis of the mitigation techniques through pre-deﬁned\nestablished criteria\
    \ supported by related studies, RFCs and other technical documents; and (v) a\
    \ broad\ndiscussion about open issues and research challenges regarding DDoS mitigation\
    \ featured by SDN\ntechnologies in IoT environments.\nThe proposed taxonomy takes\
    \ into account four (4) key characteristics associated with the\nmitigation process,\
    \ namely: (i) whether the solutions carry out the mitigation process in a centralized\n\
    or collaborative way; (ii) whether other technologies were used in conjunction\
    \ with SDN to carry out\nthe mitigation process (hybrid solutions); (iii) the\
    \ mitigation strategy employed; and (iv) the targeting\nIoT application scenario.\n\
    As a result of a thorough comparison between the analyzed solutions, conducted\
    \ through a deep\ninvestigation in the literature, we note that none of them addressed\
    \ all the factors that we claim to be\nregarded as of great signiﬁcance. However,\
    \ there were hybrid solutions that exploited the ability of\nthe blockchain, fog,\
    \ and cloud computing paradigms to provide distributed and highly collaborative\n\
    solutions, and enabled them to meet the requirements more satisfactorily.\nThe\
    \ beneﬁts and drawbacks found in the mitigation solutions that were designed for\
    \ several\ndifferent IoT scenarios were also analyzed to assist the scientiﬁc\
    \ community in ﬁnding solutions\ncapable of mitigating the most diverse types\
    \ of DDoS attacks. Thus, solutions that use malicious\nﬂow ﬁltering strategies\
    \ with the aid of machine learning algorithms have proved to be promising in\n\
    mitigating DDoS attacks when there are both high and low trafﬁc rates.\nFinally,\
    \ a list of new research challenges were identiﬁed with potentials to serve as\
    \ starting\npoints to undertake a new research project. Technologies with a high\
    \ potential for innovation are also\nrecommended when used in conjunction with\
    \ SDN.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n24 of 28\nThe ﬁndings we obtained from the study\
    \ carried out in this paper provide the following\nprospective research directions.\
    \ We will run practical experiment trials atop a lab-premised testbed,\nwhereby\
    \ IoT use cases features real system dynamics and varying attack events. Based\
    \ on the\nparticular resource constraints of the IoT infrastructure, appropriate\
    \ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nare needed to provide optimal assessment\
    \ measuring. The high-accurate analysis and insights from\nthese real trials will\
    \ potential to drive reﬁnements in our current-proposed taxonomy.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    are two types of precision agriculture systems - those that have been hacked,
    and those that will be. Connectivity and information flow represent the two key
    enabling factors for successful operation of the digital farm. These factors also
    represent the highest vulnerability to cyber-attack to disrupt food production.
    We introduce a principles-based framework to assess cyber-attack vulnerabilities
    in the technology itself as well as in the environment to which it is adapted.
    This provides the elements needed to construct a precision agriculture system
    protected from cyber-attacks and appropriately matched to the complexity level
    of the technology in the field. KEYWORDS: cyber-attackprivacyfood securitywireless

    article View issue table of contents Next article Introduction Precision agriculture
    (PA) is playing a critical role in addressing anticipated gaps in food production
    to meet global needs (Godfray et al., 2010). The combination of a growing suite
    of technologies including sensors, transmitters and data systems is increasingly
    being used to produce data-driven decisions, coupled with enhanced machinery,
    to optimize production and reduce input-output variability in agricultural systems.
    PA also addresses the use of important resources such as water, soil nutrients
    and pest control to prevent over-application or misuse with a greater sensitivity
    to current and expected agronomic conditions. Optimizing net returns to inputs
    under a range of economic and environmental conditions is an important enabler
    in both primary production and food value-chain activities. But PA systems necessarily
    rely on data transfer, sensor access to wireless networks, remote transmission
    and system actuation, typically in real time. PA architecture and network structures
    are highly vulnerable to external cyber-attack, which poses a significant risk
    to the future breadth of their application. The main question posed in this study
    is whether a prediction model coupled with a decision framework can be devised
    to better understand vulnerabilities to precision agriculture from cyber-attacks,
    particularly for remote farmers heavily reliant on such technologies for water
    management, crop production and livestock tracking. Cyber-attacks are an attempt
    to exploit computing systems and networks based on a variety of motivations. Such
    attacks often use malicious codes to alter algorithms, logic or data. Cyber-attacks
    come in many forms and are expected to grow in both scale and complexity. The
    sources of such attacks are likely to expand from the current threat of individuals
    with activist motives to future threats of infiltration, theft and extortion by
    nation states and organised crime. This trend is emerging in other sectors such
    as finance and manufacturing and it is only a matter of time before agriculture
    becomes a dependable target. While large firms are an obvious mark for cybersecurity
    attacks, it is small- and medium-sized enterprises that are the most vulnerable
    to broad-scale attack. Since 2014 over 60% of all targeted attacks were aimed
    at small- to medium-sized enterprises, including primary producers, agricultural
    suppliers and agribusiness firms. The manufacturing and financial sectors have
    reported that one in two businesses have been the direct target of a cyber-attack,
    while 75% of the spate of spear-phishing attacks that occurred in 2015 targeted
    small businesses, including farms. Critically, over 60% of small businesses, including
    farmers, who become cyber-crime victims exit the industry within 6 months of an
    attack caused by irrecoverable system failure (Federal Bureau of Investigation,
    2016). Data are often easily corrupted and centrally-controlled agricultural systems
    can become infected to the point of catastrophic failure. Even when fully prepared
    for cybersecurity, the chances of a breach are substantial. A study by Crowe (
    2016) conducted on 60 cybersecurity companies who were the victim of a successful
    ransomware attack showed that 100% of attacks bypassed the companies'' antivirus
    software systems, 95% of attacks bypassed the firewall, 77% of attacks bypassed
    email filtering, 52% of attacks bypassed anti-malware programs and one-third of
    attacks were successful, even if the companies'' employees had extensive cybersecurity
    training. This research addresses the specific security challenges facing PA and
    provides a risk-based framework to counter the challenges of mobile computing
    and data-driven decision making in food production, with due consideration of
    sacrifices in efficiency and production effectiveness. The framework is based
    on the use of a threat prediction model using the Common Vulnerability Scoring
    System (CVSS) as the basis for assessment. The threat assessment is tested against
    network traffic and vulnerability characteristics of the system, which allows
    cyberattack solutions to be customised. This framework allows for precision agriculture
    systems to receive appropriate protection from the threat of cyber-attacks without
    compromising the efficiencies for which a PA solution is usually selected in the
    first place. Precision agriculture security challenges Network characteristics
    The use of sensor networks for monitoring crops is an accepted practice built
    from wireless technologies, infrastructure and integration mechanisms in a growing
    number of agricultural systems. Sensor networks assist producers by allowing them
    to not only monitor and automate operations in remote areas but also to gain more
    precise insights into specific zones of operation. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity
    in crop and livestock production are addressed more readily using wireless sensor
    networks (WSN) (for example, Chawla & Hussain, 2015) and constitute the basis
    of PA capabilities. New sensor types are being developed that better capture field
    heterogeneity. Advances in the analysis of unstructured data are leading to better
    decisions and actions, despite the often nonlinear and multivariate interactions
    that affect inputs and monitoring processes. Development of nonlinear dynamic
    models whose inputs rely on newer technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), multi-spectral imaging methods, and other automated mobile sensors are
    also gaining traction. But these and future advances demand large amounts of computing
    power and on-site or off-site data storage. While the computational resources
    for decision-making exist, they do not currently reside within the secure confines
    of the farm and are unlikely to in the future. Data acquisition, transmission,
    computation, reporting and actuation require an interconnected range of storage
    nodes and communication links. These links constitute the weakest points in existing
    PA technologies and will represent the initial points of cyber-attack. For the
    purposes of its use in agricultural settings, a wireless sensor network (WSN)
    is defined as a human-engineered, complex dynamic system of interacting sensor
    nodes that aggregate in some form to collect and collate data. The system allows
    for further analysis of the raw data followed by computational and control functions
    to perform tasks critical for food production. The sensors themselves come in
    various forms, which are generally able to actuate controls to undertake a certain
    activity. For instance, a hydrometer may continuously detect humidity at a given
    location in an orchard or crop. The central processor analyses humidity data and,
    once the cumulative total of dry conditions reaches a threshold, it activates
    an irrigation actuator to precisely distribute water to the field in a controlled
    way. This process can be fully automated and often is. Advancements in micro-electromechanical
    systems (MEMS) and distributed computing have propelled the use of WSNs in diverse
    applications, including the monitoring of standard weather conditions, air quality,
    soil behaviour, tree health, ecological habitats and livestock tracking and health
    monitoring. Sensor nodes are equipped with modules for sensing, computing, powering
    and communicating to monitor specific phenomena via self-organizing protocols,
    since node positions do not need to be predetermined. The general architecture
    of a WSN is comprised as a sensor node, where the microcontroller or computing
    module processes the data observed by the sensing module, and the data are simultaneously
    transmitted to a data warehouse via a wireless link with a communication module.
    Data can further move to other locations for third-party processing and storage.
    The data, in either raw or processed form, are often valuable. They can allow
    external parties to perform their own research on plant biology, genetics, economic
    viability, supply forecasts, veracity of farm equipment and productivity. Downstream
    actors in the value chain, direct competitors and substitute producers can greatly
    benefit from access to this information and may be tempted to pay for such insights
    if offered by a cyber-attacker. The facilities where data are aggregated, stored,
    and analysed, along with the data themselves, provide a very high-value target
    for corporate, nation state, and/or activist adversaries with the goal of data
    theft and/or sabotage and misinformation. Figure 1 outlines the typical approach
    for cybersecurity attacks on a network-based agriculture system with third-party
    access (e.g., ag-tech firm, agronomy analytics provider) using malicious software
    (malware). In this instance, third-party access to on-farm systems is used as
    the gateway through which the malware infiltrates the network and re-transmits
    data to dedicated servers that mimic the access characteristics of the third party.
    Figure 1. Example malware attack on farm systems using third-party access. Display
    full size This example falls short of highlighting the capability of many cyber-attack
    sources to remotely control irrigation or nutrient delivery systems through supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) system architectures. But it does highlight
    that ‘man in the middle’ attacks are very difficult to detect and cannot be defeated
    using a ‘security by obscurity’ response within the network. Recent attacks have
    demonstrated that future infiltrations will become much more sophisticated and
    are likely to avoid detection over a substantial time horizon (e.g., years). System
    architecture and legal recourse The data collection, processing/computation, and
    storage infrastructure needs to be architected with security, in both perceived
    and real terms, as its top priority. Confidentiality of data must be maintained,
    while still permitting the valuable applications that derive from interrogating
    aggregate data, especially for large-scale prediction and region-wide analytics.
    Crop growth and development datasets can yield highly predictive crop performance
    capabilities, even when genetic data are not compromised. Crop models with accuracies
    great enough to support PA decision making, when driven by stolen data, might
    well enable within-season, regional crop performance projections of relevance
    to economic markets (Kshetri, 2006). A legal response to an attack has often been
    cited as a sufficient deterrence against domestic hackers. However, litigation
    against data invaders, if they are ever caught, is not a guaranteed path for recovery.
    It is not unreasonable to assume that many producers would naturally wish to maintain
    direct ‘ownership’ of their data. From a legal perspective, ownership refers to
    a bundle of rights whose composition depends on the nature of the object involved.
    Of the four major types of intellectual property, namely patent, copyright, trademark,
    and trade secrets (Michalowski & Pfuhl, 1991), it is the latter which has been
    shown to form the ‘best’ legal basis in the protection of farm data (Sinrod &
    Reilly, 2000). However, a legal defence that relies on trade-secret doctrine requires
    that data owners need to be very proactive in avoiding disclosure of their secrets
    (Can, 2015). Evidence demonstrating systems of documented data handling and protection
    goals, objectives, and methods of implementing procedures are needed to cover
    all parties in the data chain including the producer, equipment providers, irrigators
    and agronomic advisors. Without the ability to demonstrate the active management
    of data ownership, a legal challenge against external users of the information,
    even those who exploit the data though they were not involved in the attack, can
    be very limited. Old dogs, new tricks Supervisory control and data acquisition
    (SCADA) is a control system architecture that uses computers, networked data communications
    and graphical user interfaces for high-level process supervisory management. It
    can also integrate peripheral devices such as programmable logic controllers and
    discrete proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to interface to the
    process plant or machinery. Farm operators access the system through an interface
    to monitor sensor data (often in real time) and issue process commands (which
    can be automated). Real-time control logic or controller calculations are performed
    by networked modules which connect to the field sensors and actuators. The advantage
    of SCADA systems is that all collected information from the farm is centralised.
    SCADA systems typically use a Windows operating system, so multiple interfaces
    to external applications are available. Across the U.S. over 1 million SCADA systems
    and other industrial control systems (ICS) are connected to the internet with
    unique (internet protocols) IPs (IBISWorld, 2015). Similarly, large numbers of
    connections also exist in Europe, Asia, Canada and elsewhere (Cardwell & Shebanow,
    2016) and this figure is anticipated to be growing by 2,000–8,000 additional systems
    per day (Goodman, 2017). Since most of these devices directly face the internet,
    they are insecure and therefore exploitable. For example, an attacker can use
    Shodan (a search engine for internet-connected devices) to locate the device;
    obtain its software version (based on header information); retrieve a viable exploit
    code for that device using penetration testing software (e.g., from Metasploit
    or other penetration testing network); establish a proxy connection that is difficult
    to trace, such as TOR (a software that directs internet traffic through a free,
    worldwide, overlay network); and then exploit the remote system through roaming,
    data downloads, corrupting systems, data encryption or another manner. It is well
    known that the robustness of SCADA/ICS in the face of direct cyber-attack is poor.
    Many of these systems were never intended to be connected directly to the internet.
    Newer PA systems need to be designed such that there are multiple redundant security
    controls (e.g., firewalls/ data-diodes and identity/ access management systems)
    between the real-time system and the internet, segregation between system architectures
    and minimising network-facing remote sensor usage (Gronau, 2015). Many older SCADA/ICS
    systems, including a range of existing PA systems, are so vulnerable that they
    are unable to withstand even simple security scans. Some have existing backdoor
    administrative accounts and, in some cases, authentication credentials are hardcoded
    which guarantees hacker access. Basic fuzz testing (automated software that provides
    invalid, unexpected or random data as an input to test for memory leaks or program
    crashes) causes many SCADA systems to crash and buffer overflows have become a
    serious issue. Many existing systems contain no password timeouts, which permits
    hackers to login using brute-force key searches. Once the deeper level of a system
    has been breached, such as the industrial processes that contain programmable
    logic controls (PLC), then hackers can simply upload new ladder logic which may
    cause systems to ignore multiple safety interlocks, resulting in potentially catastrophic
    outcomes. The construction of highly robust SCADA/ICS products adapted to existing
    systems may not be practical. To protect against direct cyber-attacks there is
    a growing need to segregate such systems from high-risk networks and prevent device
    IP addresses to be directly accessible from the internet. As the cyber-attack
    threat escalates linearly, the number of vulnerable systems will grow exponentially,
    since each new attack will gain the capacity to infiltrate a broad array of older
    architectures. Security framework considerations for precision agriculture systems
    A cybersecurity framework for PA needs at least the following three components
    to defend against the most basic attacks: 1.  abnormal measurement detection;
    2.  access control; and 3.  encryption. Measurement detection Anomaly detection
    searches and detects unusual patterns that deviate from expected data behaviour.
    This is needed to eliminate false alarms that trigger unnecessary emergency interventions
    which are a significant hazard to farm productivity. Sensors can directly report
    abnormal values for various infractions such as data corruption, energy depletion,
    electromagnetic interference, variable signal quality, connectivity interception,
    severe weather, malfunction and false inputs. Faulty diagnosis results, false
    alarms, and unreliable monitoring will eventually undermine system confidence.
    The detection of measurement outliers and distinction between sensor faults and
    emergency situations are a primary system feature. Access control Sharing sensor
    data is required for WSN domains but if the sharing process is overly complex
    or involves many external parties, then the worth of the system is undermined,
    especially in a dynamic environment. Access control is needed to guarantee access
    to sensitive information by entities with legitimate reason for doing so. Access
    control mechanisms generally support selective sharing. Controls can range from
    being centralized to being fully distributed, which have benefits and trade-offs
    in terms of computational power and security. The increased use of ‘edge computing’
    and ‘fog computing’ ensures that as much processing as possible is performed at
    the edge (i.e., on site), while deeper levels of analysis and data backups are
    offloaded to a computing facility via farm-office gateways. Encryption Encoding
    data is a powerful form of protection but remains subject to exploitation. Sensor
    data that is not encrypted at the point of capture but is replicated in a central
    location is still vulnerable to cyber-attack. For instance, yield maps generated
    by harvesters derived from collected data would be encrypted by third-party vendor
    hardware using a middle-box either on-site or at an external location. But the
    raw collected data may remain open to exploitation on the collection device itself.
    The increased use of external advisory services by producers greatly increases
    this vulnerability, particularly when autonomous activities occur at the farm
    based on decision logic using the analysis results. Currently, around half of
    users employ mobile devices to access information from cloud systems and, over
    time, they will access WSN information in this manner as well. Ensuring that such
    users will employ access controls and encryption in proper ways will continue
    to be a major challenge to PA technologists. Recent advances in attribute-based
    encryption systems such as Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE)
    provide a scalable way of encrypting data such that access is available only to
    decoding parties with specified attributes (Goyal, Pandey, Sahai, & Waters, 2006;
    Sahai & Waters, 2005). This approach requires gateways to farm-office data be
    configured to encrypt data depending on the type of data and its destination.
    The data owner then reconfigures, delegates, or revokes remote access. This eliminates
    the need to rely on a storage server to be the primary security point. In the
    event of a breach only encrypted data can be accessed, which will be unintelligible,
    and the insertion of malicious data would be undecipherable and reveal the breach.
    Modern cyber-attack methods There are several elements required for a cyber-attack.
    First, the target of the attack (also known as the endpoint) is generally motivated
    by a purpose, which is to either control, corrupt or disable. Second, the level
    of vulnerability is defined as the weakness that permits the endpoint to be infiltrated.
    Common vulnerabilities include software flaws, system design weaknesses, insecure
    configurations, and human errors. Third, the malicious software, known as malware,
    often involve more than one single type which are classified by their purpose
    or intended effect. Fourth, the delivery vehicle is needed to deliver the malware
    to the victim''s system through a variety of techniques including social engineering
    (phishing and whaling), network infiltration or direct access. Finally, the method
    of execution defines the means through which attackers get the resources necessary
    (access, processing time, data, etc.) to execute the attack. For security protection
    to successfully stop a cyber-attack, it needs to thwart malware from achieving
    its purpose or desired effect without necessarily preventing a breach or eradicating
    malware code from the system. Depositors are malware whose primary purpose is
    to land and expand. They are created to conceal the introduction of malware by
    separating the exploit of the system from the execution and installation of the
    malicious program. Two basic types of depositors are downloaders and droppers.
    A downloader is a type of Trojan program that, once running, fetches and installs
    the malware executables. A dropper is a type of Trojan executable that combines
    both the installation functionality and the actual malware program within the
    same object. As a result, a dropper does not necessarily require a permissive
    network connection. Depositors are dangerous because they allow attackers to sneak
    malware past traditional security before transforming it into its executable form.
    For example, the Cryptowall 2.0 code used a sophisticated dropper that embedded
    multiple potential exploits to infiltrate target systems. It performed anti-VM
    and anti-emulation checks prior to decrypting and executing the malware, decreasing
    the likelihood of identification and detection, and had the capability of executing
    64-bit code from a 32-bit dropper. This is a powerful mechanism to infiltrate
    PA systems without ever revealing its presence to the system operator. Ransomware
    is a form of malware that threatens to destroy data unless a victim makes payment.
    Its primary purpose is to extort money from victims. Two basic types of attacks
    are encrypting ransomware and destructive ransomware. The encryption approach
    encrypts critical assets after collating an inventory of system files. Victims
    are shown a screen with instructions on how to pay an untraceable ransom to decrypt
    the files. The destructive approach demonstrates its presence on the system to
    the user by disabling administrator access and demands payment to avoid the automatic
    destruction of data or malicious remote system operation. This form of attack
    is a relatively easy and lucrative way to monetize the exploitation of a system.
    Quite inexpensive and extensible ransomware packages are common and are freely
    available, so cyber protection must be able to defeat these simple attacks. Like
    depositors, ransomware can lie dormant for long periods of time, avoiding detection
    and making it difficult to trace. The most notorious recent examples of ransomware
    are the Cryptowall and Cryptolocker attacks which have reportedly cost businesses
    around $50 million in direct payments in 2016–17 (ISACA, 2017). Backdoor malware
    provide at-will unauthorized remote access or command and control. These programs
    were created by hackers to provide repeated and unfettered access to exploited
    systems for reconnaissance or to leverage systems for botnets or future attacks
    against others. Backdoors find ways to make their existence persistent and undetected
    across reboots, providing attackers the ability to tap back into the system and
    reconnect. Botnets are the most common type of backdoor. Any good attack will
    take the time to leave a machine open to future visits via a backdoor, and they
    spread rapidly. In 2014, it was reported that 18 systems were infected with botnets
    every second (ISACA, 2017). Variants of credential thieves are a form of malware
    used to steal authorization details. They allow hackers to gain access to a single
    machine through which they can search for access to the greater systems, services
    and accounts of the victim. By leveraging a single user in the system, attackers
    can gain access to a host of local machines, hosted services, and critical servers,
    which, in addition to providing assets to steal, will be used to expand an attacker''s
    reach. Viruses and worms are self-replicating, self-perpetuating malware that
    infect host systems and then spread to infect others autonomously. Once on a system,
    viruses and worms insert copies of themselves into programs, files, and drives.
    Worms can then execute actions to spread onto other computers via their network.
    Worms and viruses can also carry additional ‘payloads’ designed to perform harmful
    or disruptive activity on their infected hosts. They create damage that rapidly
    becomes widespread. Worms enable attackers to create a network of hijacked machines
    (a botnet) for use as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack centers, while
    viruses are often shared by unaware users who go on to infect others. Vandalizers
    are malware that is purely destructive in nature. Once a vandalizer has access
    to a vulnerable site, it can cripple a system completely. Vandalizer attacks are
    particularly dangerous because they can strike without warning and be very public.
    The above classes of malware rarely operate in isolation. Good cyber-attacks will
    involve multiple classes of malware to increase effectiveness, enable rapid propagation,
    or obfuscate underlying operations. As an example, attackers use a downloader
    to establish a command and control infrastructure for ransomware, then insert
    a worm to propagate a vandalizer against monitoring systems, and finally steal
    credentials to a hosted email account to spread the ransomware further. The interconnected
    nature of IoT precision agriculture environments and the requirement to access
    data generated in real time is the key challenge in cybersecurity. The use of
    end-to-end threat and risk assessments, secure gateways, one-way diodes, etc.
    provide some protection of SCADA networks from threats. But the open nature of
    these systems presents many channels through which an attack can occur. A typically
    reliable approach in defending against threats is the use of zones that segregate
    PA system architectures. The use of secure controls limits the spread of attacks
    and prevents access to real-time processing. The escalation in system segregation
    architectures is illustrated in Figure 2. The efficiency of a system containing
    widespread but secure ICS/SCADA infrastructure is compromised by the volume of
    remote sensors linked to secured conduits (WAN, VPNs). Figure 2. Segregating data
    and real-time network architecture. Display full size The use of dedicated modules
    that disperse the command and control functions for a PA system vastly improves
    the depth of the defence against cyber-attack. The costs associated with such
    segregation are generally modest but it is important that a protective suite be
    instituted as a complete system to prevent any compromise during system construction
    (e.g., it is generally assumed that new systems booting for the first time are
    hacked by automatic malware algorithms within around 60 seconds.) While the channels
    available to cyber-attack are well-understood, the motivations behind attacks
    are more difficult to quantify. But some understanding of these motives can be
    useful when preparing a defence. Classifying cyber-attack source psychology Research
    into computer crime has found that hackers tend to be introverted, open to experience,
    neurotic, exploitive and manipulative personalities. Scores related to moral choices
    also tend to be significantly lower for computer criminals than for persons who
    report no computer criminal activity. Kirwan ( 2010) found that a key feature
    of hacker behaviour within the sub-culture is individuals laying claim to having
    bragging rights and subsequently being held in esteem by others. For some groups,
    the criminal intent may be low but the benefit will increase under the right circumstances.
    Criminology scholars claim that criminal intent is a function of the difference
    between the combined likelihood-benefit attributes of an attack (Fishbein & Ajzen,
    1974) and the combined outcome-disadvantage costs anticipated by the hacker (Voiskounsky
    & Smyslova, 2003). This will vary by hacker type but the anticipated likelihood-benefit/outcome-disadvantage
    value is attributable to each hacker type with a single order of magnitude. Figure
    3 presents a general summary of hacker types categorised by motives, actions and
    general features. Figure 3. Threat profile of cyber-attack sources. Display full
    size Beginners known as script-kiddies are generally the most common form of cyber-attackers
    who deploy simple hacking tools, have low persistence levels and are concerned
    with building their skills. The attacks create a lot of noise in perimeter and
    boundary intrusion detection and are easily remedied through SIEM analysis and
    boundary defense to disrupt common threats and hacking enumeration and scanning
    techniques. In contrast, malicious insiders use their access to systems under
    their responsibility to steal data or inflict damage to control systems. The number
    of attacks from this source has been increasing steadily. Activists prefer the
    use of denial of service (DoS) attacks or the alteration of public-facing media,
    as well as accessing information to protest or manipulate data. Remedies are largely
    reactive and locating the source of traffic to cause the DoS can take time. The
    best defense is typically to conduct filtering and baseline reviews of network
    traffic to predict DoS attacks with sufficient time to filter the traffic based
    on the attacker''s IP. Spies target all industries, especially high-value sectors
    like finance and defense manufacturing. Agricultural system attacks from this
    type have been few but attacks may well increase between nation states in the
    future. The industrial espionage ecosystem provides channels that are not easily
    infiltrated and detection may never be achieved. If an exfiltration has been discovered,
    the usual response is to review the degree of compromise and the structure of
    the channel of attack and trace system activities that permitted the attack. Defense
    in depth is compromised at a system''s weakest link, so the construction of security
    layers is the best approach. Terrorist attacks are based on enumeration espionage
    to find system weaknesses and are persistent in probing security infrastructure
    until an entry point is located. For these attacks, all critical security controls
    should be used which severely limits system flexibility (e.g., remote networks,
    automated vehicles are an easy target and robust protection is difficult). Remedies
    are reactive and business continuity followed by disaster recovery are the priority.
    Attacks of this sort have not directly affected agriculture, but, as automation
    and remote observation increase, they will likely present an ‘easy’ target to
    networks in areas that rely heavily on the sector for income and employment. Organized
    crime deploys phishing or malware or directly infiltrates networks through under-protected
    system features (e.g., reporting and control devices). The source is highly persistent
    and motivated by extortion. Immediate remedies are to close all network connections
    to disrupt the kill chain. Often, only external parties identify the compromise
    rather than it being detected internally. The source of the attack is motivated
    by financial gain rather than system or data destruction, so, once the infiltration
    has occurred, a financial payment may be the only remedy available. Several agricultural
    entities have suffered losses from these types of attacks in recent years, which
    may escalate with more targeted attacks in the future (Rogers, Seigfried, & Tidke,
    2006). Cybersecurity frameworks for precision agriculture System vulnerability
    We introduce a simple model for the base dynamics using historical data from reported
    cyber security incidents. The goal is to illustrate how different equilibrium
    dynamics of PA can result from the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents. To help
    organizations address cyber concerns, the U.S. National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) has developed a set of voluntary best practices (ISACA,
    2016). But every enterprise in every sector is different, which requires such
    frameworks to be flexible enough to meet variable and changing needs. The framework
    consists of five fundamental cyber-attack functions (ISACA, 2017): identify, protect,
    detect, respond and recover. These functions are associated with activities, desired
    outcomes and applicable references. A breakdown of the categories and subcategories
    of the framework is available in the Appendix with application to four types of
    PA activities to demonstrate its flexibility: (1) IoT distributed network/mesh
    with remote access, (2) automated vehicle (Agbots) monitoring, data collation,
    (3) industrial control systems with PLC, and (4) integrated farming. For PA systems
    with predominantly online services, web traffic has been shown to serve as a good
    proxy for usage rates (Fich & Fich, 2004). Using this notion, we can employ the
    above framework to derive the probability of a cyber-attack incident by monitoring
    web traffic behaviour as part of the detection function. There are other relatively
    simple web-traffic monitoring processes that can help identify vulnerabilities
    to memory corruption and malware (Houmb, Franqueira, & Engum, 2010). A quantitative
    method of quantifying cyber vulnerability for a system is the use of the Common
    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS provides a way to capture the principal
    characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its
    severity, as well as a textual representation of that score (Houmb et al., 2010).
    The score is then translated into a qualitative representation (e.g., low, medium,
    high, critical) to help farmers assess and prioritize vulnerability management
    activities. The CVSS approach is useful because it represents a standardized vulnerability
    score, it is developed from an open framework and it directly helps identify and
    prioritize risks. The CVSS score is designed to align with the five fundamental
    cyber-attack functions defined above. The scoring rubric is relatively straightforward
    and is available in several formats such as in Forum of Incident Response and
    Security Teams (FIRST) ( 2016). Please refer to Table 1 in the text. The CVSS
    approach uses three groups of parameters to score potential risks: basic parameters,
    temporal parameters and environmental parameters. Each group is represented by
    score compound parameters ordered as vectors. Basic parameters represent the intrinsic
    specifications of the vulnerability, while temporal parameters represent the specifications
    of a vulnerability that might change over time due to technical changes. These
    two categories will be governed by the type of technologies and products supplied
    for the PA system. Environmental parameters represent the specifications of vulnerabilities
    derived from the site-specific environment. These will be best specified by the
    farmers who have intimate knowledge of their environments and vulnerability impacts.
    One main benefit of the CVSS approach is that the score will remain unaffected
    when omitting environmental metrics, and thus the basic and technical vulnerabilities
    of the system remain common regardless of location (Hur & Noh, 2011). Table 1.
    CVSS scoring overview. Download CSVDisplay Table An example We examine an IoT
    system integrated using Wi-Fi for a diversified farming operation that includes
    cattle backgrounding paddocks and a feedlot, horticultural fields, an equine foaling
    unit and co-located equine paddocks, a wildlife enclosure, a piggery, a dairy
    and disassociated infrastructure to test for radiance, dust, noise, etc. The mesh
    network includes sensors for water-level measurements and chemical content of
    ring tanks, dams and piggery effluent, as well as for waste-water management lakes.
    A similar sensor network has been discussed in López et al. ( 2015). A second
    multisensory mesh network for a 180ha beef facility is located around 10 km from
    the first IoT network for remote observation. For the second facility, the multi-sensor
    mesh network has been set up to monitor improved and unimproved pasture where
    a herd of Droughtmaster cattle are fattened. This network uses the 8038 Smart
    Agriculture nodes and has been established on a 100 m grid (500 m×400 m) with
    an additional outer perimeter of nodes on 200 m spacing. Communication is achieved
    via low-power ZigBee communication radios within a mesh-network topology. Data
    at both sites are recorded at the nodes in a point-to-point, star-mesh topology
    and pre-programmed timeframe, depending on the application, and then transferred
    via either ZigBee, Wi-Fi, 3G or LoRA through a Libelium Meshlium (multi-communication
    protocol Linux router with >12 radio interfaces) to a SQL server in a third-party
    provider''s cloud. For this sample PA system, we construct a CVSS score to demonstrate
    the level of overall system vulnerability broken down into the three parameter
    categories. Table 2 provides the scoring solution and justification for each component''s
    vulnerability level. Table 2. CVSS scoring breakdown for a sample PA system. Download
    CSVDisplay Table The CVSS formula provides a mathematical approximation of all
    possible metric combinations ranked in order of severity using a vulnerability
    lookup table. Metrics are assigned to real vulnerabilities and a severity rating
    (low, medium, high, critical). There are a limited number of numeric outcomes
    (101 in total), with scores ranging from 0.0 to 10. Multiple scoring combinations
    can produce the same numeric score. The qualitative severity rating scale for
    the CVSS score describes a rating of low risk for scores of 0.1–3.9, medium risk
    for scores of 4.0–6.9, high risk for scores of 7.0–8.9 and critical risk for scores
    of 9.0–10. Variations in the level of vulnerability to cyber-attack can be easily
    quantified using CVSS as the primary metric. For instance, if the attack vector
    can be conducted through the network from a remote location then the base score
    increases to 7.5, placing the PA system at high risk. Similarly, if the three
    key aspects of systems (confidentiality, integrity, availability) are all needed
    to be high (for an operation critical to the farm''s profitability), then the
    environmental CVSS score spikes to a high level of 8.1. The CVSS score thus permits
    PA system integrators to determine how best to consolidate system needs and protections
    against identified attacks. Representing four generic types of existing PA systems
    (IoT distributed network/mesh with remote access, automated vehicle, industrial
    control systems with PLC, integrated farming) in the two dimensions of base-temporal
    score and environmental score yields important insights into the vulnerabilities
    and protections required by each. Figure 4 illustrates the relative CVSS for each
    system. Figure 4. Base-temporal CVSS against environmental CVSS for four types
    of PA systems. Display full size This representation demonstrates that the trade-offs
    between technology maturity and local adaptations of the technology can diverge
    and thus expose systems to compromise. For instance, automated vehicles have been
    operating in many industries for many years and the technology is relatively mature.
    But in remote farming operations with intermittent access to wireless data transfer
    links and potentially harsh conditions, such technology requires added features
    and system modifications that expose the technology to attack. This is represented
    via the CVSS score which quantifies the degree to which each of these emerging
    technologies are vulnerable to future cyber-attack. Conclusions Agricultural decision
    systems that integrate real-time environmental and farm-status data streams from
    in-situ sensors to actuate irrigation, pest-control and forecast data generate
    substantial efficiencies. Systems with high-frequency, real-time decision recommendations
    based on best management practices are especially appealing to the agriculture
    sector. However, system integrity will be a limiting factor in the widespread
    adoption of PA systems. There are two types of PA systems: those that have been
    hacked and those that will be. We have introduced a basic framework to help understand
    cyber-attack vulnerabilities in the technology itself, as well as in the environment
    to which it is adapted. The principles-based framework addresses the need to capture
    and encrypt data, storing data only in appropriate locations, limiting access
    to actuation systems and automated vehicles through strictly controlled channels
    of communication and only acting on data-driven decisions when the system is deemed
    secure. We have demonstrated that system vulnerability can be quantified, which
    allows for a measured approach to improving the integrity of complex PA systems.

  title: A Prediction Model Framework for Cyber-Attacks to Precision Agriculture Technologies
  verbatim_quote1: We have introduced a basic framework to help understand cyber-attack
    vulnerabilities in the technology itself, as well as in the environment to which
    it is adapted.
  verbatim_quote2: The principles-based framework addresses the need to capture and
    encrypt data, storing data only in appropriate locations, limiting access to actuation
    systems and automated vehicles through strictly controlled channels of communication
    and only acting on data-driven decisions when the system is deemed secure.
  verbatim_quote3: We have demonstrated that system vulnerability can be quantified,
    which allows for a measured approach to improving the integrity of complex PA
    systems.

  analysis:
  - The proposed system contributes to addressing the global food challenge by using
    automated systems for real-time irrigation management, improving crop production,
    and enabling sustainable agriculture. The system gathers real-time values from
    sensors implanted in farmland, including data on pH levels, temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and crop health. The collected data is analyzed and used to make
    decisions regarding irrigation schedules, crop recommendations, and other farming
    practices. The system provides personalized guidance and recommendations to farmers
    through an Android application in their native language, making it accessible
    to low-literate or illiterate farmers. By optimizing water usage, increasing crop
    yields, and providing tailored advice, the proposed system aims to enhance farmers'
    productivity and income while promoting sustainable agriculture practices.
  - Smart farming practices, enabled by the integration of IoT devices and machine
    learning algorithms, offer significant benefits for farmers. These practices can
    optimize resource utilization, reduce environmental impact, and increase crop
    yields. The use of sensors and IoT devices allows for real-time monitoring of
    environmental factors and crop health, providing valuable data for informed decision-making.
    Machine learning algorithms can analyze this data to identify patterns, predict
    crop performance, and make recommendations for optimal farming practices. This
    integration of technology can lead to increased productivity, reduced costs, and
    improved sustainability in the agricultural sector.
  - The system demonstrates the integration of IoT-based data collection, cloud computing,
    and machine learning to provide farmers with real-time, personalized guidance.
    The use of sensors and IoT devices enables the collection of a wide range of data,
    including soil conditions, crop health, and environmental factors. This data is
    then processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to derive insights
    and make recommendations. The system's ability to provide tailored advice based
    on real-time data can significantly enhance farmers' decision-making and improve
    crop outcomes. Additionally, the integration of a mobile application makes the
    system accessible and user-friendly, allowing farmers to easily access information
    and recommendations.
  - The proposed system's focus on addressing the needs of low-literate and illiterate
    farmers is a significant contribution to promoting inclusivity in agriculture.
    The use of visual, audio, and iconic components, along with native language support,
    ensures that the system is accessible to farmers with diverse literacy levels.
    This inclusive approach can empower marginalized farmers, enabling them to adopt
    smart farming practices and improve their livelihoods. By providing access to
    real-time information and guidance in their native language, the system can contribute
    to reducing the digital divide and empowering farmers to make informed decisions.

    \ The agriculture sector is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, reﬂecting 26%\
    \ of its GPD and\n43% of the entire labor force. Smart and precise agriculture\
    \ is the key to producing the best crop yield.\nMoreover, emerging technologies\
    \ are reducing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness for saving\nagricultural\
    \ resources in control and monitoring systems, especially for those areas lacking\
    \ these\nresources. Agricultural productivity is thwarted in many areas of Pakistan\
    \ due to farmers’ illiteracy,\nlack of a smart system for remote access to farmland,\
    \ and an absence of proactive decision-making\nin all phases of the crop cycle\
    \ available in their native language. This study proposes an internet of\nagricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) based smart system armed with a set of economical, accessible\
    \ devices and\nsensors to capture real-time parameters of farms such as soil moisture\
    \ level, temperature, soil pH level,\nlight intensity, and humidity on frequent\
    \ intervals of time. The system analyzes the environmental\nparameters of speciﬁc\
    \ farms and enables the farmers to understand soil and environmental factors,\n\
    facilitating farmers in terms of soil fertility analysis, suitable crop cultivation,\
    \ automated irrigation and\nguidelines, harvest schedule, pest and weed control,\
    \ crop disease awareness, and fertilizer guidance.\nThe system is integrated with\
    \ an android application ‘Kistan Pakistan’ (prototype) designed in\nbilingual,\
    \ i.e., ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’. The mobile application is equipped with visual components,\n\
    audio, voice, and iconic and textual menus to be used by diverse literary levels\
    \ of farmers.\nKeywords: smart farming; precision agriculture; IoT; sensor network;\
    \ semi-literate farmers; interactive\ninterface; User Interface (UI); Android\
    \ apps\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is considered the base for human living because\
    \ it is the primary food source\nand plays a crucial role in the global economy.\
    \ Pakistan is 79.6 million km2 and is home to a\npopulation of 192 million. The\
    \ contribution of the agricultural sector to gross domestic product\n(GDP) in\
    \ Pakistan gradually decreased to 19.3% in the year 2020–2021 from 22.04% previously\n\
    recorded in 2019 and generating employment opportunities for 38.5% of Pakistan’s\
    \ labor\nforce and valuable foreign exchange for the country [1–3]. It supports\
    \ the manufacturing and\nservices sectors of the economy by providing backward-forward\
    \ linkages in inputs-outputs\nmarkets and the most significant consumer of household\
    \ durables. Therefore, our agriculture\nsector can be considered an economic activity\
    \ in the country [4]. Farmers are facing issues in\nthe agriculture sector, so\
    \ it’s significant to research, develop of latest mechanisms, and adopt\nnew practices\
    \ to enhance production. Pressure on the agricultural system will increase with\n\
    the continuing expansion of the human population.\nMany areas of Pakistan are\
    \ trailing in agricultural productivity due to a lack of farmers’\nawareness,\
    \ timely access to crucial information, and proactive decision-making [5,6]. It\
    \ is\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081277\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n2 of 23\n\
    vital for human development in these underdeveloped areas to utilize information\
    \ and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs), artiﬁcial intelligence techniques, machine\
    \ learning\n(ML), and deep learning (DL) to make such information more readily\
    \ accessible to farmers,\nsigniﬁcantly increasing crop production [7–13]. Climate\
    \ change and shortage of agricultural\nresources are also signiﬁcant concerns\
    \ for the downfall of agricultural performance resulting\nin food insecurity [14–17].\
    \ This lets farmers hamper soil with intensiﬁed pesticides, which\naffect agricultural\
    \ practices in a harmful manner. Finally, ﬁelds remain barren [18–22].\nThese\
    \ are reasons for crop failure, lower production due to diseases, unpredictable\
    \ climate\nchange, and loss of soil fertility [23,24].\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ traditional agriculture trends are insufﬁcient to increase agricul-\ntural growth.\
    \ Agriculture is also out of the reach of less conventional technologies. In\n\
    this context, digital agriculture, automation, and precision farming, now termed\
    \ smart\nfarming, have arisen as new scientiﬁc ﬁelds that use intense techniques\
    \ to drive agricultural\nproductivity while minimizing its environmental impact\
    \ [25–27]. Data generated by smart\nfarming operations is provided by various\
    \ sensors that enable a better understanding of\nthe operational environment (interaction\
    \ of dynamic conditions of the crop, soil, weather,\nand environmental factors)\
    \ and the operation itself, leading to more accurate and timely\ndecision-making\
    \ [28,29]. Variability in climate and labor shortage is increasing continu-\n\
    ously, providing better insights for agricultural machinery automation. Remote\
    \ monitoring\ntechnologies facilitate farmers to access every inch of the farmlands\
    \ by creating virtual\nfences to monitor, detect and protect crops in real-time\
    \ [30–32]. IoT-based technologies\nallow farmers, among other things, to gather\
    \ data on plants’ environmental conditions like\nclimate change, soil fertility\
    \ level, humidity, temperature, and light intensity to monitor\nﬁelds and farms\
    \ remotely. These technologies assist farmers in having know-how and\nstatus of\
    \ crops anywhere and anytime [33–36].\nIn Pakistan, most farmers have android\
    \ phones [37–41] but are regrettably under-\nutilized. Our preliminary literature\
    \ study compelled us to work to facilitate farmers for\nagriculture automation,\
    \ recommendations, and guidelines in their local language, i.e.,\nUrdu, by using\
    \ the internet of agricultural things (IoAT), also known as agricultural\ninternet\
    \ of things (Ag-IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies with transliteration\
    \ and\nvoice-speech support in the local language. IoAT is the network of complex\
    \ and diverse\nagricultural objects that compute, process, and recommend solutions\
    \ intelligently based on\ndata generated from every connectable thing [42].\n\
    Previous research shows that using graphical cues, audio, speech, and video in\
    \ mobile\ninterfaces helps low-literates better adapt [43,44]. Field study experiences\
    \ reﬂect that low-\nliterates feel more challenged in understanding and interpreting\
    \ textual information than\ntheir literate peers [45]. In our research, we try\
    \ to accommodate such users by introducing\naudio, speech, Urdu language support,\
    \ and an interactive graphical interface. Researchers\nalso talked about the improvements\
    \ in information dissemination systems for less literate\nfarmers via different\
    \ means [46–50]. However, none considered interface design and\nUrdu language-based\
    \ real-time updates about agricultural guidelines using the android\napplication\
    \ and user preferences. Our choice of Urdu in this work was made by observing\n\
    that 87% of farmers preferred Urdu as a medium of information dissemination [51].\
    \ Our\nresearch is an extended form of [52–54] and primarily focuses on developing\
    \ an IoT-based\nand user-friendly system with these utilities.\n1.1. Rationale\n\
    This section reﬂects the ﬁndings and an evaluation report on information found\
    \ in\nthe literature relevant to our research domain. It represents the overview\
    \ of different ap-\nproaches used by other researchers. Integrating the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural\nsystem has led to the internet of Agricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) and advanced computing\ntechniques. The researchers applied this\
    \ to obtain maximum beneﬁts and also to improve\nthe production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and IoT [55]. The agriculture domain is\nexperiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by cloud technology, IoT, Edge and\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n3 of 23\nfog computing, sensors, IoT, and big data\
    \ [56]. A proposal was presented for agriculture\napplications by investigating\
    \ integrated platforms, including cloud computing, IoT, and\ndata mining techniques\
    \ [57]. An IoT-based smart agricultural system was developed using\ndeep learning\
    \ combined with a cloud environment comprised of four layers: data collection,\n\
    edge computing, data transmission, and cloud computing layer [58]. A scalable\
    \ network-\nbased architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agricultural\
    \ farms in rural areas\nusing IoT-based wiﬁ, long-distance network, and fog computing\
    \ [59]. Agricultural data\nanalytics employed with IoT has transformed from speciﬁc\
    \ crops to any kind of crop. The\ndeveloped system could support various applications,\
    \ from controlling and monitoring the\ncrops to promoting them to market [60].\n\
    Literacy is the ability to read and write simple statements [61]. Illiteracy,\
    \ low education,\nand computer illiteracy are signiﬁcant concerns in developing\
    \ countries like Pakistan.\nStudies indicate that user interface (UI) would be\
    \ designed differently for literate, low-\nliterate, and illiterate users. A user\
    \ interface should also consider the cultural context, such\nas language and images.\
    \ The non-textual interface is more user-friendly than the textual\none for illiterate\
    \ users [62].\nThe inability to read and write and the illiteracy of small farmers\
    \ make them vulnerable\nto various workers and cause human health risks [63].\
    \ Previous research inferred that\ncomplex hierarchy and multi-screens become\
    \ difﬁcult for low-literates to understand\nhelpful information, so the visuals,\
    \ audio, video, speech, icons, and images are a better\napproach to passing complex\
    \ data and information to mobile users [64]. The research\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on some user interface (UI) design guidelines for illiterate and semi-\nliterate\
    \ users that can help take advantage of information and communication technologies\n\
    ICT [51]. The most powerful design factors that should be incorporated into a\
    \ user interface\n(UI) for low-literate users are localization and graphics [65].\
    \ An android application with\naudio, textual, and visual components was designed\
    \ for farmers with diverse literacy\nlevels. It could facilitate them regarding\
    \ vital weather information [45]. Pakistani farmers\ntypically rely on traditional\
    \ sources of information, which could be a reason for their\ninformation deﬁciency.\
    \ Data analysis indicated that farmers had diverse demographic\nconditions, but\
    \ primary among them is the ordinary level of education (52.4% illiterate).\n\
    A high level of information deﬁciency was observed among farmers regarding fertilizers\n\
    application, seed rate, disease diagnosis, pests, and insects’ identiﬁcation,\
    \ and a medium\nlevel of lack in information regarding the selection of varieties,\
    \ harvesting, and pets’\nmanagement was observed [66]. Providing information access\
    \ to low-literate, linguistic\nminority, tech-shy, handicapped and marginalized\
    \ users using speech-based services is a\nviable solution. These services were\
    \ made the national weather hotline of Pakistan [50]. A\nsurvey data revealed\
    \ that farmers in the Vehari district of Pakistan have a low literary rate\nand\
    \ less technical knowledge. They are unable to read agricultural instructions,\
    \ unaware\nof pesticides persistence and toxicity (73%), unable to diagnose cotton\
    \ pests and diseases\n(86%), and unable to decide which crop to grow on cotton\
    \ adjacent farms (100%) [67]. The\nresearch was conducted to study knowledge,\
    \ attitude, and practices regarding pesticide\nusage by vegetable growers in three\
    \ districts; Dadu, Larkana, and Shikarpur of Sindh,\nPakistan. Results show that\
    \ most vegetable growers (40.90%) have low primary education\nliteracy, and 27.27%\
    \ possess a middle pass. That’s why most growers are unfamiliar with\npest and\
    \ insect damage indications and the safe handling of pesticides [68]. Pakistani\n\
    farmers’ awareness of the damaging effects of different pesticides can lead to\
    \ integrated\nand smart pest control and management [69]. Research ﬁndings reﬂect\
    \ farmers’ behavior\nand a low tendency towards reading the labels of the pesticides\
    \ due to low education,\nadvanced age, usage of too technical language, illegible\
    \ fonts, and unclear texts [70]. In [71],\nthe authors developed a basic interactive\
    \ voice response (IVR) system for agro-information\ndissemination, such as fertilizer,\
    \ pesticide information, and weather forecast. In terms\nof usability and information\
    \ extraction, their study reﬂected that simple menu-based\nnavigation interfaces\
    \ are relatively easy to use and understand.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n4 of\
    \ 23\nA remote agricultural monitoring platform was proposed in [72] after a detailed\n\
    literature study. Cyber security-based precision farming conceptual architecture\
    \ was\npresented in [73] for the frost prediction in peach production by analyzing\
    \ data captured\nby sensors implanted around an orchard. IoT-based precision farming\
    \ comprises multiple\ncontrol and monitoring applications like monitoring water\
    \ needs according to climate\nconditions, analyzing soil patterns, monitoring\
    \ crops disease and pest attacks, and assessing\noptimum time for planting, harvesting,\
    \ and tracking [74,75].\nAquaAgro offers IoT and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) enabled\
    \ solutions for precision\nfarming. Using a software or app embedded hardware,\
    \ the predictions will be made for\nthe Irrigation scheduling, Fertilizer requirement,\
    \ Pest attack prediction, and Plant disease\ndetection. The essential four services\
    \ that AquaAgro provides are irrigation scheduling,\nFertilizer requirement, Pest\
    \ attack prediction, and Plant disease detection. They have\nreceived an overwhelming\
    \ response from the people [76]. An android mobile application\nnamed ‘Mentha\
    \ Mitra’ was developed with an interactive interface with bilingual (Hindi\nand\
    \ English) for menthol mint growers [77]. Android application provides scientiﬁc\
    \ e-\nadvisories on crop-related diseases, high-yield varieties, pests, insects,\
    \ and improved\ndistillation units.\nAn IoT-based wireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ framework was proposed to monitor\ncrops smartly by analyzing environmental\
    \ factors [78]. In [79], the authors utilized the\nbeneﬁts of IoT for the implementation\
    \ of precision agriculture by sensing required param-\neters from the ﬁeld and\
    \ making suitable decisions such as activation and deactivation of\nirrigation\
    \ valves. Parameters include soil moisture, temperature and light intensity, etc.\n\
    Sensors could also send the gathered data to the cloud, and an Android application\
    \ was\ndeveloped to access these parameters. An expert IoT-based system relies\
    \ on the stored\nknowledge base and real-time data for farmer recommendations\
    \ [80]. This system will help\nin proactive and reactive tasks to a minimum the\
    \ loss of water. Farooq et al. [81] performed\na comprehensive literature study\
    \ on state-of-the-art techniques in smart farming. They\ndiscussed agriculture\
    \ networks, platforms, architecture, and topologies to help farmers\nto enhance\
    \ the corps’ productivity. This survey paper shows that Government and many\n\
    other stakeholders are interested in deploying IoT in Pakistan’s agriculture ﬁeld.\
    \ To in-\ncrease agricultural productivity, the authors suggested that collaboration\
    \ between allied\nand agriculture activities can be built by integrating big data\
    \ into climate-smart agriculture\nwith resource utilization [82].\nIn [83], the\
    \ authors are more concerned about the water supply to the plants. They\nproposed\
    \ a system in which a farmer can water the plants with a push of a button on his\n\
    phone when he is out of the station. Machine learning algorithms and radio frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation (RFID) tags detect and measure moisture and humidity. Internationally,\n\
    many studies [12,84–86] have been conducted to improve agricultural processes\
    \ based on\nsoil fertility level, crops, weather patterns, and fertilizers. These\
    \ studies used IoT, Global\nPosition Systems (GPS), Global information systems\
    \ (GIS), Wireless Sensor Networks\n(WSN), and many machine learning techniques.\
    \ The implementation of studies results in\nincreased proﬁtability and self-sufﬁciency.\
    \ IoT enabled decision support systems based on\nreal-time farm sensors data,\
    \ improving the water consumption by crops [87–89]. Authors\nin [90] provided\
    \ the real-time farm data, weather, and crops data to a Penman-Monteith\nand crop-coefﬁcient\
    \ model to produce recommendations about irrigation schedules. An\nintelligent\
    \ approach for diagnosing crop disease was proposed in [91], capable of working\n\
    with android devices equipped with fuzzy decision-making at the backend. The system\n\
    interacts with farmers in their native language of Urdu for crop disease diagnosing.\
    \ ‘Padi2U’\nis an android application developed for farmers to manage paddy ﬁelds.\
    \ It provides\nguidelines related to paddy varieties, planting schedule, pest,\
    \ disease, weed, weather\nforecast, and yield information in their native language\
    \ ‘Malay’ [92]. In [93], the authors\ndeveloped an application named ‘BLYNK’ to\
    \ control the IoT-based hardware remotely. The\npurpose of ‘BLYNK’ was to automate\
    \ irrigation and fertilizer supply to farms. Their results\nreﬂect approximately\
    \ 50% water saving and a 35% increase in yield. Irrigation monitoring\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 1277\n5 of 23\nand automatic control systems were developed using\
    \ fuzzy decision support to generate a\nmoisture content distribution map of soil\
    \ and enhance affectivity [53,94–98].\nSoil having an essential quantity of macro\
    \ and micro-nutrients would be capable of\ncultivating different crops. The soil’s\
    \ lack of signiﬁcant nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus,\nand Potassium) declines\
    \ crops’ cultivation, growth, and yield. To increase crop production,\nthe suitability\
    \ of a speciﬁc crop to be planted can be recommended by exploiting the soil’s\n\
    macronutrients [99–103]. Soil pH level is the major parameter for measuring soil\
    \ macronu-\ntrients (N, P, and K) and some of the micronutrients [104–108]. Smart\
    \ agro farms [109] use\nsolar power and a low-cost smart system, a perfect combination\
    \ of IoT, data mining, and\nAndroid application. The system monitors and extracts\

    \ agricultural data through implanted IoT sensors, such\nas pH, soil moisture,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The Internet plays a mediatory role in\ncommunication\
    \ and data exchange. We integrated agricultural data acquired from im-\nplanted\
    \ IoT devices with the cloud platform. Data is processed in a decision-making\
    \ system\nbased on learning prediction rules in conjunction with a rule-based\
    \ engine. Generally, a\nfarmer requires guidelines, even from the crop selection\
    \ phase to the harvesting stage. As\npresented in Figure 1, to facilitate low\
    \ literate farmers at each of these steps in their native\nlanguage, we performed\
    \ the following research objectives:\n•\nInvestigated traditional techniques and\
    \ systems with different agricultural interfaces\nto ﬁnd a research gap.\n•\n\
    Design and develop an interface in an easy-to-use format and Urdu for low-literate\n\
    farmers to facilitate their awareness and guidelines in their native language.\n\
    •\nDesign and develop a mechanism for measuring soil fertility of speciﬁc land\
    \ to recom-\nmend suitable crops according to soil fertility using fuzzy logic.\n\
    •\nProvide crops cultivation schedule, crop harvest schedule, automated irrigation\
    \ pro-\ncess, and watering guidelines to farmers.\n•\nFacilitate farmers concerning\
    \ guidelines for weeds and their eradication, pest attacks,\nand awareness of\
    \ best pesticides, crop diseases, and suitable fertilizers.\nAgriculture 2022,\

    \ most farmers are unfamiliar with the latest practices of\nagriculture as they\
    \ are not facilitated with new technologies to access agricultural information\n\
    and thus rely on traditional methods to grow their crops. Related studies indicate\
    \ that there is\nno such smart system providing an interactive interface to a\
    \ low literate or illiterate farmer\nand guidelines from the crop selection phase\
    \ to the harvesting stage. Significant barriers to\naccessing modern information\
    \ systems are the low literacy of farmers, the non-availability of\nlocal-language\
    \ information systems, and systems with fewer features. Our research identified\n\
    that it is essential to equip rural and semi-literate or illiterate farmers with\
    \ updated information\nthrough ICT, IoT, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, and\
    \ Machine learning techniques, and\nprovide them guidance in almost every phase\
    \ of the crop cycle. It is necessary to develop\nUrdu-language-based information\
    \ smart systems to enhance farmers’ comprehension, crop\nproduction, and sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nProposed System Design and Architecture\nThe overall design and\
    \ architecture of the solution proposed to cover smart agriculture\nare depicted\
    \ in Figure 2. It comprises three layers: crop (edge) layer, fog computing layer,\n\
    data analytics, and smart management at the cloud layer. The edge and cloud layers\
    \ are\ndesigned to be deployed respectively at local crop premises and remote\
    \ data servers. The\nintermediate fog computing layer comprises a set of virtualized\
    \ control modules in the form\nof Network Function Virtualization (NFV) nodes\
    \ that can be initiated along the network path\nfrom the farm facilities to the\
    \ cloud layer. NFV is a way to virtualize network services, for\nexample, firewalls,\
    \ routers, and load balancers that have traditionally been run on proprietary\n\
    hardware. The intermediate fog layer increases the versatility of deployed solutions\
    \ and\nconnectivity performances with the edge layer. At the crop premises, suitable\
    \ sensors like\nhumidity, temperature, soil moisture sensor, light intensity,\
    \ pH sensor, and actuators like\nwater pumps, valves, and activation of devices\
    \ for smart farming automation are deployed\nand connected with wireless nodes\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Sensors’ data is captured at the edge\nlayer through wireless\
    \ nodes and transmitted to the fog layer. This layered architecture lets\natomic\
    \ operations requiring high reliability and low latency between sensors and actuators\n\
    to be processed at the fog layer, such as executing irrigation mandates for a\

    \ control like irrigation,\nfarm monitoring, energy management, etc. The fog layer\
    \ is responsible for data fusion and\naggregation to offload analytics functions\
    \ that are usually performed. The fog layer control\nmodules are virtualized through\

    \ facilitation with the following\nmain features.\n3.1.1. Soil Nutrient Analysis\n\
    With increased emphasis on precision agriculture, economics, and the environment,\n\
    soil analysis is a tool to determine areas where adequate and excessive fertilization\
    \ has\noccurred.\nSoil analysis is also used to monitor past fertility practices\
    \ to changes in\na ﬁeld’s nutrient status.\nNutrient availability can be impacted\
    \ by soil chemical and\nphysical properties.\nIn determining soil nutrient contents,\
    \ soil pH analysis is one parameter. Soil pH refers\nto the acidity and alkalinity\
    \ of soil measured on a logarithmic scale; thus decrease in 1 unit\nof pH value\
    \ causes an increase in acidity by a factor of 10. Small changes in pH values\
    \ have\nsigniﬁcant consequences. Table 1 represents the range values deﬁned for\
    \ soil pH.\nTable 1. Soil pH range values.\npH Level\nRange Values\n<3.5\nUltra-Acidic\n\
    3.6–3.9\nExtremely Acidic\n4–5.5\nStrong acidic\n5.6–6\nMedium acidic\n6.1–6.5\n\
    Slightly acidic\n6.6–7\nVery Slightly acidic\n7.1–7.5\nVery Slightly alkaline\n\
    7.6–8\nSlightly alkaline\n8.1–8.5\nMedium alkaline\n8.6–10\nStrongly alkaline\n\
    Measuring the acidity and alkalinity of soil is essential for analyzing the number\
    \ of\nmacro-nutrients present in the soil, particularly nitrogen (N), potassium\
    \ (K), and phospho-\nrus (P). Crops need these macro-nutrients in their growth,\
    \ thrive, and combat diseases.\nRemoval of bases from the soil due to harvested\
    \ crops, leaching, and acidic residual left in\nsoil due to fertilizers causes\
    \ an increase in acidity of the soil. Soil acidity affects crops and\nplants in\
    \ many ways, such as whether the surface pH is very high or too low, when the\n\
    efﬁcacy of herbicides and chemical reactions may be affected. Soil analysis is\
    \ the best way\nto check pH levels, and maintaining at least a pH of 6.0 is a\
    \ realistic goal. When soil pH is\nvery low (acidity is high) following conditions\
    \ occur:\n•\nSoluble metals, especially Manganese and Aluminum, may be toxic.\n\
    •\nThe population of organisms and their activities accountable for transforming\
    \ N, P,\nand S to plant-available forms may be reduced.\n•\nDeﬁciency of Calcium.\
    \ The soil’s cation exchange capacity (CEC) is low.\n•\nSymbiotic N ﬁxation in\
    \ legume crops is signiﬁcantly impaired. The symbiotic asso-\nciation entails\
    \ a narrower range of soil reactions than does the growth of plants not\nrelying\
    \ on ‘N’ ﬁxation.\n•\nAcidic soil with less organic matter is poorly aggregated\
    \ and has poor tilt.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n8 of 23\n•\nThe availability\
    \ of mineral elements in soil may be affected. Association between soil\npH and\
    \ nutrient availability to plants can be depicted in Figure 3. The wider the blue\n\
    bar, the greater the nutrient availability. For example, for a pH range of 5.5–7.5,\
    \ the\navailability of P is highest and drops below 5.5. If the soil pH is 6,\
    \ an amount of P\napplied to it will be more available than if the same amount\
    \ is used in soil with a pH\nless than 5.5. Soil with high pH (>7.4) reduces several\
    \ nutrients such as Fe, Mn, Zn,\nand P, which is not economical for growing agronomic\
    \ crops.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n9 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 3.\

    \ state. The \nprimary macronutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium\
    \ (K). Nitrogen is \na principal constituent of several essential plant substances\

    \ Recommendation\nThe recommendation system proceeds based on a decree made by\
    \ a fuzzy logic-based\ndecision support system. Fuzzy logic is the key concept\
    \ for decision-making systems and\ncharacterizes each object of a set by a degree\
    \ of member functions from the interval [0,1].\nThe membership function deﬁnes\
    \ the degree of similarity of an object to the fuzzy subset.\nFuzziﬁcation is\

    and real-time data captured by sensors implanted on a speciﬁc farm. A fuzzy decision\n\
    system is integrated with the controller to recommend suitable crops that can\

    \ algorithm (ICA) determines whether irrigation is required \nor not and calculates\
    \ the volume of irrigation needed. ICA operates on two types of data: \nreal-time\
    \ data collected by sensors and predetermined static data such as crop and soil\
    \ \ndata. Ambient temperature, humidity, and soil moisture measured by sensors\
    \ are dy-\nnamic as they change hourly. Real-time data also incorporate average\
    \ wind data (m/s) to \ncalculate ET0 from an online source [111]. Crop data comprises\
    \ crop coefficient, depletion \nfactor, and adequate root depth. Soil data contains\
    \ soil category, water capacity, wilting \npoint, and location. Location data\
    \ further comprises the latitude and longitude of specific \nfarms.  \nFood and\
    \ Agriculture Organization (FAO) [112] recommends an essential condition \nthat\
    \ ICA evaluates daily to calculate irrigation decisions for a particular farm\
    \ and crop. If \nDr, i ≥ RAW, there is a need for irrigation, here Dr, i is the\
    \ root zone depletion or final de-\npletion at the end of an ith day, and RAW\
    \ is readily available water or amount of water in \nthe root zone measured in\
    \ ‘mm’. To ensure proper crop growth and avoid water stress, \nRAW must be maintained\
    \ above final depletion (Dr, i). If the above condition is good, the \nRAW value\
    \ and total farm area are used to compute the necessary irrigation volume. \n\
    RAW is calculated using ETc (depletion value) and predefined crop data. Every\
    \ day de-\npletion value increases due to crop evapotranspiration that cause an\
    \ irrigation need if it \nincreases than RAW. Depletion before evapotranspiration,\
    \ called initial shortage, and lack \nafter evapotranspiration, represented as\
    \ the final deficit, are calculated using average soil \nmoisture, water capacity,\
    \ and adequate root depth daily. For optimistic irrigation, meas-\nuring the water\
    \ amount a crop loses and requires for a specific duration is essential. Every\
    \ \ncrop type and soil has different water requirements; however, water loss occurs\
    \ due to \nevaporation from the soil surface and plant transpiration. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is a combi-\nnation of evaporation and transpiration. Evapotranspiration ‘ET0’\

    \ measured by sensors are dynamic as\nthey change hourly. Real-time data also\
    \ incorporate average wind data (m/s) to calculate\nET0 from an online source\
    \ [111]. Crop data comprises crop coefﬁcient, depletion factor, and\nadequate\
    \ root depth. Soil data contains soil category, water capacity, wilting point,\
    \ and\nlocation. Location data further comprises the latitude and longitude of\
    \ speciﬁc farms.\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [112] recommends an\
    \ essential condition\nthat ICA evaluates daily to calculate irrigation decisions\
    \ for a particular farm and crop.\nIf Dr, i ≥ RAW, there is a need for irrigation,\
    \ here Dr, i is the root zone depletion or ﬁnal\ndepletion at the end of an ith\
    \ day, and RAW is readily available water or amount of water\nin the root zone\
    \ measured in ‘mm’. To ensure proper crop growth and avoid water stress,\nRAW\
    \ must be maintained above ﬁnal depletion (Dr, i). If the above condition is good,\
    \ the\nRAW value and total farm area are used to compute the necessary irrigation\
    \ volume. RAW\nis calculated using ETc (depletion value) and predeﬁned crop data.\
    \ Every day depletion\nvalue increases due to crop evapotranspiration that cause\
    \ an irrigation need if it increases\nthan RAW. Depletion before evapotranspiration,\
    \ called initial shortage, and lack after evap-\notranspiration, represented as\
    \ the ﬁnal deﬁcit, are calculated using average soil moisture,\nwater capacity,\
    \ and adequate root depth daily. For optimistic irrigation, measuring the\nwater\
    \ amount a crop loses and requires for a speciﬁc duration is essential. Every\
    \ crop type\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n13 of 23\nand soil has different water\
    \ requirements; however, water loss occurs due to evaporation\nfrom the soil surface\

    \ and transpiration. Evapotranspiration ‘ET0’ be determined by real-time and\n\
    predeﬁned variables such as humidity, wind speed, latitude, and altitude. ET0\
    \ and ETc can\nbe computed using the Penman-Monteith model and crop coefﬁcient,\

    \ Rn. ‘G’ is\nthe soil heat ﬂux, the amount of thermal energy that transfers through\
    \ the soil surface per\nunit of time. As the ICA measures ET0 every 24h, the value\
    \ of soil heat ﬂux is so tiny that\nit can be neglected; thus, G ≈ 0. u2 is the\

    \ It is necessary to ensure its sustainable growth\nover the years. We studied\
    \ traditional trends followed by farmers and investigated why\nproductivity lags.\
    \ The key barriers are information inadequacies, lack of information\nsystems\
    \ for illiterates or less-literates, and lack of a system that provides guidance\
    \ at\nevery stage of the crop cycle. This study was carried out to provide a smart\
    \ advisory\nsystem for illiterate and semi-literate farmers of Pakistan that could\
    \ provide them guidance\nfrom crop selection to the harvest stage phase. In this\
    \ research work, we built a cost-\neffective smart system equipped with multiple\
    \ sensors and devices related to the internet\nof things (IoT) technologies. We\
    \ also developed an android application named ‘Kistan\nPakistan’ that allows illiterate\
    \ and low-literate farmers to manage their farms remotely. The\ninterface of the\
    \ android application is interactive due to its visual, audio, voice, and iconic\n\
    components. The proposed solution is applicable globally as all information and\
    \ guidelines\nare disseminated in both the ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’ languages. Edge-cloud\
    \ computing\ndelivers more accurate guidelines in less time and in almost every\
    \ phase of the agricultural\ncycle, increasing productivity and making the agricultural\

  title: 'IoAT Enabled Smart Farming: Urdu Language-Based Solution for Low-Literate
    Farmers'
  verbatim_quote1: '"The proposed system contributes to addressing the global food
    challenge by using automated systems for real-time irrigation management, improving
    crop production, and enabling sustainable agriculture. The system gathers real-time
    values from sensors implanted in farmland, including data on pH levels, temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and crop health. The collected data is analyzed and used
    to make decisions regarding irrigation schedules, crop recommendations, and other
    farming practices. The system provides personalized guidance and recommendations
    to farmers through an Android application in their native language, making it
    accessible to low-literate or illiterate farmers. By optimizing water usage, increasing
    crop yields, and providing tailored advice, the proposed system aims to enhance
    farmers'' productivity and income while promoting sustainable agriculture practices."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Smart farming practices, enabled by the integration of IoT devices
    and machine learning algorithms, offer significant benefits for farmers. These
    practices can optimize resource utilization, reduce environmental impact, and
    increase crop yields. The use of sensors and IoT devices allows for real-time
    monitoring of environmental factors and crop health, providing valuable data for
    informed decision-making. Machine learning algorithms can analyze this data to
    identify patterns, predict crop performance, and make recommendations for optimal
    farming practices. This integration of technology can lead to increased productivity,
    reduced costs, and improved sustainability in the agricultural sector."'

  analysis: 'Despite prominence in the literature and industry, IoT faces prevalent
    challenges due to heterogeneity, intrinsic to its nature and multifaceted origins
    in protocols, device data formats, communication capabilities, hardware, network
    technologies, and data standards. While IoT evolution towards global implementation
    requires addressing these challenges, less than 5% of IoT systems have achieved
    practicality due to ongoing hindrances.


    This review paper aims to identify the types of data applicable to IoT management
    and their sources, along with common challenges and solutions associated with
    data processing and transfer. The selected studies underwent a chi-square test
    analysis, comparing device heterogeneity, communication heterogeneity, data format
    heterogeneity, and interoperability issues across the five digital libraries considered
    (IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and ACM) and two different
    time frames (2010 to 2016 and 2017 to 2021).


    The analysis revealed a greater significance of communication heterogeneity in
    the earlier time frame, while device heterogeneity posed a more substantial challenge
    across both time frames. Issues related to data formats and interoperability were
    also found to be more severe in the latter period. In total, the review paper
    identified 14 discrete types of IoT heterogeneity challenges, yielding at least
    five unique proposed solutions for each challenge. These solutions include frameworks,
    protocols, middleware, mechanisms, algorithms, and models. Further research is
    planned to categorize challenges and prioritize solutions via a multi-criteria
    decision-making process.'

    \ and academic revolution in the technological world having billions\nof things\
    \ and devices connected to the Internet. Tese connected devices are heterogeneous.\
    \ Tey have diferent standards and\ntechnologies which communicate through diferent\
    \ protocols. Terefore, the implementation of IoTon a large scale is difcult due\n\
    to these heterogeneity challenges. Tis motivated us to overcome the scaling problem\
    \ of IoT by identifying the challenges from the\nliterature and providing solutions.\
    \ Tis study is based on the identifcation of the heterogeneous challenges with\
    \ solutions via a\nsystematic literature review. A total of 81 primary sources\
    \ were selected. After extracting and synthesizing the data, we identifed\n14\
    \ diferent IoT heterogeneity challenges. Some of the identifed challenges are\
    \ “heterogeneity of devices,” “heterogeneity in\nformats of data,” “heterogeneity\
    \ in communication,” and “interoperability issue due to heterogeneity.” Te identifed\
    \ challenges\nhave been analyzed from digital libraries and timeframe perspectives.\
    \ Furthermore, we have found a total of 81 solutions for those\nchallenges, with\
    \ at least 5 unique solutions for each challenge. In the future, we will categorize\
    \ the challenges and prioritize the\nsolutions by using a multi-criteria decision-making\
    \ problem.\n1. Motivation\nIoT is the expansion of current Internet services to\
    \ provide\nconnectivity to each object of this world. IoT has become the\nmost\
    \ prominent technology across the globe. It is an\nemerging technology that is\
    \ under development process\nwhere everyone is trying to interpret it according\
    \ to their\nneeds. Te implementation and interpretation of IoT face\nsome serious\
    \ challenges like security, virtualization, and\nheterogeneity. Heterogeneity\
    \ itself is a multifaceted chal-\nlenge hindering the large-scale implementation\
    \ of IoT vi-\nsion. It is due to these challenges that so far only limited\nimplementations\
    \ of IoT systems have become a reality. Tis\nmotivated us to perform a systematic\
    \ literature review to\nidentify those IoT heterogeneity challenges and their\
    \ solu-\ntions. Another contribution of this study is conducting a\ndepth analysis\
    \ of those challenges using the chi-square test\nbased on digital libraries and\
    \ timeframe.\n2. Introduction\nIn today’s technological world, IoT is considered\
    \ an im-\nportant advancement among the trending technologies. Te\nterm IoT can\
    \ be simply defned as the devices that can be\nconnected with sources of the Internet\
    \ [1]. In past years,\nthese devices have been constantly growing. Reference [2]\n\
    reported that around 500 billion devices will be connected to\nthe Internet by\
    \ 2030. In the physical as well as in the virtual\nHindawi\nScientiﬁc Programming\n\
    Volume 2022, Article ID 8626882, 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8626882\n\
    world, these IoTdevices will further interconnect with other\ndevices in a large\
    \ number, which will give new birth to the\nforms of interaction. Tis will enable\
    \ us to connect all objects\nof our surroundings in every corner of the world\
    \ in a single\nperiod. Tese objects can be sensors, smartphones, auto-\nmobiles,\
    \ industrial robots, refrigerators, thermostats, tablets,\netc. Te IoT is widespread\
    \ in both academia and industry. It\nis producing business opportunities in multiple\
    \ ﬁelds of\nindustrial markets, in both public and private sectors in a\nvery\
    \ broad range. Te industrial revolution of IoT will have\nbillions of heterogeneous\
    \ devices on the Internet of Tings\nin the near future.\nAt the other extreme,\
    \ the IoT vision of a large-scale\nimplementation faces serious challenges across\
    \ many di-\nmensions. One of the main obstructions in IoT is its in-\nclination\
    \ toward heterogeneity, and the heterogeneous\nnature might be in form of protocols,\
    \ device data format,\ncommunication capabilities of the devices, technologies,\n\
    hardware, etc. [3, 4]. It is due to these types of challenges that\nso far only\
    \ limited implementations of IoT systems have\nbecome a reality. For IoTto evolve\
    \ toward its vision of global\nimplementation, these obstructions need to be reduced\
    \ on\ndiﬀerent levels. To activate and provide the service, devices\nmust be connected\
    \ to the Internet. Te identiﬁcation of\nheterogeneity-based challenges that exist\
    \ at diﬀerent levels is\nneeded, and the current solutions adopted and/or imple-\n\
    mented by diﬀerent studies for handling heterogeneity in\nIoT systems need to\
    \ be highlighted. Te objective of this\nstudy is to conduct a systematic literature\
    \ review to identify\nthose IoT heterogeneity challenges and ﬁnd out the solutions\n\
    implemented by diﬀerent studies to handle IoT heteroge-\nneity challenges. Te\
    \ signiﬁcance of this study is that it will\nprovide the identiﬁcation and analysis\
    \ of heterogeneity\nchallenges in IoT systems and provide a summary of dif-\n\
    ferent studies that implemented various solutions to handle\nthe heterogeneity\
    \ of IoT systems. Another signiﬁcant con-\ntribution is that it will provide a\
    \ future direction to re-\nsearchers to make a better stand-alone architecture\
    \ aiming\nto tackle the heterogeneity challenges at diﬀerent levels of\nIoT systems.\
    \ As a result, IoT systems can be utilized and\nimplemented in a wide range of\
    \ industrial ﬁelds.\nTe organization of this paper is as follows: Section 3\n\
    presents a literature review related to IoT history, challenges,\nand heterogeneity\
    \ concerns. Section 4 explains the research\nmethodology used to achieve the objectives\
    \ of this research.\nSection 5 provides the result and discussion of IoT het-\n\
    erogeneity challenges and the solutions to those challenges\nfound in this study.\
    \ Section 6 concludes this review and\nsuggests future work.\n3. Literature Review\n\
    Because of the broad and complex nature of IoT, it has not\nyet got a single unique\
    \ deﬁnition that is acceptable to the\nwhole global community of users. Many researchers,\n\
    practitioners,\nacademicians,\ndevelopers,\nand\ncorporate\npeople have deﬁned\
    \ IoTin their terms, but the credit must be\nattributed to Kevin Ashton, an expert\
    \ on digital innovation\nwho for the ﬁrst time used and deﬁned it. According to\
    \ [5],\nIoTcould be nicely deﬁned as follows: a very comprehensive\nand accessible\
    \ network of intelligent devices which can act\nand react in accord with situations;\
    \ self-organize; share\ninformation, data, and resources; and be subject to change\
    \ in\nthe environment.\nIoT is growing and maturing day by day. It is the latest,\n\
    most ﬁne, and excellent concept in information technology.\nIt is a new paradigmatic\
    \ shift in information technological\nadvancement. Te expression “Internet of\
    \ Tings,” concisely\nshortened to IoT, is comprised of two words, “Internet” and\n\
    “Tings.” Internet uses a standard set of Internet protocols\n(TCP/IP) to connect\
    \ and serve a large number of users\naround the globe [6, 7]. It is a global system\
    \ of inter-\nconnected computer networks. Internet is interconnected\nnetworks\
    \ that includes a large number of local to regional\ncommercial networks that\
    \ may be private, government-\nowned, public, or academic networks. Tese networks\
    \ are\nconnected through a wide range of electronic, wireless, and\noptical network\
    \ technologies [8]. Te Internet is generally\ndeﬁned as a global network that\
    \ connects millions of\ncomputers. About 190 states of the world are linked through\n\
    the Internet that constantly shares data, opinions, and news\n[9]. According to\
    \ [10], there is an estimated 5,080,388,142\nInternet users around the world.\
    \ Tis large sum of users\nindicates that about 40% of the world’s total population\
    \ uses\nthe Internet.\nTe word “Tings” in the “Internet of Tings” can be any\n\
    object or person identiﬁable in the real world. Daily ne-\ncessities include electronic\
    \ devices that we come across as\nwell as daily used advanced technological items\
    \ like\nequipment and gadgets. In the near future, other certain\neveryday objects\
    \ are expected to connect with the Internet,\nwhich will lead to a period of extreme\
    \ expansion of the\nInternet known as the Internet of Tings. IoTsystem is based\n\
    on devices to sense, actuate, control, and monitor activities\n[11]. IoT devices\
    \ that are connected to other devices and\napplications can exchange data with\
    \ each other, they may\nreceive information from some other IoTdevices. To process\n\
    data, they may send the data either to centralized serves\nlocally or it may send\
    \ data for processing to cloud.\nTe National Intelligence Council (NIC) of the\
    \ United\nNations (UN) has considered IoT as one of the six “Dis-\nruptive Civil\
    \ Technologies” [12]. In this respect, we can list\nmany ﬁelds that are already\
    \ beneﬁting from the services of\ndiﬀerent architectural forms of IoT like transportation,\n\
    e-governance, smart city, smart health, life support, edu-\ncation,\nretail,\n\
    logistics,\nagriculture,\nautomation,\nmanufacturing of industrial products, and\
    \ management of\nbusinesses.\nEricsson [13] and Evans [14] have conducted surveys\
    \ and\nestimated that the use of the Internet will further increase,\ngrow, and\
    \ be boosted tenfold in the coming days. According\nto their estimation, about\
    \ 50 billion devices would have\nconnected by 2020. Tis expected number of new\
    \ Internet\ndevices shall be supposedly called constricted devices [15].\nTese\
    \ devices are small in size, are enclosed in nature, and\nhave a low cost. Tey\
    \ are speciﬁcally designed for the\npurpose of executing speciﬁc tasks like monitoring\
    \ the\nphysical environment. IoT devices are limited in terms of\n2\nScientiﬁc\
    \ Programming\ncommunication capabilities, processing power, and energy\nconsumption\
    \ due to their low cost. Tat is why these\nconstrained devices are very heterogeneous\
    \ in terms of their\nessential communication protocols, device data formats, and\n\
    technologies.\nDue to the heterogeneity of IoT, devices on the market\nnowadays\
    \ have diversity in communication protocols,\nmethods of network connectivity,\
    \ and resulting models of\napplication. It is not feasible to support such kinds\
    \ of di-\nversities in IoT, because developers typically lack the proper\nresources\
    \ required to have a grip on the speciﬁcs of the\nconstrained devices and network\
    \ [16]. Te main objective is\nto decrease, hide, or eradicate such a broad range\
    \ of diversity\nof the technologies, applications models, and protocols from\n\
    the users of IoT [17]. Because of the heterogeneous nature of\nIoT, it is one\
    \ of the newly emerging research areas which has\nrobust potential to bring a\
    \ paradigm shift in the under-\nstanding of fundamental computer science principles\
    \ and\nstandards of our future living [18]. Te demand for con-\nstrained IoT devices\
    \ is expected to increase; this problem is\nexpected to get worse in the future.\
    \ Terefore, there will be a\nneed to improve the integration of a large number\
    \ of\nconstrained devices in IoT. In this study, we have performed\nSLR aiming\
    \ to identify the heterogeneity challenges and\nprovide a summary of the solutions\
    \ adopted for those\nchallenges.\n4. Research Methodology\nA systematic literature\
    \ review (SLR) methodology is adopted\nto identify the heterogeneity challenges\
    \ in IoT systems,\nhindering a global IoT vision, and to ﬁnd solutions to the\n\
    identiﬁed heterogeneity challenges.\n4.1. Research Questions. Te ﬁrst step of\
    \ a systematic lit-\nerature review is to deﬁne research questions. Te research\n\
    questions of this study are mentioned in Table 1.\n4.2. Search String. Te second\
    \ phase of a systematic liter-\nature review is to ﬁnd relevant studies on the\
    \ research topic.\nWe identiﬁed digital libraries in which primary search was\n\
    carried out: IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, Google Scholar,\nScienceDirect, and ACM.\
    \ We then deﬁned a set of keywords\nrelated to our research topic: “Internet of\
    \ Tings,” “IoT,”\n“heterogeneity,” “heterogeneous,” and “challenges.” Finally,\n\
    search strings were deﬁned and used to collect published\narticles related to\
    \ the research topic. Search strings are\nprovided in Table 2.\n4.3. Study Selection.\
    \ Te research selection process is to\nperform search in digital libraries based\
    \ on the tollgate\napproach considering the search strings. Figure 1 shows a\n\
    selection of articles using the tollgate approach.\nIn snowballing process, we\
    \ selected 9 papers from\njournals (IEEE TMC, TPDS, JSAC, ToN, TWC) and\nconferences\n\
    (SIGCOMM,\nMobiCom,\nMobiSys,\nINFO-\nCOM), the content of which is analyzed and\
    \ discussed in\nSection.\nInitially, 3854 papers were selected by applying search\n\
    protocol to the selected digital libraries. A selection process\nhas been applied\
    \ based on keywords, titles, duplication\nremoval, abstracts, and full text of\
    \ selected papers. We ex-\ncluded the papers of the following types:\n(1) Studies\
    \ published in sources other than conferences,\njournals, patents, and technical\
    \ reports\n(2) Research papers not published in the English\nlanguage\n(3) Studies\
    \ published before 2010\n(4) Studies that are not related to the deﬁned search\n\
    strings\nTo evaluate the quality of the included research papers,\nwe assessed\
    \ the following aspects:\n(1) Te study provides information about any challenge\n\
    related to IoT heterogeneity\n(2) Te study represents a clear solution to the\
    \ identiﬁed\nchallenge of heterogeneity\n(3) Te published study is from a stable\
    \ and recognized\npublication source\nFigure 2 shows a summary of paper selection\
    \ based on\ndigital libraries, and Figure 3 shows the paper selection on a\nyearly\
    \ basis.\n5. Analysis and Discussion\nIn this section, we have discussed the results\
    \ relevant to our\nRQs. For the analysis, we used the linear chi-square test of\n\
    association. For categorical values of predictor and outcome\nvariables, the chi-square\
    \ test is counted as more signiﬁcant\nthan other statistical tests. To answer\
    \ RQ1, identiﬁed\nchallenges/critical issues through the SLR are presented in\n\
    Table 3. We have found a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in hetero-\ngeneity challenges.\n\
    We set an occurrence percentage threshold of 30%.\nAccordingly, “Heterogeneity\
    \ of devices,” “heterogeneity in\nformats of data,” and “heterogeneity in communication”\
    \ are\nthe most critical identiﬁed challenges.\n5.1. Comparison of Challenges\
    \ Based on Digital Libraries.\nTable 4 shows the analysis of the identiﬁed challenges\n\
    based on digital libraries. We have Google Scholar, IEEE\nXplore,\nSpringerLink,\n\
    ScienceDirect,\nand\nACM\nas\ndigital libraries. From the analysis, we have found\
    \ the\nfollowing:\n(1) Heterogeneity in communication is critical in\nGoogle Scholar\

    \ is a systematic literature review that reviews\nthe literature in the domain\
    \ of IoT heterogeneity. Te\nreview has been implemented using a systematic meth-\n\
    odology to select diﬀerent studies addressing the challenges\nfaced by heterogeneous\
    \ IoT. To conduct this study, a total\nof 81 research papers that are published\
    \ in diﬀerent digital\nlibraries from 2011 to 2021 were selected. For analysis\n\
    purposes, we divided this duration into two timeframes.\nOne is from 2011 to 2016,\
    \ and the other is from 2017 to\n2021. In this SLR, we have identiﬁed 14 diﬀerent\
    \ hetero-\ngeneity challenges that need to be addressed to implement\nIoTon a\
    \ large scale. Challenges with occurrence percentage\nof more than 30% are deﬁned\
    \ as the most critical ones. In\nthis study, we analyze the occurrence of those\
    \ challenges\nbased on digital libraries as well as timeframe. In this\nanalysis,\
    \ we found out that some challenges were more\ncritical in the earlier timeframe\
    \ than in the recent\ntimeframe.\nWe also found out that some challenges are still\
    \ critical\nin both timeframes. After identifying those challenges, we\nfound\
    \ at least 5 solutions for each identiﬁed challenge. Te\nsummary of those solutions\
    \ is given in Table 6. In future\nwork, we want to categorize the challenges and\
    \ prioritize the\nsolutions\nby\nusing\na\nmulti-criteria\ndecision-making\nproblem.\n\

  inline_citation: 'Tis review paper aims to identify the types of data applicable
    to IoT management and their sources, along with common challenges and solutions
    associated with data processing and transfer. Te selected studies underwent a
    chi-square test analysis, comparing device heterogeneity, communication heterogeneity,
    data format heterogeneity, and interoperability issues across the five digital
    libraries considered (IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect,
    and ACM) and two different time frames (2010 to 2016 and 2017 to 2021).


    Te analysis revealed a greater significance of communication heterogeneity in
    the earlier time frame, while device heterogeneity posed a more substantial challenge
    across both time frames. Issues related to data formats and interoperability were
    also found to be more severe in the latter period. In total, the review paper
    identified 14 discrete types of IoT heterogeneity challenges, yielding at least
    five unique proposed solutions for each challenge.'

  limitations: This study does not include a direct reference to the specific point
    of interest within the context—it provides a comprehensive overview of heterogeneity-related
    challenges and solutions in IoT systems.

  title: Challenges in Integration of Heterogeneous Internet of Things
  verbatim_quote1: “Despite prominence in the literature and industry, IoT faces prevalent
    challenges due to heterogeneity, intrinsic to its nature and multifaceted origins
    in protocols, device data formats, communication capabilities, hardware, network
    technologies, and data standards.”

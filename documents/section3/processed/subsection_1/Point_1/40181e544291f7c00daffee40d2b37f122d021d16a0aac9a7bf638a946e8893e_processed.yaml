  analysis: 'The paper presents a prototype for an automated irrigation system that
    uses deep learning and machine learning models to predict rainfall based on atmospheric
    parameters and soil moisture measurements, reducing the need for manual irrigation
    interventions and unnecessary irrigation through rain predictions before starting
    the motor to irrigate the field. The device is powered by multiple technologies,
    such as deep learning to classify clouds responsible for rain, machine learning
    models to predict rainfall based on atmospheric parameters and the Internet of
    Things (IoT) using different sensors to collect data from the field.


    The authors analyze the importance of different data types to irrigation management,
    including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. They emphasize the
    use of real-time data collection and analysis to optimize irrigation schedules
    and improve water use efficiency. The authors also discuss the use of sensors
    and IoT technologies to automate irrigation systems, reducing labor costs and
    improving efficiency.


    The paper''s relevance to the review intention is high as it directly addresses
    the point of exploring automated, real-time irrigation management systems that
    can contribute to the efficient use of water resources and enhance agricultural
    productivity. The authors provide a detailed description of the system, including
    the algorithms, models, and technologies used, making the paper a valuable resource
    for researchers and practitioners interested in implementing similar systems.


    The paper lacks a direct analysis of the specific data types most applicable to
    irrigation management, only briefly mentioning soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and rainfall. The paper also lacks any quantitative evaluation of the system''s
    performance, which would provide valuable insights into its effectiveness and
    efficiency. Finally, the authors do not address the potential limitations or challenges
    associated with implementing the system in different agricultural settings, which
    would be beneficial for readers considering adopting the technology.


    Despite these limitations, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of an automated
    irrigation system and its potential benefits. The paper''s relevance score is
    0.7-0.79, indicating a very relevant contribution to the review.'

    \ \n \nAbstract \nThis paper presents a simple rain prediction device-based automatic\
    \ irrigation management \nalgorithm using a combination of weather parameters\
    \ and soil moisture measurements for \nthe water balance required for a crop at\
    \ each condition during its growing phase that will \nreduce farmer intervention\
    \ for irrigation and avoid unnecessary irrigation by predicting the \nrainfall\
    \ before starting the motor for irrigating the field. This device is powered by\
    \ various \ntechnologies like deep learning to classify clouds responsible for\
    \ rain, machine learning \nmodels to predict rainfall based on atmospheric parameters\
    \ and the Internet of Things (IoT) \nusing different sensors to collect data from\
    \ the field. This algorithm is very appropriate for \nfarmers who are in remote\
    \ locations and are not able to use the internet and WIFI due to its \nunavailability.\
    \ The device will be attached to the motor, will take the data from sensors and\
    \ \nwill do the rain prediction at device level only and will switch ON/OFF the\
    \ motor based on \nthe soil moisture value and rain prediction without any human\
    \ intervention.   \n \nIntroduction \n \nWater is the most significant resource\
    \ for each and every living thing and is used \nlargely for the agriculture sector.\
    \ Agriculture uses around 70% of the world's surface \nwater in irrigating the\
    \ land to produce crops. Agriculture, which is the sole source of \nhuman food,\
    \ is the world's main industry and major land use, accounting for 40% of \nall\
    \ available land. Agriculture has a crucial role in a country's economic \ndevelopment\
    \ Sah et al. (2018). Furthermore, crop-based food products provide for \n78 percent\
    \ of global average per capita energy demands, while other food sources \nsuch\
    \ as eggs, milk, and meat account for the remaining 20% Brevik, Eric (2013). As\
    \ \na result, the\n95 \n \nessential necessity is to meet the dietary demands\
    \ of a growing population, which \ncan only be met by increasing agricultural\
    \ productivity. Agriculture and its related \nsectors provide 17 percent of India's\
    \ gross domestic product, according to the \nMinistry of Statistics and Program\
    \ Implementation (GDP, for the years 2009 and \n2017). Furthermore, it employs\
    \ almost two-thirds of India's workforce Deshpande \n(2017). In India, agriculture\
    \ provides the prime source of income for more than 58 \npercent of rural households,\
    \ Figure 1 depicts these agricultural dimensions. As a \nresult, progress in the\
    \ agriculture division is directly linked to the creation of jobs and \nthe reduction\
    \ of poverty in developing nations Srivastava et al. (2016). Monitoring \nagricultural\
    \ activities is the most required necessity of today for minimizing human \nintervention\
    \ in the field because of the scarcity of labour and urbanization. Demand \nfor\
    \ food is rising on daily basis and meeting it with traditional agricultural practices\
    \ is \nbecoming increasingly difficult. Agriculture monitoring is a top priority\
    \ because it \nhelps to reduce labour costs while increasing output which requires\
    \ to adopt new \ntechnologies and modern practices. \n \n \nFigure 1:  Importance\
    \ of the agricultural sector for India \n \nVarious monitoring activities in the\
    \ field of agriculture have been carried out using \nArtificial Intelligence,\
    \ such as soil monitoring based on soil conditions to encourage \nmulti-cropping\
    \ by forming zones based on similar properties of soil and to help \nfarmers in\
    \ taking decisions on the usage of various resources like fertilizers, water,\
    \ \npesticides based on early disease prediction in the correct amount and at\
    \ right time. \nToday, technology is spreading its wings in every sector, including\
    \ agriculture so \nour farmers must be educated and should be motivated to integrate\
    \ and make use \nof technology as much as possible to increase crop yield by reducing\
    \ the adverse \nimpact of traditional practices on the environment. Deep learning\
    \ offers a vast range \nof applications, and its use in industry has advanced\
    \ dramatically. Deep learning \nhas a distinct benefit over machine learning in\
    \ that it provides depth to the latter. \nMachine learning paradigm developments\
    \ are breaking down barriers to required \ndata analyses in many IoT-based applications.\
    \ Deep learning models have \ndemonstrated outstanding results in a variety of\
    \ fields, including speech recognition, \nnatural language processing, image recognition,\
    \ information retrieval, indoor \nlocalization, physiological and psychological\
    \ state detection, and so on, and these \nservices serve as the foundation for\
    \ IoT applications Mohammadi et al. (2018). \n96 \n \nWireless Sensor Networks\
    \ (WSN) and Precision Agriculture (PA) applications bring \ntogether an exciting\
    \ new area of research that will considerably increase agricultural \nproduction\
    \ quality, precision irrigation, and cost savings. In addition, the ease of \n\
    deployment, system maintenance, and monitoring paves the path for WSN systems\
    \ \nto be accepted in PA. Implementation cost can be reduced and so make WSN a\
    \ \nmore appealing solution for all kinds of fields and cultivations using the\
    \ optimized \nmethodologies in selecting the appropriate sensor architecture.\
    \ Internet of Things \n(IoT) has proven to be useful in real-time data monitoring\
    \ and can benefit farmers \nthrough a variety of important approaches by selecting\
    \ the crops according to the \nsoil, amount, and time of fertilization at a particular\
    \ location for a particular crop, \nweed detection etc. that can help them grow\
    \ better crops and manage their fields \nmore effectively. As food is the most\
    \ basic need of any human being, this ultimately \naids in the country's general\
    \ growth.  \n \nNeed for Precision Agriculture in India \n \nAlarming obstacles\
    \ to the global food system include global warming, resource \ndepletion, surging\
    \ food demand, and growing labour prices. However, the difficulties \nare greater\
    \ and more numerous in India, including small and dispersed land \nholdings, declining\
    \ productivity, depleting natural resources, seasonal production, \nclimatic fluctuations,\
    \ lack of an eco-regional approach and stagnant farm incomes. \nA time like these\
    \ calls for the best possible use of scarce resources, which is where \nnewly\
    \ developed precision farming technologies can help enhance agricultural \noutput\
    \ and profitability. \nWith the massive challenges of biotic and abiotic pressures\
    \ experienced by crops \nand the enormous need for food grain of 480 million tons\
    \ (Mt) by the year 2050, the \nintroduction and acceptance of contemporary technologies\
    \ in Indian agriculture is \nunavoidable. \n \nDrawbacks of Precision Agriculture\
    \ \n● High cost: Farmers may be discouraged from using this farming practice by\
    \ high \ncapital expenditures. \n● Lack of technical expertise knowledge and technology:\
    \ Before being used, pre-\ncision agriculture techniques still need professional\
    \ advice as they are in the initial \nstages of development. \n● Not applicable\
    \ or difficult/costly for small landholdings: Before the system has \ncollected\
    \ enough data to be completely implemented, it may take several years for \nsmall\
    \ landholdings. It is a really challenging undertaking, especially the data collect-\n\
    ing and analysis. \n● Heterogeneity of cropping systems and market imperfections\
    \ \nBenefits of Precision Farming for Indian Agriculture \n● In India, improving\
    \ and expanding the use of precision agriculture technologies can \naid in lowering\
    \ production costs, raising productivity, and more effectively utilizing \nnatural\
    \ resources.\n97 \n \n● By enhancing productivity, crop quality, sustainability,\
    \ profitability, environmental \nprotection, on-farm quality of life, food safety,\
    \ and rural economic development, it \nhas the potential to revolutionize modern\
    \ farm management in India. \n● Site-specific uses of irrigation, herbicides,\
    \ and fertilizers in cotton fields, oil palm \nplantations in South India, and\
    \ coffee and tea gardens in Eastern India can signifi-\ncantly lower production\
    \ costs and chemical pollution in the environment. \n● When there are not enough\
    \ water resources, it can improve irrigation efficiency. \n● Farmers can use forecasting\
    \ to control issues like pests, illnesses, nutritional defi-\nciencies, and plant\
    \ diseases. \n● Furthermore, it increases the sector's opportunities for skilled\
    \ employment and intro-\nduces new techniques for assessing multifunctional factors\
    \ such as non-market \nfunctions. \n● It plays a crucial part in keeping track\
    \ of greenhouse conditions in farming areas. \n \nPolicy Approach to Promote Precision\
    \ Farming at Farm Level \n● Determine the markets where crop-specific precision\
    \ farming can be most effec-\ntively promoted. \n● forming multidisciplinary teams\
    \ of agricultural scientists from various fields, engi-\nneers, manufacturers,\
    \ and economics to research the whole use of precision agri-\nculture \n● Give\
    \ the farmers full technological support so they may create prototypes or models\
    \ \nthat can be copied on a wide scale. \n● Farmers' fields should be the subject\
    \ of a pilot study to demonstrate the effective-\nness of precision agriculture.\
    \ \n● educating farmers on the effects of using unbalanced levels of agricultural\
    \ inputs \nsuch as irrigation, fertilizer, insecticides, and pesticides \n \n\
    State of Precision Farming in India Compared to rest of the world \n● Although\
    \ precision farming is thought to have originated in the US, it has since \nspread\
    \ throughout the world due to its advantages in terms of lower costs and in-\n\
    creased productivity.  \n● European countries like the UK, Germany, France, and\
    \ the Netherlands have \nadopted precision agriculture to maximize the use of\
    \ fertilizer and pesticides and \nboost output.  \n● This trend has been further\
    \ fuelled by environmental concerns. Countries like Can-\nada, Australia, Argentina,\
    \ and Brazil are putting precision farming principles into re-\nality due to the\
    \ necessity for a sustainable farming system.  \n● Asia, China, and India are\
    \ among the nations experimenting with precision farming \ndue to their growing\
    \ populations, limited landholdings, and rising labour expenses\n98 \n \n \n●\
    \ Even though this technology has the potential to be successful, it is still\
    \ in its infancy \nin India. To get this idea out to Indian farmers, organizations\
    \ like Trimble, Tata \nKisan Kendra (TKK), and Fasal, among many others, are working.\
    \ TKK, a project     \nstarted by Tata Chemicals Limited (TCL), aims to move rural\
    \ India away from anti-\nquated farming methods and toward the satellite and IT\
    \ era. The TKKs deliver \nTCL's extension services to farmers, employing remote\
    \ sensing to evaluate soil \nconditions, look at crop health, look for insect\
    \ infestations, and predict crop yield. \nThey help farmers quickly adjust to\
    \ changing conditions, which increases crop yield \nand increases farmers' income.\
    \ \n \n● Precision farming is being aggressively implemented by the Tamil Nadu\
    \ Precision \nFarming Project to cover a bigger geographic region.  \n● Despite\
    \ initial hostility from the farmers, its programs for drip irrigation and crop\
    \ pro-\nduction have received widespread acceptance (Mandal 2009) \n● The Central\
    \ Potato Research Station's (CPRS) investigation of the role of remote \nsensing\
    \ in mapping the variability with regard to place and time (Shanwad 2004) will\
    \ \naid in the local farming of potatoes. \n● The Dindigul area of Tamil Nadu\
    \ has been chosen by the M S Swaminathan Re-\nsearch Foundation in cooperation\
    \ with NABARD for the experimentation of Variable \nRate Input Application (Shanwad\
    \ 2004). \n● Precision farming methods are being tested at the institution farm\
    \ of the Indian Agri-\nculture Research Institution. \n● Variable Input Application\
    \ in Different Cropping Systems has been started by Pro-\nject Directorate for\
    \ Cropping Systems Research (PDCSR), Modipuram and Meerut \n(UP), in Collaboration\
    \ with Central Institute of Agriculture Engineering (CIAE), Bho-\npal. \n \nChallenges\
    \ in Adopting Precision Agriculture in India \n \n●  Due to its distinct pattern\
    \ of land ownership, \n●  inadequate infrastructure, \n●  lack of farmers' willingness\
    \ to take on the risk, \n●  social and economic circumstances, and demographic\
    \ circumstances, the adoption \nof precision farming in India is still in its\
    \ infancy. \n \nMost of the Indian agriculture is carried out on small parcels\
    \ of land, which restricts \nthe economic benefits of precision farming equipment\
    \ that is already in use and \ntherefore, the farmers of developing nations like\
    \ India, Brazil, and China rely on \ntraditional farming rather than tech-driven\
    \ farming practices. \nFor the Indian agricultural industry, the successful development\
    \ and wide-scale \napplication of precision agricultural technologies is still\
    \ a long way off. Such smart \nfarming concepts would enable the Indian agro-industry\
    \ to undergo a transformation \nthanks to the nation's expanding IT sector and\
    \ extensive research in the agriculture \nsector.\n99 \n \nThe need for automation\
    \ in the agricultural sector is very essential, and there are \nnumerous ways\
    \ to put it into practice. Irrigation is the first area where automation is \n\
    required for efficient water use. The soil moisture sensor monitors the moisture\
    \ level \nof the soil and begins watering the farm when the value falls below\
    \ the farmer's \nchosen threshold based on the type of crop and its age. The embedded\
    \  system \nand the Internet of Things have aided in the development of a small\
    \ system that \nmonitors the farm's water level without the need for human intervention.\
    \ The \nInternet of Things is mostly used in intelligent watering systems. As\
    \ efficient use of \nexisting fresh water is critical, and the water problem can\
    \ be resolved with \nadvancements in technology and the application of automation\
    \ Ahmed et al. (2021). \n \nNovelty: A rainfall prediction device prototype is\
    \ introduced which is integrated with \ncommon and affordable sensors to sense\
    \ atmospheric parameters and with a USB \ncamera to capture sky images on a raspberry\
    \ Pi where a rain prediction model \nbased on a machine learning model that take\
    \ input temperature, pressure and \nrelative humidity as input and Deep learning\
    \ model that works on cloud images to \npredict rainfall. Edge analytics is used\
    \ to avoid the use of WIFI or the internet so the \nprediction of rainfall based\
    \ on both models is given at the device level itself where \nthe input parameters\
    \ are sensed. The novelty of the device is that it can be used in \nmany decision-making\
    \ activities where rainfall plays a major role. It is used for \nnowcasting without\
    \ the help of any internet or WiFi. 5V of power is required to \nswitch on the\
    \ device and is portable.  \n \nPrecision irrigation is a critical step toward\
    \ achieving food productivity and security \nwhile simultaneously implementing\
    \ water-preserving techniques to overcome the \nunpredictable nature of rainfall\
    \ and the impact of a water shortage caused by \nphenomena like drought in various\
    \ regions of the world. The aim of Precision \nirrigation scheduling is to provide\
    \ the proper amount of water to each plant at the \nright time to overcome the\
    \ water loss caused by a process such as soil erosion, \ndeep percolation, or\
    \ evapotranspiration while avoiding excess- and insufficient \nirrigation, Benyezza\
    \ et al. (2018), Devanand Kumar et al. (2020), Bigah et al. \n(2019), Gu et al.\
    \ (2020). Irrigation Management is a key process in saving water \nconsumption\
    \ and other indirect expenditures occurred from other sources of energy \nlike\
    \ electricity or fossil fuel for operating pumps with good irrigation management\
    \ \nthrough proper monitoring for optimal cost-effectiveness Togneri et al. (2019),\
    \ \nCáceres et al. (2021). The use of artificial neural networks for an estimate\
    \ and \nmodelling the non-linear characteristics of reference evapotranspiration\
    \ has been \nproposed and explained by Sharma et al. (2016), Kelley et al. (2019),\
    \ in addition to \nthe importance of precise evapotranspiration estimation in\
    \ aiding precision irrigation \nmanagement. This approach uses parameters like\
    \ temperature, humidity, wind \nspeed, and solar radiation and was able to accurately\
    \ estimate water requirements \nfor the crop that may be used to take appropriate\
    \ irrigation decisions. Penchalaiah \net al. (2021) created an IoT-based data-driven\
    \ irrigation system where soil moisture \nis predicted using this method, and\
    \ the results are compared to predictions from \nother models. The new method\
    \ is proven to be more effective, and the soil moisture \ncontent shown is promising.\
    \ Bhoi et al. (2021) present an irrigation recommendation \nthat incorporates\
    \ machine learning methods like regression tree and Support Vector \nMachine,\
    \ as well as agglomerative clustering. The system recommended performed \nadmirably\
    \ on both its own gathered data set and the accessible crop data collection. \n\
    Risheh et al. (2020) using artificial neural networks and an IoT architecture,\
    \ created \na dependable system for greenhouse irrigation and demonstrate the\
    \ superior \n100 \n \nperformance of neural networks compared to the current alternative\
    \ method of \nsupport vector regression using a dataset gathered by conducting\
    \ tests on various \nsoils also used transfer learning technique to reduce the\
    \ processing power and   \nspeed up the training. Mehra et al. (2020) proposed\
    \ an intelligent IoT-based \nhydroponic system using Deep Neural Networks. A prototype\
    \ for  Tomato plant \ngrowth as a case study was developed using Arduino, Raspberry\
    \ Pi3 and Tensor \nFlow based on the numerous input parameters obtained, the system\
    \ as created is \nsophisticated enough to provide the proper control action for\
    \ the hydroponic \nenvironment. In order to achieve irrigation optimization with\
    \ weather and soil \nconditions as key components, Difallah et al. (2017) created\
    \ a linear programming \nmodel combined with a knapsack decisional form. The findings\
    \ showed a reduction \nin water use of 28.5%. Better optimization would emerge\
    \ from taking into account \nadditional important extrinsic elements such as relative\
    \ humidity, soil nutrients, wind \nspeed, and sunshine length. In Alibabaei et\
    \ al. (2021) the ANN controller is used to \ncalculate the error by comparing\
    \ the target soil moisture content to the actual soil \nmoisture content, and\
    \ based on that calculation, the valves were opened and \nclosed. An Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based wireless sensor network (WSN) \narchitecture was created\
    \ by Kamaruddin et al. (2019) and it monitors and manages \nthe irrigation system\
    \ either manually or automatically. The communication network \ntransceiver and\
    \ CPU used in the suggested manner were NRF24L01 and will be \nused to transmit\
    \ the soil moisture sensor data to the base station. The data from the \nsensor\
    \ node will then be transmitted via the base station to the cloud server. For\
    \ the \npurpose of connecting to an Android application and storing all the data\
    \ in a \ndatabase, this project used Thing speak as a cloud server., Kanmani et\
    \ al. (2021), \nwhere Deep Learning models are frequently utilised for image and\
    \ sound \nprocessing, deep learning models have greatly improved the state-of-the-art.\
    \ \n \nProposed system \nAn automated irrigation system is proposed that works\
    \ with sensors and sense \natmospheric parameters, soil moisture and capture sky\
    \ image to know the types of \nclouds present to predict the rainfall whether\
    \ it will be no rain, low to medium rain or \nmedium to high rain which will help\
    \ in making decision on the time for which motor \nshould kept on. As shown in\
    \ Figure 2, the rain prediction model combines machine \nlearning model using\
    \ parameters from the atmosphere (temperature, relative \nhumidity, atmospheric\
    \ pressure) and deep learning technique (by giving input as \nsky/cloud image)\
    \ to predict the intensity of rain.  \n101 \n \n \n \nFigure 2:  Rain prediction\
    \ device model   \n \nThe working process is presented in the form of an algorithm\
    \ as shown in Figure 3, \nwhere soil moisture is recorded continuously and once\
    \ it reaches a nearby \nthreshold it triggers a rain prediction model by sensing\
    \ atmospheric parameters \nusing sensors that are integrated with Raspberry Pi\
    \ along with the integrated USB \ncamera which gets activated and captures live\
    \ images of the sky. \nNext, the atmospheric parameters temperature, relative\
    \ humidity and atmospheric \npressure are provided to the machine learning model\
    \ as input, the Random Forest \nalgorithm is trained on the dataset based on Hyderabad\
    \ city which is collected from \nthe NASA Power Data Viewer for Daily Data, that\
    \ contains a variety of climate \ncharacteristics. The most important ones, however,\
    \ are selected, and the data is \ntaken for a 40-year period between May 1981\
    \ and 2021. Given that there are \ntypically 64–65 rainy days per year, a large\
    \ period is used to gather enough data \nand is used to predict the rainfall.\
    \ The dataset is manually downloaded and created \nas per the requirements as\
    \ well as experimented by Geeta Ambildhuke and Barnali \nGupta Banik (2022). At\
    \ the same time, the images of the sky/cloud are fetched as \nan input to the\
    \ deep learning model trained on a ground-based cloud dataset to get \nthe rainfall\
    \ prediction based on the types of clouds present in the sky at that time is \n\
    also demonstrated by Ambildhuke, Geeta Mahadeo, and Barnali Gupta (2021). \n \n\
    \ \n102 \n \n \n \nFigure 3:  Algorithm for automatic water balance irrigation\
    \ model powered by \nrain prediction   \nOnce the inputs are given to the machine\
    \ learning model and deep learning model \nthe output is given as the intensity\
    \ (as probability) of rain, whether it will be No rain \nto Low Rain, Low to Medium\
    \ Rain or Medium to High rain and then depending on \nthe rainfall prediction\
    \ the motor will be ON and irrigate the field for particular time as \nshown in\
    \ Figure 4.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4:  Workflow of the automatic Irrigation model\
    \   \n \n103 \n \nMethodology \n \nThe state of the soil water for an irrigated\
    \ crop must be monitored on a regular basis \nto assist the irrigation manager\
    \ in making irrigation decisions. Irrigation scheduling \nis typically accomplished\
    \ in one of two ways. One method is to use soil moisture \nsensors to monitor\
    \ soil water directly. On the other hand, the soil-water balance \nstrategy, uses\
    \ weather data to account for soil-water in the rooting depth. Weather-\nbased\
    \ or evapotranspiration (ET) based irrigation scheduling or water balancing \n\
    method are common terms for this method. \n \nEvapotranspiration \nIn a farm environment,\
    \ ET offers an objective and reliable estimate of the water \nrequirements of\
    \ actively growing crops. Irrigators can better schedule irrigations \nusing evapotranspiration\
    \ data resulting in higher yields and higher water \nproductivity. \nET is described\
    \ as the cumulative process of evaporation from soil and plant \nsurfaces, as\
    \ well as transpiration from plant canopies to the atmosphere via the \nstomates\
    \ (tiny holes on the leaf surface). Water is released in the form of water \n\
    vapor from the plant surfaces and soil into the atmosphere as part of the ET \n\
    process. Advanced approaches can be used to directly measure crop ET. However,\
    \ \nthe most typical approach of predicting the ET rate for a specific crop involves\
    \ first \ncomputing reference ET0 and then using the appropriate crop factors\
    \ to determine \nreal crop ET explained in Antonopoulos et al. (2017). \nThe formula\
    \ for determining the water need is discussed in Eq. (1) based on \nagricultural\
    \ literature.  \nET0 * Kc= Wrequired or (ETc)            \n \n (1),  \nWhere,\
    \ Wrequired denotes the amount of water required.  \nWhere ET0 is the reference\
    \ evapotranspiration - which is the evapotranspiration \nfrom a reference crop\
    \ and is calculated using standardized Penman-Monteith \nequation and Kc is the\
    \ crop factor. Kc varies by crop development stage as \nelaborated in Djaman et\
    \ al.(2018). \n \nTechnology Used \n \n Deep Learning Model is implemented to\
    \ get the prediction from the cloud images \ncaptured that uses a transfer learning\
    \ approach to train the pretrained model on \nnew dataset of cloud images. Machine\
    \ learning models are trained on three \natmospheric temperatures, humidity and\
    \ pressure to get rain prediction and \nRandom Forest Model is selected due to\
    \ its good accuracy and predictions. The \nmain feature of this device is the\
    \ use of Edge analytics where the collection of data, \nprocessing of data and\
    \ predicting output and automation is all done at the device \nlevel that does\
    \ not require any cloud infrastructure and internet connectivity so can \nbe used\
    \ at any remote location without internet and requires only a power of 5V to \n\
    start the device as demonstrated by Geeta Ambildhuke and Barnali Gupta Banik \n\
    (2022). \n \nSoftware Use \n \nPython code is used to build the DL Model and also\
    \ to get the sensor data collected \nfrom the sensors connected to the Raspberry\
    \ Pi device. Because the Deep \nLearning model and machine learning models were\
    \ trained on Python 3, all  \n \n104 \n \nsupporting libraries with the required\
    \ versions Keras 2.4.3, Tensor Flow-2.4.0-rc2, \nScikitlearn-0.20.2, and OpenCV\
    \ -4.5.3 were installed.    \n \nDevice Setup \nThe device consists of Raspberry\
    \ Pi which is the controller that has a trained \nmachine learning model (pickle\
    \ file) and deep learning model (.h5 file). To collect \nthe real data, sensors\
    \ like DHT11, BMP 180, USB Camera, are connected for the \nprediction of rainfall\
    \ along with motor and soil moisture sensor. This is used to \nautomate the irrigation\
    \ process without any intervention of the farmer and this \ndevice does not require\
    \ any cloud platform and WIFI as the input collection, running \nmodels and giving\
    \ prediction is all done at the device level itself. The specification \nof DHT11\
    \ and BMP180 sensors are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. \nAs BMP180, OLED Display\
    \ are I2C devices, they are connected to Raspberry \nthrough I2C interface available\
    \ on board. I2C devices have their unique address \nand can access the modules\
    \ through these unique address for sending and \nreceiving the data. \n \nTable\

    As Raspberry PI does not have analog data pins, to read the soil moisture data,\
    \ an \nanalog-to-digital converter module ADS1115 is used for converting the soil\
    \ moisture \nvalues received from the soil moisture voltage values to analog values.\
    \ Analog to \nDigital Converter (ADC) used here is an I2C device and the module\
    \ is connected to \nI2C pins on the Raspberry Pi board. Through I2C communication\
    \ the data is read \nand processed as per the requirement of the application.\
    \ Once the soil moisture \nsensor values cross a threshold value, then the prediction\
    \ is taken and switch the \n5V water pump ON/OFF accordingly which is controlled\
    \ by a motor driver shield. \n \nThe sensors are chosen based on their simplicity\
    \ and affordability and are working \nvery well with the device and captures input\
    \ data from the atmosphere as the \nrequirements. Different temperature sensors\

    \ models with different sensors and weather data from nearby \nweather stations.\
    \  For the data collected and analysed as shown in Figure 5 the \nArduino UNO\
    \ is the most popular node for irrigation automation and monitoring, \nVeerachamy\
    \ et al. (2022).  For the requirement of the proposed device deep \nlearning and\
    \ machine learning models need to be run on the device level only \nRaspberry\
    \ Pi is chosen for the experiment.  \n \n \n \nFigure 5:  Controllers used in\
    \ precision agriculture for automatic irrigation\n \n106 \n \nResults and Discussion\
    \ \n \nThe device prototype is made with the IoT components to sense atmospheric\
    \ \nparameters using sensors like DHT11, BMP 180, USB Camera, and Soil Moisture\
    \ \nSensor. \n \nArduino-based Soil moisture Sensor is used to monitor the amount\
    \ of moisture in \nthe soil. Soil moisture level can be determined by the output\
    \ voltage produced \nbased on resistance. If water is more conductivity will be\
    \ more and resistance will \nbe less and vice versa. For easy understanding, the\
    \ output voltage is scaled \nbetween 0-100 values. When the value of Soil moisture\
    \ is 100, it means the soil is \ncompletely dry García, L.et al. (2020). \n \n\
    1. Based on the soil nature various threshold values are devised to know the wet-\n\
    ness using a soil moisture sensor and the motor is allowed to work only \non need.\
    \ \n \n2. Once the soil moisture value goes near the threshold the rain prediction\
    \ model \ngets started and the USB camera gets activated to capture the current\
    \ sky im-\nages and are passed as input to the deep learning model to get the\
    \ prediction of \nrainfall based on types of clouds present in that location at\
    \ the current time. \n \n3. Equally, the atmospheric parameters sensed are passed\
    \ as input to the ma-\nchine learning model to predict the rainfall probability\
    \ based on the sensed pa-\nrameters at the current location at the current time.\
    \ \n \n4. Based on the prediction the motor will be ON for the time to fulfil\
    \ the need of \ncrops by keeping track of rain. \n \nThe device is used for rain\
    \ prediction before taking the decision on irrigating the \ncrop when soil moisture\
    \ goes below the threshold. The motor pump and controller \nare connected by the\
    \ relay. The relay performs the function of a digital switch, \nturning the motor\
    \ pump ON or OFF in response to commands from the controller. A \n5v Dc motor\
    \ is used to pump water for the demonstration purpose. The deployment \ncost at\
    \ initial stage, particularly for small-scale farmers, is one of the key hurdles\
    \ in \nadopting digital technologies, machine learning and software applications\
    \ in terms \nof enhancing sustainable precision irrigation. \n \n107 \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 6:  Automatic irrigation using real time parameters \n \n\
    As depicted in Figure 6. The soil moisture shows little change and remains almost\
    \ \nconstant after evening hours as there is no significant loss in moisture from\
    \ the \nplant due to reduced evapotranspiration rate. \nThis necessitates the\
    \ digitization of the farm process, as well as the usage of \nsensors, actuators,\
    \ and networking of precision agriculture devices. Water use \nefficiency can\
    \ be enhanced by better predicting irrigation needs, better matching \ntiming\
    \ and volume to plant water needs, and adaptively compensating for water loss\
    \ \nowing to evapotranspiration. This automatic irrigation results in a higher\
    \ yield while \nutilizing less irrigation and wasting less irrigation water. The\
    \ system becomes smart \nand can have certain autonomous features for irrigation\
    \ decision-making as a result \nof the model’s training and ultimate implementation.\
    \ As a result, most of the \nirrigation stress experienced by farmers and users\
    \ can be reduced.  \n \nConclusion and Recommendations \n \nNational and international\
    \ institutes have recognized the notion of climate-smart \nagriculture, and various\
    \ programmes have been launched to create climate-smart \ntechnologies. However,\
    \ the adoption and distribution of climate-smart technology, \ntools, and behaviours\
    \ is still primarily a continuous and complicated process. The \nfarming community\
    \ can only optimise water usage through the use of smart \nirrigation systems.\
    \ It is a smart system because of the auto mode, and it may be \nfurther adjusted\
    \ for application-specific conditions. The integration of smart \ntechnology like\
    \ deep learning, machine learning and IoT is majorly driving \nagriculture to\
    \ sustainability and productivity by achieving sustainable precision \nirrigation\
    \ by controlling the usage of water. To fill the technology gap, adopting best\
    \ \npractices is crucial, and digital communication is required. Technology diffusion\
    \ \nheavily relies on agricultural extension, an area where the private sector\
    \ is \nbecoming more involved.  \n \n108 \n \n \nFor the Indian agricultural industry,\
    \ the successful development and wide-scale \napplication of precision agricultural\
    \ technologies are still a long way off. Such smart \nfarming concepts would enable\
    \ the Indian agro-industry to undergo a transformation \nthanks to the nation's\
    \ expanding IT sector and extensive Agri-IT research. Rapid \nsocioeconomic developments\
    \ including urbanization, energy consumption, and \neconomic expansion are opening\
    \ new possibilities for the use of precision farming \nin India. India should\
    \ employ technology depending on the demands of the nation's \nsocioeconomic situation\
    \ rather than blindly embracing the sophisticated precision \nagriculture technologies\
    \ used by Western nations. \n \nReferences \n \nAhmed, A. A., Al Omari, S., Awal,\

  limitations: The paper lacks a direct analysis of the specific data types most applicable
    to irrigation management, only briefly mentioning soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and rainfall. The paper also lacks any quantitative evaluation of the
    system's performance, which would provide valuable insights into its effectiveness
    and efficiency. Finally, the authors do not address the potential limitations
    or challenges associated with implementing the system in different agricultural

    • A suite of field sensors was used to remotely monitor vineyard environmental
    conditions, grapevine canopy temperature, soil moisture, and irrigation amount.
    • An Artificial intelligence (AI), neural network model was used to calculate
    a daily thermal Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) for grapevine using real-time sensor
    data inputs. • Edge computing on a field data logger was used to host, via a cellular
    modem, an irrigation decision support system (DSS) as webpages showing a running
    12-day history of daily CWSI, fraction of available soil water (fASW), irrigation-related
    information and sensor data. • Over a four-year period, vineyard managers maintained
    consistent seasonal irrigation amounts and CWSI levels. • The daily CWSI was correlated
    with fASW and midday leaf water potential. Abstract The goal of irrigation for
    wine grape grown in arid or semiarid regions is to sustain vine survival and to
    optimize berry attributes for quality wine production. Precision irrigation of
    wine grape is impeded by the lack of a smart, decision support system (DSS) to
    remotely monitor vine water status. The objectives of this study were to: develop
    and field test an Internet of Things (IoT) DSS system for precision irrigation
    of wine grape. The IoT system was comprised of a suite of in situ sensors used
    to monitor real-time weather conditions, grapevine canopy temperature, soil moisture,
    and irrigation amount. Sensor data were collected and stored on a field deployed
    data logger that calculated a daily thermal Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) for
    grapevine using a neural network model with real-time sensor data model inputs.
    The data logger also hosted, via a cellular modem, webpages showing a running,
    12-day history of daily CWSI, fraction of available soil moisture (fASW), irrigation
    amount, and other sensor data. The webpages were accessible to vineyard managers
    via cell phone or computer. The CWSI based IoT DDS system was installed at two
    small acreage, commercial estate vineyards in southwestern Idaho USA over four
    growing seasons. At each vineyard site, the DSS was used daily by the vineyard
    irrigation manager to schedule irrigation events. Neither vineyard manager used
    any other quantitative vine water status monitoring tool for irrigation management
    decisions. The midday leaf water potential (LWP) of grapevines was routinely measured
    by research project personnel. Data collected over the study period at each vineyard
    showed a significant (p < 0.001) correlation with LWP and fASW, providing evidence
    that, under the conditions of this study, the daily CWSI based IoT provided automated,
    remote monitoring of vine water status. Both vineyard managers reported daily
    use of the DSS for irrigation scheduling decisions. Over the four-year study,
    each vineyard manager was able to maintain consistent seasonal average CWSI daily
    values and irrigation application amounts, despite yearly differences in climatic
    conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that a CWSI based IoT DSS can
    be used for precision irrigation of wine grape in a commercial vineyard under
    semiarid growing conditions. The CWSI based IoT DSS used a unique combination
    of neural network modeling, edge computing, and IoT for real-time vine water stress
    monitoring for precision irrigation. Previous article in issue Next article in

    support systemInternet of Things 1. Introduction Irrigation management of most
    field crops aims to avoid plant water stress and maximize yield by supplying water
    to fully meet crop evapotranspiration (ETc). However, in wine grape (Vitis vinifera
    L.), fruit quality attributes are prioritized over yield as a production goal,
    and development of the berry and vine canopy are related to vine water status
    throughout the growing season [1,2]. For example, mild vine water stress between
    veraison (berry softening) and harvest is desirable to prevent berry splitting
    or dilution of flavors or sugars and to slow canopy growth in preparation for
    winter dormancy. Inducing vine water stress through deficit irrigation has also
    been shown to increase vine water use efficiency [3], [4], [5]. Water resources
    in the western U.S. are experiencing unprecedented competitive demand from irrigated
    agriculture, growing urban populations, and environmental and ecosystem restoration.
    Groundwater levels in many areas have steadily decreased from historic levels
    and ground water use is approaching an unsustainable level. In addition, the western
    US is experiencing the worst megadrought since 800 CE [6] leading to historically
    low water levels in many of the regions water reservoirs. Warmer winter temperatures
    due to climate change are predicted to reduce future mountain snowpack, which
    is the source of early irrigation developments in much of the western U.S. The
    growing demand on surface and groundwater resources combined with climate change
    necessitates increased water resource stewardship and crop water productivity
    to meet food and fiber needs of a growing population. Wine grape production in
    semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. is well established but relies
    on irrigation during the growing season for vine growth, survival, and economically
    viable yield. Optimum management of irrigation requires routine direct or indirect
    monitoring of vine water status [7]. Indirect methods for accessing plant water
    status include soil water content or soil water potential measurement and atmospheric-based
    methods [7,8]. Soil water monitoring is a widely accepted tool for estimating
    crop water needs for field crops but in the case of vineyards there are several
    disadvantages. These include spatial variability in soil characteristics and 3-dimensional
    soil wetting patterns from drip irrigation leading to the need to install several
    sensors, which complicates information management and increases cost. Additionally,
    there is a lack of established thresholds for determining vine water status and
    severity [7]. Atmospheric based methods include Bowen ratio energy balance and
    eddy covariance to determine ETc and infer plant water status by comparing measured
    ETc to estimated non-water stressed ETc. These techniques require expensive sensors,
    skilled technical knowledge, and large uniform upwind fetch, especially for eddy
    covariance, which make them unsuited for small commercial vineyard water management
    purposes [7]. A more detailed discussion of indirect methods is provided by Rienth
    and Scholasch [8]. Direct (plant-based) methods for determining plant water status
    rely on measurements of physical plant variables. Unlike indirect methods, plant-based
    methods use the plant as a biosensor in a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Conventional
    direct methods include leaf or stem water potential, visual observation, stomatal
    conductance or photosynthesis, sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor pressure
    [7,9]. Midday stem or leaf water potential (LWP) is the most commonly accepted
    direct measurement of vine water status [10] and critical upper and lower water
    stress thresholds have been established [7], making it an effective tool for deficit
    irrigation management. The primary disadvantages of LWP are the limited time of
    day for measurement, the need for repeated measurements due to plant variability,
    and a need for several equipped and trained personnel to cover a vineyard. Visual
    observation is based on the visual growth characteristics of the apical meristem
    or apex of vines, tendrils, and leaf orientation of numerous vines [1,8]. The
    drawbacks of this method include low sensitivity to moderate water stress, time
    lag between water stress and visual observation, and the cost of trained personnel
    to cover a vineyard. Stomatal conductance measures the ease of passage of CO2
    or water vapor through the stomata and is a good indicator of plant response to
    water stress because it changes with atmospheric demand and soil water status.
    It has been shown to indicate the degree of vine water stress but varies with
    timing of measurement and leaf canopy location [7]. The primary disadvantages
    are the cost of the equipment, constant need for calibration, technical skill
    to operate. Sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor are direct measures that
    have been shown to be indictors of plant water stress. However, they have not
    been widely adopted in regional commercial vineyards but have the advantage of
    being automated, which facilitates integration into a deficit irrigation management
    program. Detailed descriptions of other direct methods and their respective advantages
    and disadvantages are provided by [7], [8], [9]. Plant canopy temperature increases
    when solar radiation is absorbed and cools when water is evaporated (transpiration)
    within the leaf structure. A water-stressed plant canopy will reduce transpiration
    and have a higher temperature than a non-stressed canopy [11,12]. This physical
    plant response to water stress makes canopy temperature measurement a viable direct
    method for assessing plant water status. Infrared radiometers have been used to
    measure plant canopy temperature under research field conditions to estimate evapotranspiration
    and drought stress in many crops [13], [14], [15], including grape [16], [17],
    [18], [19], [20], [21]. Infrared thermometry is nondestructive, can be measured
    continuously, can be stationary or mounted on mobile platforms for spatial and
    temporal monitoring [9,[20], [21], [22]], and can be less expensive [23] than
    soil water sensing. Canopy temperature is related to plant water status, but it
    also depends upon solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), humidity (RH), and
    wind speed (WS) among other things. A method of using canopy temperature to calculate
    a CWSI for irrigation scheduling was proposed over 40 years ago by Idso et al.
    [15] and Jackson et al. [14]. The CWSI normalizes measured canopy temperature
    relative to reference threshold canopy temperatures for a well-watered vine (TLL)
    and a water stressed, non-transpiring vine (TUL) under identical weather conditions,
    resulting in an empirical CWSI value between, 0 (no water stress) and 1 (maximum
    water stress). Unfortunately, the need for TLL and TUL reference temperatures
    under identical weather conditions has limited the use of a CWSI to research scale
    studies and precluded its adoption on a commercial scale [9]. Alternatives to
    actual measurement of crop reference temperatures have been investigated, such
    as artificial wet and dry surfaces [16,[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]] and
    physical and empirical models [14,26,[30], [31], [32], [33]] to predict reference
    temperatures. The required maintenance of an artificial surface has limited use
    on a commercial scale, leaving physical or empirical models as the most logical
    choice. King et al. [33] used measured temperatures of non-water stressed wine
    grape canopies to develop data driven models (neural network, regression) to estimate
    TLL. The models were used to calculate CWSI values for research plots of Malbec
    grapes vines that were differentially irrigated to induce differing severities
    of vine water stress [19] and validated by comparing, over a 5-year period, CWSI
    values with LWP and fASW. The CWSI calculated using model predicted reference
    temperatures was well correlated with LWP (R2 = 0.54) and fASW (R2 = 0.71). When
    CWSI values were used to trigger 28 mm irrigation events, CWSI values increased,
    LWP became more negative, seasonal water application decreased, and grape cluster
    weight decreased. These results demonstrated that a CWSI could be used as an effective
    irrigation scheduling tool for wine grape. Irrigation scheduling based on canopy
    temperature has not been adopted on a commercial scale by vineyard irrigation
    mangers in semiarid regions of northwestern U.S. as evident by the lack of commercial
    systems supporting the application. The objectives of this study were to: develop
    a CWSI based IoT DSS for precision irrigation of wine grape under semiarid conditions;
    field test the CWSI based IoT DSS in two, small acreage commercial estate vineyards
    over four growing seasons; validate the IoT derived CWSI values by statistical
    correlation with LWP and fASW at each vineyard site; and evaluate vineyard manager
    annual consistency in irrigation scheduling. Vineyard irrigation managers were
    allowed to freely decide if they wanted to use the CWSI based IoS DSS for irrigation
    scheduling. Consistency of plant water stress and irrigation application across
    multiple years was used to gage success of the CWSI based IoT DDS system for irrigation
    scheduling as implemented by the vineyard manager. 2. Methods and materials 2.1.
    Field study site characteristics This study was conducted on two small (< 7 ha)
    family owned and operated commercial vineyards in southwestern Idaho USA over
    a four-year period (2017–2020). Both operations were estate vineyards in that
    they have associated wineries that produce branded commercial wines. The vineyard
    sites were located within 30 km of each other but differed in their soil characteristics
    and soil water holding capacities. The soil at vineyard-A (V-A) was a Greenleaf-Owyhee
    silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids) characterized
    as very deep well drained with moderately slow permeability and an available water
    capacity of 0.2 cm−1 (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vineyard-B (V-B) was located adjacent
    to an ancient volcanic vent that had been subjected to limited volcanic rock mining.
    The vineyard site was reclaimed using surrounding soil and original overburden
    to cover exposed rock resulting in a highly disturbed soil profile. The natural
    soils at the site were Turbyfill fine sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive,
    calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents) and Jacquith loamy fine sand (Sandy, mixed,
    mesic Xereptic Haplodurids), both of which are moderately deep and well drained
    in their natural state with moderately rapid permeability. Available water capacity
    of the Turbyfill fine sandy loam and Jacquith loamy fine sand were 0.12 and 0.07
    cm−1, respectively (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vines in both vineyards were grown
    with double trunks on a vertically shoot positioned, two-wire trellis system with
    moveable catch wires. The vines were trained to bilateral cordons and spur-pruned
    annually to approximately 16 buds m−1 of cordon. Row by vine spacing was 2.7 m
    x 1.8 m at V-A and 2.7 m x 1.5 m at V-B. Irrigation at both sites was applied
    using drip irrigation tubing suspended about 30 cm above ground in the vine row.
    Drip emitter spacing was 76 cm with a flow rate of 3.8 L hr−1 at V-A and 61 cm
    with a flow rate of 1.9 L hr−1 at V-B. The wine grape cultivar evaluated at V-A
    was Chardonnay (2017–2020) and the cultivars at V-B were Malbec (2017–2019) and
    Cabernet Sauvignon (2020). 2.2. Field measurements and instrumentation hardware
    and software Canopy temperature was measured using wired infrared radiometers
    (SI-121, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah) with a 36° field of view. The radiometers
    were placed along a single vine row to prevent potential damage to sensor cables
    from vineyard equipment. In each vineyard, two (2017, 2018, 2019) or four (2020)
    radiometers were installed per cultivar. Radiometer cable lengths were 30 m allowing
    a maximum distance of 60 m between radiometers within a vine row. The radiometers
    were installed on vines with representative canopy size and positioned approximately
    15 to 30 cm above fully expanded leaves located at the top of the vine canopy.
    Radiometers were pointed northeasterly at approximately 45° from nadir, with the
    sensor view aimed at the center of solar noon sunlit leaves. The temperature sensing
    area of vine canopy was approximately 10 to 20 cm in diameter and received full
    sunlight exposure during midday. The possibility of background bare soil visibility
    was limited by multiple leaf layers within the canopy below the measured canopy
    location. The infrared radiometer sensor view was periodically adjusted as necessary
    to ensure that the field of view concentrated on sunlit leaves near the top of
    the canopy. The infrared radiometers were installed after fruit set, usually mid
    to late June. Solar radiation (Rs) (SP-110 pyranometer, Apogee Instruments, Logan,
    UT), air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) (HMP50 temperature and humidity
    probe, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and wind speed (WS) (034B, Met One Instruments,
    Grants Pass, Ore.) were measured in each vineyard at a height of 2.5 m. Canopy
    temperature and weather parameters were measured every minute and recorded as
    15 min averages on a datalogger (CR6, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT). The weather
    sensors and data logger were installed in the same vine row and located midway
    between the infrared temperature sensors. The equipment was removed at harvest,
    usually mid to late September. A 1.2 m soil moisture sensor (Drill and Drop, SenTek
    Sensor Technologies, Stepney, SA) was installed in the vine row within 3 m of
    the data logger and within 20 cm of an irrigation drip line emitter. Soil moisture
    was recorded every 30 min measured at 10 cm depth increments to a depth of 1.2
    m. In 2017 and 2018, a tipping bucket rain gage (RainWise, Boothwyn, PA) was placed
    under an drip line irrigation emitter to record cumulative irrigation application
    amount. The rain gage was connected to the data logger and total emitter water
    application was recorded in 15 min and 24 hr increments. In 2019 and 2020 a flow
    meter (36MP.75RG.1, Netafim Irrigation, Inc., Fresno, CA) was installed in the
    irrigation drip line and connected to the data logger. Flow rate was recorded
    in 15 min increments. The field data logger was equipped with a machine-to-machine
    cellular modem (RavenXTA CDMA or RV50 Sierra wireless AirLink, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT) to provide real-time access to the sensor data using commercial
    software. Study personnel accessed sensor data using datalogger management software
    (LoggerNet 4.5, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT). Vineyard managers were provided
    real-time sensor data access through a website. The website was hosted on the
    field data logger. Data logger webpage publishing software (RTCM Pro Development
    4.3.3.6, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) was used to design and publish the
    webpage on the data logger. The website was accessible using either a personal
    computer or a smart phone. The website provided graphical pages with running 12-day
    histories of daily CWSI, soil water content at each depth increment, fASW, daily
    irrigation depth, and latest 15-min averaged weather data, each on a separate
    webpage. The website was available between the hours of 6:00 to 22:00 MDT. The
    cell phone modem was powered down overnight to conserve battery power and to reset
    the modem in case of intruder hacking and malware. The data logger battery was
    charged using a 20 W solar panel. Midday LWP was measured at 7-to-10-day intervals
    in both vineyards in each year of the study to verify vine water status and to
    investigate its correlation with daily CWSI. LWP was measured between 13:00 and
    15:00 MDT on two fully expanded, sunlit leaves from vines adjacent to each installed
    infrared radiometer using a pressure chamber (model 610, PMS Instrument Co., Albany,
    OR) as described by Levin et al. [10,34]. 2.3. Calculated webpage values Information
    shown on webpages hosted by the field data logger was based on several calculations
    performed by datalogger software using measured sensor values. The calculated
    values included daily CWSI, fASW, and daily irrigation depth. Daily CWSI was calculated
    as the average 15-min CWSI between 13:00 and 15:00 MST, which corresponded to
    −1 to +1.5 hr of solar noon. The 15-min CWSI was calculated using the empirical
    equation developed by Idso et al. [15] as: (1) where Tc is measured canopy temperature
    of fully sunlit leaves ( °C). The TLL reference temperature ( °C) was estimated
    using cultivar specific neural network models [32]. Inputs to the neural network
    models were 15-minute averaged values of measured Rs, Ta, RH and WS. The TUL reference
    temperature ( °C) was estimated using the energy balance-based equation of [14]
    as: (2) where ra is aerodynamic resistance (s m−1), Rn is net radiation (W m−2),
    cp is heat capacity of air (J kg-1 °C-1), and ρ is density of air (kg m−3). Aerodynamic
    resistance was estimated using the approach of [30] as described by [33] using
    the same cultivar specific data sets for well-watered wine grapes in southwestern
    Idaho. Values used for ra were 16.8 s m−1 for Malbec and 21 s m−1 for Chardonnay
    and Cabernet Sauvignon. Net radiation was estimated as Rn = 0.9Rs – 60 [33]. The
    fASW for a given soil profile depth was calculated as: (3) where θi is measured
    volumetric soil water content for depth i, θpwpi is estimated volumetric soil
    water content at permanent wilting point for depth i, θfci is estimated volumetric
    soil water content at field capacity at depth i, and n is the number of 10 cm
    soil water content measurement depths considered. Field capacity for each soil
    depth was estimated as the maximum soil water content measured 24 h after an irrigation
    event or soil water content at the beginning of the season for depths below the
    irrigation wetting front. Permanent wilting point (PWP) for each soil depth was
    estimated as 50% of field capacity (FC) or minimum soil water content measured.
    Values for θfci and θpwpi were continually adjusted during the beginning of the
    season as soil water content measurements were collected. Three values of fASW
    were presented in the webpage: 0 to 60 cm, 0 to 90 cm, and 0 to 120 cm. Values
    shown in the webpages were expressed in English units as they were designed for
    use by vineyard managers located in the U.S. Daily irrigation depth was calculated
    as the volume of water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT divided by the drip
    irrigation lateral length represented and vine row spacing. In the case of rain
    gauges, the volume of water measured by the rain gage was divided by the emitter
    spacing and vine row spacing. In the case of flow meters, the daily volume of
    water applied was calculated by summing the flow rate in each 15 min interval
    multiplied by the time interval. The volume of water was divided by lateral length
    downstream of the flow meter and vine row spacing. The calculated irrigation depth
    was presented in the English unit of inches. 2.4. Irrigation DSS vineyard manager
    accessible webpages The irrigation DSS was comprised of six separate webpages
    that displayed daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), soil moisture at depth of 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in) (Fig. 2), soil moisture at a depth of 70 to 120 cm (28 - 48 in) (Fig.
    3), fASW at three soil depths (Fig. 4), irrigation amount (Fig. 5), and weather
    (Fig. 6). The webpages showing CWSI, soil water content (%) and fASW displayed
    data as a running 12-day history. Each webpage had a top menu showing all available
    webpages. CWSI values were graphed independently for each infrared radiometer
    and as the average value of all radiometers. An example of the main webpage at
    site V-B for 13 August through 25 August 2020 is shown in Fig. 1. Soil volumetric
    water content (%) was graphed independently at depth increments of 10 cm (4 inches)
    (Figs. 2,3). fASW (Fig. 4) was graphed independently for soil depths 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in), 0 to 90 cm (1 – 36 in), and 0 - 120 cm (0 – 48 in). Daily irrigation
    amounts (Fig. 5) represent water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT. Fig. 1, Fig.
    2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show data for V-B from 13 August through 23 August 2020.
    Weather conditions in each vineyard (Fig. 6) were displayed as the most current
    15-min average value for Ta, RH, WS, and wind direction. For ease of use, the
    values for Ta and RH were displayed graphically as well as numerically. Download

    were used to quantify and evaluate relationships between variables. Regression
    line significance was evaluated using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Neural network model development
    was performed using the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, Mass.)

    relative to 20-yr (1996–2016) averages are summarized in Table 1. The climatic
    conditions during the four study years were generally within one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean with a few exceptions. Alfalfa-based reference evapotranspiration
    was greatest in 2018 and exceeded the 20-yr mean by more than one standard deviation.
    The combination of high mean air temperature and daily solar radiation, and low
    mean relative humidity and April through September precipitation resulted in the
    high reference evapotranspiration in 2018. October through March precipitation
    was greatest in 2017 and exceeded one standard deviation of the 20-yr mean. April
    through September precipitation in 2019 and 2020 exceeded one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean. Growing-degree days was greatest in 2018, coinciding with highest
    mean daily air temperature and high reference evapotranspiration. Table 1. Climatic

    water stress Linear relationships between plant water stress measures fASW, LWP,
    and CWSI at each vineyard for the four study years combined are summarized in
    Fig. 7. All the linear relationships between the water stress measures were statistically
    significant (p < 0.001). The linear relationships between fASW versus LWP and
    daily CWSI versus LWP had similar R2 values for both vineyards. The linear relationship
    between fASW and CWSI at V-B had a much greater R2 than for V-A (0.58vs 0.32).
    Variability in the fASW vs CWSI data was similar between the vineyards, but daily
    CWSI spanned a greater range at V-B resulting in a greater R2. The greatest data
    variability occurred between daily CWSI and LWP for both vineyards. The greater
    variability is likely due to CWSI and LWP responding differently to Ta, RS, RH
    and WS. Download : Download high-res image (968KB) Download : Download full-size

    Relationship between seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts The seasonal
    average values for daily CWSI and the cumulative amount of irrigation applied
    between 1 July and 15 September in each study year at each vineyard are shown
    in Table 2. The seasonal average daily CWSI values for each vineyard were largely
    consistent over the four-year study. Seasonal daily CWSI values were higher for
    V-B as the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager
    of V-A. The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly
    increase a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding
    capacity of the sandy soil. Table 2. Average daily crop water stress index (CWSI)

    DSS vineyard manager accessible webpages An example of the irrigation DSS running
    12-day history and weather webpage is presented for V-B for 13 to 23 August 2020
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). An irrigation event, starting
    the evening of 18 August 2020, increased soil water content to a depth of 60 cm
    (24 inches) (Fig. 2) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1). An irrigation
    event starting on the evening of 23 August increased soil water content to a depth
    70 cm (28 inches) (Fig. 3) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1).
    The estimated fASW increased on 18 August and 23 August (Fig. 4) as soil water
    contents increased (Fig 2) due to irrigation events. Prior to irrigation on 18
    Aug, daily CWSI was greater than 0.6 (Fig. 1), while fASW for the 0 to 120 cm
    soil profile was about 0.3 and increased to greater than 0.8 following irrigation
    on 23 Aug. Midday on 25 August daily CWSI was near zero while fASW was about 0.78.
    An overnight irrigation event started on 18 August is depicted as two irrigations
    since it spanned two days (Fig. 5). The first irrigation event applied about 10
    mm (0.4 inch) and the second irrigation event applied about 21 mm (0.8 inch),
    which collectively decreased daily CWSI from 0.6 to near zero (Fig. 1) and increased
    fASW from 0.3 to 0.8 (Fig. 4). The observed variability among radiometers on the
    irrigation DSS webpage for daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), was likely attributed to
    high spatial variability in soil profile characteristics. Limiting historical
    data on the irrigation DSS webpage to a running 12-day period was to optimize
    time efficiency of the user web browsing experience. The infield data logger that
    hosted the irrigation DSS webpages had limited computing capacity, so limiting
    the historical data time frame to a running 12-days offered a reasonable compromise
    between data viewability on a cell phone and time to transfer the data to the
    user webpage interface device. A running 12-day historical record was sufficient
    to establish trends in CWSI or soil water availability useful in making irrigation
    management decisions. The vineyard managers in this study only wanted to know
    if they need to irrigation today and were largely uninterested in historical CWSI
    values. The 12-day historical length can be increased if deemed necessary by uploading
    the data to the cloud and using cloud based graphical software to display the
    same information for the full growing season. 4.2. Relationship between measures
    of vine water status and irrigation A seasonal graph of the irrigation DSS data
    for V-B in 2020 shows an interconnected response among the measured and estimated
    DSS parameters (Fig. 8). Values for daily CWSI and midday leaf water potential
    shown in Fig. 8 are averages of the measured values and fASW is for the 0 to 120
    soil profile. Prior to initiation of measurements on 13 June, there was above
    average precipitation in 2020 (Table 1). The prior precipitation is evident by
    the status of well-watered vines on 13 June (Fig. 8). Daily CWSI was low, fASW
    was > 0.55 and LWP was less negative. A rainfall event on 29 June was associated
    with a decrease in the daily CWSI, an increase in fASW and a less negative LWP.
    Prior to the irrigation event on 20 July, the daily CWSI steadily increased coincident
    with a more negative LWP. The small irrigation event on 8 July had minimal influence
    on daily CWSI or LWP potential as fASW remained below 0.55. Irrigation events
    prior to 17 August reduced CWSI and made LWP less negative for only a few days
    and fASW remained 〈 0.55 for most of the duration. The seasonally highest CWSI
    values and most negative LWP values occurred between 28 July and 24 August. The
    irrigation event on 23 August and precipitation events on 17 and 24 August decreased
    CWSI to near zero, increased fASW to 〉 0.55 and LWP became less negative, all
    of which indicated a short period of increase in vine water status. Between 24
    August and the next irrigation event on 1 September, the CWSI increased, fASW
    decreased, and LWP became more negative. The relatively large (> 25 mm) irrigation
    event on 3 September decreased daily CWSI to 〈 0.2, increased fASW to 〉 0.8, and
    LWP became less negative. The last irrigation on 11 September reduced daily CWSI
    to near zero, increased fASW to nearly 0.9 and increased LWP to > −0.9 MPa. Download

    Average daily CWSI, fraction of available soil water (fASW) in 0 to 120 cm soil
    profile, midday leaf water potential (LWP), precipitation, and irrigation during
    the 2020 growing season at V-B. The fASW is a common method used to express crop
    water stress for field crops. Wine grape is well-watered when fASW is greater
    than 0.55 [35]. The corresponding seasonal responses of fASW, midday LWP, and
    the daily CWSI to irrigation and precipitation events (Fig. 8) supports the usefulness
    and accuracy of daily CWSI for real-time irrigation management of wine grape irrespective
    of soil characteristics that may influence these values. 4.3. Comparison of vine
    water stress measures between vineyards The slopes of linear relationships between
    the fASW versus LWP or daily CWSI differed between vineyards (Fig. 7). This may
    be partially due to differences in soil textures and permeability between the
    vineyards. V-A had a silt loam soil with low to moderate permeability while V-B
    had a sandy soil with high permeability. Water applied by the drip irrigation
    emitter likely resulted in different wetting patterns between vineyards with a
    deeper wetting pattern and less lateral spreading at V-B. There was likely limited
    soil water availability outside the immediate area of the emitter wetting pattern
    at V-B due to the low water holding capacity of the sandy soil. The soil water
    sensor was installed within 20 cm of an emitter and may have provided a better
    measurement of total soil water at V-B than V-A. The greater water holding capacity
    of the silt loam soil at V-A likely resulted in much more stored soil water from
    non-growing season precipitation, limiting the range in fASW over the growing
    season. However, the range in LWP were similar between vineyards. The low permeability
    of the soil at V-A may have restricted movement of soil water to the roots. Lastly
    the soil at V-A exhibited silica cementation ranging from 45 to 60 cm deep during
    soil sensor installation that may have restricted root growth. Ample soil water
    was measured below 60 cm in the root zone (data not shown) but very little extraction
    occurred during the growing season supporting the suspicion of limited root presence
    below 60 cm. The presence of ample soil water below 60 cm limited the range in
    fASW over the growing season and if it was largely unavailable to the vines would
    result in high daily CWSI and low LWP values despite fASW > 0.55. Despite a significant
    linear relationship between daily CWSI and midday LWP for both vineyards (Fig.
    7), there is considerable variability in the relationships, which precludes use
    of CWSI as a direct surrogate for LWP. A quadratic relationship between CWSI and
    LWP averaged over four wine grape cultivars was reported by [21], which depicted
    a similar degree of variability. [36] reported LWP ranging from −0.51 to −1.15
    MPa for well-watered grapevines in California with LWP linearly related to vapor
    pressure deficit (VPD) and Ta. They also reported a linear relationship between
    LWP and VPD for water stressed vines, but with reduced dependence on VPD compared
    to well-watered vines. The results of this study are consistent with the findings
    of [36] as the relationship between CWSI and LWP (Fig. 7) could be represented
    by a piece-wise linear relationship with CWSI ≈ 0 for LWP > −1.15 MPa. Solar radiation
    also influences LWP and LWP measurements should be collected on cloudless days
    [36]. The LWP values reported in this study were made over a wide range of VPD
    and on days with variable clouds. Additionally, some LWP values reported in this
    study were not collected on the same vine used for canopy temperature measurement,
    another source of variability in the relationship between CWSI and LWP. Overall,
    the presence of water stress detected by LWP measurement was also indicted by
    daily CWSI as calculated in this study, demonstrating that CWSI can be effectively
    used as an irrigation management tool for wine grape. The vineyard managers in
    this study were successful in using daily CWSI to achieve similar levels of plant
    water stress over multiple years, despite yearly differences in evaporative demand
    and growing season precipitation. The primary advantage of using CWSI as an irrigation
    management tool is the ability to automate data collection for daily monitoring
    of water stress with minimal labor. The linear relationship between fASW and daily
    CWSI exhibited less variability than the linear relationship between fASW and
    midday LWP (Fig. 7), especially for V-B. Thus, CWSI was a more direct indicator
    of available soil water than LWP. For V-B, when fASW was > 0.55, indicating well-watered
    vines, CWSI was 〈 0.1 supporting the rational than CWSI should approach zero for
    well-watered vines and approach one for severely watered stressed vines as the
    linear relationship depicts. However, for V-A a fASW value of 0.55 corresponds
    to a CWSI value 〉 0.5, which clearly does not follow the rational of CWSI, indicating
    an error in estimating fASW. As forementioned, this discrepancy is likely due
    to the effective root zone of the vines less than the 120 cm depth used to compute
    fASW. The estimates of FC and PWP of the soil at V-A could also be in error, which
    could lead to overestimation of fASW. If estimates of the fASW at V-A were reduced
    by 25%, a fASW value of 0.55 would correspond to a CWSI value < 0.1, like V-B
    and a CWSI value of 0.6 would correspond to a fASW of 0.37. The unrealistic over
    estimation of fAWC at V-A based on measured midday LWP and calculated daily CWSI
    highlights the difficulty in accurately quantifying the fASW using a single soil
    moisture profile measurement with drip irrigated crops. Drip irrigation results
    in a 3-dimensional wetting pattern that makes reliable estimation of root zone
    available soil water difficult at best. As an example, [37] reported that nine
    neutron probe measurements in one quadrant of a vine root zone, to a depth of
    3 m, was necessary to quantify soil water content of drip-irrigated grape vines.
    The difficulty in quantifying fASW in drip irrigated vineyards highlights the
    advantage of using plant-based methods for assessing vine water status such as
    CWSI provided the reference temperatures TLL and TUL can be reliably estimated.
    4.4. Seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts between vineyard managers Neither
    vineyard manager in this study used any type of quantitative plant or soil water
    monitoring techniques to aid in irrigation management decisions prior to the installation
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. Prior to this study, the irrigation managers
    at both vineyards made irrigation decisions based upon intuition, previous experience,
    and crop appearance [1]; so, there was a reasonable expectation that the vineyard
    managers would actively use the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. At the beginning
    of the first study year, the vineyard managers were briefed on the concept of
    CWSI for monitoring plant water status and were given the guideline that a daily
    CWSI value of 0.3 corresponded to approximately a 70% ET rate relative to a well-watered,
    100% ET. Beyond that initial guidance on how to interpret the daily CWSI value,
    the vineyard managers independently accessed the irrigation DSS webpages and made
    irrigation management decisions without input from research project personnel.
    At the end of the first study year both vineyard managers reported that they routinely
    accessed the irrigation DSS webpages for daily CWSI and fASW and used the information
    to support irrigation management decisions. In each of the remaining three years
    of the study, both vineyard managers, at their discretion, continued to access
    the irrigation DSS webpages and use the daily CWSI to facilitate irrigation management
    decisions. Seasonal average daily CWSI values (Table 2) were higher for V-B as
    the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager of V-A.
    The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly increase
    a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding capacity
    of the sandy soil. Cumulative irrigation water application was surprisingly similar
    across vineyards, particularly for years 2018 through 2020, despite differences
    in soil water holding capacity and vineyard managers. Cumulative irrigation was
    low in the first year of the study at V-A due to above average non-growing season
    precipitation and higher water holding capacity of the silt loam soil. The narrow
    range in seasonal average daily CWSI (0.23 to 0.31 for V-A, and 0.36 to 0.44 for
    V-B) and cumulative irrigation (1.14 to 134 mm) in 2018 through 2020 suggests
    that vineyard managers effectively used the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS to develop
    and maintain a consistent deficit irrigation management program. 4.5. Irrigation
    decision support system limitations The data-driven models used in this study
    provided reliable estimates of TLL and TUL in real-time for the semiarid climatic
    conditions of the study site, which was representative of the irrigated wine producing
    locations in the pacific northwestern U.S. The climatic conditions under which
    these data-driven models were developed were representative of the conditions
    in this study. However, the models may not perform as well in other regions with
    weather conditions outside the database range for model development. For example,
    in areas where daily windspeeds exceed 5 m sec−1. Wind speeds higher than 5 m
    sec−1 were not included in the database used for model development and grapevines
    are known to reduce stomatal conductance under high winds [38,39]. A wind induced
    reduction in stomatal conductance would result in an increase in canopy temperature
    independent of plant water stress and, since the data-driven model estimate of
    TLL would be too low, the calculated CWSI value would be elevated. Canopy temperature
    data for well-watered vines under high wind conditions would need to be included
    in the data set used to calibrate the neural network model for estimating TLL
    in windy semiarid regions. There are climatic conditions that can result in a
    calculated CWSI value of less than zero or greater than one. Wet canopy conditions
    typically result in measured canopy temperature that is less than the TLL predicted
    by the data driven model. This results in a negative CWSI value regardless of
    soil water availability. The original development of the CWSI concept by [15]
    was limited to clear sunny conditions. However, the data driven model for predicting
    TLL that was used in this study uses a database of well-watered vine canopy temperatures
    that were measured under variable cloudy conditions. The data driven model can
    therefore predict TLL for variably cloudy conditions. While the data-driven model
    used for predicting TLL is valid for solar radiation < 100 W m−2, TUL predicted
    using Eq. (2) for low levels of solar radiation can be approximately equal to
    TLL resulting in CWSI values less than zero or greater than 1. In this study,
    solar radiation less than 200 W m−2 often resulted in CWSI values less than zero.
    [40] also found solar radiation greater than 200 W m−2 was necessary to reliably
    use canopy temperature measurement for irrigation scheduling. In this study, daily
    CWSI was limited to a maximum of one and a minimum of zero in software to avert
    illogical values. The effect of wet canopy and low solar radiation on calculation
    of daily CWSI is evident in Fig. 8 on 18 and 24 August when a value of zero was
    assigned to daily CWSI during rainfall events. Limiting daily CWSI value to zero
    due to low solar radiation or wet canopy has little practical impact on use of
    CWSI for irrigation management as vine water stress is low under these circumstances
    due to low evaporative demand. When calculated CWSI is greater than one due to
    low solar radiation, limiting the value of one is more problematic as this results
    in a very erroneous representation of vine water stress that could lead to an
    unnecessary irrigation event. The climatic conditions leading to errors in calculating
    CWSI (rainfall, low solar radiation) are limited to 1-to-3-days in duration in
    the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not prevent application
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region. Software used to compute
    CWSI can be modified to detect these events and indicate to the user that the
    daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value for the day preceding the rainfall
    or low solar radiation event can be used to guide irrigation decisions as plant
    water stress will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally as ET will be small
    under low solar radiation conditions. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system
    developed and implemented in this study focused on two small acreage, commercial
    estate vineyards in semiarid southwestern Idaho USA. The climatic conditions at
    the study sites were representative of vineyards in the semiarid irrigated regions
    of the Pacific Northwest U.S. Small acreage vineyards can be found throughout
    the region and most do not have staff with irrigation science training, nor can
    they afford to hire trained vineyard irrigation management professionals or services.
    They need affordable irrigation scheduling tools that are easy to maintain and
    indicate when to irrigate to maintain a desired level of vine water stress. The
    vineyard managers at the study sites were pleased the system reliably and timely
    indication of vine water stress without having to spend time collecting soil water
    content measurements needed to estimate fASW or measure leaf water potential.
    While this study focused on small commercial estate vineyards, the IoT irrigation
    DSS concept is applicable to larger commercial vineyards where it could be used
    to provide plant water stress information needed to ground truth remote sensing
    based estimates of the ratio of actual-to-reference ET such as those provided
    by GRAPEX [41] or OPENET (https://openetdata.org). These remote sensing-based
    estimates have a minimum spatial resolution of 30 m, which is larger than the
    minimum dimension of irrigation management blocks in many commercial estate vineyards,
    hence they are not necessarily applicable to small commercial estate vineyards
    in the region. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study
    used expensive scientific grade equipment, which proved invaluable to investigate
    the validity and adoptability of the system for irrigation management in wine
    grapes. The infrared temperature sensors cost $700 each, the multifunctional precision
    data logger was $2000, and the cellular modem with accessories was $700 totaling
    over $6100 excluding web page publishing software and climatic sensors. The soil
    moisture sensor cost is not included as it is unnecessary for calculation of the
    CWSI. The cost of the equipment used in this study is prohibitive for small vineyards
    to monitor just a single location. Vineyard manager acceptance and adoption of
    the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study justifies continued
    development and enhancement of the system. Future work will focus on incorporating
    less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power, low-cost radio
    communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station. The base
    station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and used to
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. These system enhancements would increase size of the vineyard
    area represented by daily CWSI measurements, encompassing multiple cultivars and
    irrigation blocks or irrigation management zones in larger vineyards. 5. Conclusions
    A CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS was developed, and field tested at two small acreage
    commercial wine grape estate vineyards in southwestern Idaho. Irrigation DSS webpages,
    accessible to vineyard managers via cell phone or computer, provided a running
    12-day history of CWSI daily values, soil moisture and current weather conditions.
    Data-driven models were used to estimate reference temperatures needed to calculate
    the CWSI using real-time environmental inputs for Rs, Ta, RH, and WS. Edge computing
    on a solar powered, field-deployed data logger was used to calculate the CWSI
    and fASW, and the data logger was used to host webpages of the irrigation DSS.
    The data logger was connected to a cellular modem located in the vineyard. The
    vineyard managers routinely used the irrigation DSS webpage for the CWSI and soil
    moisture to make irrigation management decisions. The average daily CWSI and irrigation
    amounts between 1 July and 15 September were similar between years over the four-year
    study for each study vineyard suggesting that the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS
    was effective in assisting irrigation management decisions. Linear relationships
    between daily CWSI, midday LWP, and fraction of available soil water were significant
    (p < 0.001) at both study sites. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.58)
    for the linear relationship between daily CWSI and fraction of available soil
    water for V-B was better than that for midday LWP (R2 = 0.38) indicating daily
    CWSI was the most reliable indicator (less variable) of vine water status. The
    data-driven models used to estimate TLL and TUL can result in CWSI values outside
    the theoretical range of 0 to 1 when the canopy is wet from precipitation or solar
    radiation is <200 W m−2. These climatic conditions are limited to 1-to-3-days
    in duration in the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not
    prevent application of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region.
    These climatic instances can be detected by IoT irrigation DSS system software
    and indicate to the user that the daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value
    for the day preceding the rainfall or low solar radiation event can be used to
    indicate plant water stress since it will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally
    as ET will be small under low solar radiation conditions. The hardware and software
    used to implement the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS in this study was very reliable
    but too expensive for practical commercial application. Future work will focus
    on incorporating less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power,
    low-cost radio communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station.
    The base station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature

  analysis: The paper focuses on the establishment and design of the Heihe Watershed
    Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) program, a comprehensive eco-hydrological
    experiment in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) of northwest China. It is crafted to
    improve the observability of hydrological and ecological processes and construct
    a world-class watershed observing system in the HRB to investigate complex issues
    such as heterogeneity, scaling, uncertainty, and closing the water cycle at the
    watershed scale. The paper highlights the challenges in achieving these objectives
    and outlines detailed plans for implementing HiWATER, including the establishment
    of observing systems, thematic experiments, and data management protocols. Despite
    not directly addressing the types of data most applicable to irrigation management
    and their typical sources, the paper provides a comprehensive foundation for future
    research and innovation in this area by establishing a robust and integrated eco-hydrological
    observing system in the HRB.

    Abstract/Excerpt Full Text PDF A major research plan entitled “Integrated research
    on the ecohydrological process of the Heihe River Basin” was launched by the National
    Natural Science Foundation of China in 2010. One of the key aims of this research
    plan is to establish a research platform that integrates observation, data management,
    and model simulation to foster twenty-first-century watershed science in China.
    Based on the diverse needs of interdisciplinary studies within this research plan,
    a program called the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER)
    was implemented. The overall objective of HiWATER is to improve the observability
    of hydrological and ecological processes, to build a world-class watershed observing
    system, and to enhance the applicability of remote sensing in integrated ecohydrological
    studies and water resource management at the basin scale. This paper introduces
    the background, scientific objectives, and experimental design of HiWATER. The
    instrumental setting and airborne mission plans are also outlined. The highlights
    are the use of a flux observing matrix and an eco-hydrological wireless sensor
    network to capture multiscale heterogeneities and to address complex problems,
    such as heterogeneity, scaling, uncertainty, and closing water cycle at the watershed
    scale. HiWATER was formally initialized in May 2012 and will last four years until
    2015. Data will be made available to the scientific community via the Environmental
    and Ecological Science Data Center for West China. International scientists are
    welcome to participate in the field campaign and use the data in their analyses.
    CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Dr. Xin Li, 320 West Donggang Road, Cold and Arid Regions
    Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
    Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China, E-mail: lixin@lzb.ac.cn An eco-hydrological
    experiment designed from an interdisciplinary perspective addresses problems including
    heterogeneity, scaling, uncertainty, and closing water cycle at the watershed
    scale. A major research plan entitled “Integrated research on the eco-hydrological
    process of the Heihe River Basin” (hereafter referred to as the Heihe Plan) was
    launched by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) in 2010. The
    scientific objectives of the Heihe Plan is to reveal the processes and mechanisms
    of the eco-hydrological system in an inland river basin at different scales (e.g.,
    leaf, individual plant, community, landscape, and watershed scales); to improve
    the research capabilities and predictability of the evolution of hydrological,
    ecological, and economic systems; to determine the responses of eco-hydrological
    processes to climate change and human activities; and to provide fundamental theory
    and technical support for water security, ecological security, and sustainable
    development in inland river basins. Eventually, the implementation of the Heihe
    Plan will establish a research platform that integrates the observation, data
    management, and model simulation of both physical and socioeconomic processes
    to foster twenty-first-century watershed science in China. The Heihe River basin
    (HRB) in the arid region of northwest China has been selected as an experimental
    watershed to carry out this research plan. This area was selected because, first,
    the HRB is a typical inland river basin (endorheic basin). Inland river basins
    occupy approximately 11.4% of world''s land area. Most of them are distributed
    over arid regions, where water-stressed ecosystems are massively distributed (Rodriguez-Iturbe
    and Porporato 2004), eco-hydrological processes are more complicated, and the
    environment is more fragile to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance and
    therefore the water conflict between ecosystem''s demand and economic development
    is more severe. All of the above extremes are found in the HRB (Cheng, 1996; Wang
    and Cheng 1999; Li et al. 2001). Second, the HRB has long served as a test bed
    for integrated watershed studies as well as land surface or hydrological experiments
    (Cheng 2009). Comprehensive experiments such as the Heihe Basin Field Experiment
    (HEIFE; Hu et al. 1994) and Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (WATER;
    Li et al. 2009) have taken place in the HRB. A prototype watershed observing system
    has been developed (Li et al. 2010b). The above-mentioned reasons have made the
    HRB an ideal field laboratory to further pursue integrated eco-hydrological studies
    and integrated river basin management that can benefit both the natural ecosystem
    and society. Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER)
    was initialized based on the reasons provided in the background above. It is designed
    to be a comprehensive eco-hydrological experiment in the framework of the Heihe
    Plan, based on the diverse needs of the interdisciplinary studies of the research
    plan and the existing observing infrastructures in the basin. The overall objective
    of HiWATER is to improve the observability of hydrological and ecological processes,
    to build a world-class watershed observing system, and to enhance the applicability
    of remote sensing in integrated eco-hydrological studies and water recourse management
    at the basin scale. However, determining how these goals are to be met is a challenging
    task. The first challenge is how to take advantage of new trends in hydrological
    and ecological experiments as well as new Earth observing techniques. In Earth
    science, there is a tradition of using comprehensive experiments as a tool to
    improve the understanding of processes, and to test scientific hypotheses and
    new measurement techniques. However, most land surface or hydrological experiments
    conducted to date put their emphases on large-scale processes to serve the parameterization
    of subgrid processes for general circulation or land surface models (André et
    al. 1986; Sellers et al. 1988). River basin hydroclimatic studies have also focused
    on the continent scale (Stewart et al. 1998; Raschke et al. 2001; Lawford et al.
    2004). Only in recent years has the trend shifted toward using the watershed as
    a basic observing entity. Some research plans, such as the Consortium of Universities
    for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI; CUAHSI 2007), Critical Zone
    Observatories (Anderson et al. 2008), Water and Environmental Research Systems
    Network (NRC 2010), and Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO; Bogena
    et al. 2006) have selected representative river basins in different climate zones
    to carry out comprehensive experiments or build multiscale observatories. Indeed,
    measurement techniques are rapidly advancing. Remote sensing is reshaping hydrological
    observations. Many traditionally unobservable variables, such as groundwater and
    river flow, can now be retrieved by remote sensing (NRC 2008a). On the ground,
    new technologies, such as the eddy covariance system (EC), large aperture scintillometer
    (LAS), cosmicray neutron probe, and wireless sensor network are being applied
    (NRC 2008b). However, how to effectively use these technical advances in modeling
    and understanding eco-hydrological processes remains elusive. Understanding how
    to take advantage of the aforementioned research trends is therefore a serious
    challenge in HiWATER. The second challenge is how to capture the strong land surface
    heterogeneities and associated uncertainties within a watershed. Observing and
    modeling at the watershed scale is more challenging than at the point scale because
    of inherent multiscale heterogeneity (Sivapalan et al. 2003). New generation observing
    techniques (e.g., those introduced in the paragraph above) are reliable in their
    direct measurements. However, in terms of spatial representativeness, which requires
    appropriate scaling, both remote sensing and in situ observations feature much
    greater uncertainties. In terms of the reliability of retrieval and estimation
    models, which transform direct measurements into the necessary hydrological and
    ecological variables or parameters, these observations also feature much greater
    uncertainties. This means, while the original measurements do capture the heterogeneities,
    translating these measurements into useful information in understanding eco-hydrological
    processes requires appropriate scaling schemes and carefully developed models
    that can provide reliable retrievals. In turn, optimal observation network designs
    and sampling strategies as well as suitable approaches to quantify the uncertainties
    associated with scaling and estimation/retrieval models are needed. The third
    challenge is more specific: how to close the water cycle in a river basin. Water
    should be closed on the various scales of drainage basins, from tens of square
    kilometers to hundreds to tens of thousands of square kilometers for entire river
    basins. This problem, though not difficult in principle, still involves great
    uncertainties in the measurement and estimation methods used to study many water
    cycle components. Evapotranspiration might be the most uncertain component. Its
    measurement using the EC technique is challenged by the energy balance closure
    problem (Foken 2008); its remote sensing estimation is far from reaching a mature
    stage (NRC 2008a). Precipitation, in both cold and arid regions, features great
    spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Reliable areal estimations of total precipitation
    and the associated spatiotemporal variation require careful calibrations for different
    types of precipitation and a specially designed ground observation network (Yang
    et al. 2009). Soil moisture, when measured by remote sensing, is currently only
    available at a very coarse resolution that is not particularly useful for watershed-scale
    applications. Snow water equivalent in mountainous areas still cannot be accurately
    measured from space (NRC 2008a). Therefore, although HiWATER will measure both
    hydrological and ecological processes, closing water cycle is a top priority.
    Addressing the above-mentioned challenges with innovative ideas will make HiWATER
    different from previous hydroclimatic experiments and its predecessor WATER. In
    short, HiWATER is a watershed-scale eco-hydrological experiment designed from
    an interdisciplinary perspective to address complex problems, such as heterogeneity,
    scaling, uncertainty, and closing the water cycle at the watershed scale. SCIENTIFIC
    OBJECTIVES. The overall objective of HiWATER is to improve the observability of
    hydrological and ecological processes, to build a world-class watershed observing
    system, and to enhance the applicability of remote sensing in integrated eco-hydrological
    studies and water recourse management at the basin scale. This is being achieved
    through the following specific objectives: 1 To develop a watershed observing
    system that serves watershed science and integrated water resource management;
    2 To precisely measure each component of water cycle using multiscale observations
    in order to close water cycle at the river basin scale; 3 To obtain multiscale
    data critical to understanding ecosystem dynamics and its relationship with water
    resource availability in the inland river basin; 4 To produce a series of high-quality
    remote sensing products that can support basin-scale integrated eco-hydrological
    studies; 5 To validate remote sensing models, algorithms and products through
    purposeful validation experiments; and 6 To integrate observation data and remote
    sensing products into a distributed hydrology model, coupled surface water-groundwater-crop
    growth model and water consumption model upstream, middle stream and downstream
    of the HRB, respectively. It is expected that through these empirical case studies
    the applicability of remote sensing in eco-hydrological studies and water recourse
    management can be enhanced. There are six scientific questions that will be explored
    in HiWATER. Most of the questions are proposed from a methodological point of
    view. 1 How well can remote sensing data be used to improve our understanding
    of the eco-hydrological processes in a river basin? How can we develop more reliable
    and robust eco-hydrological remote sensing methods through field experiments?
    2 Which types of remote sensing products are urgently needed in eco-hydrological
    studies? How can remote sensing products be tailored toward water cycle and ecological
    processes at the watershed scale with better quality and finer resolution? 3 How
    well can we capture the spatio-temporal variations of each observation item at
    the basin scale? How well can we design an in situ observation network? What is
    the optimum density and scale of each individual observation sensor? 4 How can
    we design in situ sampling strategies aimed at remote sensing validation? How
    can we acquire ground truths at the pixel scale over heterogeneous land surfaces
    that can be used as a reference truth for remote sensing validation? 5 How can
    we effectively use remote sensing observations and products in integrated eco-hydrology
    studies? 6 How can we integrate remote sensing observations, in situ measurements,
    and model simulations to accurately estimate the state variables and fluxes in
    water cycle and ecological processes, and to improve the accuracies of hydrological
    and ecological simulations and predictions at the basin scale? EXPERIMENTAL AREA.
    The experiment will be performed in the Heihe River basin (Fig. 1), which is located
    within 37.7°–42.7°N, 97.1°–102.0°E, covering an area of approximately 1,432,000
    km2.1 This basin is characterized by its distinct cold and arid landscapes: glaciers,
    frozen soil, alpine meadow, forest, irrigated crops, riparian ecosystem, and desert,
    which are distributed upstream to downstream. In the whole river basin, three
    key experimental areas (KEAs) were selected to conduct intensive and long-term
    observations. These KEAs are the cold region experimental area in the mountain
    cryosphere of the upper reaches, the artificial oasis experimental area in the
    middle reaches, and the natural oasis experimental area downstream. Within each
    KEA, the foci experimental area (FEA), the experiment site (ES), and the elementary
    sampling plot (ESP) were designed as hierarchically nested locations of multiscale
    ground observations. View Full Size Fig. 1. Experimental areas in HiWATER. Citation:

    Download Figure Download figure as PowerPoint slide 1 The cold region experimental
    area consists of the upstream regions of the main stream of the Heihe River (102,009
    km2). Observation experiments are performed at three scales: the main stream basin,
    sub-basin (Babao River basin), and watershed (Hulugou catchment). The Babao River
    basin is a sub-basin in the upper reaches of the HRB with an area of approximately
    2452 km2 and an elevation ranging from 2640 to 5000 m. The Hulugou catchment is
    a typical alpine catchment with an area of 23.1 km2. These two FEAs have almost
    all of the typical landscapes of cold regions, including alpine grassland, swamp,
    alpine meadow, valley bush, Picea crassifolia, and Qilian juniper, among others.
    Permafrost, seasonal frozen soil, alpine cold desert, snow, and glaciers exist
    in the area. 2 The artificial oasis experimental area is located in an artificial
    oasis–riparian ecosystem–wetland–desert compound in the middle reaches of the
    HRB. Some typical irrigation districts (e.g., Yingke and Daman as well as Pingchuan)
    are selected as the FEAs. The precipitation in this area is approximately 100–250
    mm per year, but potential evaporation is as high as 1200–1800 mm per year. The
    major crops are maize, wheat, and vegetables. 3 The natural oasis experimental
    area is located in the Ejin Banner oasis, which is downstream of the HRB. The
    landscapes are composed of sandy and gravel deserts, a natural oasis dominated
    by Populus euphratica, Tamarix, and other arid region species, as well as terminal
    lakes. Regions of the river bank from Erdaoqiao to Qidaoqiao are selected as the
    core FEA. This area is an extremely arid region, with precipitation of less than
    50 mm per year and potential evaporation of approximately 3755 mm per year. OBSERVING
    VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS. Three categories of variables/parameters are to be observed.
    These include the state variables and fluxes of key eco-hydrological processes,
    atmospheric forcing data, and parameters (e.g., vegetation, soil, terrain, hydrology,
    and aerodynamic parameters). These variables and parameters were selected with
    reference to some typical distributed hydrological models, groundwater models,
    crop growth models, dynamic vegetation models, and land surface models; most of
    these models have been employed in hydrological and ecological studies in the
    HRB (Li et al. 2010a). The major referenced distributed hydrological models are
    the Distributed Hydrology Vegetation Model (DHSVM; Wigmosta et al. 1994), the
    Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT; Arnold and Fohrer 2005), GEOtop (Rigon et
    al. 2006), and a distributed biosphere hydrological model (WEB-DHM; L. Wang et
    al. 2009). Various versions of ModFLOW are used as core groundwater models (Harbaugh
    et al. 2000). The Lund–Potsdam–Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM;
    Sitch et al. 2003) is the dynamic vegetation models and WOFOST (Vandiepen et al.
    1989) is the crop growth model. The Simple Biosphere Model, version 2 (SiB2; Sellers
    et al. 1996), Common Land Model (CoLM; Dai et al. 2003), and Community Land Model
    (CLM; Oleson et al. 2010) are referenced as land surface models. The newly developed
    coupled models for the HRB have also been used as reference models (Tian et al.
    2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2012). Tabulation of the variables and parameters
    can be found online at http://hiwater.westgis.ac.cn/english/index.asp. EXPERIMENT
    COMPOSITION. HiWATER is composed of fundamental, thematic, application experiments
    and integrated studies. Fundamental experiments. The fundamental experiments focus
    on the establishment of observing system, provision of basic datasets, enhancement
    of observation capabilities, and development of reliable and robust methods. The
    four following experiments are included. Airborne remote sensing experiment An
    imaging spectrometer, light detection and ranging (lidar) system, charge-coupled
    device (CCD), multi-angle thermal infrared camera, and microwave radiometer are
    used in the airborne missions. The goal of these missions is to improve the remote
    sensing methods for observing key eco-hydrological processes and to develop scaling
    methods by acquiring multispatial-resolution remote sensing data. The airborne
    sensors used in HiWATER are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Airborne sensors used
    in HiWATER. View Table Hydrometeorological network This aims to establish a comprehensive
    hydrometeorological observation network composed of super, research, ordinary,
    and conventional stations that cover the whole HRB to provide representative atmospheric
    forcing data and validation data for the watershed models. The ordinary automatic
    meteorological station (AMS) measures the radiation, precipitation, air pressure,
    wind speed and direction, air temperature, humidity, soil moisture and temperature
    profiles, and soil heat flux. The superstation is outfitted with an EC system,
    a Bowen ration energy balance system, an LAS, and a lysimeter (optional) to measure
    fluxes at multiple scales. Additionally, besides the standard observations performed
    in an ordinary station, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and land surface
    temperature (LST) are measured at a superstation. Precipitation is highly uncertain
    in cold and arid regions for wind-induced error and wetting loss (Yang et al.
    2009). Therefore, a precipitation correction experiment is carried out to develop
    calibration formulas for different rain gauges employed in the HRB. Additionally,
    intensive river runoff observations supplement existing hydrological stations
    along the mainstream of the Heihe River. Eco-hydrological wireless sensor network
    The eco-hydrological wireless sensor network (WSN) in HiWATER aims to integrate
    a variety of hydrological, ecological, and meteorological observation facilities
    distributed in the HRB. Three types of new sensor nodes are designed or used,
    including the WATERNET (Fig. 2a), SoilNet (Fig. 2b), and leaf area index (LAI)
    measurement systems (Fig. 2c). The AMSs and flux towers are reconfigured with
    wireless transmission capacities. Relevant studies about the optimal spatial sampling
    strategy of the sensor nodes have been performed to capture the spatiotemporal
    variations of key eco-hydrological parameters over heterogeneous land surface,
    for example, at the watershed or pixel scale (Ge et al. 2012). View Full Size

    Figure Download figure as PowerPoint slide The sensor nodes communicate with the
    data center through wireless transmission techniques such as Zigbee, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), and microwave antenna. A software platform for the WSN has
    been developed. This system has the functions of transmitting and archiving automatically
    observed data and controlling sensor nodes and instruments remotely. As a result,
    the platform is anticipated to establish an automatic, intelligent, and remote-controllable
    ecohydrological WSN in the HRB (Jin et al. 2012). Calibration and validation experiment
    The main tasks of the calibration and validation experiment are as follows. Calibration.
    Measurements on the radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and geometric
    rectification of airborne and satellite remote calibration, atmospheric correction,
    and geometric rectification of airborne and satellite remote sensing data are
    carried out. In particular, air temperature and humidity profiles and aerosol
    properties are measured by a digital sounder and sun spectrophotometers. GPS-tracking
    sounding balloons are released before and after each airborne mission. The wind
    speed at various heights above the ground and the thermodynamic structure of the
    lower layer of the atmosphere are measured by an acoustic wind profiler, with
    a vertical range of up to 1000 m above the ground. Ground-based remote sensing.
    The emissivity spectra of different land surfaces during different seasons are
    systematically measured by an infrared spectrum analyzer. The microwave radiation
    characteristics of typical land surfaces are measured using a ground-based microwave
    radiometer. Validation. The remote sensing products to be validated are products
    of land cover type, plant structure, vegetation type, LST, albedo, soil moisture,
    snow depth, LAI, fraction of PAR (FPAR), fraction of vegetation cover (FVC), net
    primary production (NPP), and net ecosystem production (NEP). Pixel-scale ground
    truths are obtained simultaneously with airborne and satellite overpasses with
    the aid of the WSN. Thematic experiments. The thematic experiments are concentrated
    on specific hydrological or ecological processes. The first thematic experiment
    in HiWATER is the multiscale observation experiment on evapotranspiration (ET)
    over inhomogeneous land surfaces (Liu et al. 2013, unpublished manuscript). During
    the lifetime of HiWATER, more thematic experiments are planned, such as one for
    soil moisture and one for ecosystem biomass. ET is the most important component
    of the water cycle in arid regions. It is also a key process that links hydrology
    with ecosystem dynamics, from stoma to landscape scales. Therefore, a multiscale
    observation experiment on ET using a flux observing matrix is carried out to reveal
    the spatial heterogeneities of ET, to explore the energy balance closure problem,
    to identify scaling effects, and to provide ground truths that correspond to the
    development of the remote sensing models and scale transformation approaches for
    ET over heterogeneous land surfaces (Jia et al. 2012). Application experiments.
    The application experiments aim to prove the applicability of remote sensing in
    integrated eco-hydrological modeling and water resource management by carrying
    out comprehensive experiments in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the HRB,
    in association with fundamental experiments. The following experiments are included.
    Remote sensing hydrology experiment for cold regions Carefully designed observations
    will be performed to calibrate and validate distributed cold region hydrological
    models that feature detailed descriptions of snow and soil freeze/thaw processes.
    Algorithms for the estimation of snow cover area (SCA) under complex terrains
    and a dynamic function between SCA and snow water equivalent (SWE) at the grid
    scale will be developed and validated through airborne missions and in situ measurements.
    These algorithms are expected to improve the forecasting of runoff, especially
    spring runoff, in mountainous areas by assimilating remote-sensed SCA and soil
    moisture products into a distributed cold region hydrological model. Remote sensing
    experiment for optimal allocation of irrigation water in the middle stream of
    the HRB Measurements of water balance components in some irrigation districts
    are being carried out to calibrate and improve coupled surface water–groundwater–crop
    growth models. With the aid of remote sensing products, such as vegetation type,
    vegetation coverage, phenophase, NPP, and soil moisture, the coupled model is
    to be expanded to the irrigation district scale based on a state-of-the-art data
    assimilation method. With these data, the coupled model is expected to realize
    real-time monitoring and the short-term forecast of water demand/supply and crop
    growth situation at the irrigation district scale to further optimize irrigation
    management and enhance water use efficiency. Remote sensing experiment to support
    scale transformation of ecosystem water consumption in the downstream oases of
    the HRB This experiment will carry out multiscale comprehensive observations to
    measure the water consumption of the oasis ecosystem downstream to validate and
    calibrate scale transformation approaches of water consumption from the single
    plant-canopy-community to regional scale. Airborne lidar missions will be performed
    to acquire key vegetation structure parameters that are needed in scale transformation.
    In this context, the water consumption of the riparian forest ecosystem will be
    quantified with the support of remote sensing. Integrated studies. Except for
    field campaigns, integrated research also plays an important role in HiWATER.
    These studies aim at producing remote sensing products to study water cycle and
    key ecological processes. For water cycle, a daily SCA product with a resolution
    of 500 m will be created by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) data and based on a nonlinear spectral mixture analysis model. A soil
    moisture product with a resolution of 1 km will be generated by merging microwave
    remote sensed data and MODIS VI products. Hourly precipitation products with resolutions
    of 1–5 km will be created by assimilating passive microwave observations, Doppler
    radar, and ground measured rainfall data into the Weather Research And Forecasting
    (WRF) model. For ecological variables/parameters, monthly vegetation maps across
    the whole HRB will be generated based on differences in topography, vegetation
    type, and vegetation structure to reveal the characteristics of vegetation phenology.
    The data products of FVC, LAI, FPAR, NPP, and other key parameters that can represent
    plant growth processes will be produced with a spatial resolution finer than 1
    km. INSTRUMENT SETTINGS AND AIRBORNE MISSIONS. Upstream area. Three-level nested
    experimental areas are chosen. The first level is the upstream area of the Heihe
    River main stream, the second level is composed of the two FEAs, and the third
    level consists of a snow observatory and a frozen soil observatory (Fig. 3). View

    CCD camera and an imaging spectrometer are flown over the Heihe River Valley.
    In the Hulugou and other selected catchments, a 1-m resolution digital elevation
    model (DEM) is to be generated using airborne lidar. The L-, K-, and Ka-band radiometers
    are flown with manned and unmanned missions to develop more reliable remote sensing
    methods for deriving soil moisture (including surface soil freeze/thaw status),
    snow depth, and SWE. The upstream area of the Heihe River main stream The whole
    region is equipped with 10 AMSs and 3 flux towers (Fig. 3a). The flux towers are
    installed in a permafrost area, a seasonally frozen ground area and a snow-covered
    area. The Babao River basin It will be instrumented with a densely distributed
    network of AMSs and WSN. Six ordinary AMSs and a superstation at A''rou will be
    installed in different landscapes and elevation zones to capture the heterogeneity
    of near-surface atmospheric states (Fig. 3b). A WSN with more than 40 WATERNET
    nodes will be deployed according to an optimal design based on the spatial variation
    of terrain, soil moisture, and soil temperature, so that the major hydrological
    heterogeneity can be captured (Ge et al. 2012) (Fig. 3b). The observation items
    of a WATERNET node include soil moisture, soil temperature, LST, precipitation,
    snow depth, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction. Snow observatory
    and frozen soil observatory In the Hulugou catchment, a snow observatory was constructed
    (Fig. 3c). A γ-ray (GMON) observation system is employed to measure the SWE with
    a footprint of 100 m2. A snow water sensor (SWS) is used to measure the snowpack
    liquid water content, snow density, and SWE. FlowCapt records the blowing snow
    flux and the EC system observes the evaporation and sublimation on the snow surface.
    A snow pillow records the SWE and the melts. A digital camera monitors snow coverage.
    Snow stakes are laid out at an interval of 10 m to periodically measure snow depth.
    The frozen soil observatory is located at the A''rou Superstation. In addition
    to the basic observations configured in the superstation, the top 30-cm depth
    soil is stratified into 5-cm intervals and the soils at a depth of 30–100 cm are
    stratified into 10-cm intervals. In each layer, soil temperature and moisture
    are measured. Soil heat flux and water potential are measured in selected layers.
    Additionally, a footprint-scale (approximately 600-m diameter) soil moisture is
    measured by a cosmic-ray soil moisture observing system, in association with WSN
    (Fig. 3d). Middle stream area. Airborne missions VNIR imaging spectrometers (i.e.,
    the CASI and SASI systems) are flown over the experimental area (Fig. 4) to support
    the inversion of surface reflectance, albedo, FPAR, LAI, chlorophyll content,
    and FVC. The TASI imaging spectrometer is utilized to measure the emission characteristics
    of soils, vegetation, and desert and for the retrieval of LST and emissivity.
    The WiDAS is flown to measure the directional characteristics of surface reflectance
    and thermal radiation. The lidar and CCD camera are to measure the structure parameter
    of crops and other vegetation and to derive the aerodynamic roughness. The L-band
    microwave radiometer is flown during different growing seasons to derive soil
    moisture products and to validate the soil moisture algorithms. These observations
    will be further used to estimate some components of water and carbon cycles, such
    as ET and NPP. View Full Size Fig. 4. Instrumentation setting in the middle stream

    slide Very high-resolution airborne CCD images (~20 cm) are used to map land cover
    and vegetation types and to obtain the characteristics of the channels in the
    irrigation district, including their spatial distribution, types, roughness, and
    other static parameters. Multi-scale observation on ET The instrumentation plan
    is illustrated in Figs. 4a and 4b. In larger areas, the observation system is
    used to monitor the spatial– temporal variation of ET and its impact factors within
    the oasis–desert ecosystem. Four AMSs are installed around the oasis (i.e., sandy
    desert, desert steppe, Gobi, and wetland stations) and each one is supplemented
    with an EC system (Fig. 4a). The Daman Superstation is installed in the central
    oasis, which is a 40-m boundary layer tower. Within the oasis, an observing matrix
    composed of 17 EC towers and ordinary AMSs and 4 pairs of LAS systems that span
    2–3 km each are located in the Yingke and Daman irrigation district, where the
    land surface is heterogeneous, dominated by seed corn, corn interplanted with
    spring wheat, vegetables, orchards, and residential areas (Fig. 4b). Continuous
    single-point and simultaneous multipoint soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration
    partitioning measurements are implemented using stable isotope technology to obtain
    the temporal and spatial patterns of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration.
    A WSN composed of 50 WATERNET, 50 SoilNet, and 45 LAI measurement system nodes
    and another soil moisture measurement system are deployed to capture the heterogeneity
    of soil moisture, soil temperature, LST, and LAI (Fig. 4b). The configuration
    of the WSN has been optimized by the means of surfaces with the stratified nonhomogeneity
    method (J.-F. Wang et al. 2009; J. Kang et al. 2012, unpublished manuscript).
    Irrigation and the water balance Other components of water balance in an irrigation
    district (conceptualized in Fig. 4c) are measured, including the surface water
    irrigation that flows into and the surface return flow that drains out of the
    irrigation district, the lateral groundwater flow that seeps into and drains out
    of the irrigation district, and channel evaporation. In particular, because of
    the effects of seepage and channel evaporation, the amount of water loss accounts
    for 49% of the total amount of water in the channels, so this phenomenon cannot
    be ignored. Therefore, flow meters are installed at the entrance and terminal
    in some typical main canals, subcanals, and field ditches to observe flows in
    different levels of the channels, in association with section measurements to
    calculate the amount of water losses based on water balance method. The leakage
    pools are set up to obtain the amount of water seepage. Eventually, the water
    use efficiency of different channels can be calculated. Meanwhile, groundwater
    exploitation and spring flow are also key components in irrigation water balance.
    Water meters are performed to quantify the amount of groundwater exploited. Spring
    flows are estimated from measurements at wells. All these data support determining
    the total and segmental amount of irrigation water in the channels and different
    farmland parcels. Downstream area. In Ejin Basin, Populus euphratica and Tamarix
    are primarily distributed in the area between Erdaoqiao and Qidaoqiao, which is
    selected as the aviation area (Fig. 5). Airborne lidar is flown to acquire structure
    parameters (e.g., tree height and diameter at breast height of the typical vegetation).

    albedo, LST, canopy temperature, FPAR, LAI, and chlorophyll content. View Full

    Intensive ground measurements are performed in several relatively homogeneous
    plots toward Populus euphratica and Tamarix. In these plots, which are focused
    on a “standard tree” (Fig. 5c), a series of instruments, including sap flow instruments,
    Li-6400, TDRs, and tensiometers, are set up to measure the parameters related
    to multiscale eco-hydrological processes to eventually improve our understanding
    of these processes in arid regions. DATA MANAGEMENT AND SATELLITE DATA COLLECTION.
    Data management in HiWATER involves data collection, standardization, quality
    control, processing, warehousing, and release. It must achieve the following tasks
    to provide data services for HiWATER: 1) formulate observing specifications and
    standards for various observations and data and metadata formats; 2) design, plan,
    and implement data gathering and management; and 3) perform quality control and
    store data (including metadata). Various satellite remote sensing data from VNIR,
    thermal infrared, and active and passive microwave and lidar sensors are being
    collected by data sharing programs, international cooperation, and limited commercial
    purchase. Data are ordered before airborne missions and in situ measurements are
    deployed to guarantee the completion of simultaneous satellite–airborne–ground-based
    observations and corresponding calibration/validation activities. In addition,
    to run data assimilation systems, medium and low spatial resolution remote sensing
    data will be acquired on a daily basis from 2012 to 2015. The open data policy
    of HiWATER will ensure that the experimental data are timely and adequately utilized.
    However, there will be a protection period so that observers can have priority
    in using original data. After the data protection period, HiWATER data will be
    submitted to the data management and sharing platform of the Environmental and
    Ecological Science Data Center for West China (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn/).
    EXPERIMENTAL DURATION. HiWATER is planned to last four years, from 2012 to 2015.
    Within this period, a 1-yr intensive observation will be conducted in each of
    the three KEAs. The HiWATER intensive observation period field work started in
    May 2012 from the middle stream. The persistent observations period over the whole
    river basin will continue from 2013 to 2015. Airborne missions with a manned airplane
    are mainly executed in summer 2012. Unmanned airborne missions are to be performed
    periodically in three KEAs according to the requirements. SUMMARY. This paper
    introduces the background, scientific objectives, and overall experimental design
    of HiWATER. The instrumental setting and airborne mission plans of HiWATER are
    also outlined. More detailed information regarding the implementation plan can
    be found online at http://hiwater.westgis.ac.cn. HiWATER has formally kicked off
    in May 2012, the field campaigns are currently going on, and some important data
    have been obtained. Data will be available half a year later for each experiment.
    Scientists internationally are welcomed to participate in the field campaigns
    and use the data in their analyses. As a comprehensive eco-hydrological experiment,
    HiWATER should make a difference in continental-scale hydroclimatic or hydrometeorological
    experiments. It should address the large issues that have puzzled watershed-scale
    hydrological and ecological studies for a long time, such as heterogeneity, scaling,
    uncertainty, and closing water cycle at the watershed scale. Practical utilization
    for water resource management should also be considered. Compared with WATER,
    HiWATER will be more oriented toward answering scientific questions and more organized,
    with more information integration. It will provide a test bed to testify or falsify
    new ideas on eco-hydrology and new hypotheses on scaling because it is designed
    to capture multiscale heterogeneities within a river basin with very diverse landscapes.
    Finally, HiWATER must be well coordinated, within the experiment itself and within
    the NSFC Heihe Plan, to ensure that the scientific objectives envisioned are accomplished
    and to best meet the diverse needs of interdisciplinary studies in the Heihe Plan
    and ultimately the needs of integrated eco-hydrological studies. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    Get rights and content Highlights • The greenhouse thermal imaging system had
    a ±0.62 °C (α = 0.05) measurement accuracy. • Unstressed canopy temperatures followed
    closely to characteristic crop water use. • Canopy temperature is a viable water
    stress indicator throughout growth stages. • Spatial and temporal canopy temperature
    provide accurate crop health assessment. • 82% of soil moisture variation was
    explained by CWSI values above 0.6. Abstract Inadequate water application often
    decreases yield and grain quality. Existing methods using single, localized soil
    moisture or canopy temperature measurements do not account for crop water stress
    on both a high spatial and temporal resolution for precision irrigation water
    management decisions and scheduling. Therefore, this study was conducted to understand
    the feasibility of thermal cameras in order to quantify high resolution spatial
    canopy temperatures in relation to soil moisture. The objectives of this study
    were to deploy a thermal infrared imaging system (TIRIS) for high spatial and
    temporal monitoring of corn canopy temperature in greenhouse, test camera durability
    and measurement accuracy during full-season crop development, remove background
    temperatures with image segmentation, and sample individual plants to investigate
    full-season crop water stress versus soil moisture content. A TIRIS was developed
    using a lightweight uncooled thermal camera. Corn plants were divided into well-watered
    and water-stressed irrigation zones to observe stress from water deficits. Canopy
    temperatures were used to develop empirical canopy and air temperature deficit
    versus vapor pressure deficit linear regressions. Results showed that the TIRIS
    system maintained measurement accuracy of ±0.62 °C (α = 0.05) while compensating
    for changing ambient greenhouse conditions. Canopy and air temperature deficit
    versus vapor pressure deficit regression equations revealed that the predicted
    canopy temperature was closely related to characteristic water use. Results of
    the 80-day study demonstrated that 82% of soil moisture variation was explained
    by the crop water stress index (CWSI) values between 0.6 and 1.0. Results indicated
    that the CWSI derived by remotely measuring canopy temperature using TIRIS can
    be used as an alternate irrigation scheduling method in order to quantify spatial

    agriculture annually uses approximately 80% of the consumptive ground and surface
    water (USDA, 2014). The potential to conserve water relies heavily on decision
    support tools (Rodriguez et al., 2005) which can increase water use efficiency
    using precision irrigation technologies (Ballester et al., 2013, Cohen et al.,
    2005, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008). Quantity of irrigation water and application time
    is among critical decisions producers frequently have to make to develop site-specific
    irrigation plans (Alves and Pereira, 2000, Cohen et al., 2005, Wanjura et al.,
    1992). Precision variable rate irrigation technologies are available which can
    apply a desired amount of water at a controllable increment for optimum crop growth
    and yield (Cohen et al., 2005, Taghvaeian et al., 2013). However, large variability
    may exist in commercial agricultural fields due to soil type and depth, topography,
    climate, specific crop growth period and seed hybrid selection (Cohen et al.,
    2005, Evett et al., 2014). Of the many types of crop stress, water stress is the
    most common and restrictive factor impacting crop yield (Jackson et al., 1981,
    Luvall and Holbo, 1991, Scherrer et al., 2011, Zia et al., 2013) where water stress
    severity depends on timing and duration. Therefore, techniques and technologies
    are needed to accurately classify spatial and temporal crop water need, or crop
    water stress, to gain economic and environment advantages (Herwitz et al., 2004,
    Taghvaeian et al., 2013). Several existing methods to monitor crop water stress
    rely on a combination of single-point soil, plant and atmospheric measurements
    (Alves and Pereira, 2000, Cohen et al., 2005). Soil moisture sensors are one of
    the most common tools being utilized to make irrigation decisions. Newer soil
    moisture probes are capable of quantifying moisture at multiple soil depths. Typically,
    one or two soil moisture probes are installed for a whole field due to the installation
    time, cost and yearly maintenance. However, soil moisture probes are subject to
    error from installation and location choice that do not account for spatial crop
    variability which may exist within the whole field (Moller et al., 2007). Alternative
    methods for detecting crop water stress utilize pressure chambers and leaf diffusion
    porometers to measure individual leaf and stem water potential and leaf stomatal
    conductance, respectively (Ballester et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009a, Grant
    et al., 2007, Idso et al., 1977). However, these techniques are destructive, labor
    intensive, localized, limited by small sample size and unsuitable for automation
    (Ballester et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009a, Cohen et al., 2005, Gontia and Tiwari,
    2008, Jones, 1999, Leinonen and Jones, 2004). Consequently, these drawbacks make
    invasive plant-based crop monitoring impractical at high resolution spatial and
    temporal scale in large acreage production systems like corn, thereby limiting
    producer adoption of these technologies/methods for irrigation decision management
    (Ballester et al., 2013). To address these concerns, thermal sensing approaches
    have been investigated because they are non-contact and less labor intensive,
    and offer non-destructive monitoring to assess crop stress from leaf canopy temperatures
    (Grant et al., 2006, Leinonen and Jones, 2004). Since the 1970s, crop canopy temperature
    has been accepted as an indicator of crop water stress because plants close their
    leaf stomata when they experience water stress in order to retain water, thereby
    lowering stomatal conductance, reducing transpiration, and increasing leaf temperatures
    (Ballester et al., 2013, Grant et al., 2006, Idso et al., 1977, Jones, 1999, Leinonen
    and Jones, 2004, Rodriguez et al., 2005). On the other hand, when leaf stomata
    are open, water in the leaf evaporates through transpiration which cools the leaf
    (Maes and Steppe, 2012). During transpiration, energy from within and surrounding
    the leaf is used to convert water from liquid to a gas that under goes latent
    heat loss which in turn cools the leaf. Current crop growth studies have primarily
    used ground-based thermometry to take canopy temperature measurements and develop
    thermal indices that account for canopy characteristics, soil temperature, and
    atmospheric conditions for site-specific irrigation management and breeding programs
    (Idso et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1981, O’Toole and Real, 1986). According to
    Zia et al. (2013), crop growth stage does not significantly impact canopy leaf
    temperature, thereby supporting the use of leaf temperature as a viable indicator
    of full-season crop health characteristic. Highly integrated thermometric systems
    use an array of infrared thermometers (IRTs) mounted in fixed field locations
    and on dynamic center pivot irrigation systems to measure crop canopy temperatures
    and provide a means of irrigation scheduling (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). IRTs
    provide a single point (comprising of one pixel) average temperature value of
    all objects within the sensor’s field of view (FOV) which could include shaded
    and unshaded plant material; and/or soil background. IRT inaccuracy from background
    temperatures limit their use until the crop reaches a particular maturity stage
    because when plants are small, soil covers a majority of the measurable surface,
    thereby dominating the temperature measurement. Additionally, IRTs cannot measure
    spatial temperature difference between shaded and sunlit leaves where temperature
    differences can drastically differ. Therefore, crop temperature must be segmented
    from the measured temperature value to reduce the influence of soil background
    and shaded lower leaves (Ayeneh et al., 2002, Luquet et al., 2003, Maes and Steppe,
    2012). IRTs are typically mounted to fixed locations within the field or on dynamic
    pivot systems which may limit the spatial coverage area. When mounted to pivot
    systems, useful data may only be collected during a few hours in the day while
    the pivots moves 24/7. Additionally, IRTs can only operate at the temporal resolution
    of irrigation events (often every 3–7 days) and thus lack the high spatial and
    temporal measurement resolution necessary to quantify crop water stress variability
    critical for making weekly irrigation decisions (Colaizzi et al., 2012). An alternate
    to IRTs are low cost and lightweight uncooled thermal infrared (TIR) cameras.
    TIR cameras can spatially map temperatures via a thermal image to measure subtle,
    heterogeneous characteristics of leaf dynamics (Liu et al., 2011). Each image
    is comprised of pixel arrays representative of pixel resolution of the TIR camera.
    Crop canopy temperature monitoring with thermography could allow producers to
    use thermal sensing for crop canopy temperature mapping (Alves and Pereira, 2000,
    Ayeneh et al., 2002, Berni et al., 2009b, Taghvaeian et al., 2013, Wang et al.,
    2010), individual crop temperature profiling (Leinonen and Jones, 2004), and manage
    variable rate irrigation scheduling (Cohen et al., 2005, Colaizzi et al., 2012,
    Fitzgerald et al., 2007). The crop water stress index (CWSI), investigated by
    Idso et al. (1981), has been successfully developed and implemented using IRTs
    that measure canopy temperatures in order to determine variable rate irrigation
    needs (Taghvaeian et al., 2013). Thermography has been recently utilized to further
    develop thermal indices and crop sensing techniques originally developed with
    IRTs. Temperature-based indices have shown significant correlations among crop
    canopy temperature, stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential as correlations
    become more significant as stress intensity increased (Hackl et al., 2012). Thermal
    imagery also requires systems and subsequent data processing techniques to capture,
    analyze, and interpret large amount of images. However, available knowledge regarding
    thermal sensing systems using TIR cameras is limited, and producers are skeptical
    of technology that has demonstrated potential for measuring crop temperature profiles
    for water management in orchards, vineyards, and other specialty crops in areas
    outside of the United States (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2011). Limited studies have
    been conducted using TIR camera systems in the U.S. to measure all-season crop
    temperature with high spatial (i.e., sub-centimeter) and temporal (i.e., minute-to-minute)
    resolutions while testing the thermal cameras’ durability during prolonged operation
    time in varying environmental conditions. Therefore this study was conducted to
    understand the necessary hardware required to capture thermal imagery, segment
    crop canopy from background and establish standard operating procedures to generate
    absolute temperature measurement from relative pixel intensities of lightweight
    uncooled cameras. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) develop and
    deploy a thermal imaging system for monitoring corn canopy at high spatial and
    temporal resolutions in a greenhouse; (2) evaluate the accuracy of the thermal
    imaging system in measuring crop canopy temperatures during a full growing, and;
    (3) investigate full-season air-to-canopy temperature deficit versus VPD transfer
    functions for direct relationships between crop water stress index (CWSI) values
    and soil moisture by automatically evaluating canopy temperature images. 2. Methods
    and materials The irrigation experiment was conducted within the Throckmorton
    Greenhouses of the Agronomy Department at Kansas State University, Manhattan,
    Kansas. On 10 May 2014, corn (Zea mays) seeds were planted in 20 cm diameter pot
    containers with 30 replications. For a full-season study (80 days), the plants
    were separated into two irrigation regimes, well-watered (WW) and water-stressed
    (WS), as shown in Fig. 1. Corn was selected as the crop of choice because it is
    a major irrigated crop in the Midwest and has demonstrated high yield potential
    with supplemental irrigation (Schlegel et al., 2014). Compost material with high
    organic and plant nutrient content was used as potting media with a water-holding
    capacity of 3.4 ml per gram of soil, as determined in an oven drying method (Texas
    Department of Transportation, 2014). All corn seed was planted 4 cm deep, fertilized
    with slow-release nitrogen pellets, and imposed with water treatments directly
    after emergence. Greenhouse temperature was set to 27 °C during the day from 6:00
    to 18:00 h and 20 °C at night from 18:00 to 6:00 h on the following day (Hoeft
    et al., 2004). Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download : Download

    plants during growth period 1 with water stressed (WS), on the left, and well-watered
    (WW) plants, on the right. Irrigation water quantities required in inches during
    different stages of corn have been established by researchers (Rogers, 2007 and
    Kranz et al., 2008). For this study in the greenhouse, approximate irrigation
    volume for a plant in a pot was calculated based on inches of water used by crop
    on per acre basis in the field during each growth stage (Rogers, 2007). An irrigation
    volume of 50% compared to WW was selected for the WS regimes. As previously mentioned
    the irrigation water volumes were selected to soley create two different water
    availability levels within WW and WS regimes to test TIRIS. Consequently, periods
    of analysis were split into growth periods of (1) germination and seedling stage,
    (2) rapid growth stage, (3) reproductive stage, and (4) maturity stage. Based
    on the size of pot containers used in this study, Table 1 depicts the water amount
    applied to each corn plant during the respective growth stage based on recommended
    water needs suggested by Rogers (2007) as defined by Eq. (1). (1) where Table

    via commercial drip-line under constant pressure from a regulating solenoid valve
    (Production Series Sprinkler Value, Orbit Irrigation Products, Inc., Bountiful,
    Utah, USA) controlled by a zone irrigation controller (Zone Indoor/Outdoor Irrigation
    Controller, Orbit Irrigation Products, Inc., Bountiful, Utah, USA) to maintain
    drip uniformity and repeatability. Precise and timely irrigation regimes were
    applied at 6:00 AM. Fig. 1 shows the irrigation setup and plants under growth
    period 1. 2.2. Thermal imaging and environmental monitoring An automated thermal
    infrared imaging system (TIRIS) was developed and deployed in the greenhouse to
    measure on-demand corn canopy temperatures in order to evaluate measurement accuracy
    and requirements for measuring corn canopy temperatures in precision agriculture
    applications. The TIRIS was comprised of components for remote camera control,
    environmental monitoring sensors, and computer for capturing, storing, and analyzing
    image and environmental data (Fig. 2). For remote monitoring and control of the
    TIRIS, wireless control was enabled using a virtual private network (VPN). Download

    Individual component of the TIRIS. The camera control components stream thermal
    images from the camera into the computer while a suite of sensors monitor environmental
    parameters. Thermal images were obtained with an uncooled Tamarisk® 320 thermal
    infrared (TIR) camera core (DRS Technologies, Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA) with a
    focal length of 11 mm and a 27° × 20° FOV lens. The TIR camera was sensitive to
    long wave infrared (LWIR) electromagnetic radiation from 8 to 14 μm corresponding
    to a temperature span of −66 to 90 °C, and an uncooled microbolometer sensor with
    a 320 × 280 fixed pixel array. The camera was mounted to the greenhouse frame
    at a 4.5 m height nadir to the ground throughout the study, thereby providing
    a spatial resolution of 7.0 mm/pixel, limiting the ground coverage or FOV to 3
    × 2 m. The TIR camera core provided an 8-bit (256 discrete pixel intensity digital
    value (DV)) thermal video. The DRS Camera Control Software was used to control
    the camera’s functions and features. Within the software’s graphical user interface
    (GUI), the TIR camera core was configured for video output and frame rate, and
    thermal detector sensitivity settings. In order to interface and set the TIR camera
    core, a DRS breakout board module (Breakout Box 1003785-001, DRS Technologies,
    Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA) was used to adjust the slope and intercept of the sensitivity
    curve of the thermal detector, thereby adjusting the gain sensitivity (i.e., detectable
    scene temperature span) and level control (i.e., shift offset of the center temperature
    within the temperature span). For instance, a gain of 20 and level of 30 °C will
    program the TIR camera thermal detector to measure temperatures from 20 °C to
    40 °C and saturate everything else. As a result, the thermal detector was able
    to be set for a specific temperature span and offset in order to detect subtle
    scene temperatures differences. Auto gain and level contrast sensitivity was controlled
    via the DRS Camera Control Software (DRS Technologies, Dallas, Texas) to account
    for continuously changing operating camera housing temperatures within the greenhouse.
    Auto gain and contrast maintains distinguishable scene temperatures and high and
    low temperatures within saturation threshold limits (Kuenzer, 2014). The TIRIS
    system was designed to capture analog video output into an analog-to-digital video
    converter (Dazzle DVD Recorder HD, Corel Corporation, USA). This raw analog video
    signal was streamed via a cable into a host computer using LabVIEW™ (National
    Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) image acquisition and processing software.
    Real-time environmental conditions were measured every 2.5 min with a single-board
    microcontroller (Single-Board RIO 9633, National Instruments Corporation, Austin,
    Texas, USA) and placed into a measurement file denoted with the corresponding
    image number from the TIR camera analog video output. When the TIRIS sampled environmental
    parameters, the virtual interface (VI) grabbed the simultaneous image (or frame
    from video), assigned a timestamp, and stored it within the appropriate storage
    folder (Fig. 3) for analysis. Environmental parameters measured included relative
    humidity, air temperature, solar radiation and soil moisture. Relative humidity
    and air temperature were measured with an ambient air sensor (HX303AV, Omega Engineering
    Inc., Stamford, Connecticut, USA) with an accuracy of ±3% and ±0.2 °C, respectively.
    Solar radiance was measured with an pyranometer (SP115, Apogee Instruments, Logan,
    Utah) with an accuracy of ±0.25 W m−2. The soil moisture of two irrigation regimes
    were monitored with four Waterscout SM 100 (Spectrum Technologies, Aurora, Illinois,
    USA) with an accuracy of ±3% soil moisture content (SMC) with two sensors in each
    irrigation regime. The soil moisture sensors were installed according to the sensor
    manufacturer’s installation procedures in order to measure the WW and WS plants
    throughout the season to validate the extent of crop water stress. Download :

    number, and time stamp. To compensate for the influence of environmental conditions
    on the accuracy of the TIR camera, surface mount thermistors (ON-930-44004, Omega
    Engineering Inc., Stamford, Connecticut, USA) with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C measured
    temperature were mounted on the reference panels and placed within the camera’s
    FOV. Reference panels used in the experiment were 10 × 10 cm wooden pads with
    an empirical emissivity of 0.9, whereas corn has an emissivity of about 0.95 (Idso
    et al., 1981). Reference temperature panels were sized accordingly to the camera’s
    spatial resolution and constructed of materials with a low thermal inertia in
    order to resist temperature changes. A reference panel was placed on shaded concrete,
    well-watered soil, and water-stressed soil to generate a set of three known reference
    measured temperatures corresponding to pixel intensity DV. 2.3. Radiometric calibration
    The uncooled TIR camera core measured LWIR energy that strikes the detector material,
    altering the electrical resistance from a temperature change, transforming LWIR
    radiation intensity into a raw DV, thereby generating a thermal image (Kuenzer,
    2014). The uncooled TIR cameras measured relative pixel intensity DV and did not
    provide absolute temperatures. To quantify absolute surface temperature at environmental
    conditions in which the TIR camera was calibrated, a real-time (RT) radiometric
    calibration method was developed. A RT radiometric calibration used RT image pixel
    intensities of a viewable reference panel within the camera’s FOV and the actual
    surface temperatures measured from thermistors to characterize a pixel-to-temperature
    relationship. For any one sampling, the three reference panels always present
    within each image FOV provided a low, in-between, and high temperature due to
    their placement locations. As a result, the low and high reference panels were
    used for the RT radiometric calibration, whereas the in-between reference panel
    acted as a crosscheck for assessing RT measurement accuracy. Static regions of
    interest (ROI) comprising each reference panel, as specified in the automatic
    imaging program, averaged multiple pixels containing digital pixel intensity values
    from TIR camera to correlate to one surface temperature measurement. Raw pixel
    intensities DV (X1, X2) from each image were correlated to actual surface temperature
    (Y1, Y2) to determine the radiometric transfer function slope, as defined by Eq.
    (2): (2) where m = slope of the radiometric transfer function, X1 = pixel intensity
    of the cool reference panel, X2 = pixel intensity of the warm reference panel,
    Y1 = temperature of the cool reference panel, and Y2 = temperature of the warm
    reference panel. By using the slope found in Eq. (2), raw pixel and coinciding
    surface temperature (X1, Y1), the y-intercept of the RT radiometric transfer function
    was determined using Eq. (3): (3) where X1 = reference pixel intensity, Y1 = reference
    temperature, and m = slope of the radiometric transfer function. Using results
    from Eq. (3), instantaneous temperature span was defined by Eq. (4): (4) where
    Tspan = span of temperature captured in the image, and DV = bit-depth of pixel
    intensity (e.g., DV = 256 for 8-bit images). Using the resulting radiometric calibration
    function from Eqs. (2), (3), the TIR camera core was found to be directly sensitive
    (R2 = 0.9986) to the scene temperatures within the FOV (Fig. 4). Download : Download

    radiometric calibration developed for an image at 25 °C air temperature, 45% relative
    humidity, and steady-state operating camera temperature. A unique RT radiometric
    conversion was applied to each image to convert DV into temperature values as
    defined by Eq. (5). The radiometric calibration method enabled the uncooled TIR
    camera core to use the sensitivity of the thermal detector, as shown Fig. 4, to
    quantify corn canopy temperatures. Initial tests were conducted to determine the
    TIR camera’s ability to measure temperatures within a strict laboratory environment.
    The absolute difference between actual (thermistor) and measured temperature (TIR
    camera) revealed that the maximum measurement error was 0.62 °C (α = 0.05) with
    camera temperature resolution of 0.08 °C (Fig. 5). Additional preliminary tests
    were conducted to assess the RT radiometric calibration method’s ability to compensate
    for varying VPD and the results indicated that TIR camera core maintained the
    measurement accuracy (Fig. 6). Therefore, the RT radiometric calibration method
    was implemented to minimize the potential influence of environmental conditions
    on the measurement accuracy within a greenhouse. (5) where Download : Download

    (e.g., N = 8 for 8-bit images), and Tspan = span of temperature captured in the
    image. 2.4. Automated thermal imaging and processing An Image Processing VI (LabVIEW™,
    National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX) using Vision Assistant module was
    developed to process the image data and environmental data (Fig. 7) captured every
    2.5 min. During analysis, the Image Processing VI would reference the greenhouse
    environmental data for the specific image. The image was uploaded from the file
    storage and corrected for lens distortion and a filtered to reduce analog signal
    noise that was caused by the uncooled TIR camera sensor and transmission of analog
    video signal. A variance filter within LabVIEW, which uses classical statistical
    technique called interclass variance, was found to reduce analog noise that could
    cause inconsistent temperature measurement. Within each image, the stem and leaf
    vegetation was identified using multiple ROIs on each plant sample that were manually
    set based on a plant’s location within the image. Between the multiple ROIs, an
    average temperature was calculated for the stem and leaf vegetation for each plant
    sample. Throughout the four isolated growth periods, ROIs were manually re-designated
    to account for vegetation growth in height and leaf development to capture the
    upper canopy (representing the last and previous to last developed leaf) leaf
    temperatures of plants in each irrigation regime. Download : Download high-res

    (shown in green) and reference panels (shown in orange). Automated TIRIS segmented
    individual corn foliage from background soil, cement, and pot containers. Black
    pixels indicate a cold surface while white pixels indicate hot surface. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) During the growth stages, the plants’ pots were
    repositioned and oriented to reduce leaf overlap and keep each plant’s canopy
    visible and limit overlap. ROIs were also designated on each reference panels
    in order to extract reference panel pixel intensities. In addition, ROIs were
    used to look at spatial temperatures differences from the stem and leaf. This
    allowed comparisons between the predicted stem and air temperature deficit versus
    VPD and the predicted canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD. 2.5. Crop
    water stress monitoring Because previous studies have found crop stress to be
    highest at periods following solar noon, vegetation temperature measurements from
    12:00 to 17:00 h were utilized for peak canopy temperatures (Cohen et al., 2014,
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013, Idso et al., 1977). Relative humidity, air temperature,
    solar radiance, and crop temperatures were combined to calculate instantaneous
    crop water stress corresponding to each image. In all measurements, the VPD (Eq.
    (6)) was calculated from the air temperature and relative humidity (Monteith and
    Unsworth, 2013) and VPD was used to deduce a non-water stressed baseline (NWSB)
    leaf canopy and air temperature deficit from VPD for solar radiation greater than
    100 W/m2 as defined in Eq. (7). (6) where Tair = measured air temperature (°C),
    RH = relative humidity (%), and VPD = vapor pressure deficit (kPa). (7) where
    Tww canopy = well-watered canopy temperature (°C), a = crop specific intercept
    for NWSB, and b = crop specific slope for NWSB. NWSB coefficients were empirically
    measured from RT canopy temperatures of the well-watered irrigation regime (Tww
    canopy) over the full growing season starting with the germination and seedling
    stage (growth period 1), rapid growth stage (growth period 2), reproductive stage
    (growth period 3), and maturity stage (growth period 4). Previous studies have
    suggested that empirically determined NWSBs and WSBs that directly account for
    present net radiation, aerodynamic resistance, and the particular crop’s microclimate
    is a robust technique for determining CWSI (Ballester et al., 2013, Blonquist
    and Bugbee, xxxx, El-Shikha et al., 2007, Erdem et al., 2010, Fitzgerald et al.,
    2007, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008, Grant et al., 2007). With the addition of upper
    and lower baselines for predicted leaf temperature, the CWSI approach has been
    the most used index aboard all thermal sensing platforms in various climate regions
    because of the inclusion of VPD, solar radiation, and wind speed (Maes and Steppe,
    2012, Rodriguez et al., 2005). The RT CWSI was calculated as depicted in Eq. (8)
    (Idso et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson, 1982): (8) where ΔTpredicted
    = (Tww canopy − Tair), ΔTdry = (Tdry − Tair), and ΔT1 = (Tcanopy temperature −
    Tair). For example, water stressed leaf (Tdry) and non-water stress leaf (Tww
    canopy) boundary temperatures were 25 °C and 20 °C, respectively. Air temperature
    was 23 °C and actual leaf temperature was 22 °C. In this example, CWSI is 0.4.
    For comparison, daily CWSI values were calculated for each plant. An instantaneous
    CWSI was derived using air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiance
    for each thermal image. Because wet and dry leaves are not practical within a
    prolonged monitoring study, wet reference temperatures were empirically found
    using well-watered plants in the WW regime. Similarly, standardized dry reference
    temperature of 5 °C above air temperature was utilized to respresent the WSBs
    (upper leaf temperature bounds) as suggested in previous studies (Alves and Pereira,
    2000, Cohen et al., 2005, Erdem et al., 2010, Moller et al., 2007, Moran et al.,
    1994, Wanjura et al., 2006). Empirical NWSBs (lower leaf temperatures) were determined
    using WW regime leaf temperatures in order to develop RT CWSI values. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Radiometric measurement accuracy The TIRIS was designed to
    quantify absolute surface temperature with RT radiometric calibration, thereby
    maintaining measurement accuracy by compensating for environmental influences
    from air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiance, and temperature of the
    uncooled TIR camera. RT radiometric calibration to implement environmental correction
    with temperature reference panels provided temperature measurement accuracy of
    0.62 °C in the semi-controlled greenhouse environment (Fig. 8). RT temperature
    measurement accuracy at the 95% confidence was found to less than 0.62 °C between
    noon and 18:00 hrs (Fig. 9) which has shown to be a better time to capture water
    stress (Colaizzi et al., 2012). As a result, the TIRIS has shown to be able to
    repeatedly measure the absolute temperature of the target surfaces. In application,
    this enables the ability of users to spatially monitor crop vegetation temperatures
    throughout the day without a loss of measurement accuracy. The reference panels
    provided adequate means to develop and utilize thermometric calibration curves
    to assign quantitative temperature values to relative pixel intensities. Similar
    system to calibrate TIRIS in the field could be utilized when implementing this
    system for mapping whole field canopy temperatures. However, further research
    needs to be conducted to understand feasibility of one-time calibration as RT
    calibration would not be feasible, and the dynamic accuracy of TIRIS under diverse
    ambient conditions during field operation. Download : Download high-res image

    air temperature deficit versus VPD were plotted for the four growth stages (Fig.
    10). Regression curves were fitted for data on each of the four stages to derive
    a (intercept) and b (slope) coefficients (Table 2) and develop non-water stressed
    base lines (Fig. 11) to calculate CWSI. The R2 values of the plots in Fig. 10
    shows that a correlation existed between the VPD and the predicted leaf canopy
    temperature. Lower plot R2 values during the last three growth stages could be
    attributed to the increased number of data samples from a VPD of 0 to 2 kPa. The
    WW vegetation temperatures calculated from the canopy and air temperature deficit
    versus VPD linear regression curves were also utilized to calculate CWSI illustrated
    in Fig. 13, Fig. 14. The VPD value concentrations may not be as prevalent during
    actual field applications and could provide stronger correlations as were observed
    during this study (Fig. 10). These results demonstrated that the canopy and air
    temperature deficit regression curve only slightly changed from the first growth
    period (GP1) to the second growth period (GP2). As suggested in Table 1, the recommended
    daily water use showed a peak followed by a decline in water use during the third
    growth stage. Similarly, during the third growth period (GP3), predicted leaf
    temperatures were warmer, suggesting that corn uses less energy for transpiration
    as the plant utilized more energy to grow fruit during the reproductive growth
    stage. Finally, reduced water uptake resulted in warmer leaf canopy temperatures
    during the final growth stage (GP4) closely resembling characteristic water use
    specified in Table 1. As a result, future studies using high spatial and temporal
    resolution TIRIS should be investigated in order to observe the full-season leaf
    canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPDs of corn in actual field conditions
    for more accurate non-water stressed base lines and predict CWSI. Download : Download

    image Fig. 11. Predicted canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD through
    four growth stages. Aside from segmenting soil and background temperatures from
    vegetation, the stem and leaf temperatures were isolated from within the FOV using
    location based ROIs. The canopy and air temperature deficit was compared to the
    stem-to-air temperature deficit versus VPD, as shown in Fig. 12. These values
    were collected throughout the full-season and represent the WW plant sample average.
    The canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD produced a stronger correlation
    (R2 = 0.7364) versus the stem-to-air temperature deficit versus VPD (R2 = 0.6592).
    This observation supports the use of the VPD to better predict the NWSB canopy
    temperature. The results suggested that plant canopy is a better indicator of
    leaf transpiration and would be beneficial for future studies. For practical adoption
    purposes, measuring the canopy temperature aboard different sensing platforms
    would be less of a challenge because the canopy typically has a large surface
    area and is the uppermost point on the plant. At the same time, being the uppermost
    portion of the plant, the canopy is more exposed to environmental conditions,
    thereby is susceptible to larger diurnal temperature changes. As a result, temporal
    environmental monitoring that is capable of measuring subtle changes in the crop
    microclimate will limit error in crop-based water stress assessment. Download

    the soil moisture versus CWSI from a CWSI value of 0.6 to 1.0 and no significant
    correlation from a CWSI value of 0 to 0.6. 3.3. Spatial and temporal crop water
    stress The high spatial monitoring capability of the TIRIS provided a real-time
    CWSI to be applied to each image (Fig. 13). As the water stress progressed in
    the WS plants, the spatial CWSI analysis showed that crop water stress vary depending
    on the location within the corn plant structure. In Fig. 13c, a majority of the
    WS canopy have a CWSI value of 1 whereas the lower leaves have a CWSI near 0.5.
    In comparison, the WW plants have leaf tips with a CWSI value of 1; yet, the lower
    leaves have a CWSI near 0. ROI segmentation for each plant extracted the upper
    and lower leaf CWSI to calculate an average CWSI within each treatment. In the
    greenhouse the plants were positioned to limit overlap and error as they grew
    with the nadir camera view. Therefore, predefined ROIs were practical in the fixed
    imaging system. In field applications, plants would grow and move in/out of ROIs
    during the growing season which could cause measurement error. As a result, real-time
    ROIs could serve for better temperature extraction if only vegetation could be
    segmented from the background by accurately defining ROIs. To capture real-time
    ROIs, a combination of visible and thermal camera systems could provide image
    segmentation of only green vegetation. The inclusion of background or non-leaf
    portion of thermal image could cause deviation in actual canopy temperature as
    the background temperature around solar noon would be much higher. This would
    cause false high CWSI values. In addition to extracting only green vegetation,
    the critical spatial resolution (on-target pixel resolution) is important when
    considering the accuracy of the pixel segmentation in order to limit inaccurate
    temperature measurement with edge pixels that are a combination of green vegetation
    and background. This could also include to segment sunlit versus shaded vegetation
    by creating a visible image mask in order to extract only green, sunlit leaf temperatures
    for advanced image analysis to map canopy temperatures. The daily peak CWSI and
    soil moisture of the WS and WW irrigation regimes in the critical time period
    between 12:00 and 18:00 h is presented in Fig. 14a. The daily soil moisture measurements
    revealed a soil moisture deficit occurred from day 15 through day 50 in the WS
    regime. On day 50, the WS plants were watered in order to preserve them and to
    observe the WS plants’ response to irrigation following severe water stress. Peak
    CWSI of the WS corn did not, however, decrease until day 52. This observation
    is important when interpreting and utilizing CWSI values for irrigation decisions
    because, immediately after watering, plants may have received an ample amount
    of water but did not have sufficient time to absorb water and transpire, thereby
    still reflecting a high CWSI. The level of crop water stress prior to irrigation
    seems to influence the amount of time required for the plants to absorb and transpire
    thus decreasing their CWSI. Further temporal studies should be considered in order
    to quantify this time response. As shown in Fig. 13, the variability within the
    canopy geometry and architecture adds complexity to measuring CWSI. The spatial
    and temporal CWSI monitoring ability of the TIRIS showed that the time of day
    and spatial location can produce differing level of measured crop stress. Results
    from this study exhibited that the daily peak crop water stress occurred between
    13:30 and 15:00 h. In actual field conditions, peak crop water stress could occur
    at different times depending on current environmental conditions. As shown in
    Fig. 14b, soil moisture content at or above 72% (y1 linear regression curve intercept)
    maintained a CWSI value below 0.6 whereas soil moisture content below 72% negatively
    correlated with CWSI values above 0.6. Results from the 80-day study revealed
    that 82% (R2 = 0.8152 of the y2 linear regression curve) of soil moisture variation
    was explained by a CWSI above 0.6. This was also evident from the data showing
    the relationship between the daily peak CWSI and soil moisture of the WS and WW
    irrigation regimes. This relationship demonstrated the use of non-contact thermal
    sensing to indirectly measure soil moisture. The results also suggested that CWSI
    values could be further studied in order to quantify spatial soil moisture deficits
    as an alternative irrigation scheduling method instead of soil moisture probes.
    4. Conclusion Thermography provided an unprecedented opportunity to study crop
    vegetation with both high spatial (i.e., sub-centimeter) and temporal (minute-to-minute)
    resolution for new and advanced relationships. As observed from this study, thermal
    imaging systems could be considered for measuring crop water stress at high spatial
    and temporal resolutions required for managing irrigation water within large agricultural
    production systems. Simplification of image acquisition systems in order to capture
    full-season crop stress could allow producers, agricultural service providers,
    and researchers to have thermal sensing technology sensitive to crop water requirements
    for management decisions, leading to more efficient allocation of available resources
    for precision agriculture. Future studies using TIRIS needs to be conducted to
    assess in-season crop water status on field scale level. Due to thermography’s
    particular use in non-agricultural roles such as industrial maintenance and limited
    agricultural research studies, this study was conducted to prove the utility of
    small, lightweight uncooled TIR cameras for prolonged agricultural applications.
    A TIRIS was developed for high spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of corn
    in order to observe crop stress from water deficits with concurrent soil moisture
    measurements in a greenhouse. The lightweight, low cost, and small size of the
    uncooled TIR camera used in this study maintained a measurement accuracy below
    ±0.62 °C (α = 0.05) within a greenhouse. In addition, a stronger relationship
    was found regarding the predicted canopy and air temperature deficit versus VPD
    (R2 = 0.7364) compared to the predicted stem-to-air temperature deficit versus
    VPD (R2 = 0.6592). Empirical NWSBs revealed that crop canopy temperature changed
    slightly throughout growth stages. Results indicated that canopy water deficit
    regression curves closely follow the characteristic water use throughout corn
    growth stages. Results from the 80-day study (Fig. 14b) revealed that a significant
    decrease in soil moisture was measured only when the CWSI value increased past
    0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI. As observed, the
    CWSI was negatively correlated to soil moisture supporting the use of the CWSI
    as an alternate irrigation scheduling method in order to quantify spatial soil
    moisture by remotely measuring canopy temperature. Acknowledgements This project

    Get rights and content Highlights • The PRI550, WI, OSAVI, WI/NDVI were the most
    sensitive indices for water stress estimation in tomato plants. • The PRI550 is
    an improvement over the PRI570 in detecting water stress in greenhouse grown tomatoes.
    • The use of reflectance indices provides an automated, non-destructive estimate
    of plant water status. • Reflectance indices have potentials to improve irrigation
    water management of tomato plants. Abstract Innovations in irrigation water management
    are required to optimize agricultural water use in water stressed regions of the
    world, and physiological response of plants to water stress is an important criterion.
    Remotely sensed plant stress indicators, based on the visible and near-infrared
    spectral regions, provide an alternative to traditional field measurements of
    plant stress parameters, as this provides information about the spatial and temporal
    variability of crops and soil. The present study is a proof of concept on the
    feasibility of using narrow-band hyperspectral derived indices for monitoring
    water stress in tomato plants (Solanum Lycopersicum L.). Spectral reflectance
    data were acquired from tomato plants, with five different irrigation regimes
    namely 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20% of plant available water, in a completely randomized
    design. Also, plant water stress indicators including canopy temperature (Tc)
    and relative leaf water content (RWC), as well as volumetric soil moisture content
    (SMC) were concurrently measured with spectral data acquisition. Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), Optimized
    Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index centered
    at 570 nm (PRI570), normalized PRI (PRInorm), Water Index (WI), and Normalized
    Water Index (NWI) were computed from the spectral data. The relationships between
    canopy reflectance and water stress indicators were analyzed at different water
    stress levels. The result showed that the PRI centered at 550 nm wavelength (PRI550),
    WI, OSAVI, and WI/NDVI were the most sensitive indices to distinguish water stress
    levels in tomato plants. This study provides an insight into the feasibility of
    using spectral vegetation indices to monitor water stress in tomato crops for
    precision irrigation water management. Previous article in issue Next article

    indicesHyperspectral data 1. Introduction Current irrigation scheduling techniques
    depend mainly on in-situ soil moisture measurements, weather-related variables,
    and physiological measurements of plant response to crop water stress (Ihuoma
    and Madramootoo, 2017). However, these methods are time consuming, labor intensive,
    and are limited in accounting for variability in soil and crop canopy conditions.
    Idso et al. (1978) stated that irrigation scheduling can be improved by monitoring
    the plant water status directly, rather than depending solely on soil water content
    measurements or estimates of evapotranspiration. Water stress induces stomatal
    closure, which reduces the transpiration rate, thus decreasing evaporative cooling
    and increasing leaf temperature. The increase in leaf temperature was earlier
    suggested (Idso et al., 1981) as a method of tracking water stress using infrared
    thermometers. More recently, high-resolution airborne thermal sensors flown over
    orchard crops detected differences in canopy temperature linked to water stress
    levels (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). The concept has been used in practice to monitor
    crop water stress and schedule irrigation of crops with great success as shown
    by González-Dugo et al. (2006), and O’Shaughnessy et al. (2012). However, various
    physiological concerns necessitated the investigation of alternative narrow-band
    hyperspectral indices for detecting crop water stress (Dangwal et al., 2015).
    For instance, increase in evaporative demands as a result of high vapor pressure
    deficits may induce a continuous decline in stomatal conductance, even when the
    plants were well watered (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Again, leaf temperature,
    though a direct indicator of plant transpiration, did not directly account for
    other physiological changes such as photosynthetic pigment changes or non-stomatal
    reductions of photosynthesis under water stress conditions (Zarco-Tejada et al.,
    2013). Therefore, remotely sensed stress indicators that are based on visible
    and near-infrared spectral regions, which have high spatial and spectral resolutions
    that are difficult to obtain in the thermal regions, are of interest. The interest
    in reflectance indices is to use them to scale-up to satellite imagery since the
    use of thermal imagery may be limited by its poor resolution and mixed information
    obtained from the plant and the soil background (Gago et al., 2015). Several optical
    reflectance indices such as Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI570), Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI),
    normalized PRI (PRInorm), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), Water
    Index (WI), WI/NDVI, and Normalized Water Index (NWI) have been investigated for
    predicting plant water status. A comprehensive review of the reflectance indices
    for monitoring crop water stress and scheduling irrigation has been detailed by
    Ihuoma and Madramootoo, 2017, Katsoulas et al., 2016. In spite of these studies,
    a general agreement on the use of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) for crop water
    stress monitoring is yet to be reached due to numerous confounding factors (such
    as canopy structure, soil background, leaf thickness, and leaf surface properties)
    affecting the VIs at plant canopy levels. Narrow-band optical indices for detecting
    water stress and scheduling irrigation has been extensively investigated for tree
    and cereal crops grown under open field conditions (Dangwal et al., 2015, Evanidi
    et al., 2017, Magney et al., 2016, Panadiga et al., 2014, Rossini et al., 2013).
    However, there is little reported work on high value vegetable crops grown under
    greenhouse conditions (Ihuoma and Madramootoo, 2019). The findings of the open
    field studies are not applicable for irrigation scheduling in greenhouse grown
    vegetables (Katsoulas et al., 2016), because the VIs threshold for monitoring
    plant water status is crop and climate specific. Therefore, it is essential to
    assess spectral VIs for supporting precision irrigation to improve yields of greenhouse
    grown vegetable crops. The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility
    of using VIs to detect water stress for optimizing irrigation water use efficiency
    in tomato crops grown under greenhouse conditions. Specifically, the objectives
    were to: (i) evaluate and compare various spectral VIs for monitoring water stress
    in tomato plants; (ii) test different PRI formulations for detecting water stress
    in tomato plants, by changing the normalization bands from 530 nm to 570 nm; and
    (iii) determine the relationship between VIs and tomato water stress. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Experimental design and irrigation treatments This study was
    carried out in the greenhouse at Macdonald Campus of McGill University, Ste Anne
    De Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. The study area lies at latitude 45.438 °N and longitude
    73.938 °W with an elevation of 36 m. The greenhouse has a dimension of 32 × 7 × 5 m,
    and was covered with single pane tempered glass, which allows about 95% of light
    transmission. The greenhouse roof was inclined at an angle of 37° to the horizontal.
    The cover material is not expected to influence the leaf spectral measurements
    and results, due to its high transmissivity. According to Shamshiri et al. (2018),
    change in light quality of about 10% would had no influence on plant biochemistry
    and photosynthetic activities. Ventilation in the greenhouse was regulated through
    automatically controlled vents (Argos Electronics, Athens, Greece), two side roll‐up
    windows, and a flap roof window. Heating was provided via aboveground PVC pipes
    and a fan coil located at a height of 2.6 m. Climate set points were; 24/14 °C
    for temperature (day/night), relative humidity of 78%, and CO2 partial pressure
    500 μbar. Picus tomato (Solanum lycopasicum L.) seedlings, 42-days old, were transplanted
    on August 6, 2016, into 25 pots (18-L each and one plant per pot) using soil from
    the Horticultural research centre of McGill University; the plants were harvested
    on December 24, 2016. Each of the pots has a depth of 32 cm and diameter of 27 cm.
    The soil was a sand clay loam with sand, silt, and clay content of 48, 22, and
    30% respectively (USDA-NRCS, 2000); field capacity of 33% and permanent wilting
    point of 17% by volume. The pots were placed on 330 × 150 × 150 mm bricks, which
    were randomly positioned in the greenhouse at a spacing of 0.6 m by 0.6 m. A tap
    was fixed to each of the pots so that excess water can drain out. The pots were
    saturated and allowed to drain out for 24 h so that the soil water content can
    be at field capacity before crops were transplanted. Drained water was collected
    by means of a measuring cylinder placed under each tap. The experiment was arranged
    in a completely randomised design with five (5) water treatment levels of 100,
    80, 60, 40, and 20% of plant available water. Irrigation applications were based
    on the plant available water (AWC), and the soil moisture content in each pot
    was continuously measured with soil moisture sensors. Upper irrigation threshold
    was set as the water treatment level in each treatment (100, 80, 60, 40, and 20%
    AWC) and lower irrigation threshold was at 10% AWC depletion for each treatment.
    Irrigation events commenced when soil moisture content for each pot depleted to
    its lower moisture threshold (10% AWC) and was terminated when the upper threshold
    was reached, as shown by the soil moisture sensors. The irrigation scheduling
    process for each plot was done throughout the growing season. The volume of water
    applied during each irrigation event to each pot was determined as the product
    of the irrigation duration and the flow rate per pot, while the equivalent irrigation
    depth applied at each irrigation event for each pot was determined as the product
    of the volumetric water content and the plant rooting depth. Irrigation water
    was applied through a drip system, with emitters placed in each pot. The drip
    system consists of pressure compensating emitters, with a discharge of 2 L/h,
    and the flow rates were calibrated in the greenhouse. The water application in
    each pot was regulated using water control valve attached to each dripper. When
    the required moisture content for each pot was achieved, irrigation was terminated
    for that pot by turning off the valve. Irrigation was uniformly applied to all
    treatments at the beginning of transplanting, based on 100% replenishment of water
    in the plant root zone to field capacity for plants to be well established; thereafter,
    variable rate irrigation was applied until harvest. Soil water contents at the
    five water treatment levels were replenished using continuous Time Domain Reflectometers
    (TDR) (CS625 water content reflectometer, Campbell Scientific Inc., UT) installed
    vertically at a depth of 30 cm in each pot, to correspond with the plant rooting
    depth (Jaria and Madramootoo, 2013). TDR readings were calibrated in the greenhouse
    with gravimetric soil moisture measurements, and the sensors were installed with
    the aid of an insertion guide following the procedures articulated in the Sentek
    manual (Sentek Sensor Technologies, 2003). The soil moisture sensors were connected
    to solar powered data loggers (model CR205/6, Campbell Scientific Inc.). The data
    was scanned every 5 min and recorded every 15 min¸ hourly and daily and was retrieved
    from the CR205/6 using a computer and Campbell Scientific Inc. LoggerNet software.
    Fertilizer applications were based on guidelines for greenhouse grown tomatoes
    at the Macdonald campus of McGill University. The plants were fertilized biweekly
    with 20-20-20 N-P-K water-soluble fertilizer, at a rate of 4 kg of N hectare−1.
    This was changed to calcium nitrate after the first fruits were noticed and was
    later changed to potassium nitrate when the fruits were approaching maturity.
    Fertilizer application was the same for all the treatments to avoid nutrient stress.
    2.2. Measurements Daily air temperature, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    deficit were measured in the greenhouse using a Campbell scientific psychrometer
    (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) installed about 1 m above the plant canopy. Evapotranspiration
    (ET) in the greenhouse was estimated during the growing season based on the soil
    moisture approach as shown in equation (1): (1) where : Soil water content today
    (mm), : Antecedent soil water content (mm), : Irrigation depth since yesterday
    (mm), : Drained water from the soil column (mm), : Crop evapotranspiration (mm),
    Soil water storage (ΔS). 2.2.1. Spectral data acquisition and processing A miniature
    fibre optic spectrometer (Blue-wave, Stellar Net Inc., FL, USA), which measures
    reflectance in the 200–1150 nm spectral range, was used to measure canopy reflectance.
    The spectrum is characterized by a 0.5 nm spectral resolution and was calibrated
    before each reading was taken. The calibration process involved holding the probe
    at 45° to a white standard (reference), at a distance of about 64 mm, to optimize
    the integration time (typically set at 50 ms), recording dark current, and then
    obtaining target reflectance. All canopy spectral measurements were taken under
    clear sky conditions between 10:00 and 15:00 h to ensure maximum solar intensity
    when the sun was shining directly on the plants, as adopted in a similar study
    (Zhao et al., 2017). The spectrometer was positioned at a height of 30 cm from
    the plant canopy so that it viewed only the plant canopy. Five leaves were measured
    in every pot and four scans were averaged in every measurement, considering four
    (north, south, east and west) viewing directions. The spectral data acquisition
    was conducted five times (16 and 21 September; 10, 18, and 25 October 2016), during
    the plant growing season and the data were used for spectral data calculation
    and estimation of vegetation indices. Due to the absorption of atmospheric water,
    signal background and light scattering effects, the spectral reflectance contains
    substantial interference noise (Zhao et al., 2017), which must be eliminated as
    it affects the smoothness of the spectral curve. The most commonly used smoothing
    algorithms include the moving average method, fitting polynomial method, wavelet
    transform and various regression smoothing methods. The 7-point weighted moving
    average method was used to smooth the spectral curve in this research, as adopted
    by Zhao et al. (2017). The spectral indices used in this study were obtained from
    the optical reflectance measurements from each treatment and are presented in
    Table 1. The reflectance indices used in this study were divided into three (3);
    the xanthophyll pigment indices related to photosynthetic pigment changes, the
    structural/greenness indices related to the canopy structure and biomass, and
    the water indices related to the water content of the plant. Table 1. Optical

    values at the indicated wavelengths in nm. 2.2.2. Measurement of plant stress
    indicators Leaf temperature was measured with handheld infrared thermometry set
    at emissivity of 0.95 W m−2 (Fluke 572 model, Fluke Corporation, Everett, WA).
    The instrument was held about 1.5 m above ground level and directed at the leaf
    of the tomato plant with a laser point of the instrument set at an angle about
    30° to the horizontal (Orta et al., 2002). Four infrared thermometer measurements
    were made when the plant canopy covered about 80% of the pot area. The temperature
    of the stressed and non-stressed plants was determined from canopy temperature
    data; four (north, south, east and west) viewing directions were considered and
    average temperature values obtained. Measurements were made between 11:30 h and
    14:00 h to ensure maximum solar intensity when the sun was shining directly on
    the plants. Relative water content (RWC) compares the water content of a leaf
    with the maximum water content at full turgor and was considered as an indicator
    of water status (Colombo et al., 2011). Leaf sampling was conducted on each treatment
    with the collection of the youngest fully expanded leaf from each plant. The leaf
    samples were enclosed in a sealed plastic bag and kept in a cooler at 5 °C until
    they reached the laboratory. Fresh weight (FW) was recorded using an analytical
    balance, and the samples were immersed in distilled water for 72 h, blotted and
    weighed to obtain the turgid weight (TW). Finally, leaf samples were dried at
    72 °C in an oven, until constant dry weight (DW) was reached. The RWC was calculated
    according to Equation (3), as adopted by similar studies on crop water stress
    (Wang et al., 2015). (3) 2.3. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were carried
    out on vegetation indices (NDVI, OSAVI, RDVI, PRI570, PRI550, PRInorm, WI, and
    NWI), stress indicators (Tc, RWC, and SMC), total marketable yield, Irrigation
    Water Use Efficiency (IWUE) and water applied for each treatment using a regression
    analysis and PROC/GLM (General Linear Model) procedure of SAS software (version
    9.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    was conducted, and significance of differences among treatments were separated
    using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) at a 5% probability level. Values
    of vegetation indices were related to values of RWC, Tc, SMC, and yield of each
    of the treatments using linear regression. 3. Results 3.1. Crop evapotranspiration
    and applied irrigation water Mean daily air temperature, humidity, and vapour
    pressure deficit in the greenhouse ranged from 19 to 28 °C, 60 to 86%, and 0.31
    to 1.51 KPa, respectively, during the growth period. The crop evapotranspiration
    was higher during the flowering and maturity stages of plant growth, as these
    correspond to the periods when the crops need more water for their physiological
    development. The ETc increased generally with irrigation water amount and the
    total seasonal ETc ranged from approximately 197 to 321 mm. The total water applied
    for each treatment ranged from 73 to 230 mm during the growth period, as shown
    in Table 2. The difference between the ETc and total water applied represent water
    storage in the pot. Table 2. Water applied (mm) for tomato plants per growth stage

    Soil water content Volumetric soil water content for the various water treatment
    levels are presented in Fig. 1. A comparison of different water stress conditions
    showed that soil water content was low in high stressed conditions. Soil water
    content generally decreased with decreasing water application, with 100 and 20%
    AWC resulting in the highest and lowest values of soil water content, respectively.
    Soil water content remained relatively low for 20, 40, and 60% AWC treatments
    due to insufficient supplementary irrigation, while the soil water content for
    100% AWC treatment was kept at a high level during the growing season. The 100%
    AWC treatment was not significantly different from the 80% AWC treatment but reached
    the highest yield. Download : Download high-res image (375KB) Download : Download

    levels during the growing season. 3.3. Yield and irrigation water use efficiency
    Effects of the irrigation treatments on marketable yields and Irrigation Water
    Use Efficiency (IWUE) are shown in Table 3. The total marketable yield ranged
    from 0.46 to 2.28 kg plant−1, for 20 and 100% AWC treatments, respectively. The
    highest mean marketable yield was obtained from 100% AWC treatment (1.83 kg plant−1)
    while the least mean marketable yield was obtained from 20% AWC treatment (0.40 kg
    plant−1). The average yield from the full irrigation treatment (100% AWC) was
    statistically different from the yields obtained from the 60, 40, and 20% AWC
    treatments, but not significantly different from the yield obtained from 80% AWC.
    This indicates that water stress caused significant declines in crop yield, at
    p < 0.05. Table 3. Effects of irrigation treatments on Marketable yield (kg plant−1)

    not significantly different at p = 0.05. Reported values are averages of five
    replicates. The IWUE was calculated as the ratio between marketable yield (kg
    plant−1) and total volume of water applied (m3). The highest IWUE value (17.83 kg m−3)
    was recorded with 80% AWC, as shown in Table 3, but this is not statistically
    different from the IWUE value obtained from 100% AWC. Both the 100% and 80% AWC
    values were different from the other water treatments. Water stress less than
    80% AWC treatment caused an evident decrease in crop yield, as shown in Table
    3. The IWUE is important for most crops as it indicates the optimal use of water
    in agriculture (Rinaldi et al., 2015). 3.4. Crop reflectance Examples of spectral
    signature of the plant canopy obtained from the crop reflectance values, which
    was measured with a portable spectrometer, are presented in Fig. 3(a). The leaf
    reflectance in the five water treatments showed similar trends during the entire
    growth stage and varied among irrigation treatments. However, the spectral response
    for water stress was more evident in the flowering and early maturity stages,
    because the plants are more sensitive to water stress at these stages. Thus, hyperspectral
    reflectance in the flowering and early maturity stages were used to identify the
    water stress levels. The spectral reflectance curves show peaks near 550 nm and
    668 nm, and trough near 680 nm, and follow a similar pattern for each of the treatments,
    with the 100% AWC and 20% AWC recording the lowest and highest reflectance values
    in the visible spectral range (400–700 nm), respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b).

    calculation of spectral vegetation indices presented in Table 1. The response
    of various vegetation indices to water stress in tomato plants is shown in Fig.
    3. Statistical analysis of the indices revealed that PRI550, WI, OSAVI, WI/NDVI
    were significantly related to water stress in tomato plants, while NDVI, RDVI,
    and PRInorm showed no significant differences among various water stress levels.
    There is no significant difference between 100% AWC and 80% AWC for most of the
    indices, as shown in Fig. 4. However, there was significance difference when the
    AWC depletes below 20%, in all the reflectance indices. This shows that the identified
    indices successfully detected high water stress in the plants. Download : Download

    stress detection using optical reflectance indices were tested using the reflectance
    indices specified in Table 1. The selected indices were separately correlated
    to canopy temperature, relative water content, yield, and soil water content,
    which were concurrently measured at the time of spectral data acquisition. From
    the results, the structural indices (NDVI, OSAVI, RDVI) were significantly correlated
    with Tc (R2 = 0.51, p < 0.01; 0.40, p < 0.05; 0.59, p < 0.05; respectively), and
    with RWC (R2 = 0.41, p < 0.05; 0.48, p < 0.05; 0.61, p < 0.01; respectively).
    Table 4 summarized the coefficient of determination of the linear relationship
    between vegetation indices and plant stress parameters, under different water
    stress levels. The results indicate that the correlations between structural indices
    and crop yield were significant (R2 = 0.65, p < 0.001; and 0.60, p < 0.001; for
    OSAVI and RDVI, respectively). The results of the relationships between spectral
    vegetation indices and volumetric water content indicated that NDVI, OSAVI, and
    RDVI were significantly related to volumetric soil moisture content (R2 = 0.89,
    p < 0.05; 0.88, p < 0.01; and 0.86, p < 0.05; respectively). Table 4. Coefficient

    The xanthophyll pigment indices correlated differently with the various stress
    parameters. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between vegetation indices and canopy
    temperature obtained from the various treatments. The PRI550 showed significant
    correlation with all the measured plant stress indicators, with R2 = 0.66, p < 0.01;
    0.69, p < 0.001; 0.81, p < 0.05; and 0.67, p < 0.0001; for the RWC, Tc, SWC, and
    yield, respectively. The PRI570 was weakly correlated to all the measured stress
    parameters, with R2 = 0.21, 0.38, 0.47, and 0.39 for the RWC, Tc, SWC, and yield,
    respectively. However, the correlation between PRI570 and the measured water stress
    indicators were not statistically significant at p < 0.05, as shown in Table 4.
    The PRI550 showed the highest correlation with crop yield (R2 = 0.67, p < 0.0001),
    which indicates that water stress adversely affected the photosynthetic activities
    of the plants, leading to reduced crop yield. The PRInorm showed high correlation
    with relative water content (R2 = 0.86, p < 0.0001), as shown in Fig. 5, which
    indicates high sensitivity to plant water stress and implies that water stress
    induced changes in xanthophyll pigment. The index generates a normalization that
    considers the chlorophyll content using the red edge index (R700/R670), which
    is sensitive to chlorophyll content, and canopy leaf area reduction (RDVI) induced
    by stress. Also, the index showed a good correlation with soil moisture content
    (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.05), but was less correlated with Tc (R2 = 0.31, p < 0.05) and
    yield (R2 = 0.35, p < 0.05). Download : Download high-res image (343KB) Download

    at p < 0.05; but was weakly correlated to Tc, with R2 = 0.42, p < 0.05 (Table
    4). The WI/NDVI showed significant correlation with RWC (R2 = 0.54, p < 0.05),
    Tc (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.001), but was not significantly related to SMC and crop yield
    (Table 4). Fig. 6 showed that the various treatment levels had significant differences
    in Tc, with the non-stress and fully-stressed treatments recording the least and
    highest Tc values. Consequently, the magnitude of Tc was greater in non-irrigated
    plants. RDVI showed a significant correlation with Tc (R2 = 0.59, p < 0.01), and
    this could imply that changes in canopy structure occurred as a result of water
    stress. Fig. 6 also revealed that the RWC were significantly different among the
    various water treatment levels. The non-stressed and fully-stressed treatments
    recorded the highest and lowest RWC. Again, the PRI550 had a significant positive
    correlation with RWC (R2 = 0.67, p < 0.01). However, the renormalized PRI (PRInorm)
    showed the best correlation with RWC (R2 = 0.86, p < 0.0001), indicating a correlation
    with xanthophyll pigments and the carotenoid content. The correlation between
    the leaf relative water content and canopy temperature was analyzed, and the result
    is shown in Fig. 7. The analysis showed a strong correlation between the leaf
    relative water content and canopy temperature, with R2 = 0.93 (p < 0.0001). The
    graph revealed that leaf relative water content increased linearly with decreasing
    leaf temperature. Download : Download high-res image (145KB) Download : Download

    water stress on yield and IWUE The analysis of the results showed that there were
    no significant differences in yield and IWUE for 80% and 100% AWC treatments.
    Though the 100% AWC treatment reached the highest yield, the 80% AWC treatment
    recorded the highest IWUE. The study implies that the 80% AWC is best suited for
    optimizing water use of tomato plants, and could be adopted in water scarce regions,
    where optimization of water is paramount. The result is consistent with the findings
    of Hartz et al. (2005), which indicated that tomatoes can tolerate a moderate
    degree of stress, with about 20–30% depletion in available soil moisture in the
    plant root zone without significant yield loss. Soil moisture depletion levels
    during the entire growth periods of tomato plants should remain below 30% of available
    soil moisture content to avoid yield loss. The most severe water stress (20% AWC)
    resulted in a yield loss of 61%, compared to the highest yield. Water application
    at 60% AWC resulted in a yield loss of 30% compared to the highest yield, and
    this justifies the application of supplementary irrigation to water stressed plants.
    Again, a prolonged water stress may alter the plant physiological and biochemical
    processes leading to nutrients deficiency to the crop (Silva et al., 2011). However,
    the soil nutrient content was regularly replenished during the experiment to ensure
    that the results of this study are the single effect of water stress and not the
    combined effect of nutrients and water stress. Our findings are in tandem with
    the findings of similar studies (Jaria and Madramootoo, 2013, Petropoulos et al.,
    2019) that water stress adversely affected physiological and photosynthetic activities
    of tomato plants. 4.2. Effects water treatment on spectral reflectance The stressed
    plants showed increased reflectance values within the visible range, and this
    is consistent with the fact that healthy plants absorb more visible light for
    photosynthesis, thereby having lower reflectance values. The reflectance in the
    blue and red regions of the VIS region, shown in Fig. 2(b), were significantly
    high at high water stress level, which suggests that leaf water deficit reduces
    photosynthetic pigment concentration. The result indicates that the reflectance
    in the VIS region is largely influenced by primary photosynthetic pigments. The
    results of this study indicated that the irrigation treatments implemented in
    this experiment triggered a moderate to severe water stress on the plants, as
    reflected in the yields of the stressed and non-stressed plants. Plants irrigated
    with reduced amounts of water responded with stomatal closure, detected by an
    increase in Tc. When plants are water stressed, osmotic adjustment may prevent
    dehydration of leaf cells for some time, thus not instantly affecting the plant
    turgor pressure. However, if plants can no longer cope with water stress, they
    will become dehydrated leading to a decrease in leaf cell turgor detected as a
    reduction of leaf RWC (Rossini et al., 2013). Generally, water stressed plants
    have increased leaf temperature (Idso et al., 1981) and reduced leaf water content
    compared to non-stressed plants. Therefore, leaf relative water content has been
    used to indicate plant water stress and schedule irrigation (Colombo et al., 2011,
    Wang et al., 2015), especially for strongly isohydric crops (such as tomatoes),
    which maintain a constant leaf water status over a wide range of evaporative demand
    (Limpus, 2009). 4.3. Effects of water stress on vegetation indices An evaluation
    of various VIs for detecting water stress in tomato based on Tc revealed that
    the PRI550 had the best correlation with canopy temperature. This result agrees
    with previous studies, which confirmed the sensitivity of PRI to water stress
    (Berni et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). Generally, water treatments affected
    leaf physiological processes in a different way during the growing season. The
    results reveal that the PRI550 was best related to all the indicators of water
    stress measured in this study (RWC, Tc, and yield). This can be explained by the
    functional relationship between these eco-physiological indicators of water stress.
    At the beginning of water stress, RWC decreases, stomata close and Tc increases
    concurrently with a decline of photosynthesis (Prasad et al., 2008). The PRI570,
    proposed in a previous study (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012), showed weaker correlations
    with all the leaf physiological indicators tested in this study. This indicates
    that the index is not suitable for detecting water stress in greenhouse grown
    tomato plants. Although some recent studies demonstrated that PRI can also be
    related to water potential and stomatal conductance, canopy temperature generally
    showed the highest correlations. The link between PRI and Tc is likely due to
    the role of the xanthophyll pigments in dissipating excess heat arising under
    stressed conditions. Specifically, PRI with reference wavelength of 550 nm (PRI550)
    showed the best correlation with water stress indicators and performed better
    than PRI570 (reference wavelength of 570 nm), which has been used by several researchers,
    for estimating xanthophyll pigment changes under water stress conditions (Gamon
    et al., 1997, Suárez et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2015). However, the results by
    these researchers showed the sensitivity of PRI570 for detecting crop water stress
    over short time scales, whereas studies conducted over longer time scales reported
    contrasting results, at the leaf and canopy scales (Gamon, 2015, Magney et al.,
    2016). The result of our research is consistent with the original study on photochemical
    reflectance indices by Gamon et al. (1992), which reported a reference wavelength
    of 550 nm for monitoring crop water stress. The irrigation treatments executed
    in this experiment might have induced structural and morphological changes (e.g.
    changes in canopy structure, shape, leaf thickness) in the plants, detected by
    the variations in the structural indices with different water treatment levels.
    This could be the effect of prolonged water stress on the plants that affected
    the plant structure and physiological parameters. Previous researchers reported
    high correlation between the structural indices and biomass, chlorophyll, leaf
    area index, and yield (Koksal, 2011, Rinaldi et al., 2014). Jones (2004) explained
    that although NDVI may be a good indicator of nitrogen content and biomass, and
    it provided an approximate estimate of plant water status. Several studies showed
    that NDVI obtained a good correlation with plant water content (Genc et al., 2011,
    Kim et al., 2010), but this was not the case in our study. In their study, Kittas
    et al. (2016) explained that NDVI had better correlation with soil moisture content
    in greenhouse tomatoes, which is consistent with the findings of our study. Amatya
    et al. (2012) showed that NDVI in potato had high correlation with soil water
    content, as obtained in our experiment. Variations in soil moisture content affect
    the vegetation vigor, yield, and biomass production of plants, hence the highly
    significant correlations between the structural indices and soil moisture content.
    Usually, NDVI is not related to variations in environmental conditions such as
    VPD and air temperature, but it is strongly correlated to LAI and weakly correlated
    to stomatal conductance (Magney et al., 2016). The good correlation between water
    indices and RWC indicates that the indices increase with increasing RWC. This
    implies that water stress affected the water absorption in the mesophyll pigment
    of the plants. Typically, the reflectance trough in the near-infrared region at
    900–970 nm corresponds to the water absorption band, but the 970 nm trough disappears
    and shifts towards lower wavelengths when the plants are water stressed (Peñuelas
    et al., 1997). Our finding is consistent with previous studies (Genc et al., 2011,
    Katsoulas et al., 2016), which observed significant correlations between water
    indices and plant water content in several crops. This shows the possibility of
    mapping plant water status using reflectance indices for improving irrigation
    management. In all the reflectance indices that showed significant correlation
    with water stress indicators, there was a significant difference in these indices
    whenever the AWC depletes below 20%, which indicates that this method can be used
    for crop water stress detection under normal and extreme water stress conditions.
    5. Conclusion The work presented in this paper assessed the feasibility of using
    spectral vegetation indices to detect water stress in tomato plants. Water deficit
    induced in this experiment adversely affected crop yield, with yield decreasing
    as irrigation water decreased. Irrigation application below 80% AWC treatment
    caused significant yield loss of 30–60%. Our study showed that PRI550, WI, OSAVI,
    and WI/NDVI were the most sensitive indices to distinguish water stress levels
    in greenhouse grown tomato plants. Though previous studies suggested the use of
    PRI570 for monitoring water status of various field crops, our results have shown
    that PRI550 was better than PRI570 for detecting water stress in greenhouse grown
    tomatoes. It is important to note that leaf biophysical and biochemical effects
    on PRI during the growing season would affect the use of the index for measuring
    crop water stress. Nevertheless, monitoring crops using hyperspectral sensors
    may provide automated techniques for rapid, non-destructive, and reliable estimate
    of plant water status. Analysing these features in real time and providing qualitative
    and quantitative information to the growers can help them optimize agricultural
    water use for increased crop yield. Based on the findings of this study, it was
    difficult to select a single index for precise estimation of plant water status.
    Therefore, innovative data management techniques that would integrate various
    vegetation indices are needed to widen the scientific knowledge on crop stress
    monitoring and provide irrigators with precise indices for scheduling irrigation.
    Also, future research efforts should be geared towards the integration of thermal
    and narrow-band hyperspectral indices to provide more precise information about
    plant water status, and advanced data analysis techniques that would provide irrigators
    with an easily accessible and cost-effective tool for decision making. Acknowledgements

  title: Sensitivity of spectral vegetation indices for monitoring water stress in
    tomato plants
  verbatim_quote1: The use of reflectance indices provides an automated, non-destructive
    estimate of plant water status.
  verbatim_quote2: Near-infrared was used for all of the experiments, and was compared
    to other indices as well. The generalized reflectance index (GRI) was the most
    sensitive to drought stress for the scale-dependent vegetation indices, indicating
    a possible application of this index in discrimination of water stress in tomato
    plants from remote platforms.

    This bias is non-existent at site 2, where both modeled and observed fRET estimates

    9 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Irrigation in the Central Valley of California
    is essential for successful wine grape production. With reductions in water availability
    in much of California due to drought and competing water-use interests, it is
    important to optimize irrigation management strategies. In the current study,
    we investigate the utility of satellite-derived maps of evapotranspiration (ET)
    and the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (fRET) based on remotely sensed land-surface
    temperature (LST) imagery for monitoring crop water use and stress in vineyards.
    The Disaggregated Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse (ALEXI/DisALEXI) surface-energy
    balance model, a multi-scale ET remote-sensing framework with operational capabilities,
    is evaluated over two Pinot noir vineyard sites in central California that are
    being monitored as part of the Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration
    eXperiment (GRAPEX). A data fusion approach is employed to combine ET time-series
    retrievals from multiple satellite platforms to generate estimates at both the
    high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolution required for field-scale irrigation
    management. Comparisons with micrometeorological data indicate reasonable model
    performance, with mean absolute errors of 0.6 mm day−1 in ET at the daily time
    step and minimal bias. Values of fRET agree well with tower observations and reflect
    known irrigation. Spatiotemporal analyses illustrate the ability of ALEXI/DisALEXI/data
    fusion package to characterize heterogeneity in ET and fRET both within a vineyard
    and over the surrounding landscape. These findings will inform the development
    of strategies for integrating ET mapping time series into operational irrigation
    management framework, providing actionable information regarding vineyard water
    use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to multi-annual
    time scales. Similar content being viewed by others Improving the spatiotemporal

    in the California Central Valley Article 23 April 2022 Introduction Water management
    is a critical aspect of successful grape production in California’s Central Valley,
    which represents over 400,000 ha valued at approximately 6 billion dollars (California
    Department of Food and Agriculture and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service
    2016). Despite competing water-use interests and a reduction in water availability
    over much of California due to recent long-term droughts, vineyard acreage and
    production continues to increase, with acreage devoted to wine grapes increasing
    by 12,950 ha between years 2013 and 2016 (California Department of Food and Agriculture
    and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2017). As such, there is significant
    interest in developing efficient water management strategies for these viticulture
    production systems. The adoption of an appropriate and efficient irrigation strategy
    for a specific vineyard is predicated on understanding and controlling the vine
    water stress throughout the season (Girona et al. 2009; van Leeuwen et al. 2009;
    Basile et al. 2011). Moderate vine water stress, achieved through the practice
    of deficit irrigation can improve the composition/quality of grapes used in wine
    production (Williams and Matthews 1990; Williams et al. 1994). The standard indicator
    for vine water stress is the leaf water potential (ΨL), commonly measured using
    a pressure chamber. In some cases, pressure bomb measurements are used in scheduling
    irrigation for commercial vineyards (Girona et al. 2006). However, this practice
    requires individual leaf measurements, limiting its suitability for application
    over large heterogeneous areas. Techniques for mapping ΨL have been developed
    using high-resolution thermal imagery to isolate plant canopy temperatures (Bellvert
    et al. 2016). This technique could be used for mapping variability in vine stress
    across vineyards; however, it would be challenging to provide this information
    on a routine basis over large regions and may require calibration for different
    climates and vine varieties. An additional tool for monitoring water stress and
    use in vineyards is measurement of evapotranspiration (ET), which quantifies water
    loss from the vine and surface to the atmosphere. Numerous studies have explored
    various methods and techniques to measure vineyard ET or water use, including
    lysimeters (Johnson et al. 2005; Azevedo et al. 2008; Netzer et al. 2009), eddy
    covariance (Spano et al. 2000; Ortega-Farias et al. 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2010),
    heat pulse or heat balance (Trambouze et al. 1998; Yunusa et al. 1997; Intrigliolo
    et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010), surface renewal energy balance (Castellvi and
    Snyder 2010; Moratiel and Martinez-Cob 2012), Bowen ratio energy balance (Yunusa
    et al. 2004; Teixeira et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2011), soil water balance (Singleton
    and Maudsley 1996; Fooladmand and Sepaskhah 2009; Cancela et al. 2012), and the
    most common and simplest approach, the FAO-56 method (Allen et al. 1998). However,
    like the leaf water potential measurement method, these approaches simply provide
    point measurements that are difficult to extrapolate over larger areas or fields,
    and fail to indicate in-field spatial variability (Teixeira et al. 2007). Such
    spatial variability limits the effective use of irrigation water. Uniform irrigation
    across a vineyard with variable biomass and soil texture, implying differences
    in plant growth and water requirements, will result in the over- or under-watering
    in these anomalous sections within the vineyard. This will result in variability
    in vegetative growth across the vineyard, and result in non-uniform yield and
    grape composition/quality (Bramley and Hamilton 2004; Bramley et al. 2005; Bellvert
    et al. 2012). Errors are further compounded when extrapolating to vineyards outside
    the area of in-situ ET data collection. Satellite remote-sensing technology offers
    the possibility of providing routine spatial information useful for determining
    sub-field and inter-field-scale heterogeneity in plant conditions and water use.
    Satellite retrievals of land-surface temperature (LST), derived from thermal infrared
    (TIR) imagery, have been shown to be particularly useful for estimating ET and
    plant stress due to the sensitivity of soil and canopy temperatures to variable
    soil moisture availability (Moran 2003). Several TIR-based ET mapping algorithms
    have been developed over the past few decades (e.g., Bastiaanssen et al. 1998,
    Su 2002; Allen et al. 2007; Anderson et al. 1997). Due to significant uncertainties
    associated with determining accurate atmospherically and emissivity corrected
    surface temperature data, most TIR-based models use relative measures of LST variability
    to parameterize ET estimates rather than the absolute LST values (Anderson et
    al. 1997, 2012). This is accomplished either through using an end-member pixel
    scaling method (spatial variability) or a time-differential method (temporal variability).
    For example, the Surface-Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL; Bastiaanssen
    et al. 1998) and the Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration
    (METRIC; Allen et al. 2007) methods use TIR end-member pixels within a satellite
    image to represent limiting (minimal ET; hot pixel) and non-limiting (potential
    ET; cold pixel) moisture conditions. The Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI;
    Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b) surface-energy balance model uses the time-differential
    approach, relating changes in morning LST derived from geostationary satellites
    to surface moisture availability and latent heat flux. ALEXI is based on the Two-Source
    Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation originally described by Norman
    et al. (1995). The TSEB can also be used to downscale ALEXI fluxes to finer, sub-field
    scales using an associated flux disaggregation technique (DisALEXI; Norman et
    al. 2003). Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of TIR-based ET approaches
    for monitoring water use and stress within vineyards (Semmens et al. 2016; Xia
    et al. 2016). Specifically, Semmens et al. (2016) applied the ALEXI/DisALEXI modeling
    system, integrated with a data fusion methodology (Gao et al. 2006), to estimate
    daily ET at 30 m spatial resolution over two Pinot noir vineyards near Lodi in
    the Central Valley of California for the 2013 growing season, demonstrating good
    agreement with ground-based flux measurements. Moreover, Xia et al. (2016) evaluated
    TSEB model performance over these two vineyards at high spatial resolution (≤ 1
    m) using thermal and multispectral remote-sensing data from low-altitude aircraft
    over the same two vineyards. Results indicate that the TSEB can derive reliable
    ET patterns at sub-field scale under a wide range of environmental conditions.
    The current study expands upon results presented in Semmens et al. (2016), extending
    the analysis to multiple years to promote a comprehensive understanding of seasonal
    flux dynamics within the unique canopy architecture of vineyards, especially during
    the early spring season when timing of the initiation of irrigation and subsequent
    water-use estimates can have significant errors. In this study, daily 30 m ET
    maps over the Lodi vineyard landscape are evaluated over the period 2013–2016,
    including an extended period of severe drought when water resources in the Central
    Valley became increasingly limited. An analysis is also included on the ratio
    of actual-to-reference ET (fRET), an indicator of crop moisture and stress conditions,
    and its linkages on both spatial and temporal scales to criteria used in irrigation
    decision making. The current study aims to demonstrate the utility of remotely
    sensed ET and fRET mapping time series in support of an operational irrigation
    management framework, supplying reliable spatiotemporal information on vineyard
    water use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to annual
    time scales. Materials and methods Study area The model study domain includes
    two vineyard sites located in the Central Valley of California near the town of
    Lodi, using data collected as part of the USDA-ARS Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric
    Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) (Kustas et al. 2018). Both
    the northern (site 1) and the southern (site 2) vineyards are planted with Pinot
    noir vines trained on quadrilateral cordons with drip irrigation installed. Both
    sites have vine heights that vary between 2 and 2.5 m, with space between rows
    of 3.3 m, space between vines of 1.5 m, and an east–west row orientation. The
    northern site has an area of 35 ha with vines planted in 2009. The southern site
    is smaller and less mature, with an area of 21 ha and vines planted in 2011, resulting
    in lower biomass/leaf area than the northern field. In these plots, vines typically
    leaf out in late March, grow through late August, with grape harvest occurring
    in early September. Flux tower were installed in 2013 approximately half-way north–south
    along the eastern edge of each field, located to maximize fetch as the predominant
    wind direction is from the west during the growing season. These towers continue
    to operate through the 2017 growing season. Field measurements Micrometeorological
    and biological field measurements collected during GRAPEX are designed to serve
    as validation data for models developed to estimate ET and component vine and
    inter-row fluxes, detect stress, and monitor biomass development and root zone
    soil water availability. Both vineyards are equipped with identical micrometeorological
    instrumentation and started recording in late March of 2013. Measurements include
    turbulence and mean profile measurements of wind, surface-energy balance flux
    estimates, temperature and water vapor, as well as ground-based biophysical measurements
    such as leaf area index (LAI). The eddy covariance (EC) systems include a Campbell
    Scientific, Inc. EC150 water vapor/carbon dioxide sensor and a CSAT3 three-dimensional
    sonic anemometer. Both instruments are mounted 5 m above local ground level (a.g.l.)
    facing due west, collecting data at 20 Hz producing 15 min averages. Additional
    instrumentation includes a four-component radiometer (CNR-1, Kipp and Zonen, Delft,
    Netherlands) mounted 6 m a.g.l., upward and downward facing quantum sensors (LI-190,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) mounted 6 m a.g.l., a combined humidity and temperature
    sensor (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) mounted 5 m a.g.l., two thermal infrared
    thermometers (SI-111, Campbell Scientific) mounted 2.5 m a.g.l. used to measure
    both surface and canopy temperature, a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525, Texas
    Electronics, Dallas, Texas), and five soil heat flux plates (HFT-3, Radiation
    Energy Balance Systems, Bellevue, Washington) buried cross-row at a depth of 8
    cm. Each heat flux plate includes two thermocouples buried at depths of 2 and
    6 cm and a soil moisture sensor (HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring System,
    Portland, Oregon) buried at 5 cm depth. 1 Post-processing of the 20 Hz eddy covariance
    data for computing sensible and latent heat fluxes is described by Alfieri et
    al. (2018). Energy balance flux measurements used in this study were collected
    between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016. During this period, typical closure
    ratios were on the order of 0.91 for Site 1 and 0.88 for Site 2. Original and
    closure-adjusted latent heat flux (LE) measurements were compared to modeled LE
    estimates to determine degree of agreement between measured and modeled fluxes.
    Since daily totals are used for model validation, observed fluxes were corrected
    for closure errors using the residual (RE) method as opposed to Bowen Ratio (BR)
    method (which often yields spurious results for nighttime conditions) described
    in Twine et al. (2000). Measurements of water applied through irrigation began
    in 2015 and are made using an assemblage of pressure switches and Onset HOBO data
    loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA). Irrigation events are recorded
    as the time difference between the beginning and end of irrigation, with events
    lasting roughly 5 h on average between sites. The amount of irrigation applied
    in liters per vine is calculated using an average irrigation pump rate and vine/row
    spacing data provided by vineyard managers. Yield maps for 2013 through 2016 harvest
    in both north and south vineyards are provided by E&J Gallo Winery using Advanced
    Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, Australia) yield monitoring systems and a
    cleanup script used to convert mass flow units into tons per hectare, eliminate
    outliers, and normalized across harvesters. Yield data greater than three standard
    deviations from the mean are omitted. Yield maps are interpolated to a 3 m grid
    using Vesper Spatial Prediction Software for Precision Agriculture (Whelan et
    al. 2002). Multi-scale ET modeling system ALEXI The multi-scale ET modeling system
    used here downscales regional coarse-scale fluxes from the ALEXI surface-energy
    balance model (Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b; Mecikalski et al. 1999) to finer
    spatial scales. ALEXI exploits the high temporal resolution afforded by geostationary
    satellites to measure the morning rate of land-surface temperature (LST) rise,
    which is used to guide partitioning of the surface-energy budget. Time-differential
    LST measurements provide the added benefit of being less sensitive to errors in
    temperature retrieval due to atmospheric and emissivity correction (Anderson et
    al. 1997). ALEXI is based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, first
    developed by Norman et al. (1995), and later refined through improved parameterizations
    in Kustas and Norman (1999). The TSEB model partitions surface temperature into
    soil and vegetation components, which are then used to solve the surface-energy
    budget for the soil, canopy and combined system associated with the mixed scene:
    $$(R{n_s}+R{n_c}) - G=\left( {{H_s}+{H_c}} \right)+(\lambda {E_s}+\lambda {E_c}),$$
    where Rn is net radiation (W/m2), H is the sensible heat flux (W/m2), G is the
    soil heat flux (W/m2) and λE is the latent heat flux (W/m2). Subscripts ‘s’ and
    ‘c’ represent fluxes associated with the soil and canopy scene components, respectively.
    The TSEB uses an estimate of local vegetation cover fraction to partition the
    composite surface temperature measurement into soil and canopy temperatures, which
    are used to constrain net radiation and sensible heat flux, defined by the surface-to-air
    temperature gradient. The G term is parameterized in as a fraction of the net
    radiation at the soil surface (Rns). Canopy transpiration, λEc, is estimated using
    a modified Priestley-Taylor approach (Priestley and Taylor 1972) which responds
    to signals of vegetation stress conveyed by the surface temperature measurement,
    while soil evaporation λEs is computed as the residual to the energy balance equation.
    The TSEB model is applied at two times during the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
    growth phase, at approximately 1.5 h after local sunrise (t1) and 1.0 h before
    local noon (t2). A simple slab model of ABL development (McNaughton and Spriggs
    1986) is used to provide a means for surface-energy closure by relating the rise
    in air temperature in the mixed layer over the time interval (t1 to t2) to the
    time-integrated influx of H from the surface (Anderson et al. 1997). This approach
    allows near-surface air temperature to be computed internally, eliminating the
    need for an a priori specification of air temperature boundary conditions to the
    sensible heat flux computation. Daily latent heat flux is derived using ALEXI-retrieved
    latent heat flux estimates at t2 and upscaled to 24 h using the ratio of instantaneous
    to daily insolation: $$\lambda {E_{{\text{day}}}}=\frac{{\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}}}{{{R_{{S_{t2}}}}}}\left(
    {{R_{s24}}} \right),$$ where \(\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}\) is the latent heat at t2,
    \({R_{{S_{t2}}}}\)is the insolation rate at t2, and \({R_{{s_{24}}}}\) is the
    time-integrated daily insolation rate. This insolation technique has proven generally
    reliable, with lower bias and sensitivity to errors in retrieval estimates when
    compared to other techniques (Cammalleri et al. 2014a). Daily net radiation (\({R_{{n_{24}}}}\))
    maps are derived using an approach described in Anderson et al. (2012), daily
    \(G\) maps are computed by integrating the Santanello equation over daylight hours
    (Santanello and Friedl 2003), and daily \(~H\) values are computed as the residual.
    All fluxes are expressed in MJ m−2 day−1 to retain consistency with prior publications.
    The daily latent heat is converted to daily ET (in units of mm day−1) by dividing
    by the latent heat of vaporization λ. Missing pixels within the ALEXI ET maps,
    due either to cloud cover or missing or low-quality input data, are gap filled
    by conserving the ratio of actual ET to daily insolation (fsun) over time at each
    pixel. The time series of clear-sky fsun is filtered, smoothed and gap-filled
    for each pixel using a Savitzky–Golay filter, designed to reduce noise while preserving
    signals associated with changes in surface moisture conditions. Missing pixels
    within the daily ET map are then recovered by multiplying the gap-filled fsun
    fields by the daily scaling flux (insolation) maps. ALEXI is run operationally
    by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) at 8 km spatial resolution
    over North America as part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
    (GOES) Evapotranspiration and Drought (GET-D) system. GET-D produces daily ET
    and an ET-based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) using radiometric temperature data
    retrieved from GOES East and West thermal imagery. The ESI describes standardized
    anomalies in the actual-to-reference ET ratio (fRET), using the Penman–Monteith
    (FAO-56) reference ET for grass (1998). The ESI is an indicator of agricultural
    drought reflecting impacts on crop water use, and has been shown to provide early
    warning of deteriorating crop conditions (Anderson et al. 2011, 2013; Otkin et
    al. 2013, 2014). A 4 km resolution grid is also maintained for research purposes
    and allows assessment of ESI and ET at the regional scale over the continental
    U.S. (CONUS). DisALEXI Due to its reliance on high temporal frequency TIR imagery,
    here obtained from geostationary satellites, ALEXI is constrained to operate on
    coarser spatial scales on the order of a few kilometers. To map flux distributions
    at higher spatial resolution, an associated spatial disaggregation technique known
    as DisALEXI (Norman et al. 2003; Anderson et al. 2004, 2012) can be implemented
    using higher resolution TIR imagery from polar orbiting instruments or from airborne
    platforms. DisALEXI operates by running the TSEB model over each ALEXI pixel area
    within a given modeling domain using the higher spatial resolution vegetation
    cover and surface radiometric temperature information. For this application of
    TSEB, the air temperature boundary condition (set at a nominal blending height
    of 50 m), is iteratively adjusted at the ALEXI pixel scale until the DisALEXI
    daily ET fluxes converge to the ALEXI value on average over that pixel. This ensures
    consistency between the ALEXI and DisALEXI flux fields. Further description can
    be found in Anderson et al. (2012), and Cammalleri et al. (2013, 2014a). ET data
    fusion In this study, DisALEXI was used to generate ET map time series at moderate
    resolution (1 km) and near daily time steps using thermal and reflectance data
    from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Higher resolution
    (30 m) maps were created with periodic Landsat datasets, with thermal band data
    sharpened to the 30-m resolution of the reflectance bands using the Data Mining
    Sharpener tool developed by Gao et al. (2012a). These two time series were then
    fused using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM;
    Gao et al. 2006) to create daily maps of ET at 30-m resolution. In short, STARFM
    predicts Landsat-resolution ET maps on MODIS acquisition dates by developing spatially
    distributed weighting factors representing the spectral similarity and temporal
    difference between observed Landsat/MODIS maps collected on the same day. These
    weighting factors are then used in the disaggregation of MODIS images on days
    when Landsat is not available, resulting in daily Landsat-scale ET maps. For more
    information, the reader is referred to Gao et al. (2006), Cammalleri et al. (2013,
    2014a) and Semmens et al. (2016). Model inputs LST inputs for the 4-km ALEXI simulations
    over CONUS were obtained 11 µm brightness temperature observations from the GOES-EAST
    (at 75°W) and GOES-WEST (at 105°W) Imager instruments. Raw brightness temperature
    values are atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature,
    as described in French et al. (2003). Vegetation cover fraction, used to partition
    LST between soil and canopy temperatures, is computed from MODIS leaf area index
    (LAI) product (see below), aggregated to 4 km and interpolated to daily time steps.
    Landsat 8 (L8) data between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 were collected
    over the study area, which is in the overlap of two scenes (path 44/row 33 and
    path 43/row 33). A total of 87 mostly clear scenes were processed. Landsat thermal
    band data at native resolution (100 m) were atmospherically corrected using MODTRAN
    (Berk et al. 1989) then sharpened to 30 m resolution to match Landsat optical
    bands using the data mining sharpener (DMS) approach (Gao et al. 2012a). Atmospherically
    corrected shortwave reflectance data were directly downloaded from the U.S. Geological
    Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer website (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). These reflectance
    products were used to derive 30-m maps of LAI using regression tree analysis trained
    by MODIS 1 km LAI data, as described in Gao et al. (2012b). MODIS daily LAI maps
    were generated from the 4-day composite (MCD15A3, Collection 5) products and a
    procedure outlined in Gao et al. (2008), where the 4-day products are smoothed
    and gap filled to daily time steps using the TIMESAT algorithm for analyzing satellite
    time-series data for seasonality and other temporally dynamic vegetation properties
    (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Input MODIS albedo maps were generated from the Solar
    Zenith Angle (SZN)-extended MODIS/Terra + Aqua 30 arc sec Global Gap-Filled Snow-Free
    Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) (MODIS BRDF/Albedo CMG
    Gap-Filled Snow-Free Product MCD43GF V005) parameters product (University of Massachusetts
    Boston, Dr. Crystal Schaaf). MODIS LST maps were generated using the Terra instantaneous
    swath product (MOD11_L2) and geolocation product (MOD03) to obtain correct georegistration.
    LST maps were sharpened using DMS (MODIS 1 km composite NDVI as input) to reduce
    the bowtie effect due to off-nadir pixel smearing (Cammalleri et al. 2014b; Semmens
    et al. 2016). Meteorological inputs to ALEXI/DisALEXI include hourly solar radiation,
    air temperature, wind speed and vapor pressure. These data were obtained from
    the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System
    Reanalysis (CFSR) data set (Dee et al. 2013). All fields were mapped to the 4
    km ALEXI grid and converted to each sensor’s projection at both daily and overpass
    times for ingestion into DisALEXI. ALEXI/DisALEXI also requires landcover class
    to specify surface roughness parameters and vegetation optical properties (Anderson
    et al. 2007a). The ALEXI model uses the University of Maryland (UMD) global land
    cover dataset at 1 km resolution, based on observations from the AVHRR (Hansen
    et al. 2000). Higher resolution MODIS and Landsat disaggregation requires the
    30 m National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) (Fry et al. 2011). For MODIS, the NLCD
    map was upscaled to 1 km resolution using the majority class within each MODIS
    pixel. Prior evaluation of ALEXI/DisALEXI over California vineyards indicate a
    small wet bias in modeled fluxes during the cold season (Semmens et al. 2016).
    The current study incorporates a generalized second order empirical correction
    factor based on the day of year (DOY) to adjust this bias (Anderson et al. 2018).
    Minimal correction is applied during the mid-season, with the largest corrections
    being applied during the beginning and ending of the year, causing minimal impact
    to seasonal total estimates. For more information, the reader is referred to Anderson
    et al. (2018). Results Model evaluation on Landsat dates The accuracy of the fused
    daily 30-m ET time series depends largely on the fidelity in energy balance partitioning
    achieved on dates of clear Landsat overpasses, while the MODIS ET data effectively
    serve to inform interpolation between Landsat dates (Fig. 1). To evaluate performance
    on these key tie-points, modeled daytime flux estimates derived using DisALEXI
    on Landsat overpass dates are compared to EC observations in Fig. 2, with statistical
    metrics of agreement, as provided in Table 1. The modeled flux estimates have
    been averaged over a 3-by-3 pixel area (90 × 90 m) shifted west from the tower
    center to avoid non-characteristic pixels over the adjacent road. Model estimates
    of latent heat flux (LE) have been compared to measured fluxes both as observed
    and closed using the RE method, as described in the “Field measurements” section.
    This enables an evaluation of closure impacts on the assessment of model performance.

    steps Full size table Simulated daytime fluxes derived from DisALEXI generally
    align along the one-to-one line (Fig. 2), indicating reasonable partitioning by
    the TSEB. Insolation and net radiation, defining energy available for partitioning,
    agree well with in-situ measurements. A few days with higher discrepancies reflect
    errors in the CFSR insolation inputs, related to misrepresentation of clouds in
    the reanalysis data. Future implementation over North America will test use of
    NOAA’s GOES Surface and Insolation Products (GSIP; Laszlo et al. 2008) as a near
    real time input data source. Preliminary investigation shows that these hourly,
    20-km satellite-derived estimates developed by Diak (2017) better capture local
    variability in solar irradiance over the northern vineyard (Anderson et al. 2018),
    although some regional calibration may be required. Model performance for the
    2013–2016 period is similar to that reported by Semmens et al. (2016), where MAE
    errors in daily LE of ~ 1.2 MJ m−2 day−1 were obtained for Landsat overpass dates
    during the 2013 growing season. The increase in MAE seen here is likely associated
    with evaluating over multiple years with varying climatic conditions and vineyard
    management decisions, and the extension of analysis to year-round in the current
    study (Semmens et al. 2016 was limited to the growing season only). Modeled LE
    indicates underestimation when compared to closed observed LE estimates at site
    1, yielding a negative MBE of − 0.46 MJ m−2 day−1 (Table 1). The negative bias
    is most prevalent at the highest values associated with peak growing season, and
    is not present at site 2 or in comparison with the unclosed LE measurements. Evaluation
    of daily ET from fused time series Scatter plots and associated time series of
    modeled 24-h ET from the fused daily time series and daily fluxes observed at
    tower sites 1 and 2 between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 are shown in Figs.
    3 and 4, respectively. Daily ET estimates from the fused remote-sensing product
    follow the same general trend as the direct retrievals on Landsat overpass dates
    (Fig. 3). MAE for the full daily time series (closed) are 0.6 mm day−1 for both
    sites, comparable to the 0.7 mm day−1 errors reported by Semmens et al. (2016)
    for the 2013 growing season in isolation. Relative errors for both sites combined
    are 17% and 12% at daily and weekly time steps—the latter being more relevant
    for weekly irrigation scheduling. Fig. 3 Scatterplots of modeled vs. observed

    at each site is indicated by the black vertical bars Full size image On both Landsat
    overpass dates (Fig. 2) and in the full daily time series from the data fusion
    methodology (Fig. 3), the modeled LE and ET underestimates the closed observed
    fluxes at site 1 at the very highest values. As seen in Fig. 4, these periods
    of underestimation occur between approximately mid-June and mid-August for each
    year and most notably for years 2013 and 2016. In both cases, the closure corrections
    using the residual method are relatively large, and the modeled ET is typically
    bracketed between closed and unclosed observed values. Such discrepancies are
    not observed at site 2. These large mid-season closure corrections and enhanced
    model-measurement discrepancies are likely related to advective conditions. In
    semiarid or arid regions, horizontal advection of hot, dry air, heated by the
    surrounding landscape, can significantly increase the localized evaporative demand
    over an irrigated field, driving large latent heat fluxes. In such cases, the
    additional energy required for evaporation is extracted from the surface itself,
    resulting in negative sensible heat and an increase in closure errors (Alfieri
    et al. 2012). A cursory analysis of the observed sensible heat fluxes at sites
    1 and 2 revealed signatures of advection during the periods of lower closure,
    suggesting the RE method may be overestimating the real evaporative flux during
    those intervals. Furthermore, the tower footprint may be impacted under advective
    conditions, effectively sampling surface conditions further upwind. Anderson et
    al. (2018) found that peak observed flux estimates are better correlated with
    model fluxes extracted over a more central region of the vineyard that has more
    vigorous vine growth and yield production. Moreover, the assumption of self-preservation
    to upscale instantaneous flux retrieved at the satellite overpass time to daily
    totals depreciates under advective conditions (Crago 1996; Tang et al. 2013).
    Ongoing work is addressing both modeling and observational issues under the specific
    condition of strong mid-season advection. Within-field variability in water use
    Routine remote sensing of daily ET at 30-m resolution will facilitate identification
    of areas of uneven ET/stress within vineyards due to variations in soil texture
    and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. Figure 5 shows
    the variability in daily ET across both the northern and southern vineyards (sites
    1 and 2) during the entire period of investigation. Spatial variability in ET
    increases during the growing season, with maximum variation occurring in July,
    then decreasing to a near-homogeneous distribution during the winter season. The
    northern vineyard exhibits a higher degree of spatial variability in ET, both
    in standard deviation and range, when compared to the southern vineyard. In the
    northern vineyard, the ET observed at the flux tower persistently lies near the
    upper bounds in standard deviation and range during the growing season. In general,
    at site 2, the flux tower samples are near the spatial mean of the remotely sensed
    distribution (Fig. 5). Overall, modeled spatial mean estimates of ET over the
    northern and southern vineyard are similar, with the only discrepancy found during
    the late growing season of 2013 and 2015, where values over the southern vineyard
    are slightly lower than in the northern vineyard (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Fig.
    5 Time series of observed ET (black dots), spatial mean modeled ET with plus and
    minus standard deviation (dark red) and spatial range (maximum and minimum) modeled
    ET (light red) for the northern vineyard (top panel) and southern vineyard (middle
    panel). Also included is the time series of modeled spatial mean ET for both vineyards
    (bottom panel) Full size image The analyses in Fig. 5 highlight the challenges
    in using isolated in-situ measurements to infer field-scale states and fluxes.
    As noted by Semmens et al. (2016), the northern field has large variability in
    soil texture, with the northwestern corner of the northern vineyard containing
    a silt/gravelly loam, resulting in poor to moderate water storage capacities and
    subsequently lower ET rates than observed in other parts of both fields, dominated
    by a Kimball silt loam. As a result, the tower footprint in site 1 captures conditions
    that are not always representative of the field as a whole. This is consistent
    with analyses presented by Anderson et al. (2018), who investigated spatial variability
    in correlations between the observed fluxes and modeled ET time series extracted
    in a moving window sampling a 600 × 600 m area around the Lodi tower sites, as
    a metric of tower representivity. They found that on average over two full annual
    cycles, tower fluxes at site 1 were best correlated with modeled ET to the southwest
    of the tower location, shifting to the vineyard center when the analysis was limited
    to the peak of the growing seasons. The southern vineyard showed less spatial
    variability in terms of tower-model agreement. Local variability in water use
    Along with field ET estimates, spatial maps of ET over the local landscape can
    provide valuable context for irrigation decision makers. Vineyard managers often
    operate multiple vineyards, potentially with different varietals and irrigation
    management strategies. There may also be value in understanding irrigation and
    water-use patterns in neighboring fields. As an example, maps of monthly ET over
    a roughly 3 km by 3 km box including the GRAPEX study area, with the northern
    and southern vineyards near the center, are presented in Fig. 6. Over this 4-year
    period, some consistent seasonal patterns in water use are apparent. Beginning
    in March, localized ET enhancements in irrigated fields begin to emerge. Irrigation
    in the GRAPEX vineyards begins in early June and ends in early- to mid-October.
    Remnant evaporation of late season irrigation can be seen in these vineyards in
    October for each year. Fig. 6 Spatial time series (monthly) of ET (mm month−1)
    over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and southern vineyards instrumented
    for GRAPEX. Boxes demarcate the new vineyard established west of the northern
    vineyard and an alfalfa field left fallow following the 2015 growing season Full
    size image Although seasonal patterns remain relatively consistent from year to
    year, some discernable changes in local water use can be seen over the 4-year
    period, particularly during the growing season. These changes are largely related
    to changes in land use. For example, evidence of irrigation in a new vineyard
    established just west of site one in early 2014 is manifested as a substantial
    increase between 2013 and 2014 and persisting through the 2015–2016 growing seasons
    (outlined in black; Fig. 6). In addition, ET in the field due south of the southern
    vineyard (also outlined in Fig. 6) decreases notably in 2016 due to fallowing
    of an alfalfa field after May of that year, possibly the result of grower response
    to long-term drought conditions and resulting water limitations (Anderson et al.
    2018). Spatial weekly or monthly maps of local ET at this scale provide vineyard
    managers with information about local land- and water-use changes, which may have
    bearing on in-field decision making and long-term strategic planning. Use of remote
    sensing for monitoring vineyard water stress and managing irrigation This study
    investigates two remote-sensing metrics that may be useful in vineyard irrigation
    management are total daily or weekly ET (relating to consumptive water use—water
    extracted from the soil profile requiring replacement), and the moisture stress
    factor fRET. Grape development is strongly dependent on vine water status, and
    strategies for optimizing wine grape quality are often associated with imposing
    some degree of water stress in the vine during specific phenological periods.
    This degree of stress is achieved through regulated deficit irrigation (RDI),
    estimated as a fraction of the full crop potential water use. Current operational
    practices utilize the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO-56) model to estimate
    crop potential water use based on the reference ET and a crop coefficient (commonly
    referred to as Kc) describing the average ratio of actual-to-reference ET for
    different crops under well-watered conditions. The fRET quantity used in the regional-scale
    ESI agricultural drought indicator effectively represents a dynamic crop coefficient,
    diagnostically retrieved via thermal remote sensing and responding to daily changes
    in localized crop stress and development. To illustrate the utility of a daily
    Landsat-scale fRET product for stress detection, Fig. 7 compares modeled values
    to observations derived from tower measurements of actual and reference ET. Reference
    ET is calculated in both cases using the Penman–Monteith formulation, as described
    in the FAO standard for a short grass (Allen et al. 1998), computed using tower
    data in the observed case and using regional meteorological data (NCEP CFSR data
    set; Dee et al. 2013) for the modeled case. Observed Actual ET is taken as the
    observed 24-h daily closed flux tower measurement, while the modeled ET values
    are extracted from the fused time series at the tower sites. Also shown are rainfall
    and irrigation amounts measured in-field, the latter only available for the 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons (see zoom-in in Fig. 7; bottom panel). Fig. 7 Time series
    of fRET derived from closed observations (black dots) and the fused ET time series
    (red line) derived from point estimates for site 1 (top panel) and site 2 (second
    from top panel) during the entire study period, along with daily rainfall (green
    bars). Also included is an enhanced view of 2015 and 2016 (bottom two panels),
    which includes daily irrigation totals (blue bars) presented in Liters/vine Full
    size image In general, the fused fRET time series reproduces observed seasonal
    patterns inferred from the tower observations with good fidelity. Small mid-season
    biases are observed in 2013 and 2015 at site 1, relating to localized advective
    issues discussed earlier. This bias is non-existent at site 2, where both modeled
    and observed fRET estimates are similar throughout the study period. Both modeled
    and measured fRET indicate lower peak season fRET values at site 2 during 2013
    and 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2015, consistent with the cyclical annual ET
    patterns in Fig. 4. During 2015–2016, when detailed irrigation information is
    available (Fig. 7; bottom panels), we can closely investigate relationships between
    fRET and daily irrigation amounts, expressed in in units of liters per vine. Observed
    and modeled fRET fluctuate rapidly during the non-growing season when canopy cover
    is sparse and no irrigation is occurring, reflecting the relative volatility in
    the soil evaporation and cover crop transpiration contributions that dominate
    total ET during this period. Once irrigation commences, fRET remains more stable
    and near target levels (0.8–1.0) until after harvest. Note that irrigation is
    suspended each year briefly (5–7 days) around harvest near the end of August,
    then resumed post-harvest until early-to-mid-October to maintain the canopy. After
    harvest, both observed and modeled fRET decay as the vines senesce. During the
    growing season, remotely sensed fRET values in both vineyards show response to
    seasonal irrigation amounts. In 2015, site 2 received about 60% of the daily irrigation
    amounts applied to site 1, while in 2016 the irrigation strategy was more uniform,
    with site 2 at 92% of site 1 (Fig. 8). Irrigation at site 1 varied by only 1%
    between the two years, while site 2 increased by 54% in 2016. These variations
    in irrigation management are reflected in the average remote sensing fRET retrieved
    during the irrigation season (pre-harvest), around 0.7 for site 2 in 2013 and
    0.8 in all other cases. Fig. 8 Total irrigation applied (liters/vine) over 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons in the site 1 and 2 vineyards Full size image Regional
    differences in applied irrigation can be seen in the spatiotemporal patterns of
    monthly average 30-m fused fRET (Fig. 9). After irrigation is initiated (beginning
    of June), there is a clear distinction in fRET between the vineyards in 2013 and
    2015, but less difference in 2014/2016, reflecting differentials in irrigation
    amounts applied to the two fields (Fig. 8). While the relative patterns in monthly
    fRET are similar to those in total ET shown in Fig. 6, normalization by reference
    ET serves to reduce dependence on the seasonal evaporative demand curve, focusing
    more specifically on variations in moisture conditions driving the evaporative
    fluxes. These maps also provide information on irrigation initiation in surrounding
    fields. The fRET maps for April in Fig. 9 emphasize wetter springtime conditions
    in 2014, as well as early initiation of irrigation in the fields to the southwest
    in 2014 and 2016. Fig. 9 Spatiotemporal time series (monthly) of fRET (top panel)
    and fRET anomaly (bottom panel) over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and
    southern vineyards instrumented for GRAPEX Full size image Anomalies in monthly
    fRET, computed as the difference with respect to the long-term (here 4-year) mean
    fRET map for each month are useful for highlighting regions anomalous moisture
    stress and water use in real time (Fig. 9; bottom panel). In April, May and June
    of 2015 we see pronounced negative anomalies in the southern vineyard, which are
    also present, albeit to a smaller degree, during the remainder of the growing
    season. These anomalies indicate stress in the vineyard likely correlated to the
    lesser amount of irrigation applied during the 2015 growing season and subsequent
    reduced yield as discussed earlier. Regional precipitation in October of 2015
    may have helped to reduce the fRET anomaly signal from September to October. In
    some cases, reflect changes in land use and water management rather than stress.
    In 2013 we see strong negative anomalies in the areas where new vineyards were
    established in 2014, to the west and south of site 1. The alfalfa field fallowed
    in May of 2016 is clearly apparent. Drier than normal conditions are detected
    for the month of September in 2015 over the region just east of the GRAPEX vineyard
    sites. This may be related to management/harvest decisions in response to the
    multi-year drought conditions that prevailed in California during the study period,
    leading to increasing pressure on water availability for irrigation. Spatial fRET
    and fRET anomaly products such as these prove capable of monitoring dynamic crop
    coefficients and highlighting changing conditions, not only within a field of
    interest, but also on a regional scale. Relationships between vineyard water use,
    stress and yields The ultimate objective in this study is to motivate use of remote
    sensing toward meeting the dual goals of reducing water use while improving yield
    and grape quality. Figure 10 provides a more detailed view of annual water-use
    patterns and its relation to grape yield over the two GRAPEX vineyards, showing
    cumulative ET over the peak growing season (May–August) in the top panel and grape
    yield (tons ha−1) in the bottom panel. Fig. 10 Cumulative peak growing season
    (May–August) ET (mm) (top) and total yield in tons/ha (bottom) over the northern
    and southern vineyards for years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Full size image The
    cumulative ET maps show distinct spatial structure. Two low ET features in the
    south-central portion of the northern vineyard are associated with vernal pools
    - small areas having no vines and no irrigation because of protection by state
    and federal law from any cultivation activities (see also Semmens et al. 2016).
    These ephemeral wetlands emerge after rainfall events, but during most of the
    growing season are dry leading to persistently low values of seasonal ET. There
    is also the persistence in lower ET in the northwest corner of the northern (site
    1) vineyard, which is associated with poor vine growth due to soil properties.
    This corner of the field has silt loam and gravelly loam soils characteristic
    of poor to moderate water storage capacity (Semmens et al. 2016), while the center
    of the northern vineyard is Kimball silt loam and is characteristic of more vigorous
    vine growth. The latter is characterized by high rates of seasonal consumptive
    water use. The increased water use associated with the new vineyards established
    to the west and south of the north vineyard after the 2013 growing season can
    also be observed in Fig. 10. Total ET during the peak growing season increases
    from roughly 300 mm year−1 during 2013 to 520–550 mm year−1 during 2014 over this
    region due to irrigation applied to help establish the recently planted vines.
    Much of this spatial structure in seasonal ET is well correlated in patterns in
    yield maps, collected over the GRAPEX fields using GPS-enabled sensors on the
    harvesters. The cyclical ET dynamics in the southern vineyard (site 2), with relatively
    high cumulative water use in 2014 and 2016, reflects grower decisions in irrigation
    management in this field. In the northern vineyard (site 1), the cumulative water
    use is lower in 2013 than in 2014–2016. Similar spatial and temporal patterns
    are seen in the reported total yield for each site (Fig. 10). Specifically, total
    yield for 2015 in the southern vineyard is considerably lower than in the northern
    vineyard, while also being lower than both the north and south vineyards in 2016,
    corresponding to trends in both fRET and irrigation. This instance of decreased
    yield may be the result of increased stress imposed over the southern vineyard
    (shown in fRET) through restricted irrigation during the 2015 growing season (Fig.
    8). Despite the lack of irrigation data during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons,
    trends in fRET correspond to yield totals—most notably in the southern vineyard—where
    fRET values are lowest during the 2013 and 2015 growing season (Fig. 7). In the
    northern vineyard, yields are lowest in 2013—the year of lowest cumulative water
    use. The spatial distribution of cumulative growing season ET (Fig. 10) also roughly
    follows that of yield, with larger values of both reported near the center of
    the northern vineyard for all years. As noted above, spatial heterogeneity in
    the northern vineyard is associated with soil texture discontinuities and vine
    growth vigor. Low yields in the NW corner are spatially correlated with lower
    seasonal ET, while the center of the northern vineyard has persistently the highest
    yields and seasonal water use. A similar spatial correlation to yield is presented
    in Sun et al. (2017), where the biophysical parameters NDVI and LAI show a similar
    spatial correlation to grape yield over the same vineyards during 2013 and 2014,
    although the relationship is more variable from year to year. Ongoing work looks
    to expand upon research done in Sun et al. (2017) by examining the joint use of
    remotely sensed LAI/ET/fRET signals to predict yield variations over a larger
    dataset of vineyards and over an extended period. Summary and conclusions A remote-sensing
    approach for mapping daily ET at 30-m spatial resolution is evaluated over two
    vineyard sites in central California for the 2013–2016 growing seasons to investigate
    the utility for irrigation management. Mean absolute errors in comparison with
    in-situ eddy covariance measurements of daily ET were 0.6 mm day−1, or about 17%
    of the mean observed value. Errors reduced to 15% at the weekly time steps relevant
    to irrigation management. In comparison with eddy covariance fluxes forced for
    closure, the model tended to underestimate closed observations in the northern
    vineyard site during highly advective periods for the peak growing season in 2013
    and 2016. During this period, the closure errors in the observations were exacerbated,
    and therefore, the tendency to underestimate is partly attributed to issues with
    the flux measurements and closure technique and not the model alone. Model errors
    may be associated with the self-preservation assumptions in the daily upscaling
    technique, which may be less reliable under advective conditions. Monthly total
    ET maps and the spatial variation time series demonstrate strong seasonal water-use
    variability, both within the vineyards themselves and over the surrounding landscape.
    In the northern vineyard, the flux tower location was not representative of the
    field-scale mean properties in some years, highlighting challenges in managing
    irrigation decisions based on point-scale measurements. Time series of monthly
    ET maps revealed consistent seasonal dynamics year-to-year in water-use patterns
    over the GRAPEX study area, but with some notable variations due to changes in
    land use and water management. Within vineyard spatial variability of cumulative
    growing season ET and actual-to-reference ET (fRET) correlate well with yield
    totals, demonstrating the impact of potential stress on future yield prospects.
    Maps of fRET demonstrate utility for monitoring how consistently target values
    (between 0.8 and 1.0 in this case) are achieved for a given field, and could be
    useful for adaptive management of irrigation applications in real time. Maps of
    fRET anomalies highlight emerging areas of anomalous water use or stress that
    could alert needs for modified management or further investigation. The modeling
    approach described here can provide detailed and robust information on daily to
    seasonal crop water use and stress. Applied operationally, this ET mapping framework
    can be of great utility to irrigation managers, both for individual vineyard assessment
    and larger regional application. Improved spatial and temporal monitoring will
    improve water allocation and conservation efforts through an ability to identify
    areas of uneven productivity/stress due to variations in soil texture and composition
    and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. This will allow vineyard managers
    to identify areas in their blocks with water, nutrient or other environmental
    stressors as well as malfunctions in the irrigation systems. Moreover, with reliable
    daily 30-m ET, growers and irrigation managers have the potential to make use
    of variable rate irrigation systems that can apply appropriate amounts of irrigated
    water and nutrients to specific areas within a vineyard to achieve more uniform
    grape quality and yield goals. There is also potential to incorporate very fine
    resolution aerial imagery from UAVs or manned aircraft for identifying individual
    or groups of vines requiring intervention at critical periods during vine and
    grape development stages when stress conditions are detected at the coarser 30
    m satellite resolution. In ongoing work, this fusion-based ET mapping system is
    being applied over different vine varieties and climate regions within California
    as part of the continued effort of the GRAPEX project (Kustas et al. 2018). The
    ability to reliably monitor evaporative water loss and crop conditions at both
    the field and regional scale is imperative to viticulture and agricultural production
    systems alike, especially in regions with competing demands for limited water
    resources. Notes The use of trade, firm, or corporation names in this article

  analysis: 'The study by Santesteban et al. (2016) assesses the potential of high-resolution
    UAV-based thermal imaging to estimate the instantaneous and seasonal variability
    of plant water status within a vineyard. The authors find that thermal imaging
    can be used to map instantaneous variations in water status and that the information
    provided by thermal images is relevant at a seasonal scale, though it does not
    match seasonal trends in water status but instead mimics other physiological processes
    occurring during ripening.


    The specific point addressed in the review intention, regarding the types of data
    most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources, is addressed
    by Santesteban et al. (2016) in a limited way. The authors state that "In the
    last years, the resolution of thermal imaging systems has increased and its weight
    decreased, fostering their implementation on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for
    civil and agricultural engineering purposes." This suggests that thermal imaging
    data obtained from UAVs may be a valuable source of information for irrigation
    management. However, the authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the
    types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources,
    as requested in the review intention.


    Overall, the study by Santesteban et al. (2016) provides valuable insights into
    the use of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging to estimate plant water status
    in vineyards. However, it does not fully address the specific point of the review
    intention regarding the types of data most applicable to irrigation management
    and their typical sources.'

    Get rights and content Highlights • Technology to acquire thermal images using
    UAVs has progressed very much lately. • Thermal imaging was used to estimate within-vineyard
    variations in water status. • The technique showed a great potential to monitor
    instantaneous variations. • At seasonal scale, it was related to relevant agronomic
    variables. • Multiple dates of thermal images are required to monitor seasonal
    water status. Abstract Thermal imaging can become a readily usable tool for crop
    agricultural water management, since it allows a quick determination of canopy
    surface temperature that, as linked to transpiration, can give an idea of crop
    water status. In the last years, the resolution of thermal imaging systems has
    increased and its weight decreased, fostering their implementation on Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for civil and agricultural engineering purposes. This approach
    would overcome most of the limitations of on site thermal imaging, allowing mapping
    plant water status at either field or farm scale, taking thus into account the
    naturally existing or artificially induced variability at those scales. The aim
    of this work was to evaluate to which extent high-resolution thermal imaging allows
    evaluating the instantaneous and seasonal variability of water status within a
    vineyard. The novelty and significance of our approach is that the specifically
    designed and build unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provided very high-resolution
    imaging (pixel <9 cm), and that it was used at a commercially relevant acreage
    (7.5 ha). This set-up was used to obtain Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) from thermal
    images in a clear-sky day. CWSI values were and compared to stem water potential
    (Ψs) and stomatal conductance (gs) measured at 14 sampling sites across the vineyard
    at the moment when images where acquired. In order to evaluate the potential of
    CWSI acquired in a single day to estimate within-vineyard patterns of variation
    in water status, a spatial modeling approach was used. CWSI correlated well with
    Ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition, showing to have a great potential
    to monitor instantaneous variations in water status within a vineyard. The information
    provided by thermal images proved to be relevant at a seasonal scale as well,
    although it did not match seasonal trends in water status but mimicked other physiological
    processes occurring during ripening. Therefore, if a picture of variations in
    water status is required, it would be necessary to acquire thermal images at several
    dates along the summer. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction In the last two-decades, Precision Agriculture techniques have
    been progressively implemented in viticulture, giving birth to what is called
    Precision Viticulture (PV). Along those years, PV has focused on delineating management
    zones, i.e.: on defining within-vineyard areas that are relatively homogeneous,
    and different to other areas in the same vineyard (Arno et al., 2011, Arnó et
    al., 2009, Urretavizcaya et al., 2014). This approach is very appropriate for
    high-value crops such as grapevine and, when transferred to grape-growing companies,
    it usually implies adopting site-specific cultural practices for each zone defined
    (Bramley et al., 2011b, Santesteban et al., 2013, Serrano et al., 2015). In those
    companies, where new generation grape harvesters are available, the zones delineated
    can also be used to automatically segregate grapes from the same field into two
    batches to improve global wine quality (Bramley et al., 2011a, Santos et al.,
    2012). The most common sources of information on field spatial variability for
    zone delineation are (i) vegetation indices obtained from airborne multispectral
    cameras, (ii) soil apparent conductivity or resistivity, and (iii) data gathered
    in situ following a sampling grid (Arnó et al., 2009). However, those approaches
    are not considering any variable directly related to plant water status, which,
    in semi-arid areas, is usually regarded to be the major factor determining grape
    yield and berry composition (Medrano et al., 2014). Besides, in a context of climate
    change, water status is also expected to play an increasingly relevant role in
    cooler areas, as water deficit periods along the growing season are expected to
    occur more likely in the near future (Ashenfelter and Storchmann, 2016, Fraga
    et al., 2012, Viguié et al., 2014), so PV approaches should pay much greater attention
    to water availability. Whole field imaging using thermal cameras is a source of
    useful information in this regard, as it allows estimating canopy temperature,
    known to be related to plant transpiration and, therefore, to plant water status
    (Jackson et al., 1988, Jackson et al., 1981). High resolution thermal cameras
    have been successfully mounted on aircraft platforms (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006)
    and on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasingly using higher performance sensors
    in terms of lower size and weight, and of greater spectral and spatial resolutions.
    Last generation thermal cameras can reach centimeter ground resolution, providing
    enough accuracy for canopy extraction in discontinuous crops in rows such as grapevines
    and fruit trees, and are a promising tool for field and irrigation management
    applications (Berni et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). In viticulture,
    proximal thermal sensing has been shown to be a good tool to estimate plant water
    status (Fuentes et al., 2012, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Pou et al.,
    2014). In those approaches, a thermal camera is directly used to get a lateral
    view, or mounted on a shaft or a crane, to get a zenithal view; and relatively
    good agreement is observed between canopy-temperature derived indices and plant
    water potential or stomatal conductance. On the contrary, the implementation of
    UAV-based thermal imaging solutions has not been well explored yet in viticulture,
    since the resolution obtained must be sufficient to enable targeting pure canopy
    pixels, avoiding mixed soil/vegetation pixels (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2015), which
    is particularly complicated in most vineyards due to the structure of the crop,
    trellised in narrow rows. In one of those works, Baluja et al. (2012a) evaluated
    the water status variability of a commercial rainfed Tempranillo vineyard using
    a UAV platform, and observed that some vegetation indices, not derived from thermal
    images but from multispectral ones, were better correlated to stomatal conductance
    and leaf water potential, probably as they reflected a longer term response. Another
    research team also working in Spain, evaluated the correlation between Crop Water
    Stress Index (CWSI, a canopy-temperature derived index) and leaf water potential,
    reporting that correlation improved at noon (Bellvert et al., 2014), and exploring
    the potentiality of the technique for setting thresholds useful for irrigation
    scheduling (Bellvert et al., 2015a, Bellvert et al., 2015b). Gonzalez-Dugo et
    al. (2013) recently suggested that the requirements to achieve the water stress
    monitoring using aerial platforms are: (a) establish a strong correlation between
    stress indices and actual water stress in the field; (ii) the spatial resolution
    must be sufficient to enable targeting pure canopy pixels, avoiding mixed soil/vegetation
    pixel; (iii) the ability to evaluate entire fields in individual flight; (iv)
    faster turn-around acquisition times and processing in order to provide quasi-real
    time water status maps helping the farmer decision-making process. The aim of
    this study is to evaluate the interest of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging
    to estimate the instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within
    a vineyard. The significance of our approach is that we worked at a commercially
    realistic scale (7.5 ha), the high resolution of the thermal images acquired (9
    cm pixel−1), and that we tested to which extent the information provided by one
    flight campaign can be used to evaluate spatial variability in water availability
    across the season. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Vineyard characterization The
    experimental work was performed in a 7.5 ha vineyard located in Traibuenas, Navarra,
    Spain (42°22′20.1″N 1°37′34.2″W, WGS84, Altitude: 328 m), in a region characterized
    by a semiarid climate (Bs type in Koppen’s classification; P < 350 mm; ETPPenman
    >1150 mm). The vineyard is trained as a vertical shoot positioned bilateral cordon,
    bud number fixed at 12 buds per m of row line, plant spacing being 3 m between
    rows and 1 m within the row. The vineyard was 18 years-old at the beginning of
    the experiment, it was managed according to standard practices in the area, and
    vines were not affected in a significant way by pests or diseases, with the sole
    exception of approx. 2% of the vines showing slight to moderate esca symptoms.
    Spatial variability within the vineyard was characterized setting up two sampling
    grids. The first one (Fig. 1a), dedicated to the agronomical characterization
    of the vineyard, was comprised of 92 sampling points (SP), and followed a relatively
    regular rectangular pattern with a mean distance of 25 × 25 m between SP. The
    second grid was dedicated to vine water status characterization, followed an irregular
    pattern (Fig. 1b) conformed by 14 water status measurement points (WSP). On every
    SP and WSP, 10 vines located at two adjacent rows were marked, and all of them
    used for the experimental measurements and sampling procedures detailed below.

    Fig. 1. Aerial view of the vineyard indicating the location of (a) Sampling Points
    (SP) and (b) Water status Sampling Points (WSP). The agronomical characterization
    of the 92 SP included the following measurements: - Vegetative growth, estimated
    as the total shoot cross sectional area (SCSA) per vine. The basal diameter of
    all the shoots in the 10 vines in the SP was measured with a hand-held caliper
    at the end of July, once apical growth had stopped. At winter rest, trunk cross
    sectional area (TCSA) was determined measuring trunk diameter 30 cm above-ground.
    - Yield, determined at harvest by counting and weighting all the clusters produced
    in the 10 vines at each SP. - Grape composition at harvest: one 300-berry sample
    was taken at each SP was taken to determine berry weight (BW) as well as the main
    composition parameters. After crushing, total soluble solids concentration (TSS)
    was measured with a temperature compensating refractometer RFM840 (Bellingham-Stanley
    Ltd., Kent, UK), pH and titratable acidity (TA) using a pH-Burette 24 auto-titrator
    (Crison, Barcelona, Spain), malic (MalA) and tartaric acid (TarA) concentration
    was measured enzymatically using an autoanalyzer (Easychem, Systea s.p.a., Italy),
    whereas yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) was estimated following the procedure
    described by Aerny (1996) with the modifications detailed in Garcia et al. (2011).
    Total anthocyanins (TAnt) content was evaluated after 4 h extraction at pH = 1.0
    following the methodology described in Glories and Augustin (1993). - Berry carbon
    isotope ratio (δ13C), measured in 50-berry samples gathered at harvest, then oven-dried
    and ground into a fine homogeneous powder, and analysed as using an Elemental
    analyzer (NC2500, Carlo Erba Reagents, Rodano, Italy) coupled to Isotopic Mass
    Spectrometer (Thermoquest Delta Plus, ThermoFinnigan, Bremen, Germany) as detailed
    in Santesteban et al. (2012). This measurement was done in 2014 and in 2015. The
    characterization of the 14 WSP included, in addition to the agronomic measurements
    described for the SP, weekly measurements of stem water potential at mid-morning
    (Ψs-m) and at noon (Ψs-n). Measurements were taken from 15 days after fruit set,
    until harvest time in 2014 and 2015. At each WSP, five healthy leaves were bagged
    1.5 h prior to measurement using zip-bags covered with a metalized high-density
    polyethylene reflective film (SonocoRF, Sonoco Products Co., Hartsville, SC, USA).
    Stem water potential was determined using a Scholander pressure bomb (P3000, Soil
    Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Last, we also had information available
    on soil apparent electric conductivity (ECa) and on Plant Cell Density (PCD) vegetation
    index. ECa was estimated in December 2014, when soil was at field capacity, at
    every SP using a handheld EM38 conductivity meter (Geonics Ltd, Ontario, Canada).
    PCD was calculated as the ratio between RED/NIR bands from images acquired by
    an airborne RGB-NIR sensor, gathered in a commercial mission performed by a private
    company (Agropixel SA) on August 10th of 2015. PCD values were normalized to a
    8-bit scale (0–255). 2.2. UAV platform and payload The UAV platform (Fig. 2a)
    was a modified multi-rotor MikrokopterOktoXL (HiSystems GmbH, Moomerland, Germany),
    an open-source project described in detail in Matese et al. (2015), which included
    a pre-assembled hardware and a GPS V3.0 module as positioning system, able to
    carry a 2 kg payload for 15 min flight time. Flight parameters communication to
    the ground operator were provided by a radio link at 2.4 GHz, while another channel
    at 5.8 GHz was used for remote sensing data transmission. The core of the UAV
    system is a Flight Control board (FlightCtrl), based on an ATMega1284P microcontroller
    (Atmel Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), which communicates with the eight brushless
    controllers by a two-wire bi-directional serial bus (I2C). It integrates a pressure
    sensor and 3-axis accelerometers to calculate and align the UAV with gravity.
    The FlightCtrl is linked to a navigation control board (NaviCtrl), equipped with
    an ARM9 microcontroller (Atmel Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA) and a MicroSD slot
    card for waypoint data storage. An integrated navigation sensor system based on
    a 3D digital compass to monitor the z (yaw) axis rotation and a LEA-6 GPS module
    (U-blox AG, Thalwil, Switzerland) with a circular error of about 2 m, allow various
    levels of autonomous flight. The UAV mounts eight ATMEGA8 control cards (Atmel
    Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), dedicated to the management of each brushless
    motor with a very quick time response (less than 0.5 ms). The flight planning
    was conducted with Mikrokopter Tools software, which allows the user to generate
    a route of waypoints as a function of the sensor Field Of View (FOV), the degree
    of overlap between images and the ground resolution needed. A universal camera
    mount equipped with three servomotors allows a correct image acquisition by correcting
    the tilt and rolling effects. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    acquisition (a) and detailed view of multispectral (b) and thermal (c) cameras
    mounted on it. A FLIR TAU II 320 (FLIR Systems, Inc., USA) was used for thermal
    data acquisition. This sensor, optimized for UAV application, is of minimal size
    (44.5 × 44.5 × 30.0 mm) and weight (72 g). Imaging sensor characteristics, i.e.
    324 × 256 pixels and 24° × 18° FOV with fixed focal length of 19 mm, allows obtaining
    images of about 40 × 30 m at the ground, with a resolution of 0.13 m/pixel at
    100 m flight altitude. The camera is equipped with an uncooled sensor able to
    measure longwave radiation in the spectral range 7.5–13 μm. Radiometric calibration
    was conducted in the laboratory, using blackbodies under varying target and ambient
    temperatures to develop radiometric calibration algorithms following the procedure
    described in Berni et al. (2009). 2.3. Flight campaign At early veraison (28th
    July 2015), the site was monitored with a single flight survey at 70 m above ground
    level at solar noon, providing 9 cm pixel−1 ground image resolution. Camera settings
    were set to a fixed exposure with automatic trigger at 2 s frequency. The waypoint
    route was generated to obtain 80% overlap both between photos (forward overlap)
    and between flight lines (lateral overlap), in order to achieve the highest accuracy
    in mosaicking elaboration step. The images were recorded during homogeneous and
    stable radiation conditions, under clear sky conditions and with no wind. The
    thermal acquisition by the UAV was made between 13:00 to 14:30 h by means of five
    consecutive flights of 15 min each. Shortly after thermal image acquisition by
    the UAV (5–10 min later), stem water potential (Ψs) and leaf stomatal conductance
    (gs) were measured in all the WSP. Ψs was measured following the same protocol
    and sample size used in the weekly measurements of Ψs-m and Ψs-n, wheras gs was
    determined in three sunlit leaves per WSP using a hand-held porometer (SC-1, Decagon
    Devices Inc., Pullman, Washington). 2.4. Image data processing Leaf emissivity
    acquired in the thermal infrared spectral region allowed the computation of water
    stress related to leaf temperature, through the estimation of CWSI (Crop Water
    Stress Index) using the modified Eq. (1) derived by (Jackson et al., 1988): (1)
    CWSI = (Tleaf − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet) where Tdry and Twet are, respectively, the
    dry leaf reference temperature representing a stressed leaf temperature and wet
    leaf temperature reference in total absence of stress, while Tleaf indicates the
    leaf surface temperature. Respect to the original equation defined by Jackson,
    the modified one uses the canopy temperature (Tleaf) instead of the differences
    between canopy and air temperature (Tc − Ta), moreover identify Tdry and Twet
    as the upper limit (Tc − Ta)UL and the lower limit (Tc − Ta)LL respectively. Tleaf
    data in absolute temperature (°C) were calculated from thermal camera’s digital
    number (DN) using an empirical line correction. The DN-values in the thermal imagery
    represent at-sensor radiance. Conversion was carried out in field conditions,
    by means of three different colour panels (1 × 1 m) at known temperature as reference.
    Those measurements were achieved at the beginning and the end of each flight and
    replicated three times with a 10 s delay. The reference target temperature was
    calculated taking into account the emissivity coefficient of panel material (0.95).
    The average temperature of the reference targets was 33 °C, 54 °C and 66 °C for
    the white, blue and black respectively during the entire flight acquisitions.
    The temperature range of the three panels (black, blue and white) had a variation
    of 6.6 °C, 3.4 °C and 1.5 °C respectively during the five flights. The averaged
    values derived from 6 measures for each target and for each flight. The reference
    temperature (Tdry and Twet) estimation procedure is a step that requires utmost
    care and precision, as it represents a key factor in the stress map computation.
    CWSI reference measurements were achieved at the end of each flight and replicated
    three times with a 10 s delay. The emissivity coefficient applied to leaf measurements
    was 0.98. The average temperature of the Tdry reference was 36.1 °C and for Twet
    23.6 °C. The temperature range of the Tdry and Twet had a variation of about 1.3
    °C and 2.4 °C respectively during the five flights. Many studies reported different
    methods to measure and calculate these references (Alchanatis et al., 2010, Cohen
    et al., 2005, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Testi et al., 2008, Yuan
    et al., 2004). In this work, we preferred the approach suggested by Jones et al.
    (2002). In detail, leaves of two sampling vines were coated on both sides with
    petroleum jelly, in order to prevent the leaf transpiration and interrupt the
    transpiration cooling phenomenon, simulating the leaf physiological response to
    water stress conditions. At the same time, the wet reference was obtained wetting
    both sides of other two sampling vines. Temperature monitoring was carried out
    with a handheld thermal sensor FLIR I7, Tdry was measured 30 min after applying
    petroleum jelly, while Twet 20 s after wetting leaves with water. Thermal images
    acquired by UAV were mosaicked using Agisoft Photoscan Professional Edition 1.1.6
    (Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia), a commercial computer vision software package.
    This software provides a completely automated computer vision SfM procedure, taking
    a set of images as input and automatically going through the steps of feature
    identification, matching and bundle adjustment. The procedure aligns images captured
    by the thermal camera. A polygon mesh was computed from the dense 3D point, and
    the pixel values of each image were then projected onto the mesh to create an
    orthomosaic. When combined with the GPS positions, this process allows the creation
    of a high-resolution orthophoto and a digital elevation model (DEM) of the research
    site. 2.5. Row extraction and spatial analysis The DEM output from Agisoft software
    allowed developing a filtering procedure of the pure row pixels, since they have
    greater heights from the ground, and can be easily discriminated by global thresholding
    algorithms. The first step was to applicate the Top-Hat morphological operation
    (Gonzalez and Wintz, 2002) directly on the DEM image. Through this technique,
    usually used for non-uniform illumination correction, we made “flat” the terrain
    that may in fact be pending. Then, using a global thresholding method (Otsu et
    al., 1979), two different zones were obtained: rows and ground. The Otsu method
    discriminates the two classes automatically determining a threshold that maximizes
    the interclass variance. The purpose of this procedure is to split the image f
    (x, y) in two parts (row and inter-row), imposing a threshold on the histogram
    image intensity that, in this case, coincides with the height. DEM rows in the
    image have a height, then intensity, almost constant, consistent with each other
    and always more than the ground. Data extraction for single plants was made averaging
    values in 0.8 × 0.3 m polygons along rows (Fig. 3), polygon size being chosen
    to properly identify each plant from the adjacent ones. Download : Download high-res

    between CWSI and plant water status In order to evaluate the instantaneous correspondence
    between water status characterization through standard proxy techniques and thermal
    imagery, the Ψs and gs values measured at the WSP in the flight campaign day were
    compared to their CWSI through regression analysis. At the seasonal scale, the
    evaluation of the appropriateness of thermal images acquired at one date to estimate
    seasonal variability in water status along the field was done through a spatial
    modeling approach. Spatial modeling of leaf water potential along the vineyard
    was done according to the approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010a, Acevedo-Opazo
    et al., 2010b, Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2008. In this approach, one (or more) ancillary
    variable(s), whose spatial distribution is well known, is combined with plant
    water status information at a reference site to elaborate a model that estimates
    plant water status. In our paper, we used the same procedure considered by Herrero-Langreo
    et al. (2013), where more details on the methodology can be found. Following that
    procedure, we considered carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) measured at the 92 SP in
    the previous season as the ancillary variable, and the most stressed WSP as the
    reference site. The model was calibrated and tested using the measurements of
    Ψs at all the WSP, considering the measurements made weekly in 2014 and 2015.
    Seasonal average leaf water potential at each SP could then be estimated from
    the model. Independent models were calculated for Ψs-m and Ψs-n. Following the
    empirical approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al. (2008), the spatial model
    tested in this study, is shown in Eq. (2). (2) Where corresponds to any of the
    92 locations where a δ13C value was measured corresponds to the reference site,
    where was measured throughout 18 dates. corresponds to any of the 18 dates when
    was measured at the reference site, is the estimated at each site, , and date,
    . is the auxiliary variable, , at each site, . is measured at the reference site,

    model extrapolates Ψ measured at the reference site, Ψ (Sre, tj), to any of the
    locations, si, where a δ13C value was measured. Hence, δ13C (s), accounts for
    the spatial variability of Ψ, while temporal variation is indicated by . The model
    was adapted to the case study following the same procedure considered by Herrero-Langreo
    et al. (2013) where a more extensive explanation on the methodology can be found.
    The comparison between CWSI and average seasonal Ψs-m and Ψs-n values was done
    using two different procedures. First, we interpolated maps for those variables
    onto a 3 × 3 m grid using block kriging performed with VESPER software (Minasny
    and McBratney, 2002), and compared them visually. Kriging is an interpolation
    procedure in which estimates of values at unsampled sites are interpolated on
    the basis of known values at georeferenced locations, weighted according to the
    parameters of the variogram – a model that describes variation within a dataset
    as a function of the distance or lag separating the samples comprising it (Bramley
    et al., 2011b). In our work, all variables were fitted to exponential models,
    taking as kriging parameters maximum distance = 100 m, 30 lags and 50% of lag
    tolerance. The second procedure for comparison was classifying CWSI in 3 and 5
    classes through fuzzy k-means cluster analysis, and then calculating mean Ψs-m
    and Ψs-n values for pixels belonging to each class with P > 0.8. Fuzzy k-means
    analyses and boxplots were obtained using R software. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Within-vineyard variability of agronomic variables The vineyard considered
    showed a relatively wide range of within-vineyard variability concerning vegetative
    growth, yield, berry weight and grape composition (Table 1a). In general terms,
    the range of variability embraced was high for all variables and the coefficients
    of variation were twice those reported in previous studies for the same variety
    in a neighbouring region (Baluja et al., 2012b, Urretavizcaya et al., 2016). That
    variability makes the field suitable for a precision viticulture based management
    (Urretavizcaya et al., 2014), aimed at decreasing variability or at segregating
    grape batches according to their composition. Although within-vineyard average
    values can be considered as adequate for quality wine making – according to regional
    standards for the variety-, the presence of less-ripen or “greener” grapes would
    impact negatively in wine organoleptic quality (Kontoudakis et al., 2011). Table

    Within-field variability in vine water status was also remarkable, δ13C ranging
    from −24.1‰ to −27.9‰ (Table 1a). These values, according to the scale proposed
    in (Santesteban et al., 2015), correspond to conditions ranging from nearly severe
    water stress to weak deficit. This variability in water status probably explains
    the variability in other agronomical variables, since water availability is known
    to be the major factor determining growth, yield and grape composition in semiarid
    areas (Medrano et al., 2014). The range of variability embraced by the WSP grid
    was smaller (Table 1b), but represented well the range of conditions observed
    in the denser SP grid. In fact, in most cases, WSP maximum and minimum values
    were similar to percentiles 5–95 in the SP grid, indicating that, in general terms,
    90% of within-vineyard variability is covered by the WSP grid. 3.2. Evaluation
    of the instantaneous variability in water status through thermal images Thermal
    image processing led to a map of CWSI distribution along the field (Fig. 4). A
    wide range of CWSI values was found (0.28–0.69), confirming the relevance of within-field
    variability observed with agronomic variables, and the pertinence of taking into
    account this variability. When CWSI values obtained from thermal images for the
    WSP were compared to instantaneous measurements in the field, they showed a relatively
    good correspondence with both Ψs and gs (Fig. 5, R2 > 0.65, P < 0.01), presenting
    lower values of Ψs and gs at the WSP with higher CWSI. The coefficients of determination
    are relatively high partly as one of the points monitored was clearly more stressed
    than the remaining ones, so when little variation in within-field water status
    exists correlation can be expected to be lower. Download : Download high-res image

    Stress Index values calculated from UAV-acquired thermal images and (a) stem water
    potential and (b) stomatal conductance measured at the WSP at the same time. The
    results obtained agree with those observed for thermal imaging in vineyards, either
    using a proxy (Fuentes et al., 2012, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Pou
    et al., 2014) or a remote (Baluja et al., 2012a, Bellvert et al., 2015a, Bellvert
    et al., 2015b, Bellvert et al., 2014) sensing approach. According to the principles
    established in early research regarding temperature sensing as an estimator of
    plant water status, plants having a greater water availability usually show increased
    transpiration, which leads to certain evaporative cooling and, as a consequence,
    to lower leaf temperature (Jackson et al., 1988, Jackson et al., 1981). Therefore,
    from this point of view, our results add further evidence on the suitability of
    this approach, and reinforce the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as
    an instantaneous water-stress mapping tool. 3.3. Evaluation of the seasonal variability
    in water status through thermal images Spatial modeling of stem water potential
    applied following the approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010a, Acevedo-Opazo
    et al., 2010b, Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2008) proved to be successful. The model
    allowed a good estimation of Ψs-m and Ψs-n at the WSP using the most stressed
    WSP as the reference site, and carbon isotope ratio measured the previous season
    (δ13C) in the SP as ancillary information (Fig. 6). Thus, it could then be used
    to estimate Ψs-m and Ψs-n values at the SP, subsequently represented as maps in
    Fig. 7(c, d), which displays how water status varied within the field. Download

    of spatial patterns From the visual comparison of the maps showed in Fig. 7, a
    recurrent spatial pattern, roughly agreeing to the topography of the field, can
    be observed for PCD, δ13C2014 and δ13C2015 datasets, which had been obtained independently.
    This pattern had also clear resemblances to ECa map, where a horizontal strip
    of higher ECa values matched areas of higher PCD and δ13C values. This coherence
    was not detected for the bottom-left part of the map, where ECa showed intermediate
    or even low values, whereas relatively high values of PCD, δ13C2014 and δ13C2015
    were observed. ECa measurements are probably integrating several soil characteristics
    of different relevance for plant performance, which explain those differences
    in behaviour (Brevik et al., 2006). The spatial distribution of Ψs-m and Ψs-n
    also followed the general pattern described above, although differences were attenuated
    at the right-top of the map, and exacerbated at the right-bottom. Last, the distribution
    pattern of classic agronomic variables followed a very different structure, the
    eastern (right) part of the field showing higher values of plant trunk section
    (TCSA), yield and berry weight (BW), and lower berry sugar content (TSS). CWSI
    estimated from thermal imaging followed a pattern that could be interpreted as
    a combination of the two major patterns described above (Fig. 4). On one side,
    a horizontal strip of higher CWSI appeared in the middle of the field, though
    much milder levels of water stress were detected at the lower part of the map.
    On the other side, certain degree of differentiation between the left and the
    right part of the map can also be appreciated. It is interesting to highlight
    that the highest CWSI values were found at the right-top of the map, corresponding
    exactly with the biggest and most productive vines. This behaviour, can be regarded
    as anomalous at first sight, but matches the water dynamics in this vineyard.
    According to the expert knowledge of the technical staff in the owning winery,
    that area has a deep soil, but much more gravely than the rest of the field and,
    as a consequence, lower water holding capacity. According to owners experience,
    that part of the field usually shows a very active growth in spring and early
    summer, and usually a high crop. However, when deficit conditions occur – from
    July on – soil water depletion happens faster, and plants end the season with
    greater water stress than other parts in the field. This behaviour can be explained
    as higher leaf area (Reynolds and Heuvel, 2009) and higher crop load (Miller et
    al., 1997, Naschitz and Naor, 2005) enhance water consumption and, as a consequence,
    can result in decreased water reservoirs from mid-season on. Thus, although at
    some fields information provided by CWSI could be redundant to that provided by
    vegetation indices, such as NDVI or PCD, it was not the case in this vineyard.
    It is common to assume that higher vigour areas will experience milder water stress,
    but under some circumstances such as those described here (deeper soils with lower
    water holding capacity), some parts of the field having greater leaf area (estimated
    through PCD), could experience higher water deficit at the end of the season.
    b. Correspondence between CWSI classes and other variables CWSI pixel values were
    classified in three and five classes using fuzzy k-means. For each class, the
    values of the remaining variables calculated for each pixel were examined through
    boxplots (Fig. 8, Fig. 9). When three classes were defined (Fig. 8), the correspondence
    between CWSI classes and seasonal water status related parameters was very low.
    Only a certain trend to lower δ13C2015 for increasing values of CWSI was observed,
    and no correspondence at all for Ψs-m and Ψs-n. However, there was a much higher
    degree of agreement between CWSI and other variables. PCD was observed to be higher
    at lower CWSI and, specially, very neat correspondence was found between CWSI
    and agronomical variables, higher CWSI plants showing higher values of TCSA, higher
    yields, bigger berries and a decreased sugar content (TSS). When cluster analysis
    was used to define five CWSI classes (Fig. 9), a very similar pattern was found,
    CWSI holding a clearer relationship with yield, berry weight and sugar content
    than water status related variables. Download : Download high-res image (412KB)

    area (TCSA, cm2 vine−1); (h) yield (kg vine−1); (i) berry weight (BW, g); (j)
    total soluble solids (TSS, °Baume). Therefore, CWSI measured at early veraison
    estimated very well what was happening from an agronomic point of view between
    the onset of ripening (occurring at the time of measurement) and harvest. High
    CWSI classes were precisely those that had greater yield and bigger berries (Fig.
    8h, i; Fig. 9h, i), and showed a delayed sugar accumulation (lower TSS, Figs.
    8j and 9j). Variations in crop (sink size) have already been shown to play a major
    role to explain within-vineyard variations in grape composition in semi-arid areas
    (Urretavizcaya et al., 2016), as it constitutes one of the two components of source-to-sink
    balance, critical for grape quality (Howell, 2001). As mentioned above, higher
    yields enhance water consumption (Miller et al., 1997, Naschitz and Naor, 2005),
    and also cause lower sugar contents (Edson et al., 1995, Naor et al., 1997), especially
    under deficit conditions (Santesteban et al., 2011). On the contrary, CWSI measured
    at a single day did not provide a good estimation of variations of plant water
    status. The vineyard considered in the study showed a stable structure of variation
    in seasonal water status, as there was a big resemblance between berry δ13C measured
    in 2014 and 2015 (Fig. 7a, b). This stability agrees with that observed for water
    status in other vineyards when several years were compared (Acevedo-Opazo et al.,
    2010b, Herrero-Langreo et al., 2013, Taylor et al., 2010). The relationship between
    berry δ13C and water status has been widely proved for cv. ‘Tempranillo’ (Santesteban
    et al., 2012), and it is sensible to consider this spatial structure mirrors stem
    water potential pattern, estimated here through modeling. The fact CWSI measured
    in a single – but representative – day did not follow this seasonal pattern cannot
    be regarded to be indicative of a bad performance for this index (or for this
    data acquisition platform). In fact, high CWSI pixels corresponded to high yielding
    parts of the field where sugar accumulation was observed to be limited, possibly
    as during the last weeks before harvest available water was not enough for such
    a leaf area and crop load. Thus, CWSI calculated from high-resolution UAV-based
    thermal imaging has shown a high potentiality for precision vineyard management
    applications, and could be a complementary tool for the implementation of precision
    irrigation systems that, in the near future, would help grape growers to manage
    water resources in a sounder and more sustainable way. 4. Conclusions UAV-based
    thermal imagery has a great potential to map instantaneous variations in water
    status within a vineyard. The information provided by thermal images proved to
    be relevant at a seasonal scale as well, although it did not match seasonal trends
    in water status, but mimicked other physiological processes occurring during ripening.
    Therefore, if a picture of variations in water status is required, it would be
    necessary to acquire thermal images at several dates along the summer. Conflict

  analysis: 'The paper develops a method for predicting spatial patterns of soil water
    status for precise irrigation that integrates data from high-resolution apparent
    electrical conductivity (ECa) and soil moisture sensors in ECa-defined management
    zones. The authors assess the accuracy of the method by comparing predicted soil
    moisture status with measured values.


    The work is highly relevant to the point in the literature review outline that
    focuses on types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical
    sources. The paper specifically addresses the need for accurate spatial characterization
    of soil water status for variable rate irrigation systems that adjust application
    rates based on site-specific conditions. The authors'' method for predicting soil
    water status using ECa and soil moisture sensor data is a valuable contribution
    to the field.


    The three most relevant verbatim quotes from the paper are:


    1. "A method has been developed for predicting daily soil water status in ECa-defined
    zones; digital information available for uploading to a software-controlled automated
    variable rate irrigation system with the aim of improved water use efficiency."


    2. "ECa variations are primarily a function of soil texture, moisture content
    and cation exchange capacity in non-saline soils, and relationships can be developed
    between ECa, soil texture and moisture content to predict soil available water
    holding capacity (AWC) (Waine et al., 2000, Godwin and Miller, 2003, Hedley et
    al., 2008, Hedley and Yule, 2009)."


    3. "This research shows that a greater number of monitored soil moisture zones
    would be required for effective spatial irrigation scheduling in these highly
    variable, young alluvial soils."'

    step has been added to field capacity maps to spatially predict soil water status
    on any day using data obtained from a wireless soil moisture sensing network which
    transmitted hourly logged data from embedded time domain transmission (TDT) sensors
    in ECa-defined management zones. In addition, regular time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) monitoring of 50 positions in the study area was used to assess spatial
    variability within each zone and overall temporal stability of soil moisture patterns.
    Spatial variability of soil moisture within each zone at any one time was significant
    (coefficient of variation [% CV] of volumetric soil moisture content (θ) = 3–16%),
    while temporal stability of this pattern was moderate to strong (bivariate correlation,
    R = 0.52–0.95), suggesting an intrinsic soil and topographic control. Therefore,
    predictive ability of this method for spatial characterisation of soil water status,
    at this site, was limited by the ability of the sensor network to account for
    the spatial variability of the soil moisture pattern within each zone. Significant
    variability of soil moisture within each ECa-defined zone is thought to be due
    to the variable nature of the young alluvial soils at this site, as well as micro-topographic
    effects on water movement, such as low-lying ponding areas. In summary, this paper
    develops a method for predicting daily soil water status in ECa-defined zones;
    digital information available for uploading to a software-controlled automated
    variable rate irrigation system with the aim of improved water use efficiency.
    Accuracy of prediction is determined by the extent to which spatial variability
    is predicted within as well as between ECa-defined zones. Previous article in

    schedulingSoil water status 1. Introduction Spatial decision support tools for
    precise irrigation scheduling are needed to address unprecedented demands on global
    freshwaters by irrigation schemes (Sadler et al., 2005, Green et al., 2006, DeJonge
    et al., 2007). These decision support tools would ideally address the spatial
    and temporal variability of crop demand and soil supply and be compatible with
    recent advances in full automation of accurate sprinkler irrigation systems, such
    as centre pivot and lateral move irrigators (e.g. Peters and Evett, 2008, Kim
    et al., 2008). Centre pivot systems typically have high irrigation application
    efficiencies of 75–90% (Martin et al., 1990). In New Zealand, centre pivots have
    been found to have a field uniformity averaging 78% (McIndoe, 1999). Other systems,
    such as border-check irrigation, are generally less efficient, as the irrigator
    has limited control over the amount of infiltration during an irrigation event,
    and large losses are likely on permeable soils, or where runoff cannot be captured
    and reused for irrigation (Wood et al., 2007). Simultaneous to technological developments
    enabling more accurate delivery of irrigation water there has been an increasing
    awareness that in many situations it is best to vary the amount of water applied
    spatially, due to, for example: (i) variable crop demands, (ii) soil variability,
    and (iii) non-irrigation zones such as tracks, buildings and small water bodies
    over which the irrigator passes. Variable rate irrigation (VRI), recently dismissed
    as uneconomic (e.g. Lu et al., 2005), is receiving renewed interest as pressure
    on freshwater resources increases and technological improvements to hardware are
    made (Sadler et al., 2005). VRI addresses the need for improved water use efficiency
    of existing irrigation systems which use about 85% of allocated freshwaters world-wide
    (Jury and Vaux, 2007). Most variable rate systems concentrate on centre pivot
    technology, due to the potential to employ real-time sensing equipment, vary application
    rates and cover the entire field (DeJonge et al., 2007). Dukes and Perry (2006)
    report 93% coefficient of uniformity for a variable rate system, when tested in
    uniform rate mode. Several prototype systems for variable-rate irrigation application
    have been developed, but adequate decision support systems have not (Sadler et
    al., 2005). In order to increase practical functionality of precision irrigation;
    real-time monitoring, decision and control systems must be developed. Existing
    irrigation decision support systems include the modelling approach (regional or
    site-specific) (e.g. DeJonge et al., 2007, Humphreys et al., 2008), direct crop
    stress measurement (Green et al., 2006, Peters and Evett, 2008), soil moisture
    measurements (Blonquist et al., 2006, Kim et al., 2008, Vellidis et al., 2008)
    or a combination of these methods (e.g. Thompson et al., 2007). Modelling approaches
    use climatic data and a soil water balance to predict availability of water to
    a crop, with an inherent weakness of reliance on the quality of its data input
    which may or may not incorporate any real-time site-specific measurements. Rainfall
    data can vary significantly from regional data being used in the water balance
    component. Both Humphreys et al. (2008) and DeJonge et al. (2007) also acknowledge
    the importance of quality site-specific soil water hydraulic data for crop modelling.
    Modelling has useful predictive ability for yield, but there are limitations for
    real-time irrigation scheduling, where quality data which include the effects
    of site-specific rainfall, rooting depth and compaction zones are essential. Thompson
    et al. (2007) use a novel method for determining time for irrigation from crop
    stress assessed indirectly through soil moisture measurements. Onset of crop stress
    is indicated by a reduced apparent daily crop water uptake. Peters and Evett (2008)
    use a “temperature-time-threshold method”. Crop leaf temperature is used as an
    indicator of crop stress which is measured on a fully automated centre-pivot irrigation
    system, where infrared thermocouple thermometers are attached to the trusses of
    the pivot. A field datalogger is polled once a day at midnight to assess whether
    canopy temperature was above a threshold level. Peters and Evett compared this
    novel decision tool for irrigation onset with manual irrigation scheduling and
    found that there was no significant difference between the two methods. They conclude
    that the fully automated “temperature-time-threshold method” has the potential
    to simplify management, while maintaining the yields of intensely managed irrigation.
    Soil moisture monitoring decision tools for irrigation onset are perhaps the most
    widely used. Practically a farmer will walk over soils to assess visible signs
    of drying, or perhaps have some soil moisture monitoring sites. Recent advances
    have been made to automatically link soil moisture monitoring sites to software
    decision tools linked to irrigation systems (Blonquist et al., 2006, Vellidis
    et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2008). Blonquist et al. (2006) installed one TDT (time
    domain transmission) sensor in a 280 m2 field plot connected to a CS3500 Controller.
    The controller logged volumetric soil water content (θ) which it compared to an
    irrigation threshold, and was connected to the solenoid valve on the irrigation
    line supplying water to the irrigation system. This system applied 53% less water
    than the conventional method. Vellidis et al. (2008) extended this approach to
    a smart sensor array for measuring soil moisture and scheduling irrigation in
    a 2.3 ha cotton field. The sensor array consisted of nodes placed into four irrigation
    management zones based on soil type, soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    and historic yield maps. Similarly, Kim et al. (2008) used a wireless sensor network
    to link soil moisture monitoring sites to software control of a site-specific
    precision linear-move irrigation system. This system provides an excellent example
    of what is now possible for full automated control of an irrigation system using
    a distributed wireless sensor network. These previous three examples use “on-the-spot”
    ECa targeted soil moisture monitoring sites to direct irrigation. However further
    research is desirable to fully address spatial variability of soil water supply
    to the crop. ECa mapping, when employing a real-time kinematic differential global
    positioning system (RTK-DGPS), easily defines soil spatial variability at resolutions
    of less than a metre. Therefore the opportunity exists to not only use the ECa
    map to target soil moisture monitoring sites, as illustrated above, but also to
    calibrate the ECa map against soil water holding properties, so that a soil water
    status map can be produced, for spatial irrigation scheduling, available for upload
    to a fully automated variable rate irrigation system. ECa variations are primarily
    a function of soil texture, moisture content and cation exchange capacity (e.g.
    Hedley et al., 2004, Sudduth et al., 2005) in non-saline soils, and relationships
    can be developed between ECa, soil texture and moisture content to predict soil
    available water holding capacity (AWC) (Waine et al., 2000, Godwin and Miller,
    2003, Hedley et al., 2008, Hedley and Yule, 2009). Alternatively ECa has been
    directly related to laboratory-assessed AWC (R2 = 0.35–0.77) (Hezarjaribi and
    Sourell, 2007) and field-assessed AWC (R2 = 0.67–0.87) (Jiang et al., 2007), where
    field capacity (FC) and wilting point (WP) were assessed in the field. Hezarjaribi
    and Sourell (2007) discuss that there are three options to delineate different
    AWC zones in the field: (1) grid soil sampling, (2) remote sensing reflectance
    and (3) a ground-based sensor method; and that the third method is preferable
    being fast, affordable, non-destructive and with high spatial resolution. They
    used ECa mapping to define zones for targeted soil sampling—and FC and WP were
    then assessed in the laboratory on air-dried, crushed and 2-mm sieved samples,
    with AWC estimated as the difference. As unprecedented demand on global freshwaters
    for irrigation continues it is increasingly important to develop a practicable,
    affordable method suitable for commercial uptake which significantly improves
    water use efficiency and simplifies management. Our present research therefore
    aims to produce daily soil water status maps available for upload as shapefiles
    to an automated variable rate centre pivot with the goal of simplified management
    of irrigation systems and greater water use efficiency. The method is developed
    to be appropriate for uptake by practitioners, and this paper describes our method
    development. It: (i) uses high resolution ECa sensor data and soil characterisation
    of ECa-defined zones to develop a relationship between ECa and soil AWC and FC
    for map development, (ii) adds a daily time step to the FC map producing daily
    soil water status maps, and (iii) assesses the accuracy of these maps by defining
    spatial and temporal variability of the soil moisture pattern within and between
    each ECa-defined management zone. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Trial site Our
    trial site is a 35.2 ha irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) field, near Bulls, in the
    Rangitikei River Catchment, Manawatu District, New Zealand (site position: S40°13′22.1″
    E175°17′46.4″). The region experiences a temperate climate with rainfall between
    900 and 1000 mm and approximately 1800 sunshine hours per annum. Seasonal dry
    periods vary from year to year, but commonly irrigation would be used between
    the months of December and March. A 600-m Valley centre pivot is employed here.
    Three years of yield mapping shows that yields vary greatly within this 35.2 ha
    field in any one-year, making it an appropriate site for assessing whether site-specific
    management is desirable. The soils have formed in fine textured alluvium deposited
    by the River onto a gravel terrace surface, and the site borders a sand dune-sand
    plain system. The soils are mapped as Ohakea silt loams (Mottled, Immature Pallic
    soils; Hewitt, 1998). They are characterised by silt loam topsoils and mottled
    silt loam subsoils, which are between 0.6 to more than 1.0 m thick, above heterogeneous
    layers of sand and gravel. In places, sand has blown onto the terrace surface
    from an adjacent sand dune forming the Ohakea loamy sand (Mottled, Immature Pallic
    soil). The Ohakea loamy sand is characterised by a loamy sand topsoil over mottled
    silt loam subsoils over sands and gravels. There is moderate topographic variation,
    with an average slope of 0.92% and elevation difference of 4.6 m. 2.2. ECa soil
    survey An on-the-go electromagnetic induction (EMI) mapping system was employed
    to map soil ECa (Hedley et al., 2004). Soil EMI surveys provide a quantitative
    spatial assessment of soil ECa variability, which is used to define soil management
    zones for site-specific management (e.g. Vellidis et al., 2008). In addition,
    soil ECa is controlled by soil textural and moisture differences in non-saline
    soils, and therefore, as discussed in Section 1, there is potential to relate
    soil ECa to soil water holding characteristics. The system consists of a Geonics
    EM38© electromagnetic sensor, Trimble RTK-DGPS, on-board datalogger and Trimble
    Ag170 field computer for simultaneous acquisition of high resolution positional
    and ECa data. The sensor was towed, in vertical mode, on a rubber mat behind an
    all-terrain farm vehicle at an average speed of 10–15 kph, and sensor data was
    logged at 1-s intervals, equating to a measurement recorded approximately every
    4 m. Swath widths were 12 m apart. The RTK-DGPS system, in high accuracy mode,
    has a horizontal accuracy of ±10 mm and a vertical accuracy of ±20 mm. The survey
    was conducted on 29 August 2007. Filtered data comprising latitude, longitude,
    height above mean sea level and ECa (mS m−1) were then imported into ArcGIS (Environmental
    Systems Research Institute, ESRI© 1999). Points were kriged in Geostatistical
    Analyst (ESRI© 1999) using a spherical semivariogram and ordinary kriging to produce
    a soil ECa prediction surface map. Three management zones were defined on this
    map (using Jenks natural breaks) for further soil sampling. 2.3. Characterisation
    of ECa-defined soil zones 2.3.1. Hydraulic characterisation The soil hydraulic
    properties in each of the three zones were investigated by soil sampling at three
    representative sites in each zone. Intact soil cores, 100 mm diameter and 80 mm
    in height, were taken from the middle of three sample depths (0–200 mm, 200–400
    mm, 400–600 mm) for laboratory characterisation of bulk density and soil moisture
    release characteristics (5 and 10  kPa); smaller cores (50 mm diameter and 20
    mm in height) were taken for soil moisture release at 100 kPa. A bag of loose
    soil was also collected (0–200 mm, 200–400 mm, 400–600 mm soil depth) for lab
    estimation of permanent wilting point (1500 kPa) (Burt, 2004, Gradwell, 1972)
    and particle size distribution. Total available water holding capacity (AWC) was
    estimated as θ1500 kPa − θ10 kPa where θ10 kPa is taken as field capacity and
    θ1500 kPa is wilting point. Readily available water holding capacity (RAWC) was
    estimated as θ100 kPa − θ10 kPa. Soil ECa was determined at the time of sampling
    at each position, as the mean of six hand-held measurements. 2.3.2. Particle size
    distribution Percent sand, silt and clay was determined on these soil samples
    by organic matter removal, clay dispersion and wet sieving the >2-mm soil fraction
    and then by a standard pipette method for the <2-mm soil fraction (Claydon, 1989).
    2.4. Soil moisture modelling and monitoring 2.4.1. Daily soil water balance modelling
    A meteorological station was installed on-site to collect hourly rainfall, wind
    speed, solar radiation, and air temperature data. These data was used to calculate
    a daily evapotranspiration rate, using the FAO Penman–Monteith equation (Allen
    et al., 1998). Vapour pressure was estimated from the minimum daily temperature.
    A water balance model was developed which included a dual crop coefficient (Allen
    et al., 1998) to predict the effects of intermittent irrigation wetting events
    on basal crop transpiration and soil evaporation separately. Daily adjustments
    were made for crop height and development stage for the maize grain crop; and
    all daily irrigation events were logged. The water balance model was used to calculate
    a daily soil moisture deficit (SMD), using zone-specific AWC values, but does
    not account for available water sourced via capillary rise from a high water table,
    or lateral flow. Any effects of capillary rise and lateral flow on plant-available
    water storage were assessed by noting depth to water table and distance from sand
    dunes. Scotter (1989) reports that the equivalent depth of plant-available water
    increases substantially from 26 to 183 mm as the water table rises from 1.2 to
    0.4 m in sandy soils adjacent to the present study site. The effects of lateral
    flow from higher to adjacent lower areas is shown to be important over distances
    of 400 m, and can provide further plant-available water (Scotter, 1989). TDT soil
    moisture measurements were used to monitor soil moisture changes to include any
    contribution of available water due to capillary rise (from a high water table)
    and lateral flow (from adjacent sand dunes) to each zone. 2.4.2. TDT soil moisture
    monitoring of ECa-defined soil zones Soil moisture was logged hourly during the
    growing season by a TDT Aquaflex© soil moisture sensor network, with one sensor
    installed into representative positions in each of the three zones (low, intermediate,
    high ECa) defined from the ECa map. The three metre long sensors were installed
    diagonally from a depth of 50 to 600 mm to provide a mean value for θ (0–600 mm)
    for an equivalent soil volume of 6 L. This depth was selected to include the majority
    of the maize root zone, estimated by previous researchers on a similar soil type
    in the same climatic region (Aslam, 2005) and confirmed by visual pit inspections
    at this trial site. A radio aerial mounted on a 3.5 metre mast wirelessly transmitted
    hourly soil moisture data to a remote PC in the farm office. 2.4.3. TDR assessment
    of spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture within and between zones
    TDR wave-guides were installed, to 450 mm soil depth, at 50 sites in the 35.2
    ha maize field (Fig. 1). The positions were ≥50 m apart on a grid pattern (see
    Fig. 1). Measurements were taken six times during the growing season between November,
    when the soils were at field capacity, and the end of March towards the end of
    grain drying, to assess (i) spatial variability of θ within and between zones,
    and (ii) temporal stability of the soil moisture pattern. Download : Download

    positions in Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3 respectively). 2.4.4. Daily time step for
    soil water status mapping The high-resolution (<1 m) soil ECa dataset was used
    to produce a soil ECa map with three soil zones (Section 2.2). AWC and FC was
    determined for each of these 3 zones (Section 2.3.1); and soil moisture changes
    were modelled (Section 2.4.1) and measured (Section 2.4.2) on a daily basis for
    each zone. Soil sampling at 9 positions (3 replicates in each of 3 zones) provided
    9 values for soil AWC and FC (Section 2.3.1), each with a corresponding soil ECa
    value. These data was used to investigate relationships between (i) AWC and ECa,
    and (ii) FC and ECa. A relationship between soil ECa and FC was used to produce
    a soil FC map, and the AWC data was used to determine an irrigation trigger point
    (θtrigger) for each FC value, based on a known crop-specific depletion factor
    of 0.55AWC for maize grain (Allen et al., 1998). The modelled daily soil moisture
    values for each position (Section 2.4.1) or zone (Section 2.4.2) were then investigated
    for use to modify the sensor data on a daily basis so that the day on which irrigation
    is required could be predicted spatially. 3. Results 3.1. Soil ECa map and zone
    characteristics The soil ECa map reflects soil and topographic differences observed
    at this site (Fig. 1; Table 1), which are classified into three zones (low, medium,
    high ECa), with a 33 m range of spatial dependence of ECa values, indicated by
    variogram analysis (Table 2). Table 1. Soil characteristics of the three ECa-defined

    mS m−1) along the NE side of the field borders a sand dune and delineates a region
    where soil profiles are characterised by about 200 mm of black sand overlying
    a silt loam subsoil. These Zone 1 soils have higher sand content (61.0%) compared
    with the other two zones (Zone 2 = 35%; Zone 3 = 12%), (Table 1). Clay content
    increases from 8.3% in Zone 1 to 13.0% in Zone 2 and 26.8% in Zone 3 (Table 1).
    Finer textured soils in Zone 2 occur on flatter surfaces, and the finest textured
    silt loam soils in Zone 3 typically occur in wet hollows and channels where water
    will preferentially flow to and settle in during wet periods, increasing the susceptibility
    of these zones to soil compaction. Zone 1 soils have lowest FC (0.30 m3 m−3) but
    largest AWC (0.19 m3 m−3) and RAWC (0.09 m3 m−3) compared with the other two zones,
    reflecting a greater proportion of pores at the size range required to hold available
    water for plant use (0.0002–0.03 mm). Zone 3 soils retain a greater proportion
    of their water at lower matric potentials, with a relatively high θ of 0.26 m3
    m−3 at WP, compared with 0.14 m3 m−3 (Zone 2) and 0.11 m3 m−3 (Zone 1). This is
    illustrated by the graph of soil water retentivity data (Fig. 2), relating soil
    matric potential (the energy that the water is held by the soil) to volumetric
    water content (θ), and reflects the finer textured soils in Zone 3. Download :

    The relationship of soil ECa to soil water holding properties reflects the major
    influence of soil texture and moisture on soil ECa (Hedley et al., 2004, Sudduth
    et al., 2005); the soil providing more conducting pathways for the electric current
    induced by the EM38 sensor as texture becomes finer and soil moisture content
    increases. 3.2. Soil moisture modelling and monitoring Fig. 4 plots the soil water
    balance-predicted soil moisture for each zone and compares it with TDT measured
    values (one mean value to 600 mm). It clearly shows that the soil water balance
    is underestimating soil θ, providing evidence for additional supply of water from
    a high water table and/or lateral flow from adjacent sand dunes. Therefore, for
    this study, the measured TDT values (θtdt) provide more accurate prediction of
    daily soil moisture changes in each zone than modelled values (θwbal). Download

    ECa-defined soil zones measured by TDT (0–600 mm) and TDR (0–450 mm) and modelled
    by water balance (wbal). Fig. 4 also shows that TDR determined mean values (θtdr)
    (mean value to 450 mm) for each zone fall between θwbal and θtdt. This suggests
    that a component of water contributed via capillary rise or lateral flow is from
    depths below 450 mm. In Zone 1, θtdr and θtdt show closer agreement suggesting
    that a greater proportion of the water supplied to this zone (above that predicted
    by the soil water balance) is in the 0–450 mm soil depth. This zone is the most
    likely zone to benefit from lateral movement of soil water being adjacent to sand
    dunes. Fig. 5 shows θtdt and θtrigger plotted for the period of irrigation (21/11/07
    to 12/03/08), and during this period 290 mm of irrigation was applied, and there
    was 154 mm rainfall. This data was used to predict daily soil water status in
    each soil zone and compare it with zone specific θtrigger. Download : Download

    assessment of spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture within and between
    soil ECa zones Site mean θtdr (n = 50) to 450 mm soil depth had a % coefficient
    of variation (%CV) ranging between 9 and 14% for the 6 TDR survey dates (Table
    3). The 14/11/07 mean θtdr (n = 50) for this 35.2 ha field, when soils were at
    FC, had the smallest % CV of 9% compared with the other survey dates. After this
    date soil moisture spatial variability increased as soils drained at different
    rates, depending on their pore size distribution and position in the landscape.

    the 3 ECa-defined zones. This information can be used to assess how accurately
    one predicted soil θ value for each zone represents the whole zone. It indicates
    that, for this case study, the small differences observed between each zone θ
    at any one time, explained by soil textural and structural differences (Table
    2), are not significantly different. Spatial variability within each zone is considerable
    and this is most likely controlled by local topographic features which control
    soil water movement, such as hollows and ridges (Lavado Contador et al., 2006,
    Kaleita et al., 2007). In addition our results suggest contributions via lateral
    flow from adjacent sand dunes (Zone 1) and capillary rise from a seasonally high
    water table in low-lying areas. The water table was observed to rise to 0.8 m
    below the soil surface in low-lying areas during the winter months. The TDR data
    (n = 50) was also used to assess the temporal stability of the spatial pattern
    (Fig. 6). A scatterplot matrix of TDR surveys against each other (Fig. 6) illustrates
    that there was moderate–significant temporal stability of this soil moisture pattern
    (bivariate correlations range from 0.52 to 0.95) which was most obvious when the
    soils were comparatively dry in March, after irrigation had stopped and grain
    drying was occurring (R > 0.9). A 95% bivariate normal density ellipse is imposed
    on each scatterplot. Site-specific management based on a spatial model prediction
    of soil water status would be impracticable if soil drying patterns were largely
    random with time across a landscape. However, these results support data presented
    by other researchers that spatial variability is far more stable in time than
    would be expected from random processes (Starr, 2005, Kaleita et al., 2007). Vachaud
    et al. (1985) suggest that this temporal stability is largely explained by relationships
    between soil texture and water content; and work by Da Silva et al. (2001) supports
    this hypothesis. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. (a) Bivariate correlations
    and (b) scatterplot matrix of soil moisture content values measured by TDR at
    50 sites. Therefore although there was significant spatial variability within
    zones, this variability was temporally stable to some extent, so that, if defined,
    the spatial variability could be managed. Many more soil moisture sensors would
    be required at this site to characterise the spatial variability for variable
    rate irrigation scheduling. 3.4. Soil water status mapping Regression equations
    developed between ECa (mean of 6 hand-held measurements) and lab-estimated AWC
    (adj. R2 = 0.76, n = 9) and FC (adj. R2 = 0.77, n = 9) (Fig. 3; Section 3.1),
    were used to predict AWC and FC from sensor data. θtrigger was then also predicted
    for each ECa value. The 0.55AWC depletion factor suggested by Allen et al. (1998)
    was used in this study as a trigger for irrigation scheduling. Other workers use
    an allowable depletion of 0.50 (DeJonge et al., 2007) and 0.60 (flood irrigation)
    and 0.70 (sprinkler irrigation) (Humphreys et al., 2008), although Humphreys et
    al. (2008) report that using these thresholds the maize crop was under-irrigated.
    A zone identification code was also added to each ECa data point (Table 4). Table

    class range on the ECa map; AWC  = −0.86E + 33.36 (Fig. 3a); FC  = 0.63E + 20.04
    (Fig. 3b); θtrigger determined as 0.55 AWC; θtdt_day x measured in each zone on
    day x. The sensor dataset was updated each day by updating θtdt for each zone,
    so that the sensor dataset can be used for spatially defined irrigation scheduling.
    Irrigation is scheduled for any unique position when θtdt_day x < θtrigger. This
    spatially defined digital data is available to drive a software alert system to
    an automated variable rate irrigation system, so that sprinklers can be switched
    on for each spatially defined zone. 4. Discussion A method has been described
    for spatial prediction of daily soil water status, using a FC map derived from
    the relationship of ECa to FC, with the addition of a daily time step by continuous
    monitoring of soil moisture wetting and drying patterns in each zone. Daily TDT
    soil moisture data were used in preference to water balance modelling to more
    accurately assess additional inputs of water as lateral flow and capillary rise.
    The spatial variability of soil moisture measurements within each ECa-defined
    zone at any one time is large (%CV = 3.21–16.09) which limits the accuracy of
    the soil water status maps at this site. Whelan and McBratney (2000) explain that
    spatial variability must be correctly characterised for effective site-specific
    management. If this is not possible, then the “null hypothesis” of precision agriculture
    applies, i.e. uniform rate application is more appropriate than variable rate
    application. Spatial differences in soil moisture are likely to be one controlling
    factor influencing yield, but if they cannot be realistically modelled they cannot
    be addressed. Whelan and McBratney (2000) report a median CV% of 9% for a number
    of θ values measured over a range of sampling scales from a comprehensive literature
    review. Median CV%, a measure of spatial variation for θ (at any one time) varies
    between 3.2% and 15.9% for the three ECa defined zones at this site, where sampling
    scales of 50–100 m were used. It is preferable to assess the spatial structure
    of soil moisture measurements using a variogram, and Whelan and McBratney (2000)
    report a median apparent range of spatial dependence of 22 m, from their review.
    Kaleita et al. (2007) used variograms to explore the geospatial structure of soil
    moisture content of a 3.3 ha research site, and found that 10 m was an appropriate
    cell size for precision agriculture operations at this site. Sadler et al. (2002)
    also discuss the importance of management zone size. Variogram analysis of θ was
    not conducted at this site due to insufficient soil moisture data points (n =
    50). Kerry and Oliver (2008) suggest that a minimum of 100 data points is required
    to compute a reliable variogram to assess spatial structure of this soil attribute.
    However ECa relates well to soil hydraulic properties and variogram analysis of
    soil ECa shows that soil variability, on a basis of soil texture and moisture,
    has a spatial dependence of 33 m (Table 2), which indicates the potential density
    of soil moisture monitoring sites required to characterise the soil hydraulic
    characteristics influencing soil water status at this site. The assessment of
    temporal stability of θ pattern in this study by regressing θtime x against θtime
    y showed that ≥52% of the observed variability could be explained. 77% of the
    observed variability was explained between November and December surveys, before
    irrigation commenced. Least temporal stability was observed between the last non-irrigated
    survey and first irrigated survey, suggesting that the irrigation system has an
    effect on the soil moisture pattern. The pattern was most temporally stable as
    the soils dried out at the end of the growing season, with 84–95% explained between
    February and March surveys. The temporal stability of soil moisture patterns is
    attributed to dependence on relatively stable properties such as topography and
    soil particle class (Starr, 2005). Tomer and Anderson (1995) found that 51–77%
    of spatial variability in soil water content was explained by elevation, slope,
    and hillside curvature, in a sandy hill slope; while Da Silva et al. (2001) found
    that clay content and C content and to a lesser extent tillage method influenced
    soil water storage patterns over time. This research shows that a greater number
    of monitored soil moisture zones would be required for effective spatial irrigation
    scheduling in these highly variable, young alluvial soils. Recent technological
    advances in distributed wireless sensor networks (e.g. Kim et al., 2008) are facilitating
    low energy, high density monitoring of soil moisture. Micro-sensors are being
    developed with on-board power supply, computational capability and ability to
    detect and communicate with other sensors in a network, thus providing affordable
    opportunities for larger numbers of sensors to be included into spatial irrigation
    scheduling decision support tools in the near future. 5. Conclusions A high resolution
    ECa datalayer has been used to target zones for characterising soil hydraulic
    properties, which relate well to ECa. A method has been developed for interpolation
    of AWC and FC prediction surfaces, and real-time soil moisture monitoring has
    been used to predict soil water status within each zone. The accuracy of this
    prediction is limited by significant spatial variability of the soil moisture
    pattern within ECa-defined zones which was larger than differences between zones.
    To improve the accuracy of prediction, and facilitate variable rate irrigation
    scheduling, a larger number of ECa-defined zones would need to be characterised
    and monitored. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Hew Dalrymple,

  analysis: In this study, a rule-based fuzzy logic system is developed for determining
    the speed of a central pivot in a variable rate irrigation system (VRI). The authors
    utilize remote sensing data to gather data on leaf development, soil moisture,
    and canopy temperature. They suggest that the fuzzy logic system is more realistic
    than traditional methods for crop management because it can account for spatial
    variability in the crop. From the perspective of a traditional control, the relay
    from pivot percent timer should have been adjusted from 70% to 35% whenever the
    central pivot passed over that specific area. The proposed system obtained values
    of 37% and 47% to adjust the pivot percent timer. Therefore, it is possible to
    affirm that traditional control models used for central-pivot irrigators do not
    support the necessary precision to meet the demands of speed control determined
    by the developed VRI systems.

    • Variable rate irrigation speed control was enhanced using spatial variability.
    • Increasing or decreasing the rotation speed of central pivot using fuzzy system.
    • Combining edaphoclimatic variables to fuzzy logic can solve problems in irrigation.
    • Expert system using remote sensing can manage the speed control for central
    pivot. Abstract Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is the capacity to spatially vary
    the depth of water application in a field to handle different types of soils,
    crops, and other conditions. Precise management zones must be developed to efficiently
    apply variable rate technologies. However, there is no universal method to determine
    management zones. Using speed control maps for the central pivot is one option.
    Thus, this study aims to develop an intelligent fuzzy inference system based on
    precision irrigation knowledge, i.e., a system that can create prescriptive maps
    to control the rotation speed of the central pivot. Satellite images are used
    in this study because remote sensing offers quick measurements and easy access
    to information on crops for large irrigation areas. Based on the VRI-prescribed
    map created using the intelligent decision-making system, the pivot can increase
    or decrease its speed, reaching the desired depth of application in a certain
    irrigation zone. Therefore, considering the spatial variability in the crop has
    made the strategy of speed control more realistic than traditional methods for
    crop management. The intelligent irrigation system pointed out areas with lower
    leaf development, indicating that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing
    the water layer applied to that area. The existence of well-divided zones could
    be observed; each zone provides a specific value for the speed that the pivot
    must develop for decreasing or increasing the application of the water layer to
    the crop area. Three quarters of the total crop area had spatial variations during
    water application. The set point built by the developed system pointed out zones
    with a decreased speed in the order of 50%. From the viewpoint of a traditional
    control, the relay from pivot percent timer should have been adjusted from 70%
    to 35% whenever the central pivot passed over that specific area. The proposed
    system obtained values of 37% and 47% to adjust the pivot percent timer. Therefore,
    it is possible to affirm that traditional control models used for central-pivot
    irrigators do not support the necessary precision to meet the demands of speed
    control determined by the developed VRI systems. Results indicate that data from
    the edaphoclimatic variables when well-fitted to the fuzzy logic can solve uncertainties
    and non-linearities of an irrigation system and establish a control model for
    high-precision irrigation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    system 1. Introduction The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
    Nations estimates that to meet food demands in 2050 agriculture production must
    at least double or triple in the next 40 years, and 80% of this increase must
    come from increasing the production. Considering the limited resources of our
    planet, reaching this goal will be challenging (FAO, 2016). The adoption of irrigated
    agriculture enables increased productivity and the production of several crops
    (Borghetti, Silva, Nocko, Loyola, & Chianca, 2017). However, with the growing
    limitation of water resources, the use of water in agriculture must be more efficient
    to maintain the current levels of productivity in conjunction with the expansion
    of irrigated areas. Decisions for irrigation management require taking into consideration
    inter-related economic, physical, and biological variables, which are frequently
    difficult to foresee and over which there is little or no control (Herrera, Ibeas,
    & de la Sen, 2013). The decade-long search for automated solutions to improve
    agricultural application for more efficient use (Evans and King, 2012, Gilley
    et al., 1983, Omary et al., 1997, Sadler et al., 1996) has resulted in the introduction
    of several solutions for agricultural inputs to conduct water application with
    spatial correction. Irrigation systems that operate using variable rate water
    application are required for a spatial water management to increase crop efficiency
    (Armindo, Botrel, & Garzella, 2011). Decision support systems for irrigation and
    water conservation are used intensely for minimizing water application and maximizing
    yield. However, the numerical optimization of irrigation systems is computer-intensive
    and often requires simplification and discretization of the model (Dogan et al.,
    2010, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). Furthermore, sensorial system and model integration
    do not reflect the natural flow of the environment (Voinov & Shugart, 2013), creating
    significant limitations in performance. Control systems also do not reflect or
    satisfy the requirements of the final users due to the lack of domain knowledge
    capture (McIntosh et al., 2011). The use of advanced control techniques is a promising
    possibility. Literature shows that these tools can significantly improve irrigation
    systems and efficient use of water resources (McCarthy et al., 2013, Romero et
    al., 2012). The final challenge of an environmental and agricultural support system
    is to overcome the uncertainty related to data quality and difficulties in remote
    sensing of large areas (Dutta et al., 2014, McCarthy et al., 2013). Moreover,
    the inter-related economic, physical, and biological variables are multi-attributed
    vaguely and in subjective terms. A neat approach to deal with such uncertain situations
    is found in the fuzzy set theory, which has now reached a mature state for expansion
    and application. Zadeh''s paper “Fuzzy Sets” was published in 1965; since then,
    the theory of fuzzy sets has been used for writing more realistic decision support
    models. Fuzzy logic can analyze the imprecise information and is efficient in
    decision-making for vague and uncertain phenomena (Kweon, 2012). Specialized systems
    that used fuzzy logic in its inception have been successfully applied to problems
    concerning decision, control, diagnose, and classification (Castillo & Melin,
    2008) because they are capable of managing intrinsic complex reasoning in an application
    area. In agriculture, the interface of these systems allows a natural and straightforward
    use, as a planning tool for the manager and farmer. In irrigation systems, the
    interaction between components is not always accurately defined. Fuzzy logic can
    be used in such systems for extracting inferences from an inaccurate input and
    for solving problems in this area (Thangavadivelu & Colvin, 1997). An irrigation
    system based on the fuzzy logic with simple rules is more attractive to most farmers
    (Bahat, Inbar, Yaniv, & Schneider, 2000) since these systems do not require a
    precise measurement or a precise model, which may be very complicated and require
    considerable funds, resources and development time. This study is based on the
    premise that irrigation problems do not require precise measures. The support
    system to the fuzzy decision is considered useful due to its interactive nature
    and flexible approach (Kumar and Rajkumar, 2014, Raju and Kumar, 2005); therefore,
    the integration of fuzzy logic and irrigation planning issues in the field is
    very effective. Herein, several control techniques for VRI have been presented,
    of which some use fuzzy inference and neural networks for setting the amount of
    water required for irrigation (Bing et al., 2015, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli,
    2015, Papadopoulos et al., 2011, Papageorgiou et al., 2016). Other techniques
    focus on determining when to irrigate and instruments that show spatial differences
    among sectors in the same crop area (Montalvo et al., 2013, Omid et al., 2010,
    Rafea et al., 2003). However, all the techniques mentioned do not present control
    maps for the central pivot, as proposed herein. The problem examined herein is
    part of the crop production domain, approaching the issue of necessary decision-making
    for precision irrigation. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop
    a fuzzy inference system that decides when to increase or decrease the speed of
    the central pivot by considering the spatial variability of the field and using
    little or imprecise information of the phenophase of the crop provided by satellite
    images. 2. Variable rate irrigation system (VRIS) An intelligent irrigation system
    was developed by following the structure shown in Fig. 1. The structure of the
    proposed system allows the elaboration of the management map in a systematic,
    autonomous, and automatized way to control the irrigation system. The commercial
    systems used more frequently by farmers still cannot draw such a control map using
    the proposed technique. Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download :

    vegetation index (NDVI) and canopy temperature Vegetation indexes generated from
    the data gathered by remote sensing constitute an important tool for monitoring
    natural or anthropogenic changes in the use and coverage of the land. These indexes
    have been used to estimate several vegetation patterns, such as leaf area index
    and green biomass quantity, as well as in the evaluation of soil use and the maintenance
    and recovery of degraded areas (Okin, 2007). Information from satellite images
    and values from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) reading, which
    is an essential parameter for irrigation maintenance, were used and adjusted according
    to local conditions. Irrigation management through the plant shows the complexity
    inherent to the visualization of the symptoms of water deficit, which are difficult
    to detect. In certain occasions, problems are discovered when it is too late,
    i.e., when their effects have already compromised the production and quality of
    the product. Usually, these symptoms are related to the color tone of leaves,
    leaf curling, and leaf angle. However, a correlation between NDVI values and the
    basal crop coefficient (Kc) (Hunsaker, Barnes, Clarke, Fitzgerald, & Pinter, 2005;
    and Kamble, Kilic, & Hubbard, 2013) can be established since a strong correlation
    exists between estimated Kc (KcNDVI) and observed Kc (Allen, Pereira, Raes, &
    Smith, 1998/FAO-56) in corn and soy crops for guiding irrigation times in the
    season. The use of canopy temperature and infrared thermometry is another way
    to relate to the development of the crop through remote sensing. A plant under
    water stress has decreased transpiration and would typically show a higher temperature
    than a plant that is not under stress (Bellvert, Zarco-Tejada, Girona, & Fereres,
    2014), a trait that could be used as a powerful tool to monitor and quantify water
    stress. Canopy temperature increases when solar radiation is absorbed (Idso &
    Baker, 1967), but it cools down when the latent energy or transpiration is used
    for evaporating water instead of cooling plant surfaces. Further, algorithms based
    on canopy temperature are strongly correlated with quantifiable results from crops
    (Colaizzi, O''Shaughnessy, Evett, & Howell, 2012), such as yield, water efficiency
    use, seasonal evapotranspiration, leaf water potential at noon, irrigation rates,
    and damage caused by herbicides. 2.2. Satellite imagery The Intelligent Environmental
    Knowledgeable system (i-ekbase)1 is an autonomous big data analytics engine running
    a CLOUD system. i-ekbase is an easy-to-use fully automated geographic information
    system (GIS). It primarily focuses on precision agricultural and biodiversity
    monitoring applications, automatically integrating data from various satellites
    with local weather data, farmers’ knowledge, and applying Machine Learning techniques
    to create a data-driven future for global agriculture (Dutta et al., 2014). Fig.

    all-purpose precision agricultural monitoring on a mobile device, for greater
    benefit to global agriculture community, and for increasing agriculture business
    profitability. The system services provide weekly or daily large area-wise resource
    management map products, including normalized vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture,
    biomass, surface temperature, vegetation landscape maps for supporting remote
    digital scouting, large area-wise farm monitoring and decision support system,
    and rapid intervention of a management issue. Herein, we used the i-ekbase system
    for capturing timely remote sensing imagery on the study site using Landsat (with
    a spatial resolution of 15 m) and Sentinel (with a spatial resolution of 10 m)
    satellites. Data were captured for 12 months for developing the experimental system.
    Data that compose this image have over 14 thousand geo-referential points, which
    indicate a raster type structure, containing in each point or pixel that attributes
    for agricultural analysis. Given the size of the data, only a few lines are shown
    in Table 1. Different types of software are available on the market, which can

    the web tool i-ekbase (Table 1), the information is pre-processed to filter the
    data that are not required by the decision-making system. Thus, only canopy temperature,
    upper layer soil moisture, NDVI, and coordinates are considered (Table 2). Table

    29.58 Source: adapted from the i-ekbase system (2017). For applying this approach
    on a commercial scale, remote sensing data required to describe the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relation can be acquired from satellite images (Moran, Inoue, & Barnes, 1997)
    and airplanes (Fitzgerald et al., 2006, Wood et al., 2003). However, high costs,
    spatial resolution, data frequency and data availability (Pinter et al., 2003,
    Trout et al., 2008), as well as satellite cloudless images (Barker, Heeren, Neale,
    & Rudnick, 2018) are challenges for the correct execution of models based on remote
    sensing; these factors can limit the efficiency of VRI management in real time.
    Remote sensing data that accurately describe the soil–plant–atmosphere relationship
    was selected for the intelligent irrigation system at the crop location. In this
    stage, accurately choosing the best data is fundamental to ensure that the results
    are calculated correctly. A simple but promising approach uses culture coefficients
    from normalized differentiated variation indexes, combined with local climate
    data, to assume the amount of ETc (evapotranspiration) of variable crops almost
    at real time (Er-Raki et al., 2007, González-Dugo and Mateos, 2008, Hunsaker et
    al., 2005). With some consideration of the daily meteorological conditions, models
    based on remote sensing can be used in studies of water relations (Barker et al.,
    2018) in the soil–plant–atmosphere system and could become an easy-to-use and
    fast response tool. Canopy temperature is also an important parameter to manage
    irrigation and must be adjusted according to local crop conditions. From the location
    selected for cultivation and the type of crop to be irrigated, in relation to
    the data linked to the type of plant, a crop coefficient will be used together
    with information from satellite images. In this case, NDVI reading, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature values will be used. 2.3. Crop area The
    crop area is a farm at Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, latitude
    15°14′24.73′′S and longitude 54°0′53.29′′W. This area contains several crops,
    such as soy, cotton, and “safrinha” corn, irrigated by a central pivot. The delimited
    area is 140 ha, with a radius of 667 m (see Fig. 3). The area delimited by the
    red circle is irrigated with a central pivot, and the information used in this
    study is for a cultivation cycle of “safrinha” corn in 2015/2016. To irrigate
    “safrinha” corn means to provide minimum water conditions for the development
    of the crop. Corn is highly sensitive to drought. Therefore, the occurrence of
    a period of lower water intake by plants in critical moments for the development
    of the crop, from flowering to physiological maturation, can lead to the lower
    yield. For maximum yield, corn plantation needs approximately 650 mm of water
    (Bergamaschi et al., 2001) during its cycle, which varies from 110 to 140 days
    in hybrids with an average cycle. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    archives. Plant development is made evident by the images captured by remote sensing
    during growth. After analyzing the NDVI values contained in Fig. 4, the similarity
    among values attributed to crop coefficient (Kc) can be verified (Hunsaker et
    al., 2005; and Kamble et al., 2013). As the crop develops, the leaf area increases,
    which makes it possible to establish a NDVI relationship. Download : Download

    in a crop cycle. Source: Author''s archives. This process is also described by
    Hunsaker et al. (2005), with relations for calculating the basal crop coefficient
    (Kcb) for cotton as a function of NDVI. When each of the development phases of
    the crop is analyzed, two distinct areas are evident: one with little growth and
    another with average growth. From this differentiation, it is possible to build
    a water demand map as well as speed control maps. For the preliminary analysis,
    the daily average precipitation data made available by National Institute of Meteorology2
    (INMET) were used. Data were collected from April to September 2016 in the municipality
    of Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. Fig. 5 illustrates the obtained
    data. Finally, precipitation readings recorded during the development of the crop
    under study corroborate with the premise of water stress due to the lack of rain,
    which would indicate the possibility of complementing the water demand with irrigation.

    Monitoring System. 2.4. Fuzzy systems Over the last 20 years, fuzzy systems have
    attracted considerable attention and have met great applicability in the agricultural
    domain, helping farmers to make the right decisions for their crops (Papageorgiou
    et al., 2016). For example, Bahat et al. (2000) proposed a solution for an irrigation
    controller based on the fuzzy logic methodology with simple rules, making the
    system more attractive for farmers. Raj and Kumar (2005) observed that the integration
    of fuzzy logic and real-world irrigation planning problems are very useful, particularly
    with multiple specialists in a subjective data environment. Upon using fuzzy systems
    for decision-making concerning irrigation, Zhang, Fei, Wei, Congcong, and Yuewei
    (2011) reported that fuzzy logic does not require all the relevant information
    for solving the problem of water in irrigation. Bing, Huifeng, and Xia (2015)
    developed a fuzzy system of decision-making for solving uncertainties and non-linearity
    of the irrigation system, and the model showed high precision. The system of fuzzy
    inference proposed by Almeida, Vieira, Marques, Kiperstok, and Cardoso (2013),
    in turn, provided a conceptual approach based on the multi-criteria decision-making
    process. This approach relates water use to environmental factors, such as drought,
    water exploration index, water use, population density, and wastewater treatment
    index, resulting in warnings about future water supply. Irrigation based on the
    fuzzy inference system presents better results than traditional methods. The fuzzy
    system will be used to infer the variations in the linear movement speed of the
    pivot according to satellite images. An intelligent system was developed, manipulating
    various data-driven approaches to create a control map. Due to the nature of the
    management of the study area, fuzzy systems are used herein to aid irrigation
    decision-making. Because a farmer''s decisions are purely intuitive and knowledge-based
    gained over years of work, we chose not to describe the way the farm works explicitly.
    Another critical piece in the farmer''s routine was that the pivot utilized extensive
    amount of time to perform a full turn. However, the central pivot irrigation system
    should operate 21 h a day, with 3 h for maintenance because high electricity prices
    are charged by the utility. Three input variables were used (NDVI, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature) to infer the speed, which the central pivot
    has to reach to improve the irrigation level within the crop area, and to find
    an adequate speed for the pivot movement in relation to the amount of water coming
    out of the sprinklers. Futhermore, a decision unit or inference machine is implemented
    using the Mamdani method to conduct the rule-based inference operations with crisp
    input and crisp output. Mamdani fuzzy systems use fuzzy sets as a consequent rule;
    therefore, the inference method for a set of conjunctive rules for the rth rule
    will be given by the following condition: (1) Within the objective proposed for
    the developed system, once linguistic variables are applied to the output of fuzzy
    inference systems, it becomes fitter for modeling the human reflection process.
    By doing so, the interface of the system becomes more straightforward and natural.
    In the first stage of development, the water layer provided by the irrigation
    system is considered constant. The database that defines the association functions
    of sets used in the fuzzy rules is implemented according to Table 3 and Fig. 6.

    to each system input. Source: Author''s archives. Remote sensing data allow building
    the universe of discourse for each input variable and therefore change the database
    into linguistic variables, as shown in Table 3. Each input was previously limited
    to the discourse universe in question and associated to the grade of membership
    in each fuzzy set through specialized knowledge. Therefore, to obtain the grade
    of membership of a certain crisp input, one must search for this value in the
    fuzzy system knowledge. The fuzzification of the decision-making system in Fig.
    6 helps to visualize the corresponding membership functions, considering these
    intervals as the discourse universe of the variables. Triangular membership functions
    were chosen because they simplify the calculation of the fuzzy inference mechanism
    and couple to the fuzzy rules IF-THEN (Wang, 1997). Well distributed triangular
    membership functions change input data into fuzzy values (low, average, and high),
    as shown in Fig. 6a, as well as values for soil moist and NDVI (Fig. 6b and c,
    respectively). Fuzzy outputs, which represent the rotation speed of the central
    pivot, were built from five linguistic variables: very low (MB), low (B), normal
    (N), high (A), and very high (MA). All the sets were interpreted based on their
    membership functions, as shown in Fig. 7. Several defuzzification methods have
    been proposed (Dubois & Prade, 2000), of which CENTROID (area center or center
    of gravity) is more widely used. For this method, a clear value of the output
    variable is calculated by finding the variable for the center of gravity of the
    association function for the fuzzy value (Jang, Sun, & Mizutani, 1997) as follows:

    inference result and ui is the position of the centroid of the individual membership
    functions. Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size

    Finally, the fuzzy rule relating to rotation speed contains 27 rules, as summarized
    in Table 3. Therefore, the reading of the first line, for example, is IF NDVI
    = Low AND Canopy Temperature = Low AND Soil Moisture = Low THEN Rotation Speed = Low.
    This set of rules is based on basic knowledge of irrigation, according to the
    methodology adopted in Bernardo, Soares, and Mantovani (2006) and Silva and Azevedo
    (1998). The rules were elaborated with the connective “AND” and are based on the
    premise that little leaf growth is due to water deficit in the soil (Boyer, 1968,
    Hsiao, 1973, Wright, 1977) along with high canopy temperature, which indicates
    low evapotranspiration, in other words, plants under water stress. Values of moisture
    close to the soil given by the web tool are local readings of spots with fewer
    leaves, making it possible to estimate its value. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Control maps for pivot rotation speed For mapping the speed control system herein,
    eight crop areas were stipulated with a level of ambiguity regarding the impact
    of the variable application rate (Feinerman & Voet, 2000), given that an increase
    in the flexibility of input application through field subdivision in a higher
    number of management unities did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the total
    (optimal) water use. The images showing different growth stages of the plantation
    were analyzed. The development stage [Kc-Development] was the one that presented
    the highest water stress in different planted areas, as shown in Table 5. Furthermore,
    performing the analysis of critical point was essential to demonstrate the applicability
    of fuzzy systems to create the control maps. Table 5. Analysis of the best dates

    The information extracted after pre-processing remote sensing data was NDVI, canopy
    temperature, and upper layer soil moisture. These values are the input data set
    for the fuzzy system, which is capable of inferring percentages for the central
    pivot rotation speed motion. The case study corresponds to the sampling of two
    readings obtained from different dates of the crop cycle: the first on June 15,
    2016 and the second on June 28, 2016. 3.2. Case study on June 15th, 2016 The input
    set for the intelligent fuzzy system is the analyzed and processed data on canopy
    temperature, moisture close to the soil, and NDVI (see Table 2) illustrated in
    Fig. 8a–c. The input, as shown in Fig. 8, was organized according to the linguistic
    variables of the fuzzy system and separated by tones for better visualization.
    Due to the nature of the central pivot speed control equipment, the output given
    by the fuzzy system was in percentage values. The per centimeter, which was responsible
    for rotational speed control, used only the reference percentage of rotation in
    relation to the time of 60 s. Thus, for the values of 50% (represented in orange
    in Fig. 9), the control made the pivot stay in operation for 30 s and off for
    30 s. The intelligent system obtained the result shown in Fig. 9, which illustrates
    different regions within the area, with different values for the pivot rotation
    speed. Download : Download high-res image (934KB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 9. Output data for the fuzzy inference system: rotation speed of the central
    pivot. Source: Author''s archives. Analysis of the input data identified the existence
    of two broad areas with lower leaf development, which could indicate a lack of
    water for development. After processing input data, the intelligent irrigation
    system showed these areas of lower leaf development in a more intense red tone.
    This indicates that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water
    layer in that specific location, because the rotation speed of the pivot determines
    the level of the water layer applied. A thinner water layer is applied with higher
    speed and a higher application of water in the soil occurs with lower rotation
    speed (Valín, Cameira, Teodoro, & Pereira, 2012). The expected result was the
    creation of control maps; in this case, it was possible to determine the reference
    speed values for eight initially programmed zones, as shown in Fig. 10. Moreover,
    areas that present different colors in Fig. 9 are shown in the control map result,
    which illustrates the existence of well-divided zones. In each one, a specific
    value is observed for the speed that the pivot must reach to increase or decrease
    the water layer in the crop area. Download : Download high-res image (181KB) Download

    3.3. Case study on June 28th, 2016 Data analyzed and processed by the SIG can
    be used as inputs for the fuzzy intelligent system. Fig. 11 shows the NDVI images,

    of input variables for the fuzzy system with linguistic definitions necessary
    for interpretation. The intelligent system of irrigation obtained the result shown
    in Fig. 12, which illustrates different regions within the crop area with different
    values of pivot rotation. A higher rotation speed implies the application of a
    thinner water layer, and a lower rotation speed leads to more water application
    in the soil, given that the application flow is kept constant in the sprinklers.

    and canopy temperature are essential for the decision-making process of the intelligent
    irrigation system. The large areas with a lower leaf development could indicate
    a lack of water for development. In the case of the output of the intelligent
    irrigation system, more intense red areas indicate that the pivot must reduce
    its speed. In this study, the reference values of the rotation speed of the pivot
    for the eight initially programmed zones of irrigation were determined, as shown
    in Fig. 13. In this result, the areas with different colors in Fig. 12 are the
    result of the control map constructed and are shown in Fig. 13. Irrigation zones
    were well divided, which makes it is possible to see an absolute value for the
    rotation speed of each pivot, increasing and decreasing the water layer applied
    to the cultivation area. The result shown in Fig. 13b corresponds to reference
    values to be sent to the pivot controller. Download : Download high-res image

    fuzzy system for irrigation control is original and innovative. No similar discussion
    in the scientific literature about speed control maps of the central pivot was
    found. Furthermore, there is no information available on commercial systems that
    can autonomously build this type of map. Experiments demonstrated the potential
    effectiveness of the pivot operation based on the differences between velocities
    by management zones. The system follows the definition of VRI; once the speed
    changes, there are changes in the amount of supplied water. In this context, fuzzy
    logic can be applied widely in agricultural areas; therefore, a decision support
    system can be build that has the knowledge of precision irrigation. The implementation
    of fuzzy logic decision support system was successful to develop prescription
    maps for VRI with central pivots. However, a broader and commercial application
    will depend on the integration of data collection systems, management strategies,
    and hardware control. In other words, the fuzzy logic model performed as expected,
    providing excellent results. However, the reliability of data sources (NDVI, surface
    soil water, and canopy temperature) to develop a reliable prescription map is
    the scope of future study. The future study will focus on the field implementations
    and determine whether any additional data (different types of data, high-quality
    data, and/or more frequent data) will be required for developing the map. In this
    analysis, the rotation speed control extracted through inference does not consider
    the volume of the water layer to be applied. The interpretation given by the fuzzy
    system is as follows: where there is variation in the plant growth, there will
    be variation in water demand. To solve this, more data should be collected to
    validate the system for various scenarios in near future. The results were favorable
    to the continuity of studies on precision irrigation and application of the fuzzy
    logic for creating central pivots irrigation systems maps. Future research should
    implement this decision support system into field trials to evaluate its ability
    to reduce irrigation pumping and/or improve crop yield. Contributorship statement

    To solve the complexities, the use of fuzzy theories and fuzzy intelligent systems
    is proper (Kokkonis, Kontogiannis, & Tomtsis, 2017; Mendes, Araújo, Dutta, & Heeren,
    2019; Mendes, Araújo, & Er-Raki, 2019). The concept of fuzzy logic was firstly

  analysis: 'Over the last two decades, the FAO56 method combined with a dual Kc approach
    has been widely employed for the estimation of crop evapotranspiration and irrigation
    scheduling. This study provides a detailed analysis of the dual Kc method and
    its implementation in the crop water balance model SIMDualKc. The applicability
    of the model under various cropping conditions and water scarcity scenarios was
    examined, and examples of model applications were illustrated.


    The accuracy of the dual Kc approach was evaluated by comparing simulated and
    observed soil water content and evapotranspiration data. The model was calibrated
    using field-measured soil water content and validated with observed evapotranspiration
    data. The model was found to be accurate in simulating both soil water content
    and evapotranspiration, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.6
    to 0.9. The model was also able to capture the effects of water stress on crop
    growth and yield.


    The model was applied to assess the impact of different irrigation scheduling
    practices on crop water use and yield. The results showed that the dual Kc approach
    can be used to optimize irrigation scheduling and improve water use efficiency.
    The model was also used to assess the impact of climate change on crop water requirements
    and irrigation scheduling. The results showed that climate change is likely to
    increase crop water requirements and require changes in irrigation scheduling
    practices.


    The study highlights the potential of the dual Kc approach for improving irrigation
    scheduling and water management. The SIMDualKc model is a valuable tool for researchers
    and practitioners in the field of irrigation and water management.'

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    the calibration of SIMDualKc for winter wheat in North China plain: (a) simulated
    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to

    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    Inner Mongolia, China, comparing a wet and a dry year with focusing on the groundwater
    contribution from a shallow water table (adapted from Wu et al., 2016). Results
    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

  title: Soil water balance models for determining crop water and irrigation requirements
    and irrigation scheduling focusing on the FAO56 method and the dual Kc approach
  verbatim_quote1: A first SWB model relative to paddy rice using the Kc-ETo approach,
    the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al. (1995). The model required not
    only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration of soil hydraulic properties
    determining the computation of percolation adopting a Darcy approach, as well
    as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage ditches.
  verbatim_quote2: An application of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped
    under center-pivot irrigation in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used
    herein as example of assessing beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout
    the crop cycle.
  verbatim_quote3: A main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling
    is to use short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation
    scheduling and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance
    (Kusunose and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017).

  analysis: '**Types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical
    sources**


    The types of data most commonly used for automated irrigation management are weather,
    soil, and plant data. The specific data that are collected and used vary depending
    on the site-specific conditions and the irrigation system being used, but some
    of the most common data include:


    - Weather data: Weather data includes information such as temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation. This data is important for scheduling irrigation
    because it can help to determine how quickly water is evaporating from the soil
    and plants, how much water the plants are using, and how much water is needed
    to replace the water that is being lost.

    - Soil data: Soil data includes information about the soil''s texture, structure,
    and water-holding capacity. This data is important for scheduling irrigation because
    it can help to determine how much water the soil can hold and how quickly water
    will drain from the soil.

    - Plant data: Plant data includes information such as the plant''s growth stage,
    leaf area, and water use. This data is important for scheduling irrigation because
    it can help to determine how much water the plants need at different stages of
    growth.


    The typical sources of data for weather, soil, and plant data include:


    - Weather data: Weather data can be collected from a variety of sources, including
    weather stations, satellites, and weather forecasting services.

    - Soil data: Soil data can be collected from soil samples that are taken from
    the field.

    - Plant data: Plant data can be collected from direct observation of the plants
    or from sensors that are attached directly to the plants.


    UAS thermal imaging cameras are well suited to monitor and assess crop water status
    using certain indices because they can estimate canopy temperature, a primary
    driver of CWSI, and because they are able to quickly and easily collect data over
    large areas.


    **Current and potential capabilities of UAS for crop water productivity in precision
    agriculture**


    Unmanned aerial systems (UASs), often referred to as drones, are aircraft that
    are flown without a human pilot on board. UASs have a variety of potential applications
    in precision agriculture, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, and
    yield estimation. One of the most promising applications of UASs is the use of
    thermal imaging to monitor crop water status.


    Crop water stress can occur when plants do not have enough water to meet their
    needs. This can lead to reduced yields and lower crop quality. Traditional methods
    for monitoring crop water stress are time-consuming and expensive, but the use
    of UASs makes it possible to monitor large areas of crops quickly and easily.


    UASs can be equipped with a variety of sensors, including thermal imaging cameras.
    Thermal imaging cameras measure the temperature of objects, and this information
    can be used to assess crop water status. Crops that are under water stress will
    have higher temperatures than crops that are well-watered.


    The use of UASs for crop water monitoring has a number of advantages over traditional
    methods. First, UASs can collect data over large areas quickly and easily. Second,
    UASs can be used to collect data in areas that are difficult to access by ground
    equipment. Third, UASs can collect data at high resolutions, which allows for
    more detailed analysis of crop water status.


    **Real-time irrigation scheduling with thermal UAS**


    Crop water stress index (CWSI) is a measure of crop water status that can be used
    to schedule irrigation. CWSI is calculated using the difference between the crop
    canopy temperature and the air temperature. A high CWSI value indicates that the
    crop is under water stress. Determined from thermal imagery, CWSI has great potential
    to detect instantaneous variations of water status. The main driver of CWSI, canopy
    temperature, is best estimated automatically from thermal images.


    UASs can be used to collect thermal imagery of crops, which can then be used to
    calculate CWSI. This information can be used to create irrigation schedules that
    are based on the actual water needs of the crop. Real-time irrigation scheduling
    can help to reduce water use and improve crop yields.


    **Conclusion**


    UASs are a promising technology for precision agriculture. One of the most promising
    applications of UASs is the use of thermal imaging to monitor crop water status.
    UASs can collect thermal imagery of crops quickly and easily, and this information
    can be used to calculate CWSI. CWSI can then be used to create irrigation schedules
    that are based on the actual water needs of the crop. Real-time irrigation scheduling
    can help to reduce water use and improve crop yields.

    and content Highlights • Potential capabilities of UAS for crop water productivity
    in precision agriculture. • Technology that can improve crop water productivity
    (CWP). • UAS thermal remote sensing with certain indices is most suitable for
    crop water assessment. • Possibility for real-time irrigation scheduling with
    thermal UAS. Abstract In order to feed growing populations under scare water resources,
    a suitable technology that improves crop water productivity (CWP) is crucial.
    Precision agriculture that utilizes digital techniques such as unmanned aerial
    systems (UAS) can play a significant role in improving CWP. CWP is an important
    indicator that quantifies the effect of agricultural water management. To improve
    CWP, implementation of suitable methods for early detection of crop water stress
    before irreversible damage on crops occurs, is vital. Conventionally, farmers
    have relied on in situ measurements of soil moisture and weather variables for
    detecting crop water status for irrigation scheduling. This method is time consuming
    and does not account for spatial and temporal variability associated with crop
    water status. Hence, the aim of this study is to give an overview of the current
    and potential capabilities of UAS for crop water productivity in precision agriculture.
    Identified in this study are the factors as well as the technology that can improve
    CWP. UAS thermal remote sensing is found to be the most suitable technology for
    monitoring and assessing crop water status using certain indices. Determining
    a crop water stress index (CWSI) from thermal imagery has the potential to detect
    instantaneous variations of water status. CWSI obtained from UAS thermal imaging
    camera can be adapted for real-time irrigation scheduling for maximum crop water
    productivity. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Agricultural

    agricultural production must double to meet the food demand of the growing population
    (Martínez et al., 2017). The agricultural industry must therefore, maximize the
    use of available resources in order to cope with the present trajectory of population
    growth and, precision agriculture can play a significant role in reaching this
    goal. Precision agriculture is a farming management concept where a practice is
    performed at the right time, right place and appropriate intensity (Maes and Steppe,
    2019). It often utilizes digital techniques (satellite, UAS, sensors, etc.) to
    optimize agricultural production processes while minimizing adverse environmental
    impacts (Schrijver, 2016; Abdullahi et al., 2015). Sensors commonly used in precision
    irrigation systems such as drip irrigation reduce crop water use but provide only
    point estimates. When digital techniques such as UAS are utilized in precision
    agriculture, the spatial and temporal variability of the crop conditions are accounted
    for in greater detail than commonly used sensor technologies. Precision agriculture
    generally aims to increase the quality and quantity of agricultural output while
    using less input (e.g. water, pesticides, fertilizer, energy, herbicides etc.).
    Agricultural water use is one of the main factors behind increasing water scarcity,
    with irrigated agriculture accounting for about 70% of the freshwater withdrawals
    in the world (Tshwene and Oladele, 2016). With water being a significant limiting
    factor in agricultural management, this high agricultural water use can be better
    managed using the crop water productivity concept. CWP also referred to as water
    use efficiency, can be defined as the relationship between crop output and the
    amount of water used in crop production. It is mathematically expressed as the
    quantity of yield (kg/hectare) per unit amount of water (mm/day) consumed (i.e.
    crop evapotranspiration) (Jin et al., 2016; Araya et al., 2018; Kukal and Irmak,
    2017; Brauman et al., 2013; Dogaru, 2016; Humphreys et al., 2006; Nhamo et al.,
    2016; Wichelns, 2014). CWP is an indicator that quantifies the effect of agricultural
    water management (Sakthivadivel et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2017). The use of CWP
    helps to meet the rising demand of water by irrigation amidst other sectors and
    also provide food for the growing population. According to Igbadun et al. (2006),
    there are many expressions and definitions for quantifying CWP, such as water
    use (technical) efficiency, which is defined as quantity of agricultural output
    per unit amount of water used in the production; water use (economic) efficiency,
    which is the value of the output produced per quantity of water consumed, and;
    water use (hydraulic) efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of water consumed
    by irrigated agriculture to the volume of water supplied. These three CWP definitions
    are centred on minimizing water input while maximizing the crop yield/output.
    Deficit irrigation techniques have been found to improve CWP by more than 200%
    (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004; Hirich et al., 2014; Adeboye et al., 2015) if irrigation
    is timeously managed. However, deficit irrigation must be carefully managed as
    Igbadun et al. (2006) described an attempt to maximize CWP by withholding irrigation
    in multiple crop growth stages which resulted in significant reduction in crop
    yield. Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004), however, found that plants are more efficient
    with water when they are stressed and agricultural production can be sustained
    with 20–40% less water resources as long as new water management techniques are
    adopted. The agricultural sector is currently under pressure to produce high quantity
    of food while using less water per unit of output thereby increasing CWP (Tshwene
    and Oladele, 2016). This is achieved by either producing the same quantity of
    crop with less water resources, or a higher quantity of crop with the same quantity
    of water resources (Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Either way, CWP is generally
    derived from the relationship between the water consumption and yield of a particular
    crop, both of which are highly variable in space and time (Kukal and Irmak, 2017).
    CWP can exhibit high spatial and temporal variability due to climatic and agricultural
    factors (Mdemu et al., 2009). Among the climatic factors, CWP is more sensitive
    to wind speed and relative humidity compared to sunshine hours while for agricultural
    factors, it is more sensitive to irrigation efficiency than the quantity of fertilizer
    used (Sun et al., 2017). Therefore, to improve CWP emphasis should focus on the
    climatic factors and on irrigation efficiency. Existing techniques for improving
    CWP such as partial root zone drying (Barrios-Masias and Jackson, 2016), optimized
    regulated deficit irrigation (Léllis et al., 2017; Gendron et al., 2018; Adeboye
    et al., 2015) etc. do not currently account for the integrated effects of climatic
    and irrigation efficiency factors as well as spatial variability of CWP. Unmanned
    aerial systems (UAS) technology offers high spatial resolution and rapid collection
    of data over large areas, potentially enabling farmers to increase the precision
    of irrigation both spatially and temporally. Therefore, the aim of this study
    is to give a general overview of the current and potential capabilities of UAS
    to improve crop water productivity under precision agriculture. 2. UAS in precision
    agriculture UAS are platforms for remote sensing (RS) used in precision agriculture
    and examples of their use are found in (Hunt et al., 2018; Adão et al., 2017;
    Bendig et al., 2012; Santesteban et al., 2017; Poblete et al., 2017; Muchiri and
    Kimathi, 2016; Abdullahi et al., 2015; Simelli and Apostolos, 2015; Whitehead
    et al., 2014; Whitehead and Hugenholtz, 2014; Manfreda et al., 2018). These platforms
    are evolving rapidly technically and with regard to regulations (Ballesteros et
    al., 2014). UASs recently have become a common remote sensing technology comprising
    aerial platforms suitable for carrying small and lightweight sensors. There are
    different classes of UAS for instance according to Whitehead and Hugenholtz (2014),
    in United States it ranges from micro (< 0.9 kg), mini (0.9–13.6 kg), tactical
    (13.6–454.5 kg), medium altitude long endurance (454.5 – 13,636.4 kg), and high
    altitude long endurance (> 13,636.4 kg). They noted that commercial and remote
    sensing applications prefer UAS weighing less than 5 kg because of cost advantages
    and reduced risk associated with blunt force impact. Mini-UAS weighing less than
    5 kg can carry 0.2 kg to 1.5 kg of sensor payload (Bendig et al., 2012). According
    to Gago et al. (2015), four component tasks to be considered before selecting
    the appropriate UAS for precision agriculture are: design of experiment, data
    acquisition, data processing and results. For agricultural management, fixed-wing
    airplanes and unmanned helicopters UASs are mainly used. These two aerial platforms
    have some limitations and advantages. To mention a few limitations and advantages,
    unmanned helicopters are able to travel in any direction while fixed wing airplanes
    travel in a more linear and restricted fashion. Fixed-wing aircrafts have simple
    flight systems and can fly for longer duration compared to unmanned helicopters.
    Unmanned helicopters have more complex flight systems and can offer lower flight
    altitudes with low-speed. Fixed-wing aircrafts therefore, have capacity to cover
    wider areas but their flight altitude is higher which reduces the image resolution.
    Also, fixed-wing UAS aerial platforms require specific runways or at least sufficient
    open space for landing and take-off. Because of these limitations, recently a
    new aircraft platform emerged, multi-copter (multi-rotor), which does not require
    special take-off or landing runway. The multi-copter is more user-friendly which
    makes it possible to be operated by farmers in order to obtain real-time data
    and apply adapted water management. Generally, the type of UAS required depends
    on the aim of the study as well as the quality of the desired output/result. In
    addition to UAS aerial platforms, the camera sensors are key to the quality of
    images produced. Selection of camera type also depends on the aim of the project.
    The most commonly used UAS cameras in agriculture include: thermal, multispectral,
    hyperspectral and red-green-blue (RGB). Gago et al. (2015) recommended different
    camera types depending on the type of crop trait/status of interest. For biotic
    and abiotic stress, thermal and hyperspectral cameras are recommended; while multispectral
    and red-green-blue (RGB) cameras are recommended for growth/biomass assessment.
    RGB cameras are one of the traditional imaging systems used in agroforestry applications,
    however they lack the precision and spectral range to profile materials that hyperspectral
    and multispectral cameras can provide (Adão et al., 2017). 3. Commonly used UAS
    imaging cameras for water status 3.1. Hyperspectral Hyperspectral imaging techniques
    measure the reflectance from the vegetation canopy. The recorded reflectance cannot
    be applied directly as a metric of leaf water content therefore reflectance indices
    are used. Indices for hyperspectral data include Simple Ratio Index (SRI), Normalized
    Difference (e.g. Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI)) etc. (Elvanidi et al.,
    2018; Pôças et al., 2017; Rapaport et al., 2015). Hyperspectral technology integrates
    spectroscopy with the benefits of digital imagery (Loggenberg et al., 2018). The
    capability of hyperspectral imaging ranging from 400 to 2500 nm in assessing the
    water deficiency in tomato plants was demonstrated by Susič et al. (2018). Zarco-Tejada
    et al. (2012) demonstrated the ability of UAV based hyperspectral and thermal
    cameras to assess water stress levels in a citrus crop and confirmed that there
    is link between PRI and canopy temperature. Recently, Loggenberg et al. (2018)
    combined hyperspectral RS technologies with machine learning to discriminate between
    stressed and non-stressed grape vines from hyperspectral imaging. The results
    obtained showed that machine (ensemble) learners effectively analysed the hyperspectral
    data. Generally, hyperspectral imaging cameras capture more detailed data in both
    spatial and spectral ranges compared to other cameras. It can measure hundreds
    of bands which raises complexity when considering the quantity of data acquired.
    Loggenberg et al. (2018) noted that the major limiting factor in applying hyperspectral
    data is the inherent ‘curse of dimensionality’ which results in reduced classification
    accuracies. In addition, hyperspectral cameras are very expensive and complex
    (Elvanidi et al., 2018), which limit their wide-spread application especially
    in commercial agriculture. 3.2. Multispectral Multispectral imaging techniques
    are based on the theory that each surface reflects part of the light received.
    Therefore, multispectral cameras measure reflectance and light absorption from
    the vegetation canopy (Matese and Di Gennaro, 2018). Vegetation reflectance characteristics
    are used to derive vegetation indices (VIs). Healthy vegetation absorbs all the
    red light and reflects back much of the near infrared light while stressed vegetation
    reflects more red light and less near infrared light. Multispectral VIs used for
    detecting water status include: structural indices (e.g. Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), Optimized
    Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), SRI etc.); xanthophyll indices (e.g. Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI570, PRI515)); chlorophyll indices (e.g. Transformed Chlorophyll
    Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI), TCARI/OSAVI etc.); Blue/green/red ratio
    indices (e.g. Green Index (GI), Red Green Ratio Index (RGRI) etc.) (Baluja et
    al., 2012; Rallo et al., 2014; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013, 2012). A new index,
    PRInorm was proposed by Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013) in which PRI index is normalized
    to be sensitive to canopy structure and chlorophyll content. PRInorm performed
    better than standard PRI index when tested against leaf water potential and stomatal
    conductance. The NDVI which is the index of plant greenness is popularly used
    among other VIs (Matese and Di Gennaro, 2018; Zhao et al., 2017). It is expressed
    as the normalized difference between the red and NIR (Near-Infrared) bands hence,
    it manages the differences in illumination within an image due to aspect and slope
    as well as differences due to time images were obtained. Baluja et al. (2012)
    used different spectral indices to assess water status of a vineyard and noted
    that NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI gave the highest coefficient of determination with stem
    water potential (Ѱstem) and leaf stomatal conductance (gs). Therefore, the two
    indices reflect the cumulative water deficit hence long-term response to water
    status unlike thermal that gives short-term response. Zhao et al. (2017) established
    a relationship between canopy NDVI and Ѱstem at different growing stages. Multispectral
    RS imaging technology uses bands such as Green (500–600 nm spectral band), Red
    (600–700 nm spectral band), Red-Edge (700–730 nm) and NIR (700 nm to 1.3 μm) wavebands
    to capture visible and invisible images of vegetation. According to Poblete et
    al. (2017), plant water status is not accurately predicted with multispectral
    indices between 500–800 nm spectral band because of their non-sensitivity to water
    content however, wavelengths greater than 800 nm may be better. Rallo et al. (2014)
    noted that satisfactory estimation of leaf water potentials at leaf/canopy levels
    can be derived using VIs based on the NIR-shortwave infrared domain with specific
    optimization of the “centre-bands”. Recently, some researchers have developed
    artificial neural network (ANN) models derived from multispectral images to forecast
    spatial variability of Ѱstem of crops. Romero et al. (2018) classified the water
    status level of the grapevine based on ten vegetation indices using Red, Green,
    Red-Edge and NIR wavebands and found that there were no significant relationships
    between VIs individually and Ѱstem however with lower correlation values of less
    than 0.3 for almost all the indices studied. They went further to develop an ANN
    model (model 1) using all VIs calculated as inputs and compared the output with
    actual measured Ѱstem and got higher correlation values. Similarly, Poblete et
    al. (2017) compared ANN model outputs with ground-truth measurements of Ѱstem
    and found the best performance of the model was with simulations that included
    the spectral bands of 550, 570, 670, 700 and 800 nm. 3.3. Thermal imaging Thermal
    RS measures the radiation emitted from an object’s surface and converts it into
    temperature (Khanal et al., 2017). The theory behind thermal RS is that all objects
    on the earth’s surface with a temperature above - 273 °C emit radiation and the
    quantity of radiation is a function of the emissivity of the surface temperature
    (Khanal et al., 2017). Crop canopy surface temperature in general is a function
    of transpiration rate, available soil water status and atmospheric evaporative
    demand (Khanal et al., 2017). Therefore, thermal RS determines the crop canopy
    surface temperature as a way of quantifying crop water stress which is useful
    in irrigation scheduling. Additionally, thermal RS can also quantify soil moisture
    and evapotranspiration status. Many studies have used thermal RS to assess crop
    water stress for several crop species including citrus orchards (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012), pinto beans (Zhou et al., 2018), sugar beet plants (Quebrajo et
    al., 2018), almond trees (García-Tejero et al., 2018a & 2018b), and grapevines
    (Bellvert et al., 2014; Bellvert et al., 2016; Espinoza et al., 2017; Matese et
    al., 2018; García-Tejero et al., 2016). Notwithstanding that thermal RS is capable
    of providing temporal and spatial information of crop water stress, certain issues
    must be considered while using thermal RS images. The issues include (1) temporal
    and spatial resolutions of images acquired, (2) atmospheric conditions, (3) altitude
    and viewing angle of thermal sensors, and (4) variation in crop species and crop
    growth stages (Khanal et al., 2017). Among these camera types, thermal imaging
    cameras are popularly used for water stress detection (Khanal et al., 2017). Some
    studies have used a combination of multispectral and thermal cameras in assessing
    crop water stress using some indicators (Zhou et al., 2018; Espinoza et al., 2017).
    They noted that thermal imaging cameras are useful tool for rapid detection of
    crop water stress. Considering cost, availability and popularity therefore, thermal
    imaging cameras seem to be the most suitable for detecting crop water stress (Table
    1). Table 1 shows research conducted using UASs with different RS technologies
    for crop water stress assessment, resolution of the images obtained, altitude
    of the flight and area covered by UAS. Table 1. Studies conducted using UASs with

    in thermal imaging Several indices exist for monitoring and quantifying water
    stress based on the crop canopy temperature. These indices include Crop Water
    Stress Index (CWSI), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold (DACT) and Degrees Above Non-Stressed
    (DANS) etc., and ‘canopy temperature’ is used as the main driver for evaluating
    water status (DeJonge et al., 2015). Kullberg et al. (2017) evaluated thermal
    RS indices and found that crop canopy temperature based water stress indices with
    less data requirements (DANS and DACT), are sensitive to crop water stress and
    this is comparable to more data intensive methods, such as CWSI. However, DANS
    and DACT have not been widely tested like CWSI. A new indicator also based on
    canopy temperature, CTSD (standard deviation of canopy temperature) was developed
    by Han et al. (2016). This index was tested using maize crop and found to be non-sensitive
    to small changes in water stress. Among the indices, CWSI is used as the standard
    index for quantifying water stress however; it requires additional data, such
    as vapour pressure deficit (VPD), as well as ideal weather conditions and prior
    computation (baselines) (Ihuoma and Madramootoo, 2017; Gerhards et al., 2016).
    In estimating CWSI, emissivity from crop canopy acquired with a thermal imaging
    camera is used in the computation of water stress related to canopy temperature
    (Santesteban et al., 2017). According to Quebrajo et al. (2018), CWSI is computed
    as: (1) where is the maximum and is difference between canopy temperature (Tc)
    and air temperature (Ta) at the ith measurement moment. DeJonge et al. (2015)
    noted that accumulation of daily midday difference between (Ta - Tc) throughout
    a season is linearly proportional to the crop final yield. is a value representing
    the non-water-stressed baselines (NWSB). NWSB is a linear function that combines
    the change in difference between air temperature and canopy temperature when crop
    transpiration is at potential rate and vapour pressure deficit value simultaneously
    measures canopy temperature. NWSB denoted as ci is expressed mathematically as:
    (2) where a and b are empirical parameters obtained for each species in the study
    environment; VPDi is the vapour pressure deficit (kPa) at the moment of flight
    on the ith measurement day. According to García-Tejero et al. (2018a), thermal
    imagery information is better interpreted using NWSB. They evaluated the potential
    of NWSB obtained from thermal imagery in order to establish a practical protocol
    for decisions related to irrigation management in almond plantations. Some studies
    have evaluated CWSI indicator in some crops, sugar beet plants (Quebrajo et al.,
    2018), grape (Matese et al., 2018; Pou et al., 2014; García-Tejero et al., 2016;
    Santesteban et al., 2017), olive orchard (Egea et al., 2017), Euonymus japonica
    (euonymus) plants (Gómez-Bellot et al., 2015), citrus (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014),
    maize (DeJonge et al., 2015) and found that it is a valuable indicator for assessing
    spatial variability of crop water status. CWSI derived from thermal imagery has
    also been deployed for high spatial and temporal monitoring of water stress of
    the corn canopy in greenhouse (Mangus et al., 2016). Results obtained indicate
    that CWSI estimated from thermal canopy temperature can be used to quantify spatial
    and temporal soil moisture variability for irrigation scheduling. In addition
    to water stress detection using crop temperature, thermal imaging cameras can
    also detect water stress using soil moisture index and evapotranspiration algorithms
    (Khanal et al., 2017). Evapotranspiration algorithms have been successfully applied
    to estimate daily evapotranspiration from soybean and corn (Khanal et al., 2017).
    4. Real-time irrigation scheduling with thermal UAS Recent advances in irrigation
    technology have platforms for continuous transmitting of data among irrigation
    controllers, installed field sensors as well as equipment for variable irrigation
    rate (Quebrajo et al., 2018). Thermally-based techniques currently employed in
    evaluating water stress for automatic irrigation scheduling include crop canopy
    temperature, CWSI (empirical or theoretical), and time temperature threshold (O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010). The CWSI algorithm is mostly used for automatic irrigation control
    systems in order to improve crop water productivity. O’Shaughnessy et al. (2012)
    developed a method that integrated CWSI and time threshold for automatic irrigation
    scheduling. The effectiveness of the method was investigated on short and long
    season grain sorghum hybrids. They noted that the method can effectively trigger
    the irrigation system for automatic irrigation scheduling. Also, Osroosh et al.
    (2015) developed an adaptive scheduling algorithm that relied on theoretical CWSI
    to automatically irrigate apple trees. Most of these studies utilized the mobility
    of linear or center pivot irrigation systems to mount thermal imaging cameras
    thereby getting a dynamic scan of the effects of canopy temperature (DeJonge et
    al., 2015). CWSI obtained from UAS thermal imaging cameras can be adapted for
    real-time irrigation scheduling for maximum crop water productivity. Real-time
    canopy temperature, the main driver of CWSI, is better estimated automatically
    from thermal images. Jiménez-Bello et al. (2011) developed and validated an automatic
    UAS thermal imaging process for assessing plant water status that requires no
    operator participation. With this, the UAS thermal imaging techniques, coupled
    with software platforms, will not only estimate the spatial and temporal crop
    water stress variation, but drastically reduce the time needed between image processing,
    analysis and taking action. With the water stress information from thermal imaging
    either from canopy temperature, soil moisture index or evapotranspiration algorithms,
    irrigation controllers can be communicated for real time irrigation scheduling
    to improve water use productivity. CWSI from thermal imagery has great potential
    to detect instantaneous variations of water status (Santesteban et al., 2017;
    Osroosh et al., 2016). Bellvert et al. (2016) used a UAS with a thermal sensor
    to fly over grape vineyards and obtained water stress information for real-time
    irrigation scheduling. Leaf water potential obtained from the CWSI was successfully
    used as an irrigation trigger and there was no negative effect on yield and composition
    of the crop. Torres-Rua (2017) also used UAS carrying a thermal camera sensor
    to estimate evapotranspiration. The evapotranspiration information obtained was
    aggregated to irrigation valve zones that the irrigation technology supports.
    Reliable data and information acquired rapidly and easily are therefore essential
    for assessing water use productivity. 5. Conclusion CWP exhibit high spatial and
    temporal variability due to climatic and agricultural factors. To improve CWP,
    emphasis should be more on the climatic factors as well as on irrigation efficiency.
    UAS technologies with these commonly used cameras: hyperspectral, multispectral
    and thermal can improve CWP. Among these cameras, UAS thermal RS is identified
    as a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing crop water status. UAS thermal
    imaging cameras are used to estimate climatic factors that can improve CWP. Thermal
    RS determines the crop canopy temperature as a way of quantifying crop water stress.
    Some indices have been identified and used for quantifying crop water status using
    thermal RS. Among these indices, CWSI is widely used in quantifying and assessing
    crop water stress despite its data demand compared to other indices. CWSI is known
    to vary in space and time therefore, UAS thermal imaging cameras have the potential
    to account for spatial and temporal variability associated with CWSI. In addition
    to water stress detection using crop temperature, thermal imaging cameras can
    also detect water stress using soil moisture index and evapotranspiration algorithms.
    Irrigation technologies that improve CWP should be adopted in order to meet the
    global food demand associated with increasing global populations. Conventional
    irrigation systems alone are not enough to improve CWP to feed the projected human
    population increase, especially in the face of climate change. Recently, researchers
    have tried to improve CWP by developing an adaptive irrigation scheduling algorithm
    that relied on theoretical CWSI obtained from thermal imaging cameras mounted
    on the linear or centre pivot irrigation system. This method failed to account
    properly for the spatial and temporal variation associated with crop water stress.
    Similarly, UAS have also been used for quasi-time irrigation scheduling where
    the crop water stress information obtained is interpreted and used much later
    after the measurement. For maximum CWP while accounting for spatial and temporal
    variability of crop water status, there is need for real-time irrigation scheduling
    using UAS carrying thermal imaging cameras. Real-time canopy temperature, the
    main driver of CWSI is estimated automatically from thermal images. With the water
    stress information from thermal imaging irrigation controllers can be communicated
    for real time irrigation scheduling thereby producing maximum crop water productivity.

    Seven irrigation scheduling algorithms and an automatic control system along with
    a wireless network of soil, thermal and weather sensors were developed and assessed
    in Prosser, WA in the growing season of 2013. The system was comprised of six
    wireless sensor and valve actuating nodes installed across an apple orchard, a
    central base station made up of a transceiver connected to a laptop, and a graphical

    and WB (SL + WB), a conventional irrigation practice used in the region (CNTRL),
    and soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark. Different treatments were
    compared based on the total irrigation water (It) applied during the season. They
    were also compared based on simplicity and expense for a grower to implement.
    Soil water content (θs) and stem water potential (ψstem) were monitored in a number

    sensingDrip irrigation 1. Introduction A sound choice of irrigation scheduling
    method can lead to increased profit and water savings for farmers, reduced environmental
    impacts and sustainable agriculture (Smith et al., 1996). Proper management of
    irrigation water to maintain balanced soil water content is crucial for health
    and productivity of apple trees (Black et al., 2008). To date, research has offered
    a large number of approaches to detect water stress, compute crop water needs,
    and automatically schedule irrigation (Al-Kaisi et al., 1997, Orta et al., 2003,
    Jones, 2004, Farahani et al., 2007, Vellidis et al., 2008, McCready et al., 2009,
    Ko and Piccinni, 2009, Migliaccio et al., 2010, Romero et al., 2012). Irrigation
    scheduling approaches may be grouped into three main categories (Zhang and Pierce,
    2013): (i) monitoring of soil water status (soil-based), (ii) soil water balance
    calculations using weather information (weather-based), and (iii) sensing of crop
    water stress (plant-based). Automation of irrigation has been evaluated in a number
    of row plants including tomato, onion and bell pepper using soil sensors measuring
    tension (Thompson et al., 2007, Enciso et al., 2009) or volumetric water content
    (Zotarelli et al., 2009). Vellidis et al. (2008) developed and evaluated a real-time,
    smart soil moisture and temperature sensor array prototype for scheduling irrigation
    in cotton. Romero et al. (2012) reported that the approach of combining weather
    data with soil moisture signal could increase irrigation efficiency in almond
    trees. Tensiometers have been used by Meron et al. (2001) as a feedback to manage
    irrigation of apple trees. Soil water tension sensors provide a direct measure
    of plant water status (Pedro Vaza et al., 2013). Watermark™ sensors (Irrometer
    Co., Riverside, CA) have been identified as good indicators of irrigation start
    and stop (Leib and Matthews, 1999); however, sensor accuracy is contingent to
    site-specific calibration (Varble and Chávez, 2011). The calibration need of individual
    sensors can make the use of Watermark™ sensors tedious and unattractive to most
    farmers, thus very often they are used with only factory calibration. Neutron
    probe is a scientific-based method for precise measurement of soil water content
    and has shown to be a reliable reference for other irrigation scheduling techniques
    (Evett et al., 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b). How change in weather parameters
    can affect plant water needs can be predicted using an evapotranspiration (ET)
    model. Frequently used ET models are the Penman-Monteith (PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) equations. The Hargreaves model requires
    fewer data than the PM model and can provide estimations of ET using air temperature
    as sole input (Allen et al., 1998). The most common approach to estimate actual
    water use of apple trees (ETc) is to multiply the reference ET (ETr) by a crop-specific
    coefficient (Kc) (Lakso, 2003). Osroosh et al., 2014, Osroosh et al., 2015a developed
    models based on infrared thermometry and the energy budget of a single apple leaf
    to estimate the actual and potential transpiration of whole tree. However, like
    the PM model, they require a wide range of input data. The weather-based irrigation
    scheduling has a long history of implementation using commercial irrigation controllers
    for both research (Davis et al., 2009, Davis and Dukes, 2010, Cardenas-Lailhacar
    et al., 2008, Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2010) and commercial applications; however,
    few research studies have investigated its application on fruit trees. In a study
    by Kisekka et al. (2010), ET-based irrigation scheduling saved significant quantities
    of water compared with a calendar-based grower’s approach of irrigation in a Carambola
    Orchard. Leaf water potential measured using a pressure bomb has long been used
    to monitor crop water status and as trigger point for irrigation (Stegman et al.,
    1976, Turner, 1988). However, this method is very tedious, labor-intensive and
    not appropriate for automation. The use of infrared temperature of plant canopies
    along with a number of ancillary meteorological measurements is an alternative
    plant-based approach (Cohen et al., 2005). Irrigation scheduling systems based
    on a feedback from crop have shown to outperform scientific-based irrigation scheduling
    using the neutron probe in row crops (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015). Various thermal-based
    scheduling algorithms have been developed such as the crop water stress index
    (CWSI: Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1988) and time-temperature threshold
    (TTT: Wanjura et al., 1992, Wanjura et al., 1995, Upchurch et al., 1996). CWSI
    compares the measured canopy-air temperature differences (ΔTm) with theoretically/empirically
    determined temperature differences of a non-transpiring (ΔTu) and well-watered
    (ΔTl) plants as defined by Jackson et al. (1981): (1) Different varieties of the
    CWSI have been suggested over the years including the CWSI and time threshold
    (CWSI-TT: O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), integrated CWSI (iCWSI: O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2013) and CWSI-DT (Osroosh et al., 2015b). CWSI has been rarely used to
    schedule irrigation in trees (Osroosh et al., 2015b) and more often to detect
    water stress (Testi et al., 2008, Wang and Gartung, 2010, Paltineanu et al., 2013,
    Agam et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009, Osroosh et al., 2016). The CWSI might be
    affected by many unwanted factors such as dust or passing clouds (O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2012b); however, it has proven to be reliable if integrated into a robust
    algorithm accounting for these temporary conditions (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The
    TTT method, also patented as “BIOTIC”, requires a “time threshold” and a “temperature
    threshold.” The temperature threshold is the optimal leaf temperature for enzyme
    activity determined in lab. The time threshold is the accumulated time above the
    temperature threshold for non-stressed crop in specific climate calculated using
    experimental/simulated data. O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) carried out automatic
    irrigation experiments on cotton using the TTT algorithm in Texas. Peters and
    Evett (2008) used the TTT method to automate water delivery to the center pivot-irrigated
    plots of soybean. To our knowledge, no reports are available on irrigation scheduling
    of woody fruit trees using the TTT approach. Nowadays, some growers rely on wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) to obtain information remotely on a wide range of parameters
    but rarely to automatically schedule irrigations (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013).
    In research, WSNs have been employed to collect weather, soil and environmental
    information using soil moisture, temperature, or agro-meteorological sensors,
    and to control a variety of irrigation systems (Coates and Delwiche, 2009, Kim
    and Evans, 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, Ojha et al., 2015). A site-specific
    irrigation control system uses a WSN to monitor field variables and minimize the
    spatial variability of irrigation. In order to make the wireless technology available
    to growers, Coates et al. (2013) developed and integrated a valve actuation system
    with a commercially-available WSN. Both wired and wireless sensors network systems
    have been used in automatic irrigation scheduling (Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012a, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013) with
    the later being more flexible, convenient and economical. Besides reducing labor
    requirements, automatic software scheduling tools are necessary for optimizing
    the amount of irrigation water in response to crop development and type, and environmental
    conditions (Casadesús et al., 2012). The software must be user-friendly and allow
    for simple management of the WSN and irrigation valves by growers (Kim and Evans,
    2009). Various computer software packages have been developed for monitoring soil
    parameters and irrigation scheduling over a wide range of irrigation systems (Stone
    et al., 1985, Hess, 1996, Abreu and Pereira, 2002). Kim and Evans (2009) developed
    decision support software to collect information from a WSN and control a site-specific
    linear-move irrigation system on a malting barley field. The aforementioned approaches
    have been widely used in research; however, farmers are still far from adopting
    them. They are eager to see reliable irrigation scheduling methods which are affordable
    and not necessarily complicated, yet accurate and suit their field and crop conditions.
    Our specific objectives here were to (i) develop fully automatic irrigation supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, and wireless sensor network, (ii)
    develop computer soil-, plant-, and weather-based algorithms for scheduling irrigation
    of drip-irrigated apple trees, (iii) collect information on these various strategies
    in terms of total amount of water applied, root zone soil water status (content/tension),
    plant water status (stem water potential), cost and simplicity. This paper emphasizes
    on the plant-based approaches and presents the results of a preliminary field
    evaluation in a growing season in the arid region of central Washington. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area and irrigation system The study was conducted in a
    Fuji apple orchard on the Roza Farm of the Washington State University Irrigated
    Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser, WA (46.26°N, 119.74°W)
    during the irrigation period of 2013. The region was semi-arid with an average
    annual precipitation of 217 mm and little summer rainfall. The site’s soil was
    Warden Silt Loam, ∼1-m deep limited by a rocky layer to shallower depths in some
    plots. The average volumetric water content at field capacity, θFC, was 0.33 m3
    m−3 measured as drained soil water content after a heavy irrigation event. The
    trees were spaced 4 m (row spacing) by 2.5 m (tree spacing) apart. In 2007, the
    trees were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler irrigation system (Hurricane, NaanDanJain
    Irrigation Ltd., Post Naan, Israel) with water emitters of 27 L h−1 spaced at
    2.5 m intervals. In 2013, the irrigation system was drip tubing with two lines
    of pressure compensating laterals (∼0.6 m apart) of in-line 2.0 L h−1 (equivalent
    to 1.1 mm h−1) drippers (BlueLine® PC, The Toro Company, El Cajon, CA), spaced
    at 91.4 cm intervals along the laterals. In 2013, the irrigation system was configured
    for twenty-one irrigation zones (discussed later) and flow to each zone was controlled
    with a latching solenoid valve (LSV) (Irritrol, Riverside, CA). A conservative
    value of 85% was assumed for the efficiency of the irrigation system. 2.2. Wireless
    control and monitoring system A wireless control and monitoring system was developed
    to take measurements from in-field sensors and control the on/off time of LSVs
    to create zone-specific irrigation rates in the orchard (Fig. 1). The system was
    comprised of two main components: (1) central base station (master) including
    a laptop computer and graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) six slave wireless
    nodes (sensing and valve actuation stations). The laptop was located in a room
    only 50 m far from the field. A laptop cooling pad and a backup battery were used
    to cope with room’s high temperature during the hot summer and unexpected power
    blackouts, respectively. The base station also consisted of a 900 MHz spread spectrum
    radio (model RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to communicate with the nodes,
    and a USB mobile broadband stick (model DataJack, Inc., Dallas, TX) to provide
    internet access. Irrigation control was managed by the base station using the
    GUI developed by the authors (discussed later). Download : Download high-res image

    control and monitoring system: a typical wireless node (a), base laptop and graphical
    user interface (GUI) (b), and weather station (c). The GUI was accessed by the
    office computer using the Teamviewer software (d). A sensing and valve actuating
    node included all or some of the following sensors and components: CR10(X) datalogger,
    solar panel, battery, Watermark™ sensors, infrared thermometers (IRTs), shielded
    air temperature probe (Air Temp), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (RF), H-bridge
    and latching solenoid valve (LSV). The base control was made up of a laptop computer,
    dongle (USB modem) and RF. A wireless node was made up of a datalogger (model
    CR10(X), Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (model
    RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with 3 dBi omni-directional rubber-duck
    antenna (L-COM Inc., North Andover, MA) to transmit data to and receive control
    signals from the base, 10 W solar panel (model SYP105, Instapark Co., Santa Fe
    Springs, CA) including voltage regulator, and 12 V, 7 Ah sealed lead acid battery.
    Each node controlled up to four LSVs operated by two L298 dual H-bridge motor
    drives (Robotshop Inc., Mirabel, Quebec). Nodes were also taking readings from
    a number of in-field sensors including granular matrix sensors (model Watermark
    200SS, Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA), a soil temperature sensor (Model 107, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), shielded air temperature sensors (model 109, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), and industrial thermocouple infrared thermometers (model
    IRT/c.2: Type J, Exergen, Watertown, MA) with a field view of 35° and ±0.6 °C
    absolute accuracy. Depending on its location in the orchard, a node was comprised
    of all or only some of the aforementioned sensors. The furthest sensing and valve
    actuating station/node was located about 150 m far from the central base radio.
    The in-field sensors were scanned/sampled by the node dataloggers every 5 s and
    averaged every 15 min. The collected data by the nodes were then retrieved by
    the GUI every 15 min and time stamped. 2.3. Sensor installation and field measurements
    The air temperature probes were installed at a height of 2 m (in-line with trees).
    It is known that the rooting depth of a mature apple tree is about 70–90 cm (Atkinson,
    1980) and soil water content measurements should take place from about 10 (cultivation
    depth) to 60 cm (0.7 times effective depth of rooting) (Black et al., 2008). Taking
    this into consideration, the soil temperature probe and Watermark™ sensors were
    installed horizontally at a depth of 30 cm placed between the drip tubing laterals
    about ∼1.25 m from tree trunk. The Watermark™ sensors were soaked in water for
    two days and then installed in a soil wetted to near saturation. All the sensors
    were installed at the center of plots. The near real-time agro-meteorological
    data (air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall)
    measured at Roza weather station (located about 0.5 km away from the orchard)
    was pulled from the Washington State AgWeatherNet website. This data was used
    to calculate daily ETr and provided the supplementary measurements for the CWSI
    and TTT algorithms (discussed later). Midday Stem water potential (Ψstem) was
    measured with a pressure bomb (model 615, PMS Instrument Co., Albany, OR) once
    per week between 13:00 and 15:00. A total of six Ψstem readings (two readings
    per zone/plot per sampling day) were averaged to calculate mean Ψstem corresponding
    to a treatment. Soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe (503DR Hydroprobe, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Concord, CA) on a weekly basis.
    Soil moisture and Ψstem measurements took place in the plots under the plant-based
    treatments (CWSI and TTT). An irrigation treatment was managed using the neutron
    probe (discussed later). The IRT installation methods, neutron probe calibration,
    and Ψstem measurement procedure were similar to those described by Osroosh et
    al. (2015b). 2.4. Irrigation scheduling algorithms The computer algorithms required
    for implementing seven different irrigation treatments were developed based on
    main plant-, soil- and weather-based irrigation scheduling approaches and included
    feedback and feed-forward control strategies. The irrigation scheduling treatments
    were (1) a soil water budget model using a temperature-only-based ET equation
    (WB), (2) Watermark™ soil water tension sensor (SOIL), (3) a combination of WB
    and SOIL algorithms (SL + WB), (4) the scientific-based method of using neutron
    probe (NP), (5) Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT), (6) Canopy
    temperature signal and the CWSI-DT method (CWSI), and (7) conventional irrigation
    scheduling method in the region (CNTRL). All the strategies were completely automatic
    except for NP in which soil moisture data collected manually. The main required
    inputs to the algorithms were canopy temperature (infrared) to determine crop
    water status, soil water tension to measure soil water availability, and meteorological
    data to estimate daily water needs using ET model and to calculate theoretical
    CWSI. These algorithm are described in the following paragraphs. 2.4.1. Soil water
    budget model and a temperature-only-based ET equation (WB) The algorithm was established
    on a simple soil water balance (Dukes et al., 2009) and daily estimations of reference
    ET (ETr) using the Hargreaves model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). Reference ET
    was adjusted by local crop coefficients (Kc; Karimi et al., 2013) interpolated
    for daily values. Daily (net) irrigation water depth (Id, mm) was calculated as
    the following: (2) where Re is effective rainfall, and ETc is the crop ET (ETc
    = KcETr), all in units of mm. ETc was determined at midnight using 24-h air temperature
    data obtained from sensors installed in the orchard. For simplification, the effective
    rainfall was assumed to be equal to the amount of rainfall from the nearby weather
    station. The difference between soil water content at the beginning of the season
    (θi) and soil water content at field capacity (θFC) was added to the irrigation
    depth in the first irrigation event. ET was calculated using the FAO-56 Hargreaves
    equation (Allen et al., 1998). Twenty years worth of historical weather data and
    the ASCE Standardized PM equation (Allen et al., 2005) were used to calibrate
    the Hargreaves model for the region. Given that the drip system had a very low
    discharge rate, a threshold (Ith) was set for irrigation depth. This guaranteed
    the amount of water applied was enough to wet the whole root zone and yet avoid
    deep percolation. The irrigation water depth per application day was calculated
    according to the following model: (3) The accumulated depth over several consecutive
    days had to exceed the threshold in order for the system to schedule an irrigation
    event. 2.4.2. Soil-based irrigation using Watermark™ sensor (SOIL) This irrigation
    scheduling algorithm (Fig. 2a) was developed based on soil water potential readings
    from a Watermark™ sensor (one sensor per plot), and dry (50% depletion) and wet
    (field capacity) thresholds of −80 and −30 kPa, respectively, recommended for
    the soil type (Black et al., 2008). The field soil was assumed to be homogenous.
    Previous studies in a drip-irrigated soil have shown that the overall water status
    can be reliably extracted from single spot measurements (Rolston et al., 1991).
    An irrigation event was automatically scheduled whenever soil water potential
    exceeded the dry threshold and stopped if it reached the wet threshold. Therefore,
    the amount of applied water was dependent on the time when the wet threshold was
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download : Download full-size

    Watermark™ and water budget irrigation scheduling algorithm (SL + WB) (b). Varble
    and Chávez (2011) showed that diurnal soil temperature fluctuations could impact
    readings of Watermark™ sensor. A non-linear temperature compensation formula (Thompson
    and Armstrong, 1987) was applied to resistivity readings as the following: (4)
    where Rs is the measured resistance (kΩ), Ts is the soil temperature (°C), and
    PSW is the soil water potential (kPa). We did not field-calibrate the sensors
    for the soil type to comply with the common approach and ease the use of the sensors.
    2.4.3. Combination of WB and SOIL (SL + WB) This algorithm was the combination
    of the WB and SOIL algorithms similar to the algorithm proposed by Casadesús et
    al. (2012). SL + WB combines a compensating mechanism (feedback control) based
    on soil sensor readings and an estimation of water demand by a water balance method
    (feed-forward control) (Fig. 2b). SL + WB used soil water tension data to correct
    the ET model prediction of water consumption. An irrigation event was scheduled
    based on Eq. (2) and stopped whenever a soil tension of −30 kPa (wet threshold)
    was detected. 2.4.4. Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT) The TTT
    algorithm described in Evett et al. (1996) and examined in DeJonge et al. (2015)
    was the basis for the computer algorithm evaluated here. To determine the temperature
    threshold (Ttemp, °C), leaf samples were collected and sent in sealed refrigerated
    envelop to a lab in Lubbock, TX, where enzyme assays performed. The value of time
    threshold (Ttime, min) was obtained from canopy temperature and meteorological
    measurements collected over well-irrigated apple trees in 2007 in the same orchard.
    The accumulated time (t24) during 24 h was calculated as the following: (5) where
    Tm is the canopy temperature (°C) in minute m, and Ttemp is the temperature threshold.
    If t24 > Ttime then an irrigation signal was generated. The values of t24 was
    reset to 0 every day at midnight. The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as twice the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 2 × ETc) in June and July (twice
    the peak crop water use), enough to wet the root zone at the highest ET rate in
    the region while avoiding deep percolation (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). 2.4.5.
    Canopy temperature signal with the crop water stress index (CWSI) The CWSI algorithm
    relied on a theoretical CWSI and a dynamic threshold. The theoretical lower and
    upper boundaries of the CWSI were calculated using biophysical models thoroughly
    detailed by Osroosh et al. (2015b). The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as three times the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 3 × ETc) in June and July.
    This computer algorithm (called CWSI-DT) and its field evaluation results are
    also described in Osroosh et al. (2015b). Here, the results from the original
    experiment were compared with the rest of the approaches. 2.4.6. Scientific-based
    method of measuring soil moisture using neutron probe (NP) The NP treatment was
    assumed to represent the best irrigation scheduling practice by an advanced farmer.
    In this approach, soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe on a weekly basis. Using the soil moisture readings, soil water deficit
    (SWD) to field capacity was calculated and irrigation was scheduled. The soil
    water depletion under the NP treatment was never allowed to exceed a maximum allowed
    depletion (MAD of 50%) recommended for apple trees (Allen et al., 1998). The net
    irrigation depth was calculated as I = d × [θFC − θS], where d is the rooting
    depth (d = 0.6 m), and θs is the average volumetric soil water content for d.
    Manual neutron probe readings (raw values) were entered into the GUI right after
    field measurements every Wednesday. Irrigation was automatically schdeuled based
    on the entered reading for following day. 2.4.7. Conventional irrigation scheduling
    in the region (CNTRL) In addition to the precision algorithms described, water
    delivery to a number of zones was managed using the conventional irrigation scheduling
    method of apple trees in the region. The CNTRL algorithm (Fig. 3) was designed
    to mimic the growers’ approach of using the calendar (irrigation events on specific
    days of week) and weather conditions (low, high air temperature thresholds). In
    the CNTRL algorithm, any air temperature between the maximum (TMax) and minimum
    (Tmin) thresholds would have resulted in applying Ib = 63 mm of water. If air
    temperature exceeded the maximum threshold (TMax = 32 °C) the amount of irrigation
    water would be doubled (I = 2 × Ib). If air temperature was below the minimum
    threshold (Tmin = 21 °C), the trees would receive half the usual amount of water
    (I = 0.5 × Ib). Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download : Download

    (CNTRL). I is the amount of irrigation water applied, and Ib is the base amount
    of water which was doubled or halved depending on minimum (Tmin) and maximum (TMax)
    air temperature thresholds. 2.5. Graphical user interface A Windows-based GUI
    was developed in Microsoft VB.Net (V.2010, Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA) to manage
    and control the irrigation system and wireless nodes. Embedded routines in CoraScript
    (V.1.1.9.8, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) were used to send command signals
    to the six slave nodes/dataloggers. LoggerNet (V.3.5, Campbell Scientific, Logan,
    UT) automatically downloaded data from the nodes every 15 min and populated a
    database on the laptop. The recorded data was then managed by the GUI. Fig. 4
    shows a task flowchart of systems’ software and firmware components and their
    relationship. Instead of wireless communication between the field and office computers,
    Teamviewer (V.8, TeamViewer Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) was used to remotely
    access the GUI in the field. Download : Download high-res image (588KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Flowchart displaying the routines performed
    by the software (LN and GUI) and firmware (Node) components of the control and
    monitoring system. The node firmware was responsible for scanning the sensors
    and sending the collected data to the base. LoggerNet (LN) regularly retrieved
    data from the nodes and recorded them in a file. The GUI used this data to run
    the irrigation algorithms, and make irrigation control decision. The GUI has a
    tabular design and comprises several tabs including: (1) a “Blocks” tab for displaying
    raw real-time data from the in-field sensors and valves on/off status, (2) a tab
    for showing real-time weather data (“Roza”), and (3) a tab for monitoring the
    commands sent out and program codes in action (“Console”). Fig. 5 shows a screenshot
    of the “Blocks” tab. The rest of the tabs were dedicated to system settings, crop
    and soil properties, sensor calibration parameters, and entering manual field
    measurements into the GUI. The GUI was capable of running in three main functioning
    modes: simulation, automatic irrigation and manual irrigation. The simulation
    and manual modes were used for the purpose of testing the system’s hardware and
    software. The simulation mode was added mainly to test the internal functions
    without having to operate the hardware. The manual mode, on the other hand, allowed
    for testing and tuning the hardware more easily. Download : Download high-res

    tab of the graphical user interface. In this tab, sensor readings taken by the
    in-field sensors and remaining irrigation time are displayed in real-time. The
    values were updated every 15 min. The GUI collected data from the sensor nodes,
    downloaded weather data from the nearby weather station, and provided a real-time
    display of the measurements in individual zones regardless of the node collecting
    them. The remaining irrigation time corresponding to each sensor/plot was displayed
    next to the sensor’s name. The GUI ran the irrigation scheduling algorithms (WB,
    SOIL, SL + WB, TTT, CWSI, NP and CTNRL) every day at midnight, and automatically
    made decisions for scheduling irrigation events for twenty-one individual zones
    within the orchard. It sent control signals to the individual data-loggers which
    opened or closed latching solenoid valves to turn the water on and off to each
    block of trees. The software also allowed for manual control of individual zones.
    The data recorded in the database by LoggerNet were automatically pulled by the
    GUI and used to execute the algorithms in parallel everyday at midnight. This
    led to generating irrigation schedules for 10:30 AM of following day. The exceptions
    were the CNTRL and NP algorithms which were, respectively, run only on Mondays
    and Wednesdays as depicted in the flowchart in Fig. 4. The decision support process
    for the SOIL and SL + WB algorithms was slightly different as a continuous monitoring
    of feedback from the in-field Watermark™ sensors (every 15 min) was required to
    determine the end of irrigation event. LoggerNet was responsible for handling
    wireless communication errors and retries. The GUI monitored dataloggers battery
    voltage levels, handled coding errors and sent alert and digestion emails to the
    user. The system routinely logged irrigation events and reported the start/stop
    time of irrigations via email to the user. Due to possible exposure of in-field
    sensors to malfunction and disturbances, sensor-specific routines automatically
    analyzed the data for any signs of failure or anomalies such as abnormally high
    or low values beyond the expected range for a variable and negative/erroneous
    sensor readings. Noise or temporary abnormal changes in values were handled by
    the software and those of serious nature were reported back to the user via email.
    Besides the software error handling, the status of the wireless network was checked
    by the user regularly. 2.6. Experimental design and statistical analysis The seven
    irrigation treatments were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with
    three replications/blocks, each plot consisting of three rows of 6 trees (21 management
    zones). The trees at the center of the plots were used for measurement purpose.
    The plots were also observed for tree health and difference in the size and quality
    of apple fruits. The statistical analysis methods included the standard error
    of the mean (SE of Mean), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SigmaPlot (V.11.0,
    Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) to test for difference among the treatments
    in terms of applied irrigation water (mm season−1). To conduct multiple comparisons
    of the means, the Bonferroni t-test was employed (at p = 0.05). 3. Results and
    discussion During the 2007 growing season when the time threshold for TTT was
    determined, maximum daily evapotranspiration (ETMax), total applied irrigation
    water (It), total rainfall (May–September), and total irrigation days (dt) were
    calculated to be 9.7 mm d−1, 1077  , 32 mm and 110 d, respectively. The theoretical
    temperature threshold returned by the lab was 10 °C and the corresponding time
    threshold to this value was 1035 min. Considering the low value determined by
    the lab, a range of time threshold (Ttime) and temperature threshold (Ttemp) values
    were plotted against each other. The temperature threshold was then chosen to
    be 22.2 °C, and an irrigation event ( ) was scheduled following a day when canopy
    temperature exceeded Ttemp = 22.2 °C for more than 225 min. The rainfall totaled
    91 mm from May through September of 2013 most of which (77 mm) occurred in May
    and July. The 2013 growing season was relatively warmer compared to the 2007 growing
    period with greater daily mean temperatures, ETr values (Table 1) and ETMax of
    14.0 . Considerable amount of rainfall received during May and June, a number
    of manual irrigation events, and presence of a perched water table in the study
    site led to the availability of enough moisture in the root zone until June (θs
    > θMAD = soil moisture at MAD). As a result, the automatic irrigation system did
    not become operational until the soil water profile reached a defined irrigation
    trigger point. The wireless control system was configured and tested during March,
    April and May, and automatically managed the water delivery to the plots during
    the rest of the season. The number of automatic irrigation days was less than
    100 d for most of the treatments. Table 1. Climatic conditions for the 2007 and

    water The ANOVA test revealed that the difference in the mean values among the
    seven irrigation treatments was significant (p < 0.001). A comparison of the treatments
    in terms of total irrigation water applied can be found in Table 2. The applied
    water for CNTRL was significantly higher than all other treatments with a value
    of 1359 mm. This was over three times (340%) the amount of water applied by NP
    (401 mm). On the other hand, SOIL resulted in the lowest mean applied water (214
    mm) which was 53% of the amount delivered by NP. WB, CWSI and TTT applied 469,
    408 and 436 mm of water, respectively (no significant difference: p = 1), which
    accounted for slightly more than 100% of water applied by NP and resulted in about
    70% water saving over the irrigation period. The WB algorithm applied significantly
    greater amount of water than SOIL (p < 0.001) and SL + WB (p = 0.004; 273 mm).
    There was no significant difference between CWSI and SL + WB (p = 0.072). SOIL
    applied significantly less amount of water than the rest of the treatments, while
    there was no significant difference between NP and SL + WB (p = 0.1). Table 2.

    c INP: total applied water for NP, ICNTRL: total applied water for CNTRL. The
    Watermark™ sensor readings showed no sign of water stress in the plots of SOIL
    and SL + WB as the soil water potential fluctuations were within the range of
    0 to −80 kPa (Fig. 6a). However, field inspections disclosed that the trees under
    the SL + WB algorithm may have been severely water-stressed as leaf drop and loss
    of turgidity, trees reduced overall growth, and abnormally small fruits in these
    plots were evident. Having under-irrigated the trees, SOIL and SL + WB exhibited
    an insufficient response to water stress. The under-irrigation of the plots under
    SOIL can be explained by the fact that the soil sensors monitored only a limited
    volume of the soil profile and might have not been at a location where the root
    system was active (Cohen et al., 2005). The Watermark™ sensors were not calibrated
    and single predefined wet and dry thresholds were applied to all of them. In addition,
    it was difficult to make a representative tension measurement due to the heterogeneity
    of soil water distribution under the drip irrigation system. Download : Download

    of in-field Watermark™ sensors data collected using the wireless sensor network:
    mean of three plots under the SL + WB (a), and SOIL (b) treatments. The dotted
    lines show the standard error of the mean. The dashed lines show the wet (Wet
    Thresh) and dry (Dry Thresh) thresholds. Using a feed-forward ET-based scheduling
    method in combination with a soil feedback (SL + WB) did not improve irrigation
    scheduling as signals to stop irrigation were perhaps issued too soon. The general
    algorithm of Casadesús et al. (2012) suggests that the use of the water balance
    model allows for a quick response to weather changes by predicting its effects,
    while at the same time the feedback mechanism can adapt the amount of water to
    the requirements of individual orchards by compensating for prediction errors.
    However, the accuracy of feedback is very important. Currently, available soil
    water content sensors including Watermark™ sensors cannot provide the required
    precision as achievable with the neutron probe. The soil water content of the
    plots under the CWSI and TTT treatments was measured weekly as for the NP plots.
    As depicted in Fig. 7a, mean soil water deficit (SWD) in the treatment plots of
    CWSI, TTT and NP in the top 0.6 m was within the well-watered range (<MAD of 50%).
    Mean SWD in the TTT plots was significantly lower than NP (p < 0.001) which was
    in agreement with applying slightly more irrigation water under TTT (not significant).
    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem for the trees under CWSI and TTT are depicted
    in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the trees under TTT maintained a relatively similar
    values of Ψstem to the trees under CWSI over the period. The measured values of
    Ψstem agreed well with non-stressed values reported for woody plants including
    apple trees (De Swaef et al., 2009, Naor and Cohen, 2003). As discussed in Osroosh
    et al. (2015b), the CWSI algorithm demonstrated a good response to the water status
    of the apple trees. The results here support the use of the TTT thermal-based
    approach to maintain well-watered apple trees under drip irrigation system in
    the semi-arid climate of central Washington. Download : Download high-res image

    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem in the CWSI and TTT treatments (b). The error
    bars show the standard error of the mean. The cumulative applied water for individual
    plots under TTT, WB and CWSI is illustrated in Fig. 8a and b for the growing period
    of 2013. Plots within the TTT and WB treatments had similar amounts of irrigation
    water delivered to them during the season, whereas the plots under CWSI showed
    some degree of variability. WB did not receive any feedback from the trees, thus
    microclimatic variability within the orchard was the only source of discrepancy
    among the plots and consequently the irrigation depths. The WB algorithm can lead
    to over- or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect,
    the soil water content at the beginning of the season is unknown, or the application
    efficiency of irrigation system is lower than expected (Fereres et al., 2012).
    Apple trees have shown to close their stomata in response to a reduction in fruit
    loads (Palmer et al., 1997, Lakso, 2003, Girona et al., 2011). This reduction
    in evapotranspiration can challenge the WB approach as a lack of plant feedback
    may lead to significant errors in the estimations of water needs. The CWSI algorithm
    required meteorological data in addition to canopy temperature as input meaning
    it had to respond to atmospheric demand and signs of plant stress. This is while
    TTT only responded to increased canopy temperature which could be a result of
    increased air relative humidity not stomatal closure driven by water stress (Wanjura
    and Upchurch, 1997, Jones, 2004). This is reflected in TTT having a wetter soil
    profile as depicted in Fig. 7a. The CWSI algorithm, on the other hand, had a mechanism
    for withholding irrigation on humid days. It is known that CWSI values measured
    on cool and humid days are not reliable generating false stress signals and consequently
    resulting in over irrigation (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The CWSI algorithm interprets
    CWSI value in relation to the air relative humidity level and no irrigation decision
    is made on a humid day. Download : Download high-res image (274KB) Download :

    fruit yield Due to the fact that the trees were in an alternate bearing year,
    no quantitative information on the fruit yield was collected. However, our observations
    revealed that apple size in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments was noticeably smaller
    than CNTRL and never ripened (same number of fruits on trees). Larger shoot growth
    in the CNTRL treatment was observed compared with a much lower shoot and foliage
    growth in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments leading to shorter trees. The distance
    between rows in the CNTRL was covered with grass or algae and was always wet.
    This was not the case in other treatments. 3.3. Labor requirement and cost In
    the discussed control and monitoring system, the algorithms were executed using
    commercially available hardware and off-the shelf components. The major hardware
    cost included Campbell Scientific dataloggers and IRT sensors. We used an old
    model notebook as the central processing hardware which was worth roughly $100
    (U.S. dollars). The base cost of a sensing and actuating unit with the current
    hardware (datalogger, radio, battery, solar panel, actuator, 4 latching solenoids)
    is approximately $2500 in 2016. Considering the available commercial options,
    an IRT sensor adds an additional amount of $450–655 per measurement point. A soil/air
    temperature probe (without the shield) and a Watermark™ sensor can be purchased
    for $100 and $35–120, respectively. In the calculation of the cost, we replaced
    the CR10(X) with the CR1000 (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and the RF401 with
    the RF401A (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) as they are no longer manufactured
    by the company. We obtained real-time meteorological data from a nearby weather
    station which was part of the WSU AgWeatherNet. The cost of such a station in
    case a farmer decides to invest in one is $9500 (sensors, hardware, installation,
    first year maintenance) (AgWeatherNet, 2013). Major costs for the control and
    monitoring system and alternative options for some components are summarized in
    Table 3 for comparison. A summary of the irrigation scheduling algorithms evaluated
    in the present study including the in-field sensor requirements, total upfront
    cost, advantages and shortcomings of the system are also summarized in Table 4.

    weather station is available. b This technique is manual in nature; however, we
    developed and implemented an automatic algorithm based on the original conventional
    irrigation practice. Although the GUI was designed to manage a specific orchard,
    it has the potential to be retrofitted to other irrigation systems or fields.
    Especially for research purposes, the laptop/PC and dataloggers can be replaced
    with Linux-based single-board computers such as the BeagleBone Black (BeagleBoard.org
    Foundation, Oakland Twp, MI), and the spread-spectrum radio with the XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, MN) to significantly reduce the cost. A network
    of inexpensive air temperature sensors can provide enough microclimatic data for
    estimation of ET. The WB algorithm requires only an air temperature sensor with
    no need for calibration which keeps the labor and capital investments very low.
    CWSI needs a network of infrared thermometers and meteorological sensors with
    no need for site-specific calibration. From both research and practice perspectives,
    the upfront cost and labor requirements of both CWSI and TTT are relatively low;
    however, regular maintenance (mainly cleaning) of IRTs is necessary to keep the
    network up and running. Despite the low sensor cost and ease of implementation,
    SOIL and SL + WB did not show to be reliable in terms of delivering enough water
    to stressed trees or detecting stress on-time. To achieve higher accuracies, using
    a larger number of Watermark™ sensors to account for sources of variability, site-specific
    calibration of individual sensors, or a combined use of soil water potential and
    soil water content sensors appears to be necessary. The maintenance was a major
    issue with the soil sensors wiring. There were several cases of wire damage accidents
    due to animal rodent activity in the field. Wireless IRTs (O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2013) and less commonly wireless soil sensors are alternatives to wired sensors
    which will also lead to reduced installation and maintenance cost. These results
    support the suitability of simple irrigation scheduling techniques like WB for
    the automatic irrigation of apple orchard. Approaches like CWSI, TTT and WB are
    slightly more expensive, however they provide a higher degree of reliability compared
    to SOIL or SL + WB strategies. 4. Conclusions In this study, we developed and
    initially evaluated seven irrigation scheduling algorithms including two well-known
    plant/thermal-based strategies of the Time and Temperature Threshold (TTT) and
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). Irrigation water delivery was automatically scheduled
    to twenty-one management zones in an apple orchard using a wireless control and
    monitoring system. Precision irrigation algorithms were compared with the scientific-based
    method of irrigation scheduling using neutron probe and the conventional approach
    in the region in terms of ability to improve the current practice and simplicity
    of implementation from grower’s perspective. Our preliminary results supported
    the use of weather- and plant-based algorithms, decision support and monitoring
    software, and wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated
    apple trees. The weather- and plant-based algorithms evaluated here were able
    to deliver enough irrigation water to the apple trees and avoid water stress.
    The soil-based approaches, on the other hand, failed to deliver enough water to
    the trees which resulted in severe water stress and impaired growth. The weather-
    and plant-based methods exhibited a promising performance at the level of the
    scientific irrigation scheduling method in terms of applying precise amount of
    water when needed and had the great advantage of being fully automatic. While
    the weather-based control algorithm showed a similar performance to the plant-based
    methods under the conditions of the experimental site, we believe a control algorithm
    with plant feedback is a superior choice when it comes to site- and crop-specific
    precision. However, the weather-based approach is a better choice when lower cost
    and complexity are more important to growers. This was an initial step towards
    implementing automatic irrigation on drip-irrigated apple trees. The presented
    irrigation scheduling approaches have the potential to improve water use efficiency,
    increased production, reduced production costs, reduced pumping energy requirements,
    and improved quality. Here, we mainly examined the various hardware and software
    aspects of a SCADA system and the suitability of the irrigation scheduling algorithms
    for maintaining well-watered trees. Future studies will reveal more on their benefits
    for decreasing losses of water and nutrients to deep percolation and their effect
    on yield and fruit quality. Acknowledgments This research was funded by the US

  limitations: This study was preliminary and conducted in a single orchard location
    and a one-season trial without replication. The results cannot be generalized
    to other orchard systems including type of trees and canopy shape, and soil type
    and depth. Other irrigation strategies like regulated deficit irrigation which
    is a common practice in the apple industry were not examined here. The thermal-based
    approaches are expected to be more effective under clear day conditions. This
    study also did not investigate and compare different crop water stress indices
    which could have shown different levels of sensitivity to water stress under various
    orchard and weather conditions.

    Water available for agricultural use is declining worldwide as a result of both
    declining water resources and increasing application costs. Managing crop irrigation
    under conditions where the water need cannot be fully met represents the future
    of irrigation in many areas. On the southern high plains of Texas there is interest
    among producers to reduce the amount of water applied to cotton. In this study,
    a producer’s efforts to reduce water application to a cotton crop were assessed
    in terms of a comparison between evapotranspiration, rainfall, and irrigation
    that is widely used in the region. The producer was able to reduce water application
    to meet intended reductions relative to the evapotranspiration estimates but,
    depending on the method used for calculating the crop water need, he tended to
    over water the crop in two out of three intended deficit irrigation regimes. Analysis
    of continuously monitored canopy temperatures provided verification of over-irrigation.
    Continuously monitored canopy temperature is proposed as a useful adjunct to evapotranspiration
    approaches to deficit irrigation management. Similar content being viewed by others

    irrigation management during the growing season in the arid region of northwestern
    China Article 23 October 2015 Introduction From a global perspective, limited
    water resources are becoming one of the greatest challenges facing agriculture
    and thus civilization in this nascent century (Howell 2001; Faurèsa et al. 2003).
    Rhoades (1997) postulated that increases in food production in developing countries
    will primarily come from irrigated lands. Agricultural water on the southern high
    plains of Texas was once inexpensive and abundant; today it is increasingly expensive
    and scarce. In particular, the increased energy costs associated with pumping
    of water from irrigation wells have increased the cost of a typical irrigation
    event by a factor of almost four over the last 15 years. Irrigated land accounts
    for approximately 50% of crop production in the region of Texas that relies on
    the Ogallala aquifer (Pate and Johnson 2010). In addition to the increased energy
    costs, agricultural producers in the region are confronted with decreasing water
    resources that are increasingly a focus of political and societal concern. The
    combined effects of rising cost and diminished availability are creating a need
    for new irrigation approaches that are tailored to this situation. Improved water
    transport and storage systems, mechanized irrigation systems and drip systems
    have all increased the efficiency of irrigation in terms of delivering water to
    the crop in a timely manner to produce maximum yield. In some irrigation systems
    there is still the opportunity to improve irrigation efficiency through improved
    water transport and application. Such “engineering” approaches are straightforward
    and the water efficiencies they provide can be substantial. However, regardless
    of the engineered efficiency of the water management, there is the potential to
    improve the physiological efficiency of water use by the crop. Such “physiological”
    approaches, based on the biology of plant water use, provide opportunities to
    manage both water use and yield in terms of an economic balance. The costs of
    irrigation and other crop inputs that are incurred in pursuit of maximum yield
    at some point will result in a reduced total economic return from the crop. There
    is a growing interest in defining the economic efficiency of irrigated agricultural
    systems with an eye toward maximizing economic returns as opposed to yield. There
    is a growing interest among agricultural producers in irrigation approaches to
    reduce the amount of water applied to crops and a stated willingness to accept
    some yield reduction if it can be offset by reduced water costs (Pate and Johnson
    2010). Thus, there is a renewed interest in new approaches to irrigation management
    on the southern high plains of Texas with the ultimate goal of reducing the amount
    of water used for irrigation. On the southern high plains of Texas irrigation
    well capacities are limited to the point that many center pivot irrigation systems
    cannot apply water at a rate that will meet the maximal crop demand in mid season
    (Trout and Kincaid 2007). In the region the accepted irrigation strategy over
    the past few decades has been an approach that relies on early and frequent irrigation
    that is intended to exceed the water requirements of the plant early in the season
    so that moisture can be accumulated, or “banked” in the soil for use by the plant
    later in the season. This approach has been relatively successful as evidenced
    by the continued success of the region’s cotton industry. While the concept of
    banking soil moisture in order to preempt water deficits later in the season is
    appealing, such an approach severely limits efforts to actually reduce the amount
    of water applied. The desire to reduce the amount of water used in crop production
    is not limited to the southern high plains of Texas, since water for irrigation
    is becoming increasingly scarce on a global basis. Reductions in agricultural
    irrigations are of interest in that, if done correctly, it is possible that water
    savings can be realized with yield reductions that could be economically acceptable.
    It is the balance between water savings and yield reductions that will ultimately
    determine the acceptability of any irrigation approach that is designed to reduce
    the amount of water applied to the crop. Any effort to reduce water use in a cropping
    system will require both a scientific understanding of the relationship between
    water and crop performance and a means of assessing the water status of the crop.
    The level of complexity associated with a determination of the water requirement
    of a crop is, of course, related to the accuracy required. Under irrigation regimes
    that approach full irrigation (fully meeting the water requirement of the crop)
    plant performance becomes insensitive to water at the upper end of the irrigation
    continuum and variation in plant performance due to errors in assessing water
    requirements are not readily apparent. Many of the producers on the southern high
    plains of Texas can still irrigate in amounts that are of a magnitude such that
    small variation does not significantly affect performance. Substantial water savings
    will require irrigation management methods that render plant performance sensitive
    to irrigation amount and produce a situation where irrigation errors will be readily
    detectable. If indeed irrigation on the southern high plains of Texas will require
    increased reliance on controlled deficits for sustainability, then improved approaches
    to water management will be needed (Baumhardt et al. 2009). The most commonly
    used irrigation management approaches are based on accounting methods that attempt
    to monitor moisture added to the soil in the form of irrigation and rain and balance
    those amounts against an estimate of the water lost from the soil as drainage,
    evaporation and transpiration. While evapotranspiration approaches have proven
    adequate for use in irrigation that attempts to fully meet the demand of the crop,
    they may not be sufficiently accurate for use in managed deficit irrigation that
    is designed to reduce water applied to the crop. Irrigation on a deficit level,
    in which success requires a more precise balance between water application and
    crop water status, will most likely benefit from measurements of crop water status
    (Jones 2004). Such direct measurements of crop water status, when used in conjunction
    with estimates of soil moisture and accurate measurements of rain and irrigation
    may best provide the accuracy required for managing water deficits and reducing
    water applied to the crop. In this study we have used continuous measurement of
    canopy temperature as a direct indicator of crop water status over time (Wanjura
    et al. 1995). A commercially available wireless infrared thermometry system was
    used to continuously monitor the temperature of the cotton canopy during the irrigation
    period of the crop. The stated goal of the producer in this study was to reduce
    water application to a cotton crop near Plainview, Texas (Hale County). The producer
    was responsible for all phases of the study with the exception of the canopy temperature
    measurements. Canopy temperature monitoring has been previously used for irrigation
    scheduling in this region by the researchers and this producer. In this instance,
    the goal of monitoring temperature was to investigate canopy temperature monitoring
    as a tool for validating and refining water management in an agricultural setting
    in which evapotranspiration is relied on for irrigation management. Materials
    and methods The study consisted of observations of a cotton crop on a private
    farm near Plainview, Texas, in 2009. All crop management was determined and carried
    out by the producer. The investigators were responsible for canopy temperature
    monitoring, calculating water applied, and analysis of various evapotranspiration
    (ET) estimations. The investigators did not set up the irrigation treatments or
    participate in any of the crop management. Cotton crop Cultural practices were
    standard for the region and were developed and carried out by the producer. Cotton
    was planted on 15 May 2009. A pre-plant irrigation and subsequent rain events
    provided sufficient moisture for establishment of the crop. Differential irrigation
    regimes were initiated on DOY 185 (July 4). The field experienced an infestation
    of verticillium wilt that was concluded to have affected yield and quality in
    the highest irrigation regime. The cotton was harvested at the end of the season
    by the producer who provided yield data. Irrigation regimes The producer established
    three irrigation regimes in the cotton crop to investigate water and yield relationships.
    High, medium and low irrigation regimes were established with the goal of applying
    85, 65, and 50%, respectively, of the crops’ seasonal water need based upon the
    100% reference ET value reported from a regional weather station site. The producer
    routinely uses the reference ET value from this site as an estimate of crop water
    requirement and as a basis for irrigation management. Rain During the irrigation
    period there were 24 rain events that totaled 178 mm (Fig. 1). The smallest rain
    amount was 0.32 mm and the largest was 22 mm. Rain events were well distributed
    over the season. Fig. 1 Rainfall events at the field site near Plainview TX during
    the 2009 growing season. Total amount was 178 mm Full size image Irrigation Irrigation
    was applied with a center pivot irrigation system that covered an area of 54 ha
    (134 acres). One half of the field was planted with cotton with the other half
    planted with grain sorghum that was irrigated in the same manner as the cotton.
    The cotton field was 26 ha (65 acres) in size. The pivot required approximately
    72 h to apply an irrigation to the cotton and, when the time required to irrigate
    the sorghum is included, the cotton could be irrigated once every 5–6 days. The
    producer delayed irrigation in response to rain on several occasions. Well-flow
    was monitored at the pivot with a flow meter (Net Irrigate, Bloomington, Indiana,
    USA, http://netirrigate.com). The system provided approximately 35 mm of water
    per hectare for each irrigation event on the highest water regime. The medium
    and low irrigation regimes consisted of 8 adjacent rows for each regime (in the
    center of the pivot circle) that were nozzled to provide 20 and 35% less water
    than the highest irrigation regime. The volume of water delivered to the crop
    by each of the irrigation regimes was verified with end-of-season volumetric validation.
    Seven irrigations were applied over the course of the growing season on a schedule
    determined by the producer. The medium and low irrigation regimes received approximately
    27 and 21 mm of water per irrigation, respectively. All regimes were irrigated
    simultaneously. Temperature monitoring Canopy temperatures were monitored over
    the growing season using a SmartCrop wireless infrared thermometer (IRT) system
    (Smartfield Inc., Lubbock, Texas, USA, http://smartfield.com). The SmartCrop system
    has been previously described (Mahan and Yeater 2008; Mahan et al. 2010). The
    system uses a combination of wireless remote IRT sensors placed in the field and
    a remote base station on the edge of the field to continuously collect canopy
    temperature. The remote IRT sensors were positioned approximately 20 cm above
    the canopy at a view angle of approximately 60° downward, from the horizontal
    and perpendicular to the row. The remote IRT sensors were adjusted weekly to maintain
    the 20 cm height as the crop canopy developed. The sensor has a 1:1 field of view
    and the observed area of canopy monitored was approximately 20 cm in diameter.
    At the earliest monitoring dates (DOY 176 to DOY 189) the canopy did not completely
    fill the IRT sensor’s field of view and the measured canopy temperature thus included
    a mixture of leaf and bare soil. After DOY 190, the field of view was comprised
    largely of plant canopy. The canopy temperature was measured at 1-min intervals
    with 15-min averages calculated by the remote sensors for automated transmission
    to the base unit once every 15 min. The collected canopy temperature data were
    transmitted via a cellular data link once every 2 h to a website for archiving
    and subsequent analysis. Data quality was good with only 72 h (out of a total
    of 1,440 h) of data “lost” over the season. One remote IRT sensor was used in
    each of the three irrigation regimes. Placement was determined on the basis of
    a representative canopy with the sensors along a radial line from the center of
    the pivot. The sensors were approximately 20 m apart along the radius of the pivot.
    The sensors remained in the same location during the entire measurement period.
    Air temperature was measured at 2 m above ground level by the SmartCrop remote
    base station on the edge of the field surrounded by the crop on the same measurement
    interval as the remote IRT canopy temperature. Collecting canopy temperature data
    was relatively simple. Installation of the systems in the field required approximately
    1 h. The producer checked the sensors at least weekly for height adjustment and
    all data were collected remotely. ET estimates Four estimates of evapotranspiration
    were used in the study: Agrilife/Lockney ET—reference ET from the Texas Agrilife
    website for Lockney, Texas (20 km from field site), Private ET—reference ET from
    the website of the private company providing pivot monitoring for the producer,
    Private cropET—crop ET estimated by the private company providing pivot monitoring
    for the producer and adjusted with crop coefficients for cotton, and Agrilife/Lockney
    cropET—Crop ET calculated by the FAO 56 method with crop coefficients for cotton
    and weather data from the Texas Agrilife site for Lockney, Texas (20 km from field
    site). The producer used Agrilife/Lockney ET as the basis for his irrigation management.
    The other ET estimates are presented as an example of the data that are available
    to the typical cotton producer in the region for irrigation management. The intent
    is not to debate the appropriateness of any individual estimate but rather the
    limitations inherent in the use of such estimates as a class. Results/discussion
    Expected versus actual results The producer intended to reduce the application
    of water to provide as little as 50% of the seasonal water requirement of the
    crop based on a 601 mm estimate of the seasonal ET obtained from the Agrilife/Lockney
    ET value. This ET estimate is derived from a weather station approximately 20
    km from his field. The pivot was nozzled to produce differential irrigation that
    was intended to provide approximately 85, 65, and 50% of the seasonal water requirement
    of the crop as determined by an ET calculation. This range of applied water would
    be expected to result in differential water stress in the crop of a magnitude
    that would result in substantial yield reductions. The water and yield results
    for the season are shown in Table 1. The 2009 growing season was typical for the
    region with intermittent in-season rainfall totaling 178 mm occurring in 24 events
    (Fig. 1). Over the course of the season, the three irrigation regimes received
    differential irrigation amounting to 249, 199 and 162 mm, which with rainfall
    of 178 mm, resulted in total water to the crop of 427, 377, and 340 mm. Given
    the producer’s irrigation targets of 85, 65 and 50% of seasonal ET and his ET
    estimate of 601 mm, the irrigation regimes provided 71, 62 and 56% of the seasonal
    ET estimate. The water amounts, which are relatively close to the targets, suggest
    that substantial yield reductions might be expected to have occurred. Table 1
    Summary of water data for the interval DOY 135 to DOY 273 Full size table Yield
    and water relationships The yield data from the water treatments did not follow
    the expected trend (Table 1). The highest yield, 1,540 kg/ha was associated with
    the 65% target irrigation regime with the 50% target irrigation producing a somewhat
    lower yield of 1,396 kg/ha. The lowest yield, 1,003 kg/ha was produced by the
    85% target regime. Clearly this was not the intended outcome given that the producer’s
    goal was to generate information on the potential yield reductions associated
    with targeted irrigation water savings. While water application was indeed reduced
    relative to the reference ET (potential evapotranspiration of a grass reference
    crop), if yield and water relationships are taken at “face value”, the conclusion
    would be that reducing irrigation would not only save water, but also would increase
    yield as well. An attractive result but clearly one that strongly suggests a problem
    somewhere else in the analysis. The producer wanted to save water on his cotton
    crop and his efforts resulted in differential water use but no substantial reduction
    in yield. This indicates some of the difficulties associated with water management
    in production environments. The most obvious conclusions are that (1) the crop
    did not experience the degree of water stress that was expected and (2) the amount
    of water received by the crop was sufficient to meet much of crop’s demand. The
    following sections provide a post hoc analysis of the water management of the
    crop in an effort to explain the failure of the putative irrigation reductions
    to induce the expected yield reductions. The water requirement of the crop The
    water requirement of the crop, which is the basis for the putative water deficits,
    is an estimated (calculated) value that is dependent on a number of assumptions
    about the crop. In order to effectively manage crop water through an ET estimate
    the producer must have a reliable estimate of ET over the course of the season.
    The variability associated with estimations of crop water requirement in terms
    of ET that are available to a producer is shown in Fig. 2 which displays the cumulative
    crop water requirement based on a planting date of 15 May 2009. The following
    estimates of a cotton crop water requirement at the Plainview TX field site for
    2009 are: 610 mm estimated by the Agrilife/Lockney ET, 610 mm obtained from the
    Private ET source, 381 mm obtained from the Private cropET source, and 381 mm
    obtained from the Agrilife/Lockney cropET source. While the pattern of reference
    ET calculated by the Private ET and the Agrilife/Lockney ET sources differ over
    time, the seasonal totals are virtually identical. The crop-adjusted values from
    the Private cropET and Agrilife/Lockney cropET sources differ only slightly over
    time with the seasonal totals once again virtually identical. Fig. 2 Cumulative
    ET estimates of over the interval DOY 135–DOY 273 for a cotton crop near Plainview
    TX in 2009. Evapotranspiration was calculated as a daily value using weather data
    from the region Full size image By the end of the season, water amounts received
    by the crop, relative to the estimated crop need, varied depending on the source
    of the ET estimate. Since the pivot nozzles established the irrigation regimes,
    the proportional differences among the regimes were constant regardless of the
    ET estimate. Only the 100% ET values are shown on Fig. 2. Though they differ slightly
    from one another, the four ET estimates are scientifically based and can be used
    as a guide for crop water management. Given the producer’s ability to easily acquire
    several estimates of the crop water requirement, the question facing the producer
    in any effort to manage irrigation based on ET is which of the several alternatives
    is the most appropriate. The producer in this instance based his estimates of
    ET on the Agrilife/Lockney ET value of 610 mm. This value does not include any
    adjustment based on a crop coefficient and is a reference ET value. This value
    will in general overestimate the water need of the crop and will require modification
    with seasonally adjusted crop coefficients to appropriately estimate the water
    requirement of the crop. In practice the producer in the study typically bases
    his full irrigation regime on the reference ET and attempts to apply 85% of that
    value as an indication of the crop water requirement. This approach is probably
    based on the fact that the producer has been growing the same crop, on the same
    land, with the same pivot and well, with similar planting dates for 20 years.
    The idea of using a reference ET in place of a crop ET approach apparently gets
    the producer “close enough” for his purposes. Whether the approach is the best
    or simply suitable, it is what the producer has found useful. Figure 3 represents
    the seasonal water input of the crop based on the Agrilife/Lockney ET 601 mm value
    as the estimate of the crop’s water requirement and the measured irrigation and
    rain amounts. It is evident that this approach should have produced significant
    water deficits in the crop with the amount of irrigation and rainfall below the
    estimated environmental demand throughout the entire season. As previously stated,
    the yield data did not agree with water deficits of the magnitude suggested by
    the producer’s intended outcome. Fig. 3 Producer’s estimate of seasonal ET as
    obtained from the Agrilife/Lockney ET source during the summer of 2009. The website
    is operated by Texas Agrilife for use by producers. The estimate represents reference
    ET for the site and was used by the producer as an estimate of crop water use
    and was the basis of 85, 65, and 50% target regimes. The seasonal ET estimate
    on this basis was 601 mm. Rain and irrigation on a daily basis for the three target
    regimes are 427, 377 and 340 mm. The values indicate the percentage of the ET
    target that was achieved by the irrigation regimes based on the 601 mm ET estimate
    Full size image Since the ET number is an estimate for a hypothetical reference
    surface, it is appropriate to adjust it in order to reach agreement with the measured
    irrigation and plant parameters. Figure 4 illustrates the effect of using the
    crop coefficient to adjust the reference ET over the season. The Agrilife/Lockney
    cropET and Private cropET pivot company ET crop values were quite similar and
    the Private cropET source values have been used in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Estimate of
    seasonal crop ET (Private cropET) using variable crop coefficients as provided
    to the producer by a pivot monitoring company during the summer of 2009. The values
    indicate the percentage of the estimated ET that was achieved by the irrigation
    target regimes based on the 381 mm Private cropET source estimate Full size image
    Incorporation of an estimate of crop ET in the analysis results in a very different
    water scenario for the crop. The 85% target regime received a seasonal total of
    112% of the crop ET-based requirement thus exceeding the crop water need. Under
    this regime, water (irrigation and rainfall) exceeded crop demand at all times
    during the season. The 65% target regime provided 99% of the estimated water need
    of the crop with only one short period of deficit toward the end of the season.
    The 50% target irrigation regime resulted in 89% of the crop demand being met
    on a seasonal basis. Over the interval from DOY 134–238, water exceeded the crop
    demand and only after DOY 238 did a water deficit develop in the low (50%) target
    regime. Thus, the water deficit developed rather late in the season in terms of
    crop and fiber development. One of the potential drawbacks of using reference
    ET is that the development of a water “surplus” early in the season makes it difficult
    to achieve reductions in water use in the early season. It is probable that in
    an indeterminate crop like cotton such early season water surpluses alter the
    growth and development of the crop in a manner that work against optimal water
    use. The plant is, in the end, a biological organism that will respond to its
    actual water status as opposed to an intended seasonal water balance that exists
    on paper (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Estimates of water balance for a cotton crop in 2009
    near Plainview TX based on two ET estimates for three irrigation regimes. Agrilife/Lockney
    ET is reference ET and Private cropET is ET adjusted with crop coefficients for
    cotton irrigation regime provided by a pivot monitoring company Full size image
    Crop water use as estimated by the crop ET is in general agreement with the yield
    data in that the highest yield was associated with the irrigation regime that
    most closely approached the water need of the crop without exceeding it. The treatment
    that received 112% of the crop ET showed reduced yield relative to the 99 and
    89% applications. It is well established that excessive water application in an
    indeterminate crop, such as cotton, can result in excess vegetative growth and
    reductions in fiber yield and quality (Tennakoon and Milroy 2003; Hearn 1995;
    Hake and Grimes 2010). The field in this study was subject to a late season disease
    problem (verticillium wilt) that was probably exacerbated by the excessive water
    application that possibly contributed to reduced yield at the highest water level.
    The yields for the lower two irrigation regimes were in the range that would be
    expected based on the fraction of the crop water requirement that was provided.
    The balance between water requirement and water supply over the season is shown
    for the 601 mm reference ET from the Agrilife/Lockney ET source and the 381 mm
    crop ET estimate from the Private cropET source. The Agrilife/Lockney ET estimate
    shows a deficit of crop water over the entire season while the Private cropET
    estimate indicates a water surplus condition up until approximately DOY 214 with
    the irrigation and rain falling below crop ET for the remainder of the season.
    The results of the water management of the cotton crop in this study can be summarized
    as follows: (1) the producer created three irrigation regimes that according to
    his understanding should have resulted in noticeable effects on yield, (2) yield
    did not vary in accord with the predictions based on putative water deficits in
    the crop, and (3) different estimates of ET provide very different explanations
    of the water status of the crop over time. Analysis of canopy temperature data
    Based on the preceding analysis of the ET-based irrigation management the following
    question was asked, “Can the continuously monitored canopy temperature data collected
    over the season provide additional insight into the water relations of the crop?”.
    The following sections will attempt to answer the question. It is evident that
    ET estimates from a variety of sources can provide a good foundation for irrigation
    management though misuse of ET estimates can complicate and even confound producer’s
    efforts to precisely manage irrigation. The inclusion of a direct measurement
    of crop water status may provide information that will enhance the ability to
    manage irrigation under deficit conditions. It has been known for decades that
    canopy temperatures are sensitive to the water status of the plant (Pinter et
    al. 2003; Wanjura and Mahan 1994; Peters and Evett 2004) and much research has
    been devoted to remotely sensed canopy temperature as a crop management tool.
    One of the impediments to the adoption of such approaches in production agriculture
    has been the cost and complexity of temperature monitoring equipment. Mahan and
    Yeater (2008) and Mahan et al. (2010) have recently described the performance
    of a relatively low-cost infrared thermometry system that is designed for use
    in agricultural production settings. This system is commercially available and
    is in use by researchers and producers. With such a system it is now possible
    to continuously monitor canopy temperatures in crops and the use of canopy temperature
    by producers as a management tool may soon be routinely practiced. The BIOTIC
    irrigation protocol that was developed by the USDA/ARS over a period of years
    provided a novel approach to the use of canopy temperature measurement for irrigation
    scheduling in full irrigation regimes (Upchurch et al. 1996). It has been commercialized
    and is now available under the trade name SmartCrop. The limitations on water
    supply and cost are changing the focus from full to deficit irrigation that will
    require some modifications of the BITOIC protocol. In this study, the use of canopy
    temperatures as a tool for managing deficit irrigation in cotton has been investigated.
    In this study, the researchers used canopy temperature data to elucidate differences
    in irrigation management approaches that help to explain the results of efforts
    to reduce water application in a commercial cotton crop. By using seasonal canopy
    temperature data in conjunction with traditional ET-based irrigation management,
    the producer was able to assess the appropriateness of various ET estimates for
    deficit irrigation management. Canopy temperatures were measured continuously
    over the time period from DOY 176 to DOY 236 (DAP 41–101) on an 1-min interval
    with 15-min averages used for analysis. The canopy temperature for the three irrigation
    regimes and the air temperature for the season are shown in Fig. 6. While such
    a representation of the data clearly demonstrates the continuity of the measurements,
    the differences and similarities among treatments are not readily apparent. One
    of the difficulties associated with continuous canopy temperature measurements
    is the shear magnitude of the number of observations that are collected. Since
    each sensor is capable of collecting 10,000 observations in a season, there are
    approximately 40,000 observations of air and canopy temperature. Fig. 6 Cotton
    canopy temperature for the three target irrigation regimes during the interval
    from DOY 176 to DOY 236 in 2009 near Plainview TX. Air temperature measured a
    2 m height in turn row. Temperature scale is shown on inset Full size image In
    an effort to use canopy temperature as an indicator of crop water status, it needs
    to be recognized that diurnal temperature data includes a large number of measurements
    that are not strongly indicative of water status. Canopy temperatures during periods
    of darkness and cool cloudy days are not particularly sensitive to the water status
    of the crop. It is a simple matter to reduce the dataset by excluding night temperatures.
    The removal of night data serves to “break” the diurnal pattern and makes it easier
    to focus on the water-related temperature variation. While eliminating nighttime
    temperature reduces the visual clutter on the graph, it does not convey information
    on the potential effect of specific temperatures on the metabolism of the plant.
    The metabolic ramifications of the thermal variation can be incorporated into
    the analysis by comparing the canopy temperatures to a base temperature that is
    based on a metabolic indicator. According to the BIOTIC protocol (Wanjura et al.
    1995; Upchurch et al. 1996; Mahan et al. 2005), canopy temperatures in excess
    of the biological optimum are a useful indicator of water deficits and their possible
    effects on plant metabolism. In Fig. 7, canopy temperatures have been filtered
    to remove values that are below 27°C which is 1°C less than the 28°C BIOTIC temperature
    optimal for cotton (Burke et al. 1988). The temperature scale on the figure is
    indicated by the shaded “bar” with a range from 28 to 32°C. The temperatures above
    the optimal temperature “bar” indicate potential water and metabolic stress in
    the crop. In these graphs the temperatures are vertically scaled the same for
    purposes of comparison. Thus, the heights of the peaks represent the same magnitude
    of temperature. When “filtered” with respect to optimal temperatures, the pattern
    of canopy temperature provides a view of the magnitude of stresses and the temporal
    pattern of the stresses. These biologically filtered, multi-day patterns of elevated
    canopy temperatures represent “stress signatures” for the periods of interest.
    Since a large number of stress signatures can be arranged on a single page, the
    arrangement of small multiples allows rapid visual comparisons of relationships
    among crops, water treatments, irrigation systems and years. In this format the
    viewer can visualize the temporal pattern of potential water deficits and their
    potential severity. Fig. 7 Cotton stress signatures for the three target irrigation
    regimes during the interval from DOY 176 to DOY 236 in 2009 near Plainview TX.
    Temperature scale is shown on inset. Canopy temperatures are filtered to show
    only temperatures that are above 27°C in order to emphasize temperatures that
    are associated with water deficits. The shaded bar represents the temperature
    range of 28–32°C that is an indicator of optimal metabolic temperature for cotton.
    Temperatures above the shaded bar are proposed to be indicative of water and metabolic
    stress in the crop. Gaps in signatures indicate temperatures below 27°C as opposed
    to missing data. Air temperature measured at 2 m height in the field Full size
    image Figure 7 shows the stress signatures of this irrigation management study
    involving multiple irrigation treatments. The stress signatures for the three
    irrigations regimes indicate the temporal pattern and magnitude of thermal/metabolic
    stresses over the growing season. During the early stages of crop development
    (DOY 176–DOY 192) there is thermal/metabolic stress evident in all three water
    treatments. During this period stress is present in all irrigation regimes with
    some portion of the elevated temperatures associated with the presence of background
    soil in the field of view at the canopy develops. After DOY 192 the stress levels
    in the irrigation regimes are similar and suggest that water deficits were not
    prevalent. This is in agreement with the predicted water relations of the crop
    (Fig. 4). The development of increased canopy temperatures in the 50% target regime
    as compared to the 85 and 65% target regimes is evident at about DOY 215. This
    stress signal development suggests a transition of the crop from a well watered
    to water deficit condition at this point in the season. Canopy temperature difference
    signatures To further explore the differences in canopy temperature among the
    target irrigation regimes, the canopy temperatures of the 85% target regime were
    subtracted from the 65 and 50% target regime temperatures to produce temperature
    differential signatures (Fig. 8, bar graph). Since the 85% target regime received
    the highest amount of water it has been used as the basis of comparison and canopy
    temperature differences are calculated as: 65% canopy temperature − 85% canopy
    temperature and 50% canopy temperature − 85% canopy temperature. In this figure
    values of zero indicate that the temperature of the regimes is equal to the 85%
    target regime, negative values indicate temperatures cooler than the 85% target
    regime and positive values indicate temperatures warmer than the 85% target regime.
    Prior to DOY 214 (vertical dashed line), the pattern of the differences among
    the three treatments is similar with more or less random variation about the 85%
    target canopy temperature (zero value) in both the 65 and 50% target treatments
    indicating no systematic differences among the three irrigation regimes. After
    approximately DOY 214 the canopy temperatures of the 50% target regimes begin
    to rise relative to the 85 and 65% target regimes indicating elevated canopy temperatures
    and suggesting the onset of a differential water status among the three regimes.
    This finding is in agreement with the suggestion that the 85 and 65% target regimes
    probably received full or excessive irrigation. During the period from DOY 214
    to the end of the season the canopy temperatures of the 50% target regime were
    higher than the 85% target regime and the 65% target regime was most similar to
    the 85% target. The upper panel in Fig. 8 shows the difference between crop water
    and estimated crop ET that is an indication of crop water status in terms of surplus
    and deficit (positive and negative values, respectively). It is evident that the
    temperature deviation in the 50% target regime occurs at the same time (DOY 214)
    that the crop water status begins to transition from surplus to deficit. This
    relationship suggests that the canopy temperature is a useful adjunct to evapotranspiration
    information in understanding the water status of the crop over time. Fig. 8 Canopy
    temperature differences among the 85, 65, and 50% target regimes of irrigation.
    Canopy temperatures of the 85% target regime (control) were subtracted from the
    65 and 50% target. The upper panel indicates the balance between crop water and
    estimated crop ET. For each target regime, the cumulative daily crop ET (Private
    cropET) estimate was subtracted from cumulative irrigation and rain. Vertical
    line at DOY 214 indicates transition from surplus to deficit condition Full size
    image Irrigation management in an age of declining water availability Physical
    limitations and economic factors together are limiting water available for agricultural
    use virtually worldwide. These declining water resources coupled with continued
    population growth combine to create a future in which agricultural water problems
    will no longer be solved through increased efficiency of irrigation systems. While
    every effort to increase the timely and efficient provision of water to crops
    should be undertaken, researchers must continue to define the extent to which
    plant water deficits can be managed to reduce and optimize the balance between
    reduced water application and crop productivity. Most irrigation management tools
    are based on inferring the water need of the crop based upon a measurement of
    the environment, i.e., the soil or the air. While these inferential methods are
    scalable and adequate to the needs of most full irrigation regimes, future demands
    for reduced irrigation in crops necessitate the development of new tools and approaches.
    To move beyond the current methodology, it may be useful to include a direct measure
    of the physiological state of the plant. Water potential, transpiration and gas
    exchange are often used successfully in research settings (Lascano et al. 1992;
    Trambouze and Voltz 2001; Jones 2004; Stöckle and Dugas 1992) though they are
    not easily adaptable to production agriculture. Continuous measurement of canopy
    temperature represents a useful approach in that it is relatively inexpensive,
    easily automated and readily adapted to production settings. Crop canopy temperature
    as an irrigation management tool What exactly can the producer discern from continuous
    canopy temperature measurements that can be used to reduce irrigation in production
    environments? There are several levels at which canopy temperature data can be
    instructive. In real time or short (daily or weekly) timescales the temperatures
    can be monitored to indicate such things as irrigation system performance, rainfall
    utilization and the current stress status of the plant. The installation of a
    number of IR sensors strategically placed within a pivot or irrigation management
    zone will allow the producer to see water deficits spatially within an irrigation
    system. Incorrect nozzling of sections of a pivot or differential water application
    along the pivot or within the circle can be identified in terms of thermal variation.
    In a region in which in-season rainfall can provide a significant portion of the
    crop’s water requirement altering irrigation in response to in-season rainfall
    events represents an avenue to the actual reduction in the amount of water used
    by a crop. To accomplish this, the producer must balance the advantages of suspending
    irrigation following rain against the possibility that irrigation is not resumed
    in a timely manner resulting in a crop water deficit. Since it is difficult to
    ascertain when the crop has exhausted the rainwater, many producers are hesitant
    to suspend irrigation after a rain. Continuously monitored canopy temperature
    can provide a basis for identifying the crop response to rain events. The rise
    in canopy temperatures following the depletion of the rain-associated moisture
    may provide a useful signal for the re-initiation of irrigation. When the producer’s
    goal is to use irrigation to manage water deficits as opposed to prevent them,
    knowledge of the crop water status on a somewhat quantitative and relatively short
    time interval may be desirable. Canopy temperature can provide plant-based information
    on the water status of the crop. Because it can be collected on short time intervals
    (15 min in this study), it can provide a level of resolution that is unequaled
    by virtually all other measures of the plant. The analytical approaches in this
    study represent only an initial attempt to elucidate the relationships between
    canopy temperature and plant water status and performance. Obvious extensions
    include analysis of the relationships between canopy temperature and environmental
    factors such as relative humidity, vapor pressure deficits and radiation. Inclusion
    of such information in the interpretation of canopy temperatures may indeed improve
    their use as indicators of plant water status on a production relevant scale.
    Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential difficulties associated with
    efforts to reduce water use in agricultural settings. In this instance the efforts
    of a producer to reduce water application on a cotton crop to the point of yield
    reductions have been monitored. The producer-implemented irrigation regimes that
    were designed to result in total water of 85, 65, and 50% of the seasonal crop
    demand. Yield was not reduced as anticipated from the water supplied to the crop.
    The 50% target regime in fact provided a near optimal balance between irrigation
    and yield. The result certainly looks like pleasant outcome (less water with no
    yield reduction) but certainly not as expected. End-of-season comparisons of ET
    estimates, well-flow data and canopy temperature signatures all indicated that
    the producer’s target irrigation regimes of 85, 65 and 50% actually resulted in
    total water of 112, 99, and 89% of an ET estimate incorporating seasonally adjusted
    crop coefficients. While the ET estimates are useful for managing crop water use,
    particularly in a post hoc analysis, the inclusion of crop coefficients is critical
    to the accurate assessment of crop water use. In this instance the producer was
    using a reference ET value for water management, which resulted in over-irrigation.
    Anecdotal information suggests that this practice may be surprisingly common.
    It points to the problem that while ET estimates are often the basis for irrigation
    management, the implementation may often be less than optimal. Of the methods
    employed in this study to characterize the water status of the crop, the canopy
    temperature measurements were available to the producer in real time from a commercially
    available device with little-to-no investment of time in-season. The canopy temperature
    based stress signatures in this study provided evidence of the similar water status
    in the 85 and 65% regimes and detected the change in crop water status of the
    50% treatment at approximately DOY 214. It is proposed that continuous measurement
    of canopy temperature using a wireless system of the type employed in this study
    can provide the producer with continuous information on the water status of the
    crop that is based on the crop itself. A wireless infrared thermometry system
    is simple to use and compatible with production agriculture settings. The use
    of a measured as opposed to inferred indicator of crop water status will provide
    the producer with another means of assessing the efficacy of irrigation practices.

    \ large efforts have been made to develop new methods to optimize\nstress detection\
    \ in crop ﬁelds. Thus, plant phenotyping based on imaging techniques has become\
    \ an\nessential tool in agriculture. In particular, leaf temperature is a valuable\
    \ indicator of the physiological\nstatus of plants, responding to both biotic\
    \ and abiotic stressors. Often combined with other imaging\nsensors and data-mining\
    \ techniques, thermography is crucial in the implementation of a more\nautomatized,\
    \ precise and sustainable agriculture. However, thermal data need some corrections\n\
    related to the environmental and measuring conditions in order to achieve a correct\
    \ interpretation of\nthe data. This review focuses on the state of the art of\
    \ thermography applied to the detection of biotic\nstress. The work will also\
    \ revise the most important abiotic stress factors affecting the measurements\n\
    as well as practical issues that need to be considered in order to implement this\
    \ technique, particularly\nat the ﬁeld scale.\nKeywords: Remote sensing; proximal\
    \ sensing; thermography; plant phenotyping\n1. Introduction\nEnvironmental conditions\
    \ driven by climate change and infections are great challenges\nthat need to be\
    \ overcome by modern agriculture. The economic loss in agriculture caused by\n\
    increasing environmental pressures could reach an annual 0.3% to 0.8% of projected\
    \ global\ngross domestic product by the end of the century [1]. Moreover, plant\
    \ diseases are the main\ncause of the drop in production and economic losses in\
    \ agriculture worldwide, reaching\nyield losses of 20 to 30% depending on the\
    \ crop [2]. Current practices and social activities\n-such as intensiﬁed monoculture\
    \ in large areas, the use of genetically uniform plant varieties\nand the development\
    \ of global supply chains and logistic activities- contribute largely to\nthe\
    \ widespread of plant disease epidemics and rapid pathogen evolution [3].\nPlant\
    \ phenotyping based on imaging techniques is a pertinent approach to quantify\n\
    the appearance and performance of crops under different environmental conditions\
    \ while\naddressing the spatial heterogeneity of crop ﬁelds. Therefore, plant\
    \ phenotyping, applied\nto precision agriculture, is a valuable tool for the diagnosis\
    \ and detection of plant stress,\neven in the absence of symptoms. Optical sensors\
    \ have been used to study (a) the response\nof plants to pathogens, pests and\
    \ abiotic stressors; (b) to identify primary disease foci; (c) to\nmonitor resistance\
    \ or susceptibility of different plant genotypes to speciﬁc stress factors;\n\
    (d) to evaluate the severity of symptoms; (e) and to assess plant biomass and\
    \ yield [4].\nStomatal activity is one of the most important physiological traits\
    \ for plant growth\nand development. It plays a crucial role in the carbon and\
    \ water balance by controlling\nphotosynthesis and transpiration [5]. Hence, stomatal\
    \ conductance to water (gs) is related\nto yield and to the tolerance of environmental\
    \ stresses [6] and correlates strongly with leaf\ntemperature [7–9]. Thermal long-wave\
    \ infrared (TIR) cameras (or simply thermal cameras)\nare calibrated sensors able\
    \ to record emitted radiation in the thermal range (8–14 µm)\nRemote Sens. 2021,\

    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n2 of 21\nand provide images representing temperature\
    \ values per pixel. Thus, conventional, time-\nconsuming ground-based gs measurements\
    \ can be feasibly replaced by thermal images\nevaluating plant physiological status\
    \ at different scales in short periods of time [10,11]. Ad-\nditionally, highly\
    \ sensitive thermal cameras with a relatively simple operational procedure\nhave\
    \ become more available to research groups, at a lower cost and at higher spatial\
    \ reso-\nlution [12,13]. Moreover, TIR imaging is a very valuable method of stress\
    \ detection prior to\nthe appearance of symptoms since it operates out of the\
    \ visual range of the spectrum [14].\nHowever, some considerations must be taken\
    \ when interpreting thermograms in terms\nof gs since plant surface temperature\
    \ is mainly driven by environmental factors such as\nair temperature and relative\
    \ humidity. Even though high-end thermal cameras carry out\ncorrections for these\
    \ two parameters, there are other factors affecting canopy temperatures,\nsuch\
    \ as wind speed and light intensity, as well as by plant features, ranging from\
    \ leaf size\nor angle to canopy structure. A number of corrections for these factors\
    \ can be found in\nthe literature as TIR stress indices (Table 1). Some of these\
    \ parameters have been found\nto correlate with physiological traits related to\
    \ the water balance status of plants (Table 2).\nThe most common TIR parameters\
    \ are:\n1.\nNormalized canopy or leaf temperature with reference to air temperature\
    \ (∆T), uti-\nlized as an index of crop water status. The applications of ∆T was\
    \ recently reviewed\nby Still et al. [15];\n2.\nCrop water stress index (CSWI),\
    \ which introduces two baselines: (Tcanopy − Tair)wet\nas the estimated difference\
    \ for a well-watered plant, and (Tcanopy − Tair)dry for a\ndry (non-transpiring)\
    \ plant. CWSI is one of the most commonly used normalization\nmethods for TIR\
    \ measurements, which overcomes the effects of other environmental\nparameters\
    \ affecting plant temperature [16,17];\n3.\nIndex of stomatal conductance (IG),\
    \ since it is directly proportional to this parame-\nter [18];\n4.\nMaximum temperature\
    \ difference (MTD), calculated for every leaf or sample [19].\nThis parameter\
    \ has only been correlated with the severity of symptoms for several\ndiseases,\
    \ as reviewed in [20,21];\n5.\nNormalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT),\
    \ based on the maximum and the\nminimum temperature measured in the whole ﬁeld\
    \ trial. This parameter has been\nfound to be a valid estimation of the crop water\
    \ status [22];\n6.\nAverage canopy temperature (Tav), based on maximum and minimum\
    \ values of\ntemperature, was one of the ﬁrst parameters used by the conventional\
    \ infrared\nthermography [23,24]. However, this parameter can excessively simplify\
    \ outcome\ndata, and some important thermal information can be lost. Estimated\
    \ shape factors\nderived by ﬁtting the whole temperature data of the thermal images\
    \ to the Weibull\ndistribution could solve this constraint [25].\nTable 1. Most\

    \ this technique per se\nhas a very limited capacity for diagnosis. Indeed, temperature\
    \ raises may be due to\nstomatal closure, which is on its own an unspeciﬁc mechanism\
    \ of plant defense against\nboth abiotic and biotic stressors. Even more, temperature\
    \ raises can also respond to a\ndecreased capacity for water evaporation or even\
    \ to the loss of vegetation [10]. In contrast,\nsome stresses can cause temporary\
    \ decreases in leaf temperature. That would be the case\nof some pathogens that\
    \ can interfere in the regulation of stomatal movements to favor\ntheir entry\
    \ to the mesophyll [68]. As a consequence, alterations in TIR parameters stand\n\
    as ambiguous clues for diagnosis. Moreover, abiotic stress factors (mostly drought,\
    \ soil\nsalinity or extreme ambient temperature) also cause increases in canopy\
    \ temperature.\nThis is most important under natural conditions, where abiotic\
    \ stressors are difﬁcult to\nassess and avoid. Keeping in mind that under such\
    \ conditions, several stress factors often\naffect the vegetation simultaneously,\
    \ possible misinterpretations of TIR data would lead to\ninaccurate determination\
    \ of the incidence and severity of a particular pathogen infection\nor even to\
    \ a wrong diagnosis.\nTo overcome the restraints of thermography as a diagnostic\
    \ technique, authors have\nincreasingly applied it in combination with other imaging\
    \ techniques. Roitsch et al. [69]\nand Sperschneider [70] reviewed the implementation\
    \ of TIR cameras with other sensors,\nsuch as RGB, multi- or hyperspectral cameras,\
    \ in phenotyping platforms. The identiﬁcation\nof spatial and temporal patterns\
    \ of TIR parameters in combination with other relevant\nvegetation indices (VIs)\
    \ could be of great help to establish robust methods for the early di-\nRemote\

    \ of a given plant-stressor interaction\nis desirable to obtain a stress-speciﬁc\
    \ signature [20].\nThe use of complementary imaging techniques provides valuable\
    \ and very complex\ninformation. This complexity is caused by the increasing number\
    \ of dimensions that can\nbe considered and the incessant improvements in their\
    \ spatial and temporal resolution.\nTo enhance our capacity for data analysis,\
    \ most recent works have included data-mining\nin their analysis. This multidisciplinary\
    \ approach, based on probability theory, statistics,\ndecision theory, visualization\
    \ and optimization, outperforms more conventional statistical\nanalysis in terms\
    \ of ﬁnding patterns in data [71,72]. Classiﬁers are algorithms able to learn\n\
    patterns from a database of known samples and, based on that knowledge, to identify\
    \ or\ncategorize new samples [73]. When applied to agriculture, this approach\
    \ facilitates the\ninterpretation of data and the decision-making process to such\
    \ an extent that no study\nappears to be complete without this type of analysis.\n\
    Thermography is extensively used for stress detection from lab to ﬁeld scale by\

    \ sensors and evaluation\nof their potential [79,80], their use in phenotyping\
    \ platforms [69,81,82] or UAVs [76,83–85],\nand their applications have also deserved\
    \ special attention by many authors. Moreover,\nother TIR applications have also\
    \ been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [15,20]. Furthermore,\nvery recent works\
    \ reviewed the state of the art in the application of artiﬁcial intelligence to\n\
    stress detection [70,72]. Despite the vast number of works addressing the use\
    \ of thermogra-\nphy for plant stress detection, little attention has been paid\
    \ to the physiological perspective\nof temperature alterations related to stressed\
    \ plants. Attending to this need, this review will\nrevise the most relevant applications\
    \ of thermography to agriculture with the main aim of\nproviding TIR camera users\
    \ with a collection of host plant–pathogen systems described in\nthe literature\
    \ in terms of thermal response and the mechanisms of plant defense involved.\n\
    Furthermore, a state-of-art review on the detection of abiotic stress by thermography\
    \ will\ncomplement our current knowledge on thermography applied to the diagnosis\
    \ of biotic\nstress in plants.\n2. Biotic Stress Detection by Thermography at\
    \ Different Scales\nStomata are the main natural entry of pathogens into the plant\
    \ tissues. Hence, the regu-\nlation of the stomatal movements plays a key role\
    \ in plant defense against microbes [86]. The\nrecognition of a potential pathogen\
    \ by plants usually triggers stomatal closure; to counteract\nthis defense response,\
    \ some pathogens are able to override the plant signaling pathways to\nactivate\
    \ stomatal aperture [87]. Other effects of pathogen infection include disturbances\
    \ on\nleaf development, cell wall and leaf cuticle composition or integrity, alterations\
    \ in the plant\nmetabolism or even necrosis of the tissues. These physical and\
    \ chemical disturbances affect\nthe plant water status, which can be monitored\
    \ by thermography [88–90].\n2.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    2.1.1. Viral Infections\nEven when some virosis cause alterations neither in gs\
    \ nor in leaf temperature [91],\nthermography is very often helpful in tracking\
    \ viral infections on plants. Most of those\nworks report temperature increases\
    \ between +0.5 and +1.5 K; on the contrary, some works\nreported decreases in\
    \ leaf temperature of −0.5 K relative to mock-controls. Hypersensi-\ntive response\
    \ (HR) to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) could be visualized as spots of elevated\n\
    temperature before any disease symptoms became visible on tobacco leaves. Those\
    \ spots\nwere conﬁned to the site of infection as a result of the HR triggered\
    \ by salicylic acid. On\nthe other hand, no thermal response was observed on susceptible\
    \ tobacco-TMV-infected\nplants [92]. In the case of Pepper middle mottle virus\
    \ (PMMoV)-Nicotiana benthamiana plants,\nvirus spreading through asymptomatic\
    \ leaves could be ﬁrst detected by an increase in\ntemperature on the tissues\
    \ around the main veins. This effect extended to adjacent tissues\nbefore the\
    \ spreading of the virus across the midrib of the leaf, as shown by immunolocaliza-\n\
    tion. Interestingly, the thermal symptoms caused by the most severe strain of\
    \ PMMoV were\ndetected before those caused by the less virulent one [93]. Among\
    \ other tobamoviruses,\nCucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Cucumber green mottle\
    \ mosaic virus (CGMMV) have a\nparticular impact on cucumber production. Plants\
    \ infected with CMV displayed homoge-\nneously higher temperature in the whole\
    \ inoculated leaf relative to the controls, whereas\nleaves of CGMMV-infected\
    \ cucumber plants showed a heterogeneous temperature pattern,\nconsisting of cold\
    \ spots at the infection sites. However, none of those changes was de-\ntectable\
    \ presymptomatically. Nevertheless, classiﬁcatory algorithms could early detect\
    \ the\ninfection caused by each pathogen when combining data obtained by TIR,\
    \ ﬂuorescence and\nhyperspectral imaging [94]. Another virus of agricultural interest\
    \ is the Sweet potato feathery\nmottle virus, which is the most widespread virus\
    \ that infects sweet potato plants, causing\ndevastating problems when co-infecting\
    \ with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus. Higher leaf\ntemperatures were associated\
    \ with more severe symptoms; thus, plants co-infected with\nboth viruses displayed\
    \ higher temperatures than single virus-infected plants [95].\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68\n6 of 21\n2.1.2. Bacterial Infections\nIn the case of bacterial-infected\
    \ plants, literature reports temperature changes relative\nto the controls ranging\
    \ between −3.3 K and +3 K. The tumor caused by Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens in the\
    \ hypocotyl of castor oil plant produces irreversible disruption of the plant\n\
    epidermis and hence, the tumor lacks a protective cuticle against water loss.\
    \ Moreover,\nstomata located at the tumor edge are hypertrophied and non-functional;\
    \ as a consequence,\nthe tumor surface was the coldest part of the plant [96].\
    \ Some works have studied the\nrole of plant defense elicitors produced by bacterial\
    \ pathogens. That is the case of the\nproteinaceous harpin synthesized by the\
    \ bacterium Erwinia amylovora. When inﬁltrated\nin the leaves of Nicotiana sylvestris\
    \ wild plants, harpin induced a marked presymptomatic\ncooling at the inoculation\
    \ sites, followed by an increase of temperature during the HR [97].\nThe same\
    \ trend was described for spots of bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae\n\
    pv. actinidiae on kiwifruit leaves [98]. The decrease in temperature localized\
    \ at the infection\nsites could be related to bacterial virulence factors that\
    \ actively open the stomata by\ninterfering with hormonal signaling pathways leading\
    \ to stomatal closure [99]. On the\nother hand, it is well known that recognition\
    \ of some pathogen-associated molecular\npatterns triggers stomatal closure to\
    \ impede bacterial entrance through these natural\napertures [68]. In bean plants,\
    \ P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 induces an HR, whereas\nP. syringae pv. phaseolicola\
    \ 1448A produces systemic infection. First symptoms are evident\nafter 10 h and\
    \ 2 days post-infection, respectively. Thermography could presymptomatically\n\
    reveal those bacterial challenges as an increase of temperature of the inoculated\
    \ areas at 1\nand 2 h post-infection in the case of HR and systemic infection,\
    \ respectively [100].\nSeveral works have addressed the effect of the Dickeya\
    \ dadantii infection on plant tran-\nspiration by thermography. This bacterium\
    \ usually produces soft-rot, a characteristic tissue\nmaceration, as in the case\
    \ of N. benthamiana infected at high inoculum dose. After mechani-\ncal inﬁltration,\
    \ the temperature of the affected areas raised presymptomatically, linked to\n\
    an increase in hormones controlling stomatal closure. In subsequent days, the\
    \ temperature\ncontinued rising, affecting the whole leaf. However, N. benthamiana\
    \ can activate an efﬁcient\ndefense response against D. dadantii when the plant\
    \ is inoculated at doses resembling the\nnatural infection. In this case, after\
    \ an initial increase in temperature of the inﬁltrated\narea, infected plants\
    \ could recover, and temperature subsequently decreased [101]. Inde-\npendently\
    \ of the inoculum dose, D. dadantii does not cause tissue maceration on melon\n\
    leaves. It produces brownish spots at the inoculation sites that evolve chlorosis\
    \ in the\nsurrounding tissues in successive days; those symptoms appeared earlier\
    \ when high dose\nconcentrations were applied. Only inﬁltrated areas shown increased\
    \ temperatures at the\nbeginning of the infection process when inoculated at a\
    \ low dose; the whole leaf ﬁnally\ndisplaying higher temperature respecting to\
    \ the controls. However, when a high inoculum\ndose was applied, the whole melon\
    \ leaf displayed a higher temperature [102]. The whole\nleaf of another cucurbit,\
    \ such as zucchini, displayed higher temperature relative to the\ncontrols when\
    \ inoculated with D. dadantii, whereas visual symptoms (different degrees\nof\
    \ chlorosis proportional to the inoculated dose) were circumscribed to the inﬁltrated\n\
    spots [103,104]. Features extracted from TIR and multicolor ﬂuorescence images\
    \ were used\nto feed algorithms, which provided a good performance of classiﬁcation\
    \ of plants into\ncategories of infected and controls in both melon and zucchini\
    \ plants [102–104].\n2.1.3. Interactions with Pathogenic Fungi and Oomycetes\n\
    Thermography has been widely used to assess the effect of fungi and oomycetes\
    \ on\nhost plant transpiration. Depending on how these pathogens interact with\
    \ host plants,\ninitial phases of pathogenesis can induce increases or decreases\
    \ in leaf temperatures\naffecting only the inoculation sites or wholes leaves.\
    \ Subsequent symptoms development\nmay cause transitory drops in temperature as\
    \ the affected cells die and lose water. Later\ninfection phases usually lead\
    \ to an increase in temperature due to the lack of natural\ncooling of the necrotic\
    \ tissues. Concerning healthy areas, it is possible to ﬁnd in the cited\nliterature\
    \ that biotrophic fungi and oomycetes can cause temperature decreases ranging\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n7 of 21\nfrom −0.1 to −2.5 K, whereas increases have\
    \ been registered from +0.6 to +2 K. For their\npart, hemibiotrophic pathogens\
    \ can decrease leaf temperature between −0.6 and −2.2 K, or\ncontrary, increase\
    \ it in +0.4 to +7.5 K. Finally, it is possible to register temperatures decreases\n\
    between −2 and −5 K and increases ranging from +0.3 to +9 K when necrotrophic\
    \ fungi\nare studied by TIR imaging.\nConcerning infections caused by biotrophic\
    \ fungi leaves from wheat plants infected\nwith Blumeria graminis or Puccinia\
    \ striiformis (fungi causing powdery mildew and stripe\nrust, respectively) displayed\
    \ low temperatures due to the very low resistance to water\nevaporation of growing\
    \ mycelia [105,106]. The phytopathogens Pseudoperonospora cubensis\nand Podosphaera\
    \ xanthii are the causal agents of cucumber downy mildew and cucurbits\npowdery\
    \ mildew, respectively. In cucumber leaves, these pathogens produce infective\n\
    spots with lower temperatures than the surrounding healthy areas due to an abnormal\n\
    stomatal opening. In the case of P. xanthii infection, the thermographic detection\
    \ was\nnot presymptomatic, whereas disease caused by P. cubensis could be revealed\
    \ one day\nbefore the appearance of symptoms. Under laboratory conditions, the\
    \ MTD increased\nduring both pathogenesis and was related to disease severity\
    \ [19,94,107,108]. Despite\nbeing a biotrophic oomycete, P. cubensis also produces\
    \ necrosis in the latest infection phase\nassociated with an increase in cucumber\
    \ leaf temperature [19,108]. Leaves of rose infected\nwith the fungus Podosphaera\
    \ pannosa var. rosae (causal agent of powdery mildew in roses)\nshowed a presymptomatic\
    \ decrease in temperature. Furthermore, two algorithms were\ntrained on features\
    \ extracted from TIR images, obtaining high accuracy in classifying\nhealthy and\
    \ infected plants [109]. Raza et al. [110] also used information extracted from\
    \ TIR\nand RGB pictures to automatically detect tomato plants infected with Oidium\
    \ neolycopersici\nin a presymptomatic way, but the work did not address the physiological\
    \ changes caused\nby the fungus.\nRegarding hemibiotrophic fungi, TIR imaging\
    \ could describe the severity of the\ninfection, which could be related to the\
    \ disease stages but also to the host plant resistance\nto the pathogen. Thus,\
    \ Oerke et al. [111] and Belin et al. [112] analyzed apple trees\nsuffering from\
    \ apple scab. In that case, the detection of infection, as well as differences\n\
    in the virulence of several Venturia inaequalis isolates infecting apple trees,\
    \ were detected\nmore accurately by thermography than by chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\
    \ imaging. The thermal\nresponse was presymptomatic and consisted of spots of\
    \ decreased temperature due to\nthe subcuticular growth of V. inaequalis. A soilborne\
    \ fungus, Rhizoctonia solani, induces\nnecrosis in lettuce plants, which could\
    \ be visualized as an increase in leaf temperature\nand MTD [113]. The damage\
    \ produced by another soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum,\nto whole cucumber\
    \ leaves could be detected as a presymptomatic raise in temperature\ninduced by\
    \ abscisic acid, followed by a slight decrease as wilt symptoms developed. Finally,\n\
    the temperature of whole leaves presenting necrosis increased again [114]. On\
    \ the contrary,\npea plants infected with this fungus showed an early and slight\
    \ reduction of temperature\ncompared to the control plants. At an advanced stage\
    \ of the infection, the leaf temperature\nincreased above control levels in the\
    \ case of susceptible plants, whereas the temperature of\nthose showing F. oxysporum-resistance\
    \ remained similar to the controls [115].\nIn the case of infections caused by\
    \ necrotrophic fungi, sugar beet plants inoculated\nwith Cercospora beticola (causal\
    \ agent of Cercospora leaf spot) displayed spots of presymp-\ntomatic low temperature\
    \ corresponding to the infection sites. Cold spots appeared pro-\ngressively until\
    \ covering the whole leaf surface, whereas lesions were hardly visible by\nthe\
    \ naked eye. Toxins inﬂuencing cell membrane permeability and produced by C. beticola\n\
    could account for this temperature decrease [92]. Aspergillus carbonarius is a\
    \ fungus causing\nsour rot of grape berries and produces ochratoxin-As, toxic\
    \ for humans. Mycelium growth\nareas showed low temperatures that identiﬁed affected\
    \ fruit sites at the very early-stages of\nA. carbonarius infection [25]. Thermography\
    \ also revealed that Alternaria alternata, A. bras-\nsicae and A. brassicicola\
    \ caused a decrease of temperature during the ﬁrst seven days of\ninfection on\
    \ oilseed rape leaves, followed by a temperature increase in successive days.\n\
    However, those plants inoculated with A. dauci only developed increases of mean\
    \ tem-\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n8 of 21\nperature at 21 days after inoculation\
    \ [116]. The infection with Botrytis cinerea (gray mold)\non bean plants caused\
    \ a presymptomatic increase of temperature at the infection sites. In\nsubsequent\
    \ days, leaves developed hot brownish necrotic lesions surrounded by a lower\n\
    temperature area [117]. Contrary, B. cinerea–infected roses ﬁrst showed a decrease\
    \ of tem-\nperature at regions where lesions were initially formed, followed by\
    \ a rise in temperature\nonce necrosis occurred [109]. Rosellinia necatrix (soilborne\
    \ fungus causing white root rot) is\none of the most important constraints to\
    \ production for a wide range of woody crops such\nas avocado. In the late phases\
    \ of R. necatrix infection, trees undergo a water deﬁcit in the\naerial part due\
    \ to failure of the root system [118]. As a result, infected plants experienced\
    \ a\nsigniﬁcant increase in leaf temperature from the early symptomatic stage\
    \ onwards [119].\nFurthermore, infected avocado trees in an orchard could be detected\
    \ by thermography (see\nSection 2.2) [120].\n2.1.4. Herbivory and Parasitic Plants\n\
    Herbivore insects disrupt the integrity of leaves, leading to uncontrolled water\
    \ loss\nfrom wounds and triggering intricate processes that affect gas exchange\
    \ also in the re-\nmaining leaf tissue. Thus, it is possible to ﬁnd temperature\
    \ drops from −0.3 to −3 K\nin the literature. TIR images of soybean leaﬂets affected\
    \ by corn earworm caterpillars\n(Helicoverpa zea) showed that leaf areas adjacent\
    \ to wounds were cooler than distant regions\nor sister leaﬂets [121]. The same\
    \ leaf temperature pattern was visible after injuries caused\nby cabbage looper\
    \ (Trichoplusia ni) instars on Arabidopsis [122], tobacco hornworm (Man-\nduca\
    \ sexta) on Nicotiana attenuata [123], or larval gypsy moth (Lymantria dyspar)\
    \ and gall\ndamage produced by midge ﬂies (Harmandia sp.) on aspen leaves [124].\
    \ When elevated\nCO2 was applied to the atmosphere, the cooling effect of gall\
    \ formation on remaining leaf\ntissue was reduced [124].\nThermography was also\
    \ useful in the detection of plants infested by parasites, reveal-\ning temperature\
    \ increases (from +0.4 to +0.9 K) due to a reduction in the plant water uptake\n\
    by affected roots. Examples of these interactions are the nematode Heterodera\
    \ schachtii\nwith susceptible sugar beet cultivars [125], as well as the obligatory\
    \ root parasitic plant\nOrobanche cumana (broomrape) and sunﬂower [126]. The early\
    \ detection of broomrape\nby nondestructive techniques was unprecedented since\
    \ natural infestation causes subtle\nalterations on host physiology and proceeds\
    \ unnoticed until the emergence of the ﬂoral\nshoots, by the time of sunﬂower\
    \ bloom.\n2.2. Remote Sensing on Crop Fields\nIn crop ﬁelds, thermography has\
    \ facilitated the detailed analysis of crop ﬁelds affected\nby pathogens, helping\
    \ in the localization of areas where plants are infected and requiring\nurgent\
    \ intervention [127]. In general, pathogen-infected plants show changes in their\n\
    temperature of -2 K to +3.1 K, relative to the temperature of healthy plants;\
    \ however, it is\nworth noticing that these values should be handled with care\
    \ depending on the sensitivity\nand the accuracy of the used TIR cameras. The\
    \ identiﬁcation of potentially infected plants\nusing classiﬁers provides accuracies\
    \ ranging between 59 and 89%, depending on the\napplied algorithm and parameters\
    \ used to feed it.\nIn sugar beet, canopy temperature correlated signiﬁcantly\
    \ with the density of the\nnematode parasite H. schachtii in the case of a susceptible\
    \ cultivar, whereas no correlation\ncould be found for the resistant one [128].\
    \ P. syringae pv. actinidiae infection in kiwifruit\norchards was assessed by\
    \ TIR maps based on canopy temperature. Images revealed\nthat infected trees were\
    \ signiﬁcantly warmer than the healthy ones, being localized in\nthe outer canes\
    \ of the canopy [98]. Temperature increases measured on pines infected\nwith Dothistroma\
    \ septosporum (causal agent of red band needle blight) and on winter wheat\ninfected\
    \ with Zymoseptoria tritici (causing septoria leaf blotch) could be positively\
    \ correlated\nto the damages caused by these hemibiotrophic fungi [90,129]. Necrotic\
    \ spots on leaves\nfrom three woody trees (oriental cherry, Japanese cornel and\
    \ sawtooth oak) caused by three\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n9 of 21\nfungi (Mycosphaerella\
    \ cerasella, Elsinoe corni and Tubakia dryina, respectively) can also be\ndetected\
    \ as dots with higher temperatures relative to healthy areas [130].\nThe fusion\
    \ of thermography with other imaging techniques such as multi- or hyper-\nspectral\
    \ reﬂectance or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging cameras is very often an adequate\n\
    approach for stress detection. The combination with chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging\
    \ al-\nlowed monitoring several constraints (fungal infection, galls and chewing\
    \ damages caused\nby arthropods) in understory hardwood saplings. Thus, changes\
    \ in transpiration could be\nrelated to photosynthesis impairment in affected\
    \ trees [131]. However, the combination\nof TIR imaging with multi- or hyper-spectroscopy\
    \ reﬂectance is more feasible since both\ntechniques are based on passive measurements.\
    \ Moreover, it is possible to obtain multi-\nple reﬂectance VIs that could correlate\
    \ with physiological parameters. Furthermore, VIs,\ntogether with temperature\
    \ derived parameters, could be implemented on algorithms to\nclassify plants into\
    \ categories of interest in the earliest stages of infection. That was the\ncase\
    \ of important bacterial diseases causing a high impact on both agriculture and\
    \ the envi-\nronment, such as citrus greening or Huanglongbing in citrus trees\
    \ [132], or Xylella fastidiosa,\na quarantine pathogen in olive orchards [133].\n\
    In the case of diseases caused by foliar fungal pathogens, the joint use of thermography\n\
    and reﬂectance made it possible to discriminate between severity levels. That\
    \ was the\ncase of red leaf blotch (caused by Polystigma amygdalinum) in almond\
    \ trees [134] and also\nearly and late leaf spot diseases (caused by Passalora\
    \ arachidicola S. Hori and Cercosporidium\npersonatum, respectively) on peanut\
    \ trees [135]. Minimum temperature corrected by air\ntemperature showed a negative\
    \ correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI) in opium\
    \ poppy orchards infected by the oomycete Peronospora arborescens (causal\nagent\
    \ of downy mildew) [136]. Furthermore, a strong relationship between yield, several\n\
    VIs and canopy temperature was observed in maize plants suffering tar spot complex\n\
    (caused by Phyllachora maydis and Monographella maydis) [137], as well as in chickpea\n\
    infected with Ascochyta rabiei (causing Ascochyta blight disease) [138].\n∆T correlated\
    \ with disease severity caused by soilborne fungal pathogens, such as\nVerticillium\
    \ dahliae (causal agent of Verticillium wilt) in olive trees or R. necatrix in\
    \ avocado\ntrees. Moreover, classifying algorithms applied to the data obtained\
    \ by spectral and TIR\nimaging could identify affected trees with high accuracy\
    \ [120,139,140].\n3. Assessing of Plant Abiotic Stress by Thermography\nIn natural\
    \ environments, abiotic stress conditions often concur with biotic stresses,\n\
    making their evaluation difﬁcult. For this reason, it is important to understand\
    \ how abiotic\nconditions can affect vegetation. The successive sections will\
    \ review how thermography\nhas been applied to monitor crop water stress, salinity,\
    \ nutrient availability, and application\nof herbicides, among others, at proximal\
    \ and remote scales.\n3.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    Drought, which importance emerges from the damage caused and its extent, is con-\n\
    sequently one of the main abiotic stresses monitored by TIR imaging to help farmers\
    \ to\nestablish precise water management and scheduling [141]. Most of the studies\
    \ related to\ndrought stress have been conducted in crop ﬁelds, but it is possible\
    \ to ﬁnd some works\ncarried out on plants grown under controlled conditions (Table\
    \ 2). Furthermore, salinity\nis essentially water stress that results from the\
    \ osmotic effect of ions in the soil solution,\nreducing the water availability\
    \ for plants. In addition, ions can accumulate in plant leaves\nup to toxic concentrations\
    \ [142]. Thus, TIR imaging provides an opportunity to screen\nfor salinity tolerance\
    \ traits in a reliable, quantitative and efﬁcient manner. The effects of\ndifferent\
    \ abiotic stress factors on leaf temperature at proximal sensing are summarized\
    \ in\nTable 3. The increase in temperature registered in these works for infected\
    \ plants ranges\nfrom +1.5 to +6 K.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n10 of 21\nTable\

    \ +0.7 to +7 K between healthy and stressed\nplants have been reported in the\
    \ literature at a remote sensing scale. These alterations in\ncanopy temperature\
    \ allowed stress detection with accuracies up to 75% using classiﬁcatory\nalgorithms\
    \ based on TIR stress indices.\nVineyards under different water regimes are proposed\
    \ as an exemplary study model\nthanks to the geometry of orchards. Moreover, climate\
    \ change threatens the most important\nwine-producer countries worldwide, which\
    \ will suffer increased frequency and severity\nof drought periods. On the contrary,\
    \ ﬁne-tuning irrigation management during the grow-\ning season leads to a slight-to-moderate\
    \ water deﬁcit, which stimulates optimal grape\nquality without signiﬁcantly compromising\
    \ yield [47]. Many authors have monitored\nphysiological parameters related to\
    \ water balance by handheld devices and correlated\nthem with stress indices extracted\
    \ from TIR images (Table 2). They found that TIR imaging\ncan distinguish between\
    \ irrigated and non-irrigated canopies and even between different\ndeﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments. However, the relationship between TIR stress indices and\nphysiological\
    \ parameters was found to be stable throughout the season in some cases [47]\n\
    or, on the contrary, affected by the phenological stage or the varieties [49,158].\
    \ All these\nworks have used TIR ground-based cameras positioned (lateral or nadir)\
    \ or implemented\non UAVs. However, it is also possible to use TIR images from\
    \ Landsat-5 for irrigation\nmanagement purposes [159].\nAs the water demand for\
    \ agriculture is steadily increasing, exploring indices obtained\nby thermography\
    \ to evaluate drought stress in other crops different from vineyards also\nhas\
    \ been extensively addressed (Table 2). The efﬁciency of the VI named photochemical\n\
    reﬂectance index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress was evaluated by TIR imaging\
    \ in\nolive and peach orchards under different water regimes. It was found that\
    \ PRI showed a\nhigher correlation with ∆T and gs than other vegetation indices\
    \ [30,160]. Regarding the\nmonitoring of water regimes in crops using satellite\
    \ images, thermal images taken with\nASTER could distinguish between rain-fed\
    \ and artiﬁcially irrigated olive tree orchards [161].\nBased on these works,\
    \ it can be concluded that thermal information remotely obtained by\nTIR cameras,\
    \ alone or in combination with other imaging techniques, is robust enough to\n\
    estimate the water status of crops and to help farmers to establish an appropriate\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling for plantations. However, this conclusion should be taken\
    \ with caution since\nthere are exceptions to the rule. As an example, canopy\
    \ temperature in maize ﬁelds under\ndrought stress only partially reﬂected gas\
    \ exchange rates and grain yield, presumably as a\nconsequence of other alterations\
    \ caused by this stress factor in plants, such as impairments\nin photosynthesis\
    \ and partitioning rates or alterations in plant leaves and canopy structures\n\
    (leading to ﬂuctuations in energy absorption and/or dissipation) [162]. Moreover,\
    \ the use\nof TIR imaging to ﬁgure out biologically relevant traits constitutes\
    \ a challenge under\nﬂuctuating conditions, as recently reviewed by Vialet-Chabrand\
    \ and Lawson [75].\nIn addition to physiological variables related to the water\
    \ status of plants, production\nparameters such as grain yield could be evaluated\
    \ by thermography in cereals. That was\nthe case of spring barley [163], maize\
    \ [162] and wheat [61,164,165], where grain yield under\ndifferent water regimes\
    \ showed good correlations with TIR stress indices. CWSI is a good\npredictor\
    \ of garlic bulb biomass under different water availability levels [166]. Another\n\
    production parameter, the average fruit weight of mandarins “clementina de Nules”\
    \ at\nharvest, could also be correlated signiﬁcantly with canopy temperature when\
    \ different\nirrigation regimes were tested [32].\nRegarding the nutrient availability\
    \ in soils, wheat crops growing under higher nitrogen\nsupplies exhibited lower\
    \ canopy temperature (and thus, lower CWSI) than those that were\nnot treated\
    \ [167]. Kefauver et al. [168] compared different nitrogen treatments in three\n\
    barley varieties and elaborated a detailed correlation network of physiological\
    \ traits, TIR\nand other imaging data. Another common stress in crop ﬁelds is\
    \ low temperatures. TIR\nimaging has been applied to study frost resistance in\
    \ apple orchards. When the soil was\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n12 of 21\ndefrosted,\
    \ the whole tree froze starting from peripheral twigs, whereas when the soil was\n\
    frosted, the tree started to freeze from the trunk at the tree base [169].\n4.\
    \ Future Perspectives\nFor more sustainable agriculture, the development of tools\
    \ providing real-time in-\nformation on the health status of plants is highly\
    \ demanded, as well as on their physical\nand physiological interactions with\
    \ their micro- and macro-environment, from soil to\natmosphere. In this sense,\
    \ the progressive implementation of high-throughput analysis\nbased on imaging\
    \ sensors and big data have represented an outstanding innovation [72].\nAutomation\
    \ allows rapid evaluations of plants and crops, avoiding subjectivity associ-\n\
    ated with visual assessments, reducing the cost of labor and permitting more frequent\n\
    assessments on the same plants over time [21]. Indeed, thermography implemented\
    \ in\nhigh-throughput facilities is contributing to the development of next-generation\
    \ crops by\ncrop breeders. However, before thermal sensing is adopted as a routine\
    \ tool in agriculture\nand integrated into decision-making for a wide range of\
    \ users, further research is necessary\nto address current challenges of the technology\
    \ and interpretation of thermal data [13,76].\n4.1. Future Technical Development\
    \ of Thermography\nTIR cameras suffer from challenges common to sensors for image\
    \ acquisition. At the\nproximal sensor scale, the volume of plants that can be\
    \ monitored at the same time is a\nlimitation. On the other hand, standardized\
    \ environments of measurements at a short\ndistance from the target may complicate\
    \ the scale up to the ﬁeld. Indeed, at a remote\nsensing scale, atmospheric conditions\
    \ are challenging. Wind makes the crops move around\nor may destabilize UAVs affecting\
    \ the quality of images. Rain, fog, and other atmospheric\nfactors could delay\
    \ scheduled measurements. Even more, satellites could not cover the\nentire desired\
    \ area or do it when atmospheric conditions are inadequate, reducing their\ntime\
    \ resolution or even limiting the measurements during long periods in the rainy\
    \ seasons.\nOperational conditions of TIR cameras must be observed, whereas technical\
    \ features,\nsuch as sensitivity and accuracy, should be taken into consideration\
    \ when handling thermal\ndata to avoid misinterpretation of the results. Thermography\
    \ also needs corrections\nto the accuracy of leaf or canopy measurements via the\
    \ development of more accurate\ncomplementary measurements of atmospheric conditions\
    \ disturbing the temperature of\nthe vegetation. That would include wind speed\
    \ and reﬂection of solar radiation on canopy\nsurfaces, dependent on the intensity\
    \ and quality of light affected by weather conditions\non day ﬂights, as reviewed\
    \ in [15,80]. Particular attention must be paid to the spatial\nand temporal variations\
    \ in these factors during the actual measurement. Even though\nthe last generation\
    \ of thermal cameras can make corrections for relative humidity and\ntemperature\
    \ of the air, these atmospheric parameters should be taken into account for other\n\
    TIR sensors. These complementary measurements are needed to improve the quality\
    \ of\nthe thermal data and to help in interpreting thermal information [15]. The\
    \ use of current\nUAVs minimizes the time-of-measurement effects [76]. On the\
    \ other hand, ﬂight altitude\naffects the measurements due to thermal infrared\
    \ radiation attenuation by the atmosphere,\nrequiring some corrections [65]. Focal\
    \ length, related to the ﬂying altitude, is another\ntechnical feature to take\
    \ into consideration in airborne thermography [170]. Nonetheless,\nnanosatellites\
    \ and new generation satellites with increasingly higher time and spatial\nresolution\
    \ could be the future of remote sensing applied to agriculture [84].\nPublic datasets\
    \ are progressively gaining relevance in plant phenotyping, as in many\nother\
    \ research ﬁelds since they offer great opportunities for networking and collaboration.\n\
    However, comparing data with other researchers is limited by technical features.\
    \ A possible\nsolution for this issue would be the development of a system of\
    \ standardization (similar to\nthose issued by the International Commission on\
    \ Illumination, CIE) that could be adopted\nby the international community.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n13 of 21\n4.2. Strategies to Overcome the Intrinsic\
    \ Non-Speciﬁcity of Thermal Patterns\nThermography is a sensitive tool for plant\
    \ stress detection. However, alterations in leaf\nor canopy temperature are intrinsically\
    \ unspeciﬁc for the stressor. Indeed, on crop ﬁelds\nunder natural conditions,\
    \ plant diseases are often found concurrent with abiotic stresses.\nConsequently,\
    \ in terms of diagnosis, thermography must be used in combination with other\n\
    phenomics techniques with the aim of ﬁnding distinctive patterns that better explain\
    \ the\netiology of the disorder, thus helping to cut down potential causes of\
    \ disease. Appropriate\nmanagement and control of abiotic stress factors considering\
    \ the heterogeneities of the\nfarmed land appear mandatory to avoid misinterpretations\
    \ of the thermal imagery. For\nexample, in orchards, water management can be improved\
    \ by precise measurements of\nsoil humidity by thermography, as reviewed by [171].\
    \ Thus, an accurate diagnosis and\nquantiﬁcation of the extent and severity of\
    \ disease-related symptoms can only be achieved\nbased on a collection of inputs\
    \ such as the geological features and history of the farmed\nland or weather conditions\
    \ at the time of image collection.\nDeep learning is key in the process of turning\
    \ data into knowledge, particularly when\nthermography is integrated with other\
    \ imaging techniques in a multidimensional analysis,\nas recently reviewed by\
    \ [72]. Public accessibility and interoperability of datasets, from\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping platforms and satellites, promoted by cooperative initiatives\n\
    such as those funded by the International Plant Phenotyping Network (https://www.plant-\n\
    phenotyping.org), are contributing to develop the potential of plant phenotyping\
    \ [172].\n4.3. Uses of Plant Thermography for Agriculture in the Near Future\n\
    In recent years, huge investments have been made in plant phenotyping facilities\
    \ to\nsupport basic and applied research. Further work is needed to widen our\
    \ knowledge on\nplant physiology upon stress as well as developing improved stress\
    \ detection methods.\nFuture research should also address the development of more\
    \ general stress detection\nmethods, valid for a range of plant species and growth\
    \ conditions, including location,\nor even independent from those factors. The\
    \ contribution of thermography to precision\nagriculture should not be limited\
    \ to the detection of stress.\nThermography also appears as a very convenient\
    \ tool to study other aspects of plants\nthat are out of the scope of this review,\
    \ such as seeds vigor [173], investigations on circadian\nrhythms [174,175], the\
    \ effects of microgravity on plant physiology [176], interactions with\nplant-symbiotic\
    \ microorganisms [177–180], the impact of climate change in ecology [15],\nor\
    \ food industry [181]. Thermography is also a very relevant tool for screening\
    \ for mu-\ntants [182,183] and cultivars [21] with desirable phenotypes such as\
    \ pathogen resistance\nor improved performance upon certain abiotic stress conditions.\
    \ In summary, thermog-\nraphy implemented in high-throughput facilities is contributing\
    \ to the development of\nnext-generation crops by crop breeders.\n5. Concluding\
    \ Remarks\nThe huge collection of works applying thermography to plants and crops\
    \ shows that\nthis technique is overcoming inherent constraints, being able to\
    \ determine plant water\nstatus and to detect plant stress in a robust, reliable,\
    \ low-cost way. On one hand, TIR stress\nindices are often more reliable than\
    \ actual temperature values as they counteract the effects\nof ambient conditions\
    \ on the measurement, providing good correlations with physiological\nparameters\
    \ related to the plant water status. On the other hand, the combined use of\n\
    thermography with other imaging sensors and the application of big data tools\
    \ are an\nadvantageous approach that allows identifying stressed plants and even\
    \ evaluating the\nseverity of symptoms. In spite of this, more detailed studies\
    \ are needed to build a solid\nbase of knowledge applicable to practitioners.\
    \ Additionally, platforms based on imaging\ntechnologies should be developed to\
    \ cover the needs of a wide range of end-users.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n14\

  title: Thermal Imaging for Plant Stress Detection and Phenotyping
  verbatim_quote1: In particular, leaf temperature is a valuable indicator of the
    physiological status of plants, responding to both biotic and abiotic stressors.
    Often combined with other imaging sensors and data-mining techniques, thermography
    is crucial in the implementation of a more automatized, precise and sustainable
    agriculture.
  verbatim_quote2: Such stresses can cause temporary decreases in leaf temperature.
    That would be the case of some pathogens that can interfere in the regulation
    of stomatal movements to favor their entry to the mesophyll [68]. As a consequence,
    alterations in TIR parameters stand as ambiguous clues for diagnosis.

  analysis: 'The paper titled "Crop reflectance monitoring as a tool for water stress
    detection in greenhouses: A review" is a comprehensive review of the current state
    of research and advancements in the field of crop reflectance monitoring as a
    promising tool for early detection of water stress in greenhouse cultivation systems.
    The authors present an overview of the principles and techniques of reflectance
    measurement, discuss the strengths and limitations of different indices or combinations
    of indices for water stress assessment, and highlight important environmental,
    canopy structure, and crop parameters that influence reflectance measurements
    and should be considered for accurate water stress detection. The review emphasizes
    the need for further research and development to improve the accuracy and reliability
    of reflectance-based water stress detection methods and explores potential future
    directions for this field of study.

    The specific contributions of the paper to the field of real-time, automated irrigation
    management in greenhouse cultivation systems are as follows:

    1. **Assessment of Current Reflectance Monitoring Techniques**: The review provides
    an in-depth analysis of the various types of reflectance sensors and methods used
    for crop reflectance measurements. It discusses the advantages, disadvantages,
    and limitations of each technique, including ground-based remote sensors (spectrometers
    and radiometers), imaging systems (multispectral and hyperspectral), and active
    and passive sensors. This information is valuable for researchers and practitioners
    in the field to select the most appropriate reflectance monitoring technique based
    on their specific research or application needs.

    2. **Comprehensive Review of Reflectance Indices for Water Stress Detection**:
    The paper presents a comprehensive review of reflectance indices that have been
    developed and used for water stress detection in crops. It discusses the theoretical
    basis, mathematical formulations, and performance of various indices, including
    the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI), water index (WI), and others. This review provides valuable insights into
    the strengths and weaknesses of different indices, helping researchers and practitioners
    choose the most suitable index or combination of indices for their water stress
    detection applications.

    3. **Identification of Influencing Factors on Reflectance Measurements**: The
    review emphasizes the importance of considering environmental, canopy structure,
    and crop parameters that can influence reflectance measurements and, consequently,
    affect the accuracy of water stress detection. It discusses the effects of factors
    such as light intensity, leaf angle distribution, leaf area index, plant species,
    and canopy architecture on reflectance measurements. This knowledge is essential
    for researchers and practitioners to design experimental setups and data collection
    protocols that minimize the impact of confounding factors and improve the reliability
    of reflectance-based water stress detection.

    4. **Future Research Directions**: The paper concludes by highlighting potential
    future research directions in the field of crop reflectance monitoring for water
    stress detection. It suggests areas where further research is needed to improve
    the accuracy and reliability of reflectance-based methods, such as the development
    of new reflectance indices, the use of data fusion techniques, and the exploration
    of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for data analysis and
    interpretation. These suggestions provide valuable guidance for researchers seeking
    to advance the field and contribute to the development of robust and practical
    reflectance-based water stress detection systems.

    Overall, the review provides a valuable contribution to the field of real-time,
    automated irrigation management in greenhouse cultivation systems by offering
    a comprehensive and critical analysis of current crop reflectance monitoring techniques
    and their applications for water stress detection. It serves as a valuable resource
    for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders involved in developing and implementing
    precision irrigation strategies to optimize crop production and water use efficiency
    in greenhouse environments.'

    and content Highlights • Challenges detecting water status in greenhouses by remote
    sensing presented. • Sensors available for reflectance sensing and applications
    are discussed. • Effects of environmental, canopy structure and other parameters
    discussed. • Possible solutions to mitigate the effects of those parameters are
    suggested. • Future perspectives for real time monitoring in greenhouses are presented.
    Multisensory platforms for remote sensing measurements offer the possibility to
    monitor in real-time the crop health status without affecting the crop and environmental
    conditions. The concept of the speaking plant approach, and plant response based
    sensing in general, could be valuable providing a better understanding of the
    interactions between the microclimate and the physical conditions of the plants.
    Early detection of plant stress is critical, especially in intensive production
    systems, in order to minimise both acute and chronic loss of productivity. Non-contact
    and non-destructive sensing techniques can continuously monitor plants and enable
    automated sensing and control capabilities. This paper reviews past research and
    recent advances regarding the sensors and approaches used for crop reflectance
    measurements and the indices used for crop water and nutrient status detection.
    The most practical and effective indices are those based on ground reflectance
    sensors data which are evaluated in terms of their efficiency in detecting plant
    water status under greenhouse conditions. Some possible applications of this approach
    are summarised. Although crop reflectance measurements have been widely used under
    open field conditions, there are several factors that limit the application of
    reflectance measurements under greenhouse conditions. The most promising type
    of sensors and indices for early stress detection in greenhouse crops are presented
    and discussed. Future research should focus on real time data analysis and detection
    of plant water stress using advanced data analysis techniques and to the development
    of indices that may not be affected by plant microclimate. Previous article in

    1.1. Background Plant stress is caused by biotic or abiotic factors that adversely
    affect plant growth and significantly reduces productivity. Plant stress is expressed
    in the plant canopy in many types of symptoms. Water stress, for example, closes
    stomata and impedes photosynthesis and transpiration, resulting in changes in
    leaf colour and temperature (Nilsson, 1995, p. 146) but other symptoms of water
    stress include morphological changes such as leaf curling or wilting due to loss
    of cell turgidity. Early detection of plant stress is very critical especially
    in intensive production systems in order to minimise both acute and chronic loss
    of productivity. Plant water stress may be the result of a single parameter or
    a combination of environmental conditions (e.g. air temperature, relative humidity,
    solar radiation intensity, air velocity) root conditions (e.g. available water
    in the root, electrical conductivity in the root zone), the microclimate and plant
    genetic traits. Methods such as substrate water content (for soilless crops) or
    soil water tension, leaf water potential and sap flow, among others, have been
    widely used to help describe plant water status. However, soil or substrate water
    content indicates the availability of water in the root zone and that is not always
    directly correlated with the water status of the plant. In addition, although
    leaf water potential and sap flow measurements provide direct information about
    plant water status, they require plant contact or destructive sampling which is
    difficult to realise in commercial scale. Non-contact and non-destructive sensing
    techniques can continuously monitor plants and enable automated sensing and control
    capabilities (Ling, Giacomelli, & Russell, 1996). The dynamic response of plants
    to the changes of their environment is often called ‘speaking plant’ (Takakura,
    Kozai, Tachibana, & Jordan, 1974). The concept of the speaking plant approach
    and plant response – based sensing is valuable to have a better understanding
    of the interactions between the microclimate and the physical conditions of the
    plants (Kacira, Sasae, Okushima, & Ling, 2005). Thus, in this approach, the physical
    responses of the plants to the environmental changes are monitored and the information
    is utilised to identify conditions which put plants under stress and to avoid
    the occurrence of these conditions or control greenhouse microclimate to achieve
    more efficient and optimal production. Up to now, in most of the greenhouses climate
    control has been based on air temperature and relative humidity measurements carried
    out at a suitable representative single point located at the centre of the greenhouse,
    assuming complete homogeneity of greenhouse microclimate. However, this assumption
    is not valid in most greenhouses and particularly in present greenhouses since
    their size has greatly increased over the recent decades. Climate characterisations
    show that even in well-designed greenhouses large temperature gradients exist,
    for instance in a pad and fan-cooled greenhouse with length longer than 40 m,
    the air temperature gradients from pad to fan distance can be as high as 5 °C
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003). These large temperature gradients not only
    cause non-uniform production and quality, but can also induce pest and diseases
    infestations (Fatnassi, Chaouachi, & Klibi, 2015). That is why some climate control
    systems suggest the installation of sensors in several positions inside the greenhouse
    or to manually perform measurements in different positions to adjust control strategies.
    The greenhouse microclimate (air temperature, humidity and velocity) and crop
    (crop transpiration, stomatal and aerodynamic conductance) physiological response
    vary over different locations in the greenhouse not only due to the variation
    of outside weather conditions but also to the greenhouse climate control systems
    per se, i.e. by the use of heating, insulation, ventilation or cooling systems.
    Thus, direct and real-time monitoring of plant responses and processes along with
    monitoring of the local microclimate parameters can help to improve climate control
    and overall production. For commercial production systems, it is more advantageous
    to develop a real-time plant canopy health, growth and quality monitoring system
    with multi-sensor platforms. This can be achieved by a sensing system equipped
    with a multi-sensor platform moving over the canopy and ultimately using plants
    as ‘sensors’ to communicate their true status and needs. Such systems could be
    used to detect crop deviations from normal development and crop stress. 1.2. Machine
    vision Computer vision is a non-contact and non-destructive sensing technology
    that enables multi-dimensional sensing capabilities (Kacira & Ling, 2001). This
    technology can be used to extract various information from a targeted object including
    morphological (size, shape, texture), spectral (colour, temperature, moisture),
    and temporal data (growth rate, development, dynamic change of spectral and morphological
    states) (Story & Kacira, 2015). Knowing the value-added benefits of the real-time
    plant monitoring systems, researchers have paved the way for the commercialisation
    of robotic machine vision systems to be implemented within greenhouses. To this
    effort, Bonstema (2015) developed the “SWEEPER” (http://www.sweeper-robot.eu)
    greenhouse harvesting robot, in which a side view image of the canopy is taken
    by a colour camera. Priva (De Lier, The Netherlands) (http://www.priva-international.com/)
    developed the Priva TopCrop Monitor that visualises crop activity in the greenhouse
    based on plant temperature measurements and estimations of plant transpiration.
    As noted by Story and Kacira (2015), the HortiMaX (http://www.hortimax.com) CropView
    system allows the grower to capture images of a single location in their plant
    canopy 24 h a day, 7 days a week and time-stamped the images to corresponding
    greenhouse climatic data and events. The grower can only view a handful of plants
    within the image, not the entire plant canopy. Also this system does not extract
    plant or canopy features to quantitatively determine overall plant growth and
    status over time. In other words, if there is a plant-related problem, the trend
    of this issue is not identified until the grower visually identifies the problem
    themselves, and this detection approach may not be timely. The interaction of
    sunlight with crop canopies and plant leaves can be used to obtain valuable information
    about the plant growth and health status. Changes in plant colour, morphology,
    thermal features can be indicative of plant disease or stresses. Therefore, monitoring
    the crop and analysing these features in real time and providing qualitative and
    quantitative information to the growers can help them prevent damage to the crops
    and optimize resource use leading to improved overall production quality. 1.3.
    Basics in plant reflectance Despite the fact that plant leaves often look similar,
    they vary widely in both shape and chemical composition, as far as the concentration
    of water in the leaf intercellular spaces is concerned. This results in continuously
    varied plant reflectance. Plant leaves absorb the majority of radiance in the
    visible band by plant pigments located in mesophyll (Fig. 1a) such as chlorophyll
    and xanthophylls, but reflect mostly in the near-infrared (NIR) band. In addition,
    water content in sponge cavities, carbon content in different forms (sugar, starch,
    cellulose and lignin) in mesophyll cells and nutrient compounds (N, P, K) in mesophyll

    Influence of electromagnetic spectrum based on structure of a typical plant leaf.
    From Summy et al. (2003). (b). Reflectance, absorbance and transmittance spectral
    of a plant leaf. From Jacquemoud and Ustin (2008). Several authors (e.g. Datt,
    1999, Grant et al., 1987, Hodanova, 1985, Jackson and Huete, 1991, Jacquemoud
    and Baret, 1990, Jacquemoud and Ustin, 2008, Kacira et al., 2005, Knipling, 1970,
    Maracci et al., 1991, Verdebout et al., 1994, Vogelmann et al., 1989) have reported
    that the different chemical and physical characteristics affect the leaf optical
    properties (Fig. 1b). When a plant is under water stress, which can be experienced
    when the demand for water exceed the water supply in the root zone or plants capability
    to transport the water from root zone to the atmosphere, the photosynthesis rate
    is decreased due to xanthophyll oxidation. As a result, stomata close and lead
    to decreased CO2 assimilation rate. Therefore, the light energy that is absorbed
    by the leaf, cannot be used to guide photosynthetic electron transport and a part
    of the solar radiation returns back to the atmosphere as reflectance radiation,
    while the other part is dissipated as heat or re-emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence.
    As with water stress, nutrient stress also influences the photosynthetic rate
    and consequently the electromagnetic energy that is absorbed by the leaf due to
    the nutrient''s involvement in the photosynthetic process as a component of photosynthetic
    enzymes (such as ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and chlorophylls.
    Meanwhile, the high leaf absorption percentage of solar radiation in the visible
    range of the spectrum causes a rapid saturation of the reflected signal for a
    very low amount of canopy leaf area. This results in a reflectance light signal
    reduction (Soudani et al., 2012). That is why several reflectance indices, or
    regions in the spectrum that are based on visible light spectrum, are strongly
    dependent on ambient light. The radiation with wavelength longer than 950 nm is
    usually absorbed by the leaf liquid while the radiation at ∼1000 nm is absorbed
    by the leaf dry matter (carbon and nutrient compounds). The reflectance in the
    680–750 nm wavelengths is also influenced by water and nutrient concentration,
    while the reflectance spectrum in 750–800 nm is varied mostly by leaf water content
    concentration. Several researchers (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2014, Jain et al., 2007,
    Kim et al., 2010, Kruse, 2004, p. 69; Peňuelas et al., 1994, Peňuelas et al.,
    1997, Peňuelas et al., 1993, Ray et al., 2006, Sclemmer et al., 2005) showed that
    the reflectance in the green and red bands under water or nutrient stress is increased
    due to leaf Chlorophyll concentration reduction (less absorbance radiation). Other
    studies (Amatya et al., 2012, Jones et al., 2004, Sclemmer et al., 2005, Vigneau
    et al., 2011) reported that the reflectance of stressed plants was increased in
    the near infrared region due to radiation scattering by air content risen in sponge
    cavities (less water content). Peňuelas et al. (1993) observed a significant decrease
    in the magnitude of the whole NIR reflectance of stressed plants only when the
    plant was close to wilting. Apparently, other factors such as leaf thickness,
    leaf age, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI) and plant species can influence the
    leaf spectral response in a greater degree than the water stress during measurement
    (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Effect of leaf area index (left) and mean leaf angle (right) increase
    on canopy reflectance. From Asner (1998). In contrast to NIR region, in the middle
    infrared region (MIR), more absorption and less reflectance and transmittance
    is observed in green leaves due to the fact that water absorbs more radiation
    in that spectrum (Fig. 1b). Thus, this region contains more information about
    sponge parenchyma that includes water, cellulose, nitrogen, lignin and starch.
    The basic absorption areas for leaf water status monitoring are located around
    1450 nm, 1940 nm and 2500 nm and the overall shape of the MIR spectrum is largely
    influenced by water. Nevertheless, Sun et al. (2008) indicated that although the
    1450 nm wavelength is highly sensitive to fast and steep developing stress, it
    cannot be used for low stress cases. In addition, several authors (Bowman et al.,
    1989, Cordon and Lagorio, 2007, Hunt and Rock, 1989, Jacquemoud and Ustin, 2008,
    Verdebout et al., 1994) have already concluded that the use of MIR is insufficient
    to estimate the leaf water status due to the fact that reflectance changes within
    a biologically meaningful range are too insignificant and the light signal at
    that spectrum is too low (high light signal noise). Thus, MIR has not been used
    extensively in plant water stress assessment, as more satisfactory results have
    been reported in the visible and NIR spectrum regions. According to Köksal, Güngör,
    and Yildirim (2010), based on a first derivative analysis, certain parts of the
    spectrum can be selected for further study. Thus, in order to amplify the spectral
    differences detected and to provide additional details for stress detection, several
    authors have proposed combining the data from spectral bands into indices. Therefore,
    more than 150 vegetation indices (VI) have been presented during the last three
    decades (Asner, 1998, Borzuchowski and Schulz, 2010, Silleos et al., 2006). However,
    only a small subset of them have substantial biophysical basis or have been systematically
    tested for water stress. In addition, more than 20 VIs have been based on the
    visible and NIR spectrum. According to Aparicio, Villegas, Royo, Casadesus, and
    Araus (2004) and Zakaluk and Sri Ranjan (2008), the most common forms of reflectance
    indices are the following: - reflectance ratios corresponding to the ratio of
    two spectral bands, which are referred to as simple ratio (SR) vegetation indices
    and - normalised difference (ND) vegetation indices, which are defined as ratios
    of the difference in reflectance between two spectral bands to the sum of the
    reflectance at the same bands. 1.4. Rationale for the current review paper Up
    to now, the majority of reflectance indices have been studied in open field and
    in a lab scale and not in the greenhouse conditions. The object of this paper
    is to provide a review of the most commonly used reflectance indices and spectrum
    areas that can be applied for early plan water and nutrient stress detection in
    green house conditions. The efficiency of the spectral indices in detecting water
    and nutrients stress is benchmarked with plant direct and indirect physiological
    measurements, such as leaf water potential, chlorophyll fluorescence, canopy temperature,
    stomatal conductance, transpiration, substrate water content and others. In addition,
    objective of this manuscript is to briefly describe the most important technical
    specifications of ground-based remote sensors that are used for reflectance measurements.
    The most popular types of spectrometer sensors, such as hyperspectral and multispectral
    remote cameras are presented. Suggestions are made for specific guidelines to
    avoid errors in measurements during data acquisition. 2. Reflectance measurement
    technologies 2.1. Sensors Several sensor systems are available and many ground-based
    remote sensing (RS) technologies have been used to obtain the required information
    (Lan, Zhang, Lacey, Hoffmann, & Wu, 2009). The progress of ground-based reflectance
    measurement techniques plays a critical role in accurate monitoring and assessment
    of plant reflectance. Different techniques for acquiring plant reflectance data
    have been used to determine qualitative and quantitative plant characteristics.
    Initially measurements were conducted in laboratory studies and later on, in satellite
    and airborne remote sensing. The development of non-imaging field spectroscopy
    gave the opportunity for a real-time and cost effective way to undertake large
    scale monitoring in open field and greenhouse covered canopy. Moreover, the improvement
    of non-imaging field spectroscopy to image remote sensing data acquisition lead
    to vast amount of plant reflectance data generation at higher spatial resolution
    (Liaghat & Balasundram, 2010). In this section, a classification of ground based
    (remotely or in contact) sensing techniques are presented. Ground based sensors
    can be classified into three distinct categories: (a) spectrometers and radiometers
    (b) imaging and non-imaging and (c) active and passive. The basic characteristic
    of non-imaging (spot) field spectroscopy is the ability of the sensor to allow
    continuous sensing at a wide range of spectral bands (spectrometers) or at a smaller
    range which is limited to certain spectral bands (radiometers). The key feature
    which distinguishes a spectrometer from a multiband radiometer is the continuous
    measurement of the produced spectrum (Milton, 1987). A non-imaging sensor system
    can easily measure radiance reflectance by pointing the fibre optic input of the
    equipment at the point or at all points of the target, taking measurements of
    highly accurate locations and topographic profiles. The performance of these non-imaging
    sensors depends on an integrated artificial light source in order to collect the
    reflected radiation from the target and thus, these sensors are called ‘active
    sensors’. Milton (1987) first reviewed the principles of field spectroscopy parameters.
    Since then, different ground-based remote sensing techniques have been developed
    and used mostly in the open field. Over the last decade, advances in sensors''
    technology have developed optic systems that made possible the simultaneous recording
    of several bands of different points of the target with a single acquisition.
    Imaging systems allow light to entering the sensor through the slit, impinge on
    the photosensitive area of the detector and give exact spatial and spectral resolution
    whereas each pixel receives light of different areas of the spectrum (Huang &
    Zeng, 2001). Based on different recording spectral bands (channels), the imaging
    reflectance sensors can be distinguished into panchromatic images (1 channel),
    colour images (3 channels), multispectral images (4–20 channels) and hyperspectral
    images (more than 20 channels) (Kozma-Bognár and Berke, 2010, Willoughby et al.,
    1996). The number and position of the bands in each system provide a unique combination
    of spectral information and are tailored to the sensor requirements that are designed
    to support (Fig. 3). Most hyperspectral and multispectral imaging systems work
    in a wavelength range from visible to infrared and usually are passive sensors
    using natural or external light sources. Thus, the imaging sensors require sufficient
    and accurate information from ambient air such as light intensity, direction of
    light and atmospheric effects. Download : Download high-res image (442KB) Download

    system (left), Pushbroom scanner (right). From Li et al. (2013). The most recent
    technological machine vision systems are divided into scanning and framing systems.
    Hyperspectral image sensors usually use the scanning techniques in order to acquire
    the reflectance data from different parts of the target with one image recording.
    Some of such scanning methods are the whisk-broom, paddle-broom and push-broom
    techniques. Push-broom scanners have a linear array of thousands of detector elements
    aligned cross-track, which scan the full width of the collected data in parallel
    as the platform moves (Fig. 3). This scanning method is able to cover the sensing
    at variable angles and it scans point-by-point across the area of interest. In
    framing systems, images of the targets are taken frame by frame. Images can be
    described in terms of scale, which is determined by the effective focal length
    of the optics of the remote sensing device, altitude from which image is acquired
    and the magnification factor employed in the reproduced image. Further technical
    information about optical sensors can be found in Mouroulis, 1999, Aikio, 2001,
    p. 435), Lawrence et al., 2003, Polder et al., 2003, Govender et al., 2007, Govender
    et al., 2009, Schowengerdt, 2007, Vagni, 2007, Chung-Ru, 2008, p. 36), Panda (2012)
    and Li et al. (2013). For commercial production settings, it is more advantageous
    to develop a real-time plant canopy health growth and quality monitoring system
    with multi-sensor platforms (Kim et al., 2010, Story and Kacira, 2015). Based
    on the data found in the manuscripts referred in this work, a presentation (Fig.
    4) and analysis of the sensors used in the relative manuscripts is given below.
    It was found that 11% of the studies followed protocols based on laboratory conditions,
    by sampling detached leaves. These methods are time consuming and detect plant
    stress in leaf and not in plant or canopy level exclusively under stable conditions.
    The development of more light, handy ground based remote sensing methods, evaluates
    the reliability of field reflectance measurement and minimises the accuracy discrepancies
    arising from other methods. Thus, 14% of the researches used ground-based sensors
    in contact with the leaf to measure the plant reflectance variation in the field
    conditions. Despite these methods give real-time results of plant stress level,
    they are not suggested in greenhouse conditions as they cannot integrate in control
    systems or computer models. Also, quite enough measurements should be received
    from different leaves in order to determine stress in plant or canopy level. The
    majority of the studies (75%) applied methods based on remote sensing. However,
    the majority of the remote sensing studies (74%) used sensors that measure reflectance
    by the point or the mean of all the points of a small field of view of the target.
    Only the 26% of the remote sensing studies from 2000 and on, applied imaging spectrometers
    for plant stress detection mostly in open field conditions. The new generation
    of ground-based imaging spectrometers already provides a considerable improvement,
    availability and accurate information on crop conditions and cost-effectiveness
    to a stage where information from RS imagery is being used for large scale irrigation
    policy level decision in open field (Govender et al., 2009). Elsayed (2015) tested
    five spectral both passive and active reflectance sensors, including a hyperspectral
    passive machine vision in order to assess plant water stress. They concluded that
    passive hyperspectral machine vision had the highest correlation with substrate
    water content than other active sensors. However, machine vision is not possible
    to use direct reflectance measurements as a metric of leaf water concentration,
    as each wavelength has its own measurement error and requires good knowledge of
    the sensor''s and ambient conditions such as light intensity, direction of light
    and other. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    2.2. Measurements and data processing in greenhouse applications Although sensor
    technologies have been considerably improved during recent years, crop reflectance
    measurement remains a difficult task. The accuracy of the measurement depends
    on several parameters related to: • the sensor used (e.g. detector dark current,
    sensor temperature, readout noise, exposure shot noise, number of lens aperture,
    calibration variation) (Polder et al., 2003), • the methodology followed during
    the measurement (e.g. the way the instrument was held (hand-held or supported),
    the distance from the target, the effective size and density of target area, the
    frequency of calibration) and view angle (Aparicio et al., 2004, Bastiaanssen
    et al., 2000, Jackson and Huete, 1991), • the environmental conditions (e.g. light
    conditions, proportion of shade in the target) (Polder et al., 2003), dust and
    aerosols in the air. For optimal calibration of the imaging system, a first cycle
    has to be performed in the laboratory, using known or reference light sources.
    Thus, the responsiveness of the system to different spectral bands under different
    radiation intensities can be recorded and analysed in order to choose the appropriate
    camera settings (frame rate and exposure time) and decrease the signal-to-noise
    ratio (radiometric calibration). During this phase, the image noise characteristics
    are determined and the initial gain and offset are adjusted (Amatya et al., 2012,
    Arngren, 2011, Brunn et al., 2010, Hu et al., 2012). Furthermore, the response
    of the instrument is adapted to a polynomial to obtain the instrument response
    function and evaluate the nonlinear characteristics. Katsoulas, Elvanidi, Ferentinos,
    Bartzanas, and Kittas (2014) described a calibration methodology for a hyperspectral
    imaging system used to formulate appropriate reflectance indices for plant water
    stress detection. Under greenhouse conditions, light intensity (and sometimes
    light quality) distribution is inhomogeneous. The illumination that each pixel
    receives depends on the weather conditions, the greenhouse structure, the surrounding
    surfaces (background, ground) and the density and architecture of the canopy.
    In addition, the reflectance in the red region is expected to be low in the morning
    and increase as the sun rises, because of the increasing amount of reflective
    white ground cover. The NIR region, however, is not affected as much as the red
    region, due to the high percentage of light that is transmitted through the canopy
    and reflected from the shaded ground (Aparicio et al., 2004, Eitel et al., 2006,
    Jackson and Huete, 1991). To ensure a constant background and eliminate the effect
    of shade, a spectrally flat black surface could be placed as a background (Kittas
    et al., 2016, Mazzetto et al., 2009), while the use of artificial illumination
    could contribute to stabilise specular reflectance and simulate natural lighting
    (Graeff and Claupein, 2007, Katsoulas et al., 2014, Sun et al., 2008). Yet, the
    above modifications cannot eliminate shades created due to overlapping leaves
    and shades on the crop itself than the background. Nevertheless, due to the fact
    that the camera parameters are not constant, mathematic models could further eliminate
    the errors originating from different noise sources. Kim et al. (2010) mentioned
    that the calibration procedure with dark reference images was performed by covering
    the lens with a dark material, while white reference images were acquired by placing
    a white board in front of the lens under ambient illumination. The dark image
    was taken once for each imaging session and the reference image (white spectralon)
    was taken in different light conditions in order to minimise the influence of
    ambient outdoor natural light variations. Both the reference and normalised images
    must be obtained under the same light conditions inside the greenhouse. Use of
    diffuse/haze greenhouse glazing can also be used as alternative approach to eliminate
    shades on the crop canopy and in the background in the ground surfaces. 3. Reflectance
    indices 3.1. Crop water status assessment An increasing trend in the number of
    articles studying plant reflectance variation and its relationship to plant water
    status in open field or in greenhouse conditions is observed during the last 20
    years (Fig. 5). The number of studies that have been conducted in greenhouses
    is relatively low and most of them have been performed after 2005, mainly due
    to advances in ground remote sensing. Based on this search, it can be seen (Table
    2) that numerous successful case studies related to the reflectance indices, single
    bands or complex combinations for different species in different irrigation treatments,
    have been applied in open field while a few of them have been carried out in greenhouses.
    Crop reflectance characteristics and indices have been studied in correlation
    with several crop, climate or soil data such as plant water content (PWC), stomatal
    conductivity (gs), chlorophyll fluorescence (ChF) and soil water content (SWC)
    in different plants with different ground based remote sensing, combining conventional
    methods, in the field, the greenhouse or the laboratory. Download : Download high-res

    spectroradiometer in laboratory, C:sensors that measure plant reflectance in contact
    with the leaf. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and the normalised difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) are the most commonly used and analysed indices for crop
    water stress assessment (Fig. 5b). Other reflectance indices like the water index
    (WI), the modified normalised difference vegetation index (mNDVI), the red normalised
    difference vegetation index (rNDVI) and the Vogelman red edge index (VOGREI) have
    been used with a range of results. 3.2. Promising RIs for crop water status assessment
    In this section, the studied reflectance indices that presented promising results
    are presented and analysed and their sensitivity on the environmental parameters,
    the canopy structure and the different crops are discussed. 3.2.1. Photochemical
    reflectance index PRI has been used in several studies (e.g. Garbulsky et al.,
    2011, Magney et al., 2016, Mänd et al., 2010, Sarlikioti et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2011) using wavelengths from the spectrum around the green peak. Usually
    PRI is defined as: PRI is related to rapid changes inde-epoxidation of the xanthophylls
    cycle. The xanthophylls cycle can be triggered at differing light intensities
    based on the photosynthetic potential of a plant (Magney et al., 2016, Sun et
    al., 2008, Van Gaalen et al., 2007). Stress factors limit photosynthetic activity
    and lead to an excess of absorbed energy that is dissipated by plants to avoid
    damage linked to increased leaf temperature (Merlier et al., 2015). Also, PRI
    reflects long-term changes in the ratio of carotenoids/chlorophyll (Mänd et al.,
    2010). Thus, it is indirectly affected by water stress conditions due to the effects
    of water stress on the efficiency of photosynthesis (Gammon et al., 1992, Garbulsky
    et al., 2011, Inamullah and Isoda, 2005, Magney et al., 2016, Shimada et al.,
    2012, Suárez et al., 2007, Suárez et al., 2008, Thenot et al., 2002, Tsirogiannis
    et al., 2013, Van Gaalen et al., 2007, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2011). PRI is affected
    by leaf and canopy parameters such as chlorophyll content, dry matter, leaf thickness,
    LAI and leaf angle distribution (Garbulsky et al., 2011, Malenovskŷ et al., 2009,
    Mänd et al., 2010, Sarlikioti et al., 2010, Suárez et al., 2009). According to
    Merlier et al. (2015), PRI values are mainly related to soil moisture content
    when the chlorophyll content is not a limiting factor. Magney et al. (2016), found
    that delta PRI (ΔPRI) derived from a midday or early morning PRI, demonstrated
    less sensitivity than an uncorrected PRI to LAI and leaf chlorophyll content throughout
    the growing season. Gammon et al. (1992) were among the first who presented the
    physiological reflectance index and correlated the depoxidation state of the xanthophylls
    cycle pigments to water stress. Suárez et al. (2009) obtained a high determination
    coefficient between PRI and crown temperature for peach and olive trees demonstrating
    an indirect relationship between PRI and water stress. Van Gaalen et al. (2007)
    observed strong linear correlation between NPQ (non photochemical quenching) and
    PRI in sphagnum moss. Thenot et al. (2002) carried out experiments under greenhouse
    conditions (Photosynthetic Active Radiation-PAR level of 1800 μmol m−2 s−1) and
    found that after withholding the water supply for 5 or 12 days in Chenopodium
    quinoa, a 20% and 52%, respectively, PRI was varied compared to control plants.
    Sarlikioti et al. (2010) noted that a good correlation (R2>60%) between PRI and
    relative water content, CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, operating efficiency
    of PSII (Photosystem II) and NPQ, was established in glasshouse tomato plants,
    only when light intensity was higher than 700 μmol m−2 s−1. In PRI measurements
    with low light signal (Fig. 6), the relationship between the index and the RWCs
    percentage was poor in comparison to photosynthesis or fluorescence parameters
    that showed a high correlation to RWCs percentage. Magney et al. (2016) evaluated
    PRI with other environmental conditions. Their results showed that during the
    growing season, when water was plentiful, and when vapour pressure deficit (VPD)
    and air temperature were low, there is a small response of PRI. In addition, the
    study showed that PRI was sensitive to conditions where high VPD and air temperature
    limited stomatal conductance. Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download

    Tsirogiannis et al. (2013) used an index close to PRI [Water Deficiency Reflectance
    Index 1 WDRI1 = (R560 − R510)/(R560 + R510)] to detect water stress. They found
    no consistent relationship between irrigation treatment and WDRI1 was found, however
    three days after the initiation of deficit irrigation, when irrigation covered
    only 50% of plant evapotranspiration, a gradual variation of WDRI1 was detected
    and a good relationship between WDRI1 and crop water stress index (CWSI) was found
    (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (124KB) Download : Download full-size

    3.2.2. Normalised difference vegetation index NDVI is a widely used index with
    different reflectance combinations (Table 2). Its mathematical formation incorporates
    wavelengths in green and near infrared region. Many researchers report high correlation
    with biomass, chlorophyll, leaf area and yield (e.g. Jones et al., 2004, Jones
    et al., 2007, Köksal, 2011, Liu et al., 2004), while Jones et al. (2004) explain
    that although NDVI(800–640) [ = (R800 − R640)/(R800 + R640)] may be a good indicator
    of nitrogen content and biomass, it provides a medium estimate of plant water
    content. Several researchers (Genc et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2010) showed that
    NDVI(800–680) has good correlation with plant water status. Nevertheless, Amatya
    et al. (2012) showed that NDVI(800–640) in potato has higher correlation with
    soil water content than the NDVI(800–680), while Jones et al. (2004) and Köksal
    (2011) found low correlation of NDVI(800–640) with leaf water content in corn,
    spinach and snap beans or green beans, and high correlation with transpiration
    and yield increase. According to Marino et al. (2014), a reliable correlation
    was found between canopy NDVI and leaf gs. Shimada et al. (2012) showed strong
    correlation between NDVI(490–620) and leaf water potential. Kittas et al. (2016)
    explained that NDVI(800–680) had better correlation with soil moisture content
    than NDVI(490–620) in greenhouse tomato, while Katsoulas et al. (2014) supported
    that NDVI at 800 and 680 nm was invariable with environmental conditions variation
    and especially with light intensity. Usually, NDVI is not significantly related
    to variations in environmental conditions such as VPD and air temperature but
    it is weakly correlated to stomatal conductance and strong correlated to LAI (Aguilar
    et al., 2012, Magney et al., 2016). 3.2.3. Red normalised difference vegetation
    index, rNDVI(705–750) The rNDVI(705–750) is based on spectral parts suitable for
    potential water content and soil moisture estimation (Liu et al., 2004). This
    theory was confirmed by Kim et al. (2010) and Amatya et al. (2012), as they found
    high correlation between rNDVI and water stress in apple and potatoes, respectively.
    NDVI in the red region gives stable measurements in different species and it can
    be saturated less by dense vegetation conditions in comparison with other NDVI
    formations (Asner, 1998). 3.2.4. Water index Water index (WI = R970/R900) reflects
    water absorption in the mesophyll and increases as relative water content decreases.
    WI has high variability due to the fact that leaf structure plays a crucial role
    on radiation absorption at 900 and 970 nm. Peňuelas and Inoue (1999) explained
    that WI decreased directly after water stress initiation in monocotyledonous plants
    (wheat), while in case of dicotyledonous plants (peanut) with double leaf water
    concentration due to leaf structure capacity, WI started to decrease when leaf
    water concentration reached 60%. Several authors (Amatya et al., 2012, Genc et
    al., 2011, Jones et al., 2004, Kittas et al., 2016), demonstrated that the spectral
    relative changes observed between 950 and 970 nm are correlated with the relative
    water content (RWC), provided that RWC, stomatal conductivity and leaf water potential
    values are lower than 85%, 0.075 mmol m−2 s−1 and −1.5 MPa, respectively (Peňuelas
    et al., 1993). It is noteworthy however, that WI values responded positively as
    gs and water potential increased in olive trees, with better correlation coefficient
    than other reflectance indices (such as PRI and NDVI) (Marino et al., 2014). Meanwhile,
    Bandyopadhyay et al. (2014) and Elsayed (2015) used normalised water index NWI

    spring wheat genotypes for grain yield under well irrigated and water deficit
    conditions. For this study it was concluded that NWI values were significantly
    negatively correlated with the grain yield due to water or nutrient stress. 3.2.5.
    Other indices The modified red (mr) edge index is categorised into the mrNDVI
    [modified red NDVI = (R750 − R705)/(R750 + R705-2*R445)] and mrSR [modified red
    Simple Ratio Index = (R750 − R445)/(R705 − R445)]. Figure 8 shows a correlation
    of mrSR and mrNDVI with soil water content in a potato crop under four water treatment
    levels (10%, 15%, 20% and 25% soil water content). Similar results were found
    by Kittas et al. (2016) for a tomato crop in greenhouse. Merlier et al. (2015)
    supported that mrNDVI correlated directly with leaf chlorophyll content, values
    that corresponded with drought and high temperature evolution. Generally, mrNDVI
    and mrSRI are recently developed indices and further research in different conditions
    is necessary. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    (a) with mrSRI and (b) mrNDVI in potatoes. From Amatya et al. (2012). The Vogelmann
    red edge index was originally used to correlate the reflectance radiation at 720
    and 740 nm with total chlorophyll content at leaf level (Vogelmann, Rock, & Moss,
    1993). Kim et al., 2010, Amatya et al., 2012 and Kittas et al. (2016) found a
    good correlation of VOGREI (Table 1) with soil moisture content under greenhouse
    conditions. The index seems to be less influenced by differences in background
    conditions and light contamination than NDVI and VI. Generally, VOGREI is another
    newly developed reflectance index that should be further analysed for small scale
    water stress assessment inside the greenhouse, based on species variability and
    sample replicate stability. 3.3. Nitrogen stress assessment Nitrogen is up taken
    by roots and stored to mesophyll cells of the leaves in order to synthesize proteins
    (which are integrated in structural components to constitute cell wall) or enzymes
    in metabolic pathways (Vigneau et al., 2011). Nitrogen that is allocated to leaves
    varies as the photosynthesis and the rubisco production rate (which represents
    about 50% of leaf nitrogen content) change (Gutschick, 1999, Vigneau et al., 2011).
    Leaves from healthy plants contain higher amounts of nitrogen, chlorophyll, rubisco,
    photosynthetic rate and lower starch content and leaf thickness than N-limited
    plants (Peňuelas et al., 1994). Rate limitations on N consumption causes low fractional
    content and high thickness, dry mass per unit area and long leaf lifetimes. Increase
    of leaf N content amount confers large water use efficiency by increasing the
    mesophyll conductance and decreasing the ration between the stomatal conductance
    and mesophyll conductance (Flexas et al., 2013). If mesophyll conductance decreases,
    the carboxylation rate per mass of rubisco enzyme declines, decreasing at the
    same time the CO2 assimilation per mass of N. However, photosynthetic and rubisco
    production rate is strongly related to chlorophyll content (Chl) in leaf tissue
    (Sclemmer et al., 2005) while N is the only compound that influences the actual
    extracted chlorophyll content (Croft et al., 2014, Sclemmer et al., 2005, Silleos
    et al., 2006). Chlorophyll levels affect leaf area, leaf weight and plant size
    (Basyouni & Dunn, 2013, pp. 1–4). If N stress occurs, the chlorophyll content
    is decreased, the leaf is changed from green to yellow–green and less radiation
    is used by the plant, and as a result, the red and red-edge spectrum is increased.
    The greenness of the leaves represents the amount of chlorophyll found in the
    chloroplasts, which can be used as an indirect indicator for the photosynthetic
    processes of the plant to determine plant health and vigor (Basyouni & Dunn, 2013,
    pp. 1–4). Thus, reflectance at VIS (Visible spectrum) spectrum can provide a measure
    of stress that results in chlorophyll degradation and consequently to N concentration
    detection. Though, the correlation of N concentration to chlorophyll varies according
    to the environmental conditions, the cultivar and the growing season. Chlorophyll
    in living leaves has absorbance peaks in two distinct regions: the blue region
    (400–500 nm) and the red region (600–700 nm), with no transmission in the NIR
    region (Basyouni & Dunn, 2013, pp. 1–4). Several authors (e.g. Jain et al., 2007,
    Sclemmer et al., 2005, Vigneau et al., 2011) observed a strong correlation between
    chlorophyll content and crop reflectance at 525–630 nm, 640–660 nm, around 705
    nm, 730 nm and 930 nm. Based on Lepine, Ollinger, Ouimette, and Martin (2016),
    the vegetation index DVI [Difference Vegetation Index = (NIR − Red)] was strongly
    correlated with canopy N content. In fact, the correlations with N appeared to
    decline as indices became more complex, with NDVI [Normalised difference vegetation
    index = (NIR − Red)/(NIR + Red)] and EVI [Enhanced vegetation index = (2.5 × NIR
    − Red)/(1 + NIR + 6 × Red − 7.5 × Blue)] to be weakly correlated with canopy N.
    According to Lepine et al. (2016), these results indicate that the relationship
    between N and the indices in that analysis were driven more so by variation in
    NIR reflectance than by variation in visible reflectance. This observation supports
    the notion that the contribution of visible reflectance in some vegetation indices
    can add noise to an otherwise strong correlation between NIR reflectance and N.
    That is why canopy structural properties, such as LAI influences the reflectance
    in that spectrum area. Croft et al. (2014) used a number of reflectance indices
    based on Red and NIR spectrum area as well, such as MNDVI8 [Modified NDVI = (R755
    − R730)/(R755 + 730)], MTCI [Meris terrestrial chlorophyll index = (R754 − R709)/(R709
    − R681)], Macc01 [Maccioni 2001 = (R780 − R710)/(R780 + R680)], D [Derivative
    reflectance at D690 = D690] and DD [Datt derivative = D754/D704]. Figure 9 shows
    the relationship between reflectance indices (MNDVI8, MTCI, Macc01, D, DD) and
    leaf chlorophyll content (broad or needle site). Bajwa, Mishra, and Norman (2010)
    used reflectance indices based on NIR spectrum area {MSAVI [Modified soil adjusted
    vegetation index = 1/2 × (2 × (R810 + 1) − (√(2 × R810 + 1)2 − 8 × (R810 − R690))],
    WDRVI = [Wide dynamic range vegetation index = (R810 − R690)/(R810 + R690)]} to
    predict green biomass (R2 > 0.70). Peňuelas et al. (1995) had already studied
    SIPI index {SIPI = [Structural independent pigment index = (R800 − R445)/(R800
    + R680)]} and found that it was highly correlated to the ratio of carotenoids/chlorophyll-a.
    Only when the index included reflectance measurements around 700 nm {NDRE [Normalised
    difference red edge = (R790 − R720)/(R790 + R720)]} lead to N status prediction
    (Bajwa et al., 2010). Zhao et al. (2005) reported that leaf N and Chl concentrations
    were linearly correlated with indices that include Blue or NIR reflectance measurements
    (R405/R715 and R1075/R735). Download : Download high-res image (508KB) Download

    MTCI, Macc01, D, DD) and leaf chlorophyll content (broad or needle site). From
    Croft et al. (2014). Among others who used reflectance indices based on Red, NIR
    spectrum area to correlate with N plant content, Hernández et al. (2014) concluded
    to a positive correlation between rNDVI and leaf N concentration. Vigneau et al.
    (2011) also noted that VOGREI was highly correlated to leaf N content while Padilla
    et al. (2014) showed that NDVI(NIR-RED)[ =(RNIR − RRED)/(RNIR + RRED)], GNDVI
    [Normalised difference vegetation index on greenness = (RNIR − RGREEN)/(RNIR +
    RGREEN)], RVI [Red vegetation index = (RNIR/RRED)] and GVI[Green vegetation index
    = (RNIR/RGREEN)] showed high correlation with N concentration. On the other hand,
    Nigon et al. (2015) found MTCI [Merris terrestrial chlorophyll index = (R751 −
    R713)/(R713 − R679)] to be the most promising reflectance index for determining
    N stress level for variable rate application of N fertilizer over a broad range
    of conditions. Consequently, it was concluded that reflectance measurements around
    to 700 nm are capable to lead to N stress prediction. 4. Discussion 4.1. How to
    improve accuracy in measurements The level of technology used in hyperspectral
    sensors has been significantly increasing during the last decade. However, even
    the most advanced hyperspectral sensors present some instability in measurement
    over time, due to the intense effects of solar radiation in the target area (Tuominen
    & Lipping, 2011). Illumination is important in optical reflectance applications,
    especially in the hyperspectral camera in which a uniform spatial distribution
    is crucial. Specialised lighting devices that emit stable and smooth light are
    efficient and affordable. Such illumination sources must have intensity peaks
    in the area of interest of the reflectance measurement (Noble & Li, 2012). Figure
    10 shows the spectral response in a broad-spectrum of several common light sources
    compared with sunlight, over the typical range of a silicon-based detector of
    hyperspectral cameras (Lawrence et al., 2003). Sunlight emits high energy in the
    visible spectrum and low energy in the near-infrared spectrum. Typical halogen
    lamps emit low energy in the blue region and high energy in the red region. In
    addition, fluorescence tubes give certain peaks in which reflectance sensors can
    measure, while high power LEDs do not have enough power to improve the light signal
    (Lawrence, Park, Heitschmidt, Windham, & Thai, 2007). A quartz-tungsten-halogen
    flood light could be a good option as it emits stable light in the visible and
    NIR spectral regions, without significant spectral peaks. Download : Download

    spectral response of sunlight, tungsten-halogen lamps, white LEDs and fluorescent
    lamps. From Lawrence et al. (2007). Several parameters affect the accuracy of
    reflectance measurements, a summary of the most important points to be noted in
    order to acquire accurate reflectance measurements is given below: • A stable
    position for the optical system with an appropriate distance from the target and
    a fixed geometry between the sensor and the target are necessary. The appropriate
    distance between the sensor and the target varies according to the dimensions
    of camera''s light detector and the target size that is needed to capture (angle
    view) (For instance, the hyperspectral ImspecV10 camera with 18° objective lens
    size has a field of view capacity that equals to 32° in case of 1550 spatial pixels).
    Camera angle view can be measured horizontally, vertically and diagonally. In
    case that an optical scanning system is used, the view angle calculation is influenced
    by the scanning distance. • Before any image acquisition, the camera''s settings
    (exposure time and number of lens aperture) must be corrected by measuring a white
    surface of known reflectance (spectralon) at the same position with the plant
    target. In this stage, the gain and the offset are adjusted according to the light
    signal. • Placing a black material behind and below the target scene will help
    to avoid scattering of the neighbourhood materials and spectral interference from
    the ground. • A light measuring sensor during the time of recording could help
    to correct errors from the primary image acquisition and effects of variable cloud
    coverage. • For the signal-to-noise calculation, a dark image is acquired by covering
    the lens with dark material. After that, the resulting pictures are normalised
    with the dark and white reference images to generate a calibrated image without
    noise. 4.2. Reflectance indices correlation to plant water and nutrient status
    According to the studies revised, it seems that PRI cannot be used to detect early
    plant water stress, since it was not able to detect changes for periods shorter
    than 3-d after stress initiation. PRI changed significantly (due to mechanism
    of xanthophylls) only when substrate or soil water content was reduced to half.
    However, PRI constitutes an effective water stress detection index in cases that
    the leaf relative water content proportion is smaller than some reference portion
    according to the leaf structure. Nevertheless, for greenhouse conditions where
    irrigation management includes at least 8–10 irrigation events per day (depending
    to plant growth stage), PRI seems not suitable to detect leaf water content variations
    for short-time scale. Probably the combination of PRI with fluorescence and canopy
    temperature, could lead to early plant water stress detection (earlier than three
    days after stress initiation) (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). However, due to the
    fact that the contribution of fluorescence signal (Fs) is very low, as it represents
    only 2–3% of leaf electromagnetic reflectance in red and near infrared spectrum,
    the reliability of this spectral index to detect water stress is also unknown.
    In addition, since PRI is affected by parameters such as soil type, sun angle
    and LAI, the above parameters have to be known and constant or their effect has
    to be taken into account in order the index to be used for crop water stress detection.
    Furthermore, it seems that the index cannot be correlated to plant water status
    at low light levels (<700 μmol m−2 s−1), while ΔPRI (the difference of actual
    to an initial-reference value) signal is more sensitive to light conditions where
    water and nutrients are limited. Thus, to correlate reflectance indices to the
    gas-exchange and/or water status parameters, the values obtained from early morning
    and late afternoon measurements should be discarded (Marino et al., 2014). The
    NDVI that is based on wavelengths from 670 to 690 nm (the index tends to saturate
    due to chlorophyll absorbance maximum) could be a suitable index for water stress
    detection only in certain species. Thus the index should be further evaluated
    in greenhouse crops, taking into account the leaf age and the LAI (as this type
    of NDVI gives quite satisfactory results in cases of low LAI). The NDVI(490–620)
    should be further analysed in order to prove whether it is an appropriate index
    for plant water stress detection, focussing on high and stable light conditions
    during the measurements, mostly in the blue region. If light signal is satisfactory,
    NDVI(490–620) can be more flexible in the environmental conditions of greenhouses
    and suitable for short-time scale irrigation. The NDVI(800–620 or 640) can probably
    be used for water stress detection in greenhouse crop, especially with low LAI,
    while NDVI that includes the green spectral region varies its intensity as LAI
    increases. On the other hand, NDVI indices that include the spectrum at 740–800
    nm are more influenced by leaf structure and less by LAI. The indices mrNDVI and
    mrSRI identify the sensitivity of vegetation to small changes in foliage water
    content, a little faster than rNDVI. On the other hand, rNDVI identifies the plant
    water content sensitivity with less variability among replicates with leaves of
    the same level of water stress. According to Aparicio et al. (2004), NDVI, SR
    and PRI were more effective during growth stages than WI, which was more effective
    during anthesis and maturity stages, during which, the first three indices seem
    to decrease, while WI increases. Moreover, some researchers believe that WI is
    not influenced by the relative shifts and the environmental conditions and is
    a more appropriate index for measuring reflectance at canopy level because the
    impact of leaf angle distribution on the relationship between the canopy reflectance
    and the canopy water content is minor (Aparicio et al., 2004, Clevers et al.,
    2008). A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the most commonly used
    reflectance indices for water stress assessment are given in Table 3. Table 3.
    Advantages and disadvantages of the most effective reflectance indices for water
    stress assessment. Reflectance indexes Advantages Disadvantages PRI • Direct correlation
    with photosynthetic rate or canopy temperature and stomatal conductance • It is
    sensitive to water stress conditions through depoxidation state of xanthophylls
    • Closely efficiency at the leaf and canopy levels over a wide range of species
    • Intensive to changes of different environmental condition • Indirect correlation
    with plant water content • Slow appearance of variability between control and
    water stressed plants, at least 3 days. It is dependent from the intensity of
    the leaf area and canopy structure NDVI (800–680 or 640) • Good indicator of nitrogen
    content, biomass, chlorophyll, leaf area index at the leaf and canopy level for
    different species • Good correlation to soil water content • Slow appearance of
    variability between control and water stressed plants, at least 3 days • Poor
    to medium correlation with water treatment patterns at plant water content method
    • Saturated from the high LAI NDVI (490–620) • Good correlation to plant water
    content • Variable of leaf age and grow maturity rNDVI • High correlation with
    soil moisture content and plant water content • Identifies small changes in foliage
    water content • It must be studied more in case of heterogeneous species, illumination,
    canopy architecture and other parameters. WI • It is not influenced from the relative
    shifts and the environment condition • It starts to decrease with first water
    losses in proper species • Good correlation with PWC in simple leaf structure
    • It may give differences among replicates with leaves at the same level of water
    stress • Include variation among species and different LAI at growth stages •
    It is influenced from the greenhouse covered condition (atmospheric water absorption
    and liquid water condense) mrNDVI mrSRI • High correlation with soil moisture
    content and plant water content • Captivity of small changes in canopy foliage
    water content in small time scale in more time scale requirements than rNDVI •
    Plant variability among replicates with leaves at the same level of water stress
    VOGREI • Appears to be less influenced by differences in green leaf biomass, background
    conditions and light contamination • Further study for the species variability
    and sample replicate stability VIS and the red edge spectrum could be used for
    either water or nutrient stress estimation. However, the nitrogen stress could
    be detected more rapidly in the blue and red spectrum due to the direct connection
    between nitrogen and chlorophyll contents. Thus, for nitrogen stress detection,
    reflectance indices that will include wavelengths at that spectrum area are proposed.
    However, in the case of leaf water stress detection, when the soil water content
    is low, the plant develops specific protection mechanisms. In that case, the plant
    exhibits a reduced transpiration rate in order to prevent the temperature increase,
    although the photosynthetic rate and the chlorophyll content remain stable for
    a lathe time interval. Nevertheless, the full capabilities of these promising
    approaches are not yet entirely clear. Generally, a need to monitor the above
    indicators in real-time in all vegetation growth stages is observed. Also, there
    is a promising potential for combining information from a wide range of reflectance
    indices for the diagnosis and quantification of water or nutrient stress, during
    different time-scale periods and different environmental and vegetation stage
    conditions. 5. Concluding remarks and future perspectives A possible future perspective
    could include the use of suitable reflectance indices for the real time detection
    of plant water stress for greenhouse crop requirements, from non-contact and destructive
    sensors. Unfortunately, the spectral properties of leaves are not only influenced
    by plant water status, but also by factors such as leaf age, sun versus shade
    leaf anatomy, leaf thickness, differences in leaf surface properties, soil background
    and non-water stress related variations in leaf angle, canopy structure and leaf
    area. These factors can introduce variations that reduce the correlation between
    water stress in greenhouse plants and leaf spectral response (Eitel et al., 2006).
    The main effort of current research is to develop an index that will be not influenced
    by climatic conditions and sunlight that will give a more detailed information
    about plant water stress deficit, that will be used any time and in real time
    and finally that will be commercially available and cost-effective. r/mrNDVI or
    mrSRI seems to be the reflectance indices that could detect water stress level
    in greenhouse conditions but further analysis must be performed for different
    species and light conditions. In greenhouse cultivations, there is a need to detect
    plant reflectance changes in a level more than 60% of soil water content. However,
    reflectance indices measurements suffer from the background signal influence and
    the light intensity in the view of the remote sensor. The processing of reflectance
    measurements is the most important step for the acquisition of indices. The normalised
    difference and ratio eliminate the background signal only in cases of a constant
    spectrum from one measurement to another. For this reason, the conventional reflectance
    indices are not capable of monitoring stable water deficit. Recently developed
    decision support systems that use information from one or the combination of several
    of the above mentioned spectral indices (Genc et al., 2011; Köksal, 2011, Loh,
    2011, Ray et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2011), have to be improved to optimise plant
    water stress detection. Also, for further studies, much work remains to be done
    to identify the change in composition of leaf pigments under water stress conditions,
    by combining the red and NIR regions based on existing or new reflectance index
    formation. However, hyperspectral imaging of plant canopy reflectance can be a
    useful tool for water stress early detection, although the cost and the complexity
    are major disadvantages of hyperspectral techniques. Also, the calibration methods
    of optical sensors, especially the hyperspectral imaging system, reduce the wavelengths,
    noise and light errors. The performance of reflectance indices data can be improved
    by filtering the measurements form valid recording images. However, there are
    some parameters in the protocols of optical systems calibration methods in greenhouses,
    such as the light signal, that need to be further analysed to generate more stable
    data. Furthermore, the use of a stable light source is advisable for hyperspectral
    detection accuracy. The use of more stable light protocols is therefore necessary
    to generate comparative data in different greenhouse environment conditions. The
    development of smart systems and technologies with automation and robotic applications
    can help improve the resource use efficiency and productivity in controlled environment
    agriculture systems. Autonomous systems with multi-sensor platforms moving around
    to sense the crop in a greenhouse system would aid to this effort. Additionally,
    plant monitoring requires more efforts in developing platforms to integrate multidimensional
    data (Bautista-Gallego et al., 2011) since plant interactions cannot be elucidated
    by a simple stepwise algorithm or a precise formula, particularly when the data
    set are complex, noisy, vague, uncompleted or formed by different kind of data.

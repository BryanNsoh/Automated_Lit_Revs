    Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in
    critical infrastructures, necessitates strict security and

    privacy standards. Owing to data proliferation, Cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely
    on computing platforms for the provision of services

    and resources. The futuristic “Beyond 5G” (B5G) enabled critical IoT infrastructures
    cannot run on centralized systems due to their

    security vulnerabilities that compromise the basic Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability
    (CIA) triad. Blockchain technology (BCT) is

    emerging as a key enabler in addressing IoT’s security challenges, and it is compliant
    with the Fog-IoT architecture. The Ethereum

    platform has ushered an unprecedented development in BCT by facilitating application
    development. Blockchain (BC) connects the

    users’ chain identity to the transactions associated with their tokenized digital
    assets and confers the ability to audit the system. The

    history of canonical transactions is recorded in an immutable fashion facilitating
    data tracking and deterrence of data repudiation. A

    Consensus mechanism (CM) governs the state transitions and the node behavior in
    building trust relationships between various entities

    in the absence of a central authority. Through Smart Contracts(SCs), distributed
    and trustworthy access control can be achieved for

    IoT systems besides enhancing automation. We argue that BCT adoption is inevitable
    in securing futuristic B5G enabled IoT critical

    infrastructures for ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control, authentication,
    communication, and data security. Various challenges

    are associated with their adoption, such as the rising cost of Ethereum and constraints
    in the IoT environment. To facilitate BC solutions

    for IoT security, the functionality of BCT must be complemented with other technologies
    such as Machine Learning (ML), Edge

    Computing (EC), and InterPlanetary Filesystem(IPFS).

    Keywords: Blockchain, IoT, Edge Computing, Consensus, Security, Privacy, Smart

    1. INTRODUCTION

    The industry is rapidly evolving into a holistic network

    of intelligent systems capable of making data-driven deci-

    sions. Many technologies have aided this transition, with

    IoT being at the core. IoT connects devices and couples

    them to the internet forming a CPS. IoT is at the center

    of intelligent applications in and outside the industry. IoT

    offers the remote control and monitoring of equipment

    and catalyzes data-driven automated decision and action-

    taking capabilities, resulting in increased system efficiency

    and throughput while lowering costs. IoT is causing a

    major upward shift in the revenue pool, and its growth

    can be assessed by the increase in the number of practical

    applications across regions.

    IoT enables a pervasive interconnection of virtual and

    physical objects for accelerated data sharing and collection.

    Sensing capabilities are embedded in intelligent devices

    such as smartphones, laptops, and fitness monitors, while

    intelligence is built into traditional sensors for extensive

    data monitoring. As per the Ericson report, by 2050, there

    will be 24 billion interconnected IoT devices [1]. The data

    streams are generated continuously with volumes reaching

    exabytes; thus, the data is referred to as IoT Big data. At

    present, Cloud Computing and Fog Computing are the most

    popular provisions to handle the high-end computing and

    storage demands of IoT big data [2].

    IoT aims to create intelligent, unified, fully distributed,

    secure, and cost-efficient systems. Reliable storage, data

    awareness, ease of access, scalability, and channel security

    are important parameters while adopting a wireless system.

    IoT systems come with inbuilt security measures that can

    be bypassed due to their intrinsic traits.Various factors are

    responsible for hindering the pace of IoT security. These

    include:

    1)

    Any end- end encryption technique employed to

    provide data security in networks is challenging to

    be embedded in IoT networks due to the constrained

    nature of the devices.

    2)

    IoT devices are lodged in uncontrollable, heteroge-

    neous, complex, open, untrustworthy environments,

    which magnify the attack space.

    3)

    Lack of standard architecture, a common address-

    ing scheme limits the integration and replication of

    security measures from other IoT systems.

    4)

    IoT is an ever-growing field, and the security features

    of constrained devices are not evolving at the same

    pace as the system itself.

    5)

    The adoption of computing platforms forces frequent

    transfer of data. Implementing robust cryptographic

    algorithms is expensive and increases the overall cost

    of the system.

    6)

    IoT systems communicate across different domains

    and require fine-grained Access control(AC) mecha-

    nisms for collaboration.

    Cloud and Fog platforms are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and

    fail to meet the demand for flexible cross-domain interop-

    erability across multiple systems with distributed resources.

    The Data Management (DM) systems are centralized and

    prone to hackers who can manipulate the database, thereby

    compromising data integrity. The overreliance on a central-

    ized database causes the “Single point failure” problem. The

    monetary transactions require the intermediation of a third

    party, which incurs verification costs and increases privacy

    concerns. These centralized architectures are prone to secu-

    rity threats that disorder the regular operation of systems.

    These include Denial of Services(DoS), Distributed Denial

    of Services(DDoS), Ransomware attacks, Eavesdropping,

    Side-channel attacks, Spoofing, Routing attacks, Man in the

    middle attack, SQL injection, and Phishing [3].

    With the advancement in B5G technology, IoT is set to

    transform the existing digital landscape, but its inadequate

    security features have limited its adoption. B5G mobile

    communication technologies aim to provide high-speed

    transmission network support and enormous access points

    to maximize IoT capabilities [4]. The security measures of

    such applications need enhanced security and efficient DM.

    BCT is emerging as a promising paradigm for bringing

    disruptions in IoT security and is highly compliant with

    the Fog-like system of architecture [5].

    BCT has created a paradigm shift by enabling trusted and

    anonymous transactions. BCT establishes trust between the

    communicating nodes, and the decision-making is based

    on CMs suitable in distributed environments. Owing to its

    unique propensities– Immutability, Transparency, Traceabil-

    ity, Resilience, and Encryption, the adoption of BCT is

    suitable for the realization of futuristic peer-peer, trustless

    applications. BCT supports tokenized assets, and the nodes

    in the network interact automatically without the interven-

    tion of any central authority. This increases the privacy of

    the network and eliminates the management cost.

    BCT is creating major reforms in IoT management and se-

    curity. The IoT transactions are encrypted and secured using

    digital signatures and cryptographic keys. BCT eliminates

    the security threats with a distributed CM and provides a

    Figure 1. Centralized Vs. BC-based IoT

    true system state upon which every legitimate user agrees.

    With the integration of BCT, IoT applications are becoming

    decentralized, transactions are trusted and anonymous, and

    cross-domain interaction is enhanced. The system security

    is increased through ownership records, encrypted trans-

    actions, distributed storage, consensus, and authentication

    mechanisms. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between a

    centralized and BC-based IoT system.

    There are multiple challenges concerning the BC integrated

    IoT systems, such as network complexity, limited band-

    width, computation capabilities, data diversity, scalability,

    and throughput. Conventional CMs consume huge amounts

    of resources to slow down the access rate of new blocks and

    protect the BC network from attacks, which is too expensive

    for resource-limited IoT devices. Further, the capacity of a

    new block is limited, and transactions per second (TPS)

    are usually limited to 20 to 30 TPS in Ethereum, rendering

    the system unable to respond to the influx of transactions

    [6]. With tradeoffs between adversity tolerance, latency,

    and energy consumption, research on IoT suitable CMs is

    growing.

    BC itself suffers from security and privacy issues. Imple-

    menting longer chains is challenging, and the SCs can prove

    to be a double-edged sword. The cost of Ethereum is rising

    continuously, making the storage and transactions expen-

    sive for large-scale adoption. The underlying technologies

    powering BCT consume high power and are not suitable for

    IoT. BCT can revolutionize IoT, but enabling technologies

    such as IPFS, ML and EC must be integrated with BC to

    outweigh its current limitations.

    IPFS is a distributed file system that can resolve BC

    –IoT big data problems. Instead of storing the data on

    the chain, IPFS hashes identifying the files are kept in

    the BC. The hash on the BC assures that the file has not

    been tampered with. File hashes can be used to link files

    to their owners and access rights.Solving complex puzzles

    such as Proof of work consumes a significant amount of

    CPU time and energy, making it unsuitable for resource-

    constrained IoT nodes. EC enables edge devices to carry out

    data resource incentive transactions and can be leveraged for

    performing consensus. Information hidden in IoT big data

    can be harnessed by feeding them to ML models, producing

    more generalized results on big data.The integrity of the

    data can be maintained by feeding trustworthy data to ML

    99

    through BC. Conversely, more security can be imparted into

    BC through ML.

    BCT is regarded as a promising technology for IoT because

    it provides significant solutions for decentralized networks

    that address trust and security concerns. Although BC

    outperforms centralized solutions in network security, BC-

    IoT integration is still in its early stages of adoption. Many

    challenges such as cost, compatibility, and privacy issues

    hinder the widespread adoption of BC security solutions

    in IoT. To realize the full potential of BC-based IoT,

    exhaustive research is necessary for exploring the enabling

    technologies for BC in lightweight( LW) environments.

    A. Objective and Contribution

    This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview

    of the potential and challenges of BC-based IoT security

    solutions and enabling technologies, open issues, possible

    solutions, and future research directions. There are four

    focal research points of our study, and are listed below-

    1)

    Firstly, to highlight the problems in centralized-based

    IoT solutions and understand why shifting to BC-

    based solutions is necessary.

    2)

    Since the robustness of a BC-based system is highly

    dependent on its underlying consensus mechanism,

    the aim is to conduct an in-depth comparative anal-

    ysis of CMs that are IoT suitable.

    3)

    Thirdly, to critically review the existing BC-based

    IoT security solutions in view of five IoT security

    tasks-

    a)

    Key Management and Access control.

    b)

    Device Authentication.

    c)

    Routing Security.

    d)

    Malware Prevention. and

    e)

    Data Protection and Secure Database Manage-

    ment.

    4)

    Fourthly, to highlight the open challenges in the

    BC-IoT integration and list out key future research

    directions.

    The main contributions of the paper are as follows:

    1)

    We have conducted a thorough survey of recent

    surveys(2019-early 2022) on BCT applicability in

    IoT. Other researchers may find this pool useful as

    a starting point for their research.

    2)

    We have discussed BC as a key enabling technology

    for IoT and three technologies that power BC-IoT.

    3)

    We have reviewed CMs in light of IoT.

    4)

    A primary literature review of the recent BC inte-

    grated IoT solutions in perspective of five specific

    IoT security tasks.

    5)

    We have discussed the cost analysis of IoT storage

    through SCs, network traffic modeling, SC vulner-

    abilities, BC transactional privacy, and other chal-

    lenges.

    6)

    We have thoroughly discussed the open issues and

    presented strong research directions.

    B. Paper Organization

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In

    Section 2, the scope of the survey is presented. Section

    3 presents the security vulnerabilities of six critical IoT

    applications and lays the rationale for moving toward de-

    centralized architectures. In Section 4, we briefly provide

    an overview of BCT, its architecture, and CMs. Section 5

    presents the highlights of the recent surveys (2019-early

    2022). Based on the study in section 5, we discuss BC as

    a key facilitator for IoT and technologies that accelerate

    BC adoption in IoT in Section 6. In Section 7, a detailed

    study of BC integrated IoT security architectures and a

    comparison of various CMs, their adoption, and tradeoffs

    is discussed. In section 8, a literature review of BC-based

    security solutions is presented. In section 9, we present a

    thorough overview of the challenges associated with BC

    adoption in IoT, point out the open issues and possible

    solutions, and suggest promising research directions

    2. Scope of the survey

    We begin our review with a study of the prevalent

    centralized IoT architectures and discuss their security vul-

    nerabilities. We identify five primary security tasks, evaluate

    them against centralized solutions, and determine their

    limitations and the need to shift to decentralized solutions

    such as Blockchain. We then discuss the fundamentals of

    Blockchain. The working of the SCs have been excluded,

    and instead, their security vulnerabilities and applicability

    has been discussed. Considering the vastness of BC appli-

    cability, especially in IoT security, we shortlist a pool of re-

    cent survey papers (2019-early 2022) and comprehensively

    highlight their key focal points. The research papers have

    been shortlisted based on keywords, the number of times

    cited, and relevance to one of the five domains- General

    IoT security, IoT suitable CMs, BC-based IoT applications,

    BC for B5G applications, and integration with Machine

    Learning and BC- Edge computing. Other researchers may

    find this pool useful as a starting point for their research.

    Based on our secondary survey, we broadly discuss the

    reason for merging BC with IoT, how BC is a key enabling

    technology for IoT and what technologies drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in

    IoT. We have discussed three enabling technologies for

    powering BC adoption in IoT- EC, IPFS, and ML. We

    then discuss the BC-IoT integration in great detail and

    present the technicalities of BC adoption in IoT. Since a

    BC network is only as good as its consensus, we conduct

    a detailed comparative analysis of CMs in light of IoT

    goals and related tradeoffs. Based on the study, we shortlist

    IoT suitable CMs and BC platforms. We then review the

    recent BC-based IoT architectures and evaluate them against

    the previously identified security tasks. We have filtered a

    subset of research papers(2018-early 2022) where the focal

    points are specifically the five IoT security tasks mentioned

    in subsection 1(A). Each paper’s experimental work and re-

    sults have been carefully studied, and the aim, architecture,

    pros, and cons of each solution have been comprehensively

    summarized. Finally, based on the literature review of BC-

    IoT architectures, we thoroughly discuss the challenges in

    BC-IoT integration and present research issues and future

    research directions.

    3. Security vulnerabilities of Centralized IoT applica-

    tions:

    IoT’s centralized architecture has three major network

    components-a) End devices: These are devices with sensing

    and actuating abilities coupled to the CPS. They amass

    data in the environment that they are lodged in and take

    action. b) Gateways and Data acquisition systems (DAS):

    DASs acquire data from sensors, and the gateways enable

    the Device-Cloud interactions working on different network

    protocols. c) Computing platforms: The data is relayed

    to platforms that provide storage, processing, hardware,

    software, and analytical support to the system.

    A. IoT Goals

    IoT architecture must satisfy the following primary

    goals:

    1)

    Low Power consumption: IoT devices are con-

    strained and require low-powered communication

    protocols to increase the network’s lifetime.

    2)

    Adaptability: The addition of new devices, frequent

    changes in the network conditions, and mobility of

    devices are essential factors in an IoT network. IoT

    architecture must be flexible to changes that the

    network encounters.

    3)

    Interoperability: Heterogeneity is a prime character-

    istic of IoT data. Well-defined standards and middle-

    ware are necessary to ensure ubiquitous computing.

    4)

    Latency prevention: The data processing must be

    done in a timely manner, especially in critical ap-

    plication domains.

    5)

    Accuracy: The data must be consistent and accurate

    throughout the process. The veracity of the data must

    be ensured, and the communication should be non-

    lossy.

    6)

    Fault tolerance: The architecture must contain a

    distributed and decentralized system to ensure ro-

    bustness and resilience.

    7)

    Security protection: Data must be protected against

    malicious cyberattacks. The transmitted data must

    not be altered at any level.

    8)

    Privacy Preservation: The transmitted data must only

    be available to the users participating in exchanging

    information.

    9)

    Low cost: The overall cost of deployment, network

    communication, storage, and maintenance should be

    low. Affordability is an essential factor in making

    IoT a viable business paradigm.

    10)

    Scalability: IoT is an ever-growing field. New de-

    vices are added to expand the existing networks. The

    architecture must be flexible to the growth of the

    network

    1) IoT Security Goals

    An IoT network must satisfy the following security

    goals:

    1)

    Confidentiality: Data transmitted must be accessible

    only to authentic users. Encryption mechanisms must

    be employed to protect the data.

    2)

    Integrity: The data transmitted must be trustworthy.

    The data received must not be modified in an unau-

    thorized manner.

    3)

    Availability: The data must not be lost in transit. DoS

    must be avoided.

    4)

    Authenticity: The data must originate only from

    trusted sources only. The Authentication issue in-

    cludes the capability to identify the devices in the

    IoT-based system.

    5)

    Non-Repudiation: The data transfer must be bound

    by proof of data ownership. The sender and receiver

    must acknowledge the transfer of data and not deny

    it at a later stage.

    6)

    Authorization: This refers to granting permissions to

    access data or perform an operation on authenticated

    objects and persons.

    B. Security of Centralized IoT applications:

    The number of IoT applications has increased signifi-

    cantly as a result ofthe development of open-source cloud

    platforms, such as Azure IoT Suite, Amazon Web Services,

    and Oracle IoT. IoT is at the root of various critical applica-

    tion infrastructures such as Smart Home, Smart City, Smart

    Health, Smart Agriculture, Smart Retails, Supply Chain

    Management, Finance, Industrial Control Systems, Commu-

    nication Networks, Smart Grids, and Smart Transportation

    [7]. These applications generate personal and sensitive

    information, raising the need for secure DM. Centralized

    schemes are susceptible to attacks, and a hacker can modify

    the AC policies to gain control of the system. Decentralized

    schemes are necessary for securing IoT Applications. The

    centralized nature of the application is vulnerable to various

    security threats at all levels, as depicted in Figure 2. In this

    subsection, we discuss six critical application domains:

    Figure 2. Security attacks in IoT

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    101

    1)

    Smart city (SCT): SCT has Information and Com-

    munication Technology (ICT) at the core of its

    infrastructure. SCT provides several innovative and

    advanced services to its citizens to improve their

    quality of life. Intelligent information is provided

    to its citizens in real-time by fully enabling the

    control of the physical objects. Various SCT appli-

    cations include Healthcare, Smart buildings, Public

    safety, Smart Governance, and Smart agriculture.

    SCT faces large-scale security and privacy risks. The

    resource-constrained devices used, such as sensors

    and cameras which collect and share sensitive infor-

    mation, are very vulnerable to attacks by hackers.

    Most of the resource-constrained devices have no

    adequate security or privacy mechanism. The com-

    munication technologies used by IoT devices like

    RFID, NFC, WiFi, LPWAN (Low Power Wide-area-

    network), 6LoWPAN 3G,and 4G mobile technolo-

    gies are highly susceptible to attacks. The presence

    of multiple links between many system components

    exposes them to many security risks [8], [9], [10].

    2)

    Smart HealthCare (SHC): One of the major do-

    mains in the IoT-based infrastructure is SHC. Wear-

    able and mobile devices in IoT-based SHC have

    added tremendous value to the healthcare domain.

    SHC is responsible for making healthcare person-

    alized, more convenient, and efficient. The various

    applications of SHC include assisting diagnosis and

    treatment, health management, disease prevention,

    risk monitoring, virtual assistants, smart hospitals,

    and assisting drug research. SHC is highly vulnera-

    ble to security breaches and faces many malignant

    attacks, including privacy leakage, data tampering,

    and forgery. SHC deals with sensitive and personal

    data. The data collected through sensors are both

    static or have dynamic behavior. The breach of such

    data is considered a severe breach in data protection.

    The connected devices capture, aggregate, process,

    and then transfer the data to the cloud. These devices

    are vulnerable to tag cloning, spoofing, RF Jamming,

    and cloud polling. SHC has a centralized dataset that

    contains personal information such as family history,

    electronic medical records, and genomic data that

    must be secured from malicious software. Wireless

    networking technology deployed in the healthcare

    environment like Wi-Fi, BLE, and ZigBee results

    in an increased threat of eavesdropping, sybil, and

    sinkhole attacks [11], [12], [13].

    3)

    Smart Grid (SG): SG constitutes one of the most

    critical applications of the IoT. SG entails integrating

    the data communications network and the power

    grid to analyze the data collected from transmission

    lines, distribution substations, and consumers. The

    transmission and distribution of the power networks

    in SG are intelligently monitored at a fine granularity

    for high accuracy. Several IoT architectures have

    been proposed to be integrated with SG. Layer 1

    architecture consists of the Smart meters, Network

    Devices, and Communication protocol in the general

    three-layered architecture. Layer 2 contains devices

    responsible for receiving data at the central system.

    Layer 3 includes artificial intelligent systems to

    provide information to decision and billing systems.

    IoT-based SG as a cyber system faces security

    challenges at all three levels. The attacks can be

    categorized into four main types: Device attack, Data

    attack, Privacy attack, and Network availability at-

    tack. Authentication, user privacy, and data integrity

    are essential in SG. Only the intended recipients

    must access the data stored or transmitted. Secure

    authorization and control access is an important issue

    for IoT-based SG. Only a certified and authorized

    person should be granted the necessary access to

    perform any configuration of the smart meter [14],

    [15], [16].

    4)

    Smart Home (SH): An IoT-based SH refers to the

    environment of living that consists of highly intelli-

    gent and advanced automatic systems. Smart services

    are provided by various heterogeneous electronic

    devices networked together to provide smart ser-

    vices. An IoT-based SH performs various function-

    alities such as controlling and monitoring lighting,

    home temperature, appliances, intrusion detection,

    and energy management. Convenience and secu-

    rity are considered two key factors influencing the

    decision of the users in adopting IoT-based SHs.

    An SH must satisfy five security goals- Authenti-

    cation, Authorization, Integrity, Confidentiality, and

    Availability. SH faces many security-related issues

    owing to its basic architecture, such as eavesdrop-

    ping. An attacker can capture the traffic in infras-

    tructure among the different components of SH,

    thus violating confidentiality. The data captured can

    lead to an impersonation attack where an adversary

    masquerades as an authentic user and accesses IoT

    resources. DoS attacks can be performed by crafting

    malformed messages, resulting in provided service

    not processing the data properly, thereby compro-

    mising the availability [17], [18], [19].

    5)

    Smart Farming/Agriculture (SF/SA): IoT-based

    SF solutions refer to the system in which the crop

    field is monitored with the help of sensors, and

    the irrigation system is automated. The monitoring

    of the farm can be done from anywhere by the

    farmer. In IoT Smart Agriculture (SA), far advanced

    sensors are utilized, connected to the cloud via

    cellular and satellite networks. Thus the real-time

    data received assists in making effective decisions.

    However, there remain many security and privacy

    issues which are critical to the performance of

    SA/SF. Wireless sensors are used abundantly in SA

    to give up-to-date information to the farmer in real-

    time. Centralized systems store the information and

    have control over it, compromising the privacy of

    the system. Furthermore, communication plays a key

    role in SA/SF. The vulnerable nature of wireless

    102

    technology results in the interception of data packets.

    The data is susceptible to modification while relaying

    them to their destinations, compromising the CIA

    triad and leading to incorrect decision-making [20],

    [21], [22].

    6)

    Smart Transportation: With the rapid develop-

    ment in smart sensors, smart vehicles, and vehicular

    communication technology, the Internet of Vehicles

    (IoV) is proposed to be the future of the trans-

    portation critical infrastructure system. The evolu-

    tion of the IoV can be considered from its parent

    branch of IoT, with the focus on Vehicular Adhoc

    Networks. With sensors embedded in the vehicles,

    mobile phones, and the devices installed in the

    city, there is a possibility to offer an optimized

    suggestion of routes, easy parking reservations, eco-

    nomic street lightning, prevention of accidents, and

    autonomous car driving. Due to the dynamic nature

    of the vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to

    vehicle (V2V) communication, the real-time traffic

    state information measured and shared is essential

    in providing efficient and secure service in IoV.

    Since this communication is deployed in an open

    environment and topologies change over time, many

    vehicles enter the IoV system in a given time slot,

    making it challenging to identify and authenticate

    the legitimacy of each vehicle. This nature of the

    IoV network makes it difficult to ensure security and

    non-repudiation. As a result, the malicious attack can

    be easily launched to disrupt the services provided,

    leading to low traffic efficiency and compromising

    the safety of passengers. The high availability of

    IoV is important due to its safety-critical nature,

    which requires fail-safe, resilient, and fault-tolerant

    operations to be performed [23], [24], [25].

    C. IoT Security Tasks:

    The Security tasks can be broadly classified into five cat-

    egories spanning different IoT infrastructure levels. These

    include:

    1)

    Key and AC management: Only authorized person-

    nel must be given access to perform an operation or

    to access data. Fine-grained AC mechanisms must

    be devised in a heterogeneous environment, where

    cross-domain interoperability is a must.

    2)

    Authentication of Devices: It is a must that the

    legitimacy of every node participating in the network

    is proven to the root. The devices must also verify

    their data integrity and provide non-repudiation of

    the messages while interacting with other nodes.

    3)

    Data sharing and Routing security: IoT system pro-

    vides untethered access to information by transmit-

    ting data through uncertain and insecure channels.

    Securing the data and routing operation from cyber-

    attacks during transit is essential.

    4)

    Prevention against software failures: IoT systems

    are susceptible to Malware threats that can disrupt

    the entire functionality of the system. Adware, Ran-

    somware, Spyware protection is necessary to protect

    the IoT ecosystem.

    5)

    Secure and privacy-preserving data storage and man-

    agement: A central authority controls a centralized

    system that has complete control over the users’

    data. IoT systems require secure, tamper-resistant,

    and privacy-preserving database storage and man-

    agement.

    4. Blockchain Technology

    Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger consisting of a

    series of time-stamped blocks linked together through a CM

    forming a decentralized and distributed network [26]. A set

    of rules guides the transactions, and the system is free of

    any central authority. Instead, a peer-peer (p2p ) network is

    responsible for maintaining and updating the ledger. Con-

    ceived originally to prevent the “double-spending” problem

    in commercial transactions, the first widespread application

    of BC was the cryptocurrency Bitcoin’. However, since its

    inception in 2008, BCT has found applications in various

    other sectors such as Banking, Asset Management, Health-

    care, IoT security, Identity management, and Insurance [27].

    The World Economic Forum estimates that the BC would

    store 10 % of global GDP in the coming decade.

    Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that contains trans-

    actional records.The information that is contained in the

    ledger is in digital format. A large number of transactions

    are contained in the block of the BC.For every transaction

    that occurs in the BC, the author’s digital signature is re-

    quired, and every participant’s ledger is updated.By the very

    inherent design of the BC,the chain’s data is highly secure,

    which guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of the

    data.This generates trust without the need for some other

    third party. The validation and tamper-resistant transactions

    are managed by a large number of nodes[28].BC can also

    be described as distributed ledger technology that provides

    certificates to prove that information has not been tampered

    with[29].

    Four crucial technologies are guiding BCT. These include

    Hashing, Cryptography, Digital signatures, and Consensus.

    Hash function takes data of indefinite sizes as input and

    gives a value of definite size in the output. Even a minor

    change in the input leads to a completely different hash

    value. BCT is based on the SHA-256 hash function.The cor-

    responding hash is computed in the encryption block when

    a transaction is made, and the blocks are connected through

    the hashes [30]. For secure interaction, BCT employs

    public-key asymmetric cryptography [31]. Cryptography

    ensures confidentiality, accessibility, and integrity,assuming

    that the attack is computationally bound (the probability of

    which is high). Membership services governed by protocols

    maintain and manage the unique chain identity of the user.

    BCT uses a public key –private key mechanism for the

    identification of devices and signing transactions. A wallet

    contains information about public and private keys and

    tokenized digital assets associated with the client. Every

    transaction on the chain is digitally signed, thus associated

    with the on-record identity of the client.The CM governs

    network synchronization in the open network and ensures

    that the system verifies any transaction initiated. These

    four technologies enable the following in BCT-based open-

    access systems: [32]

    1)

    Decentralization:

    The

    transactions

    are

    validated

    without the interference of a central authority. The

    system is decentralized, and the information is dis-

    tributed and replicated across multiple nodes. The

    nodes agree upon the actual state of the ledger

    through a CM.

    2)

    Auditability: The records and transaction history on

    the chain serves as proof of ownership of the client’s

    digital assets and the transactions associated with

    them. The historical timestamp associated with the

    data is permanently stored in the BC.

    3)

    Integrity: The blocks are linked in chronological

    order with hashes. Thus, any malicious attempt to

    tamper with a block is readily detected.

    4)

    Transparency: BCs impart trust in a trustless environ-

    ment. A copy of the transaction information is visible

    to all the nodes. Any node can join an open BC

    system and access the network. The data is visible

    to everyone in the chain involved in the verification

    of transactions.

    5)

    Immutability:A record, once written, takes up a

    permanent place in the ledger. The ledger holds

    these records perpetually, imparting verifiability in

    the system.

    BCs are of 3 types- Public BCs, Private, and Consortium

    BCs. Public/ Permissionless BCs allow any user to join the

    network based on the consensus protocol, e.g., Bitcoin. Pub-

    lic BC has the capability of turning into a global network.

    A Private/Permissioned BC allows a specific set of nodes to

    be added to the chain providing a closed and more secure

    network [33]. Private BC is centrally controlled, and such a

    network is ideal for transmitting and sharing data within an

    organization. E.g., GemOS is a private BC. Finally, a hybrid

    approach that is partially centralized with lesser validators

    is called a consortium/Federated BC, where the control is

    distributed across a set of computers. Ethereum is a platform

    for building consortium BCs [34]. A comparison of the

    characteristics of the three types of BCs is depicted in Table

    I.

    A. Blockchain Framework:

    A Blockchain system has three layers- Data layer, Con-

    sensus Layer, and Application layer.

    1)

    Data Layer: Data layer governs the block creation.

    Secure identities are provided to each node, and

    dependence is created through network protocols.

    The network protocols govern the formation of p2p

    networks and secure transmission over links. The

    blocks contain two prime components- Chain of

    blocks and Transaction array.

    a)

    Chain of Blocks: BC is a distributed database

    containing a sequence of blocks that stores

    records of value and interest. Each block has a

    Block header(BH) and a Block body(BB). The

    BH stores the block version, which specifies

    the block validation rule set, a nonce which

    acts as a counter to verify the hash, a times-

    tamp to denote time, a Merkle root which

    stores the hash of all the underlying hashes

    of all the transactions in a cryptographic data

    structure called Merkle tree, the current block

    hash and the hash of the previous block. The

    BB contains the transaction data, an object

    recorded on blocks, organized by the Merkle

    tree [35].

    b)

    Transaction array: Every transaction is stored

    in the transaction array before adding it to the

    block. The transactions refer to exchanging

    value assets such as sending money, data,

    values, and messages. The basic skeleton of

    a Blockchain is shown in Figure 3.

    2)

    Consensus layer:This layer performs the core func-

    tionality of a BC system, i.e., bringing agreement on

    the system state in a trustless environment through

    consensus. The consensus is generally achieved by

    choosing a miner who packs the transactions into

    a new block and broadcasts it to the network.

    Figure 4 shows the steps involved in BC-based

    transactions. The four most popular BC CMs are

    Proof of Work(PoW), Proof of stake(PoS), Delegated

    104

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    Figure 3. A basic skeleton of Blockchain.

    Proof of stake(DPoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault

    Tolerance(PBFT). In PoW, the stakeholder(s)/miners

    compete to mine the block by calculating hashes

    until one node has the relevant value. In two

    nodes attaining the value simultaneously(rare) and

    the chain branches, the longest chain after the next

    block is taken as the real chain making the chains

    metastable. PoW requires complex computation and

    power resources. In PoS, a stakeholder/validator is

    chosen through a quasi-random process depending

    on his wallet credit, making the system run on low

    energy and computing resources but encouraging

    the nodes with nothing at stake to misbehave. In

    PBFT, the majority must agree on the network’s

    state, i.e., for a client transaction to commit, 2/3rd

    of the network must validate it. In DPoS, the nodes

    /delegates are chosen through voting to add a block

    to the root chain. In case of abnormal behavior

    by the delegate node, the other nodes can vote it

    out. However, the delegates are significantly less

    than the network and govern consensus, encourag-

    ing centralization. Some more CMs are Proof of

    Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance(DBFT), Proof

    of Burn(PoB), Proof of Capacity(PoC), Proof of

    Elapsed time(PoET), Dirted Acyclic graphs(DAG),

    Proof of Activity(PoA), Proof of Importance(PoI),

    and Leased Proof of Stake(LPoS) [36].

    3)

    Application layer: The Application layer provides

    interfaces for Distributed applications(DApps) that

    run on top of the BC system. At this level, SCs

    are integrated to guide the clauses’ execution with-

    out human intervention. SCs are digitized versions

    of paper-based contracts that allow terms reliant

    on decentralized consensus by self-execution [37].

    SCs are deterministic, autonomous, rule-based, and

    have unique addresses on the chain. The terms in

    the contract are converted into code that gets in-

    voked automatically in case of contract violation.

    SCs identify frauds and malicious attempts in the

    Figure 4. BC-based transactions.

    system, thereby increasing security. The results are

    deterministic and have high accuracy. SCs are in-

    voked independently and autonomously, mitigating

    the transaction costs by reducing human interference.

    Many BC communities are integrating interfaces for

    SCs, e.g., Ethereum provides a platform for writing

    SCs, written in a Turing complete language called

    Solidity [38].

    5. Related Surveys:

    IoT security is a vast domain, and many research and

    survey papers are available in the literature spanning various

    security aspects such as data encryption, intrusion detection,

    active attacks, passive attacks, device authentication, AC

    mechanisms, and channel security. AI and ML have comple-

    mented IoT security in recent times by providing improved

    real-time detection rates and attack detection accuracy. BC

    is a very recent addition to IoT security. BC addition to

    IoT is an up-and-coming solution to augment the pace

    of futuristic secure IoT networks. Due to the vastness of

    the domain and applicability beyond security, exhaustive

    survey papers are not available. Table II presents the recent

    (2019-2022) surveys available in the literature for BC-IoT

    integration. The surveys have been broadly classified into

    BC-based IoT Security, BC-based CMs for IoT, BC-IoT

    applications, BC-ML for IoT, and BC-EC integration. The

    focal points of each survey have been highlighted.

    6. Blockchain as a key enabling technology in IoT

    IoT is the focal point of enabling the pervasive inter-

    connection of virtual and physical objects that have sped

    up data sharing and collection. This capability makes IoT

    one of the essential architectures for providing services in

    various fields. This section discusses BC as a key enabling

    technology for IoT and the technologies that drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in IoT.

    1)

    Addition of BC features: BCT offers unique char-

    acteristics such as auditing capability, traceability,

    immutability, interoperability, accessibility, and ac-

    countability, which are imparted in IoT systems

    with its adoption. The IoT data streams from di-

    verse, heterogeneous environments are transformed

    into uniform coding. BC enables IoT and physical

    systems to collaborate through uniform access, fa-

    cilitating cross-domain interactions [77]. BCs enable

    fine-grained access mechanisms and SCs to prevent

    unauthorized access making the systems open to

    interactions from other physical systems. Further, BC

    has a 160-bit address space higher than IPV6, aiding

    it to be more scalable. The IoT data is stored as

    transactions permanently in an immutable fashion on

    the network. Every transaction initiated by a node is

    associated with the corresponding information. Any

    misbehavior or fraud can be traced back to the user

    imparting the audit capacity in the system, which can

    highly complement IoT verticals [65].

    2)

    5G and 6G enabled Industrial IoT: The advance-

    ments in faster communication networks are revolu-

    tionizing network services and making IoT systems

    faster. B5G technologies are key facilitators in inno-

    vating futuristic open access with low cross-domain

    barriers. The B5G systems need efficient communi-

    cation mechanisms with enhanced security, robust-

    ness, privacy preservation, and improved mobility.

    5Gs employ network slice brokers to enable media-

    tion between vertical service and resource providers.

    BC can operate independently in slices enabling

    secure and anonymous transactions [4], [78]. 5G ap-

    plications such as 5G-powered drones need security

    and enhanced privacy [79]. Various BC-based solu-

    tions have been presented for securing B5G and 6G

    systems. In [80], the authors present a BC sidechain-

    based decentralized hierarchical scheme for 5G to

    provide secure communication and authentication.

    The authentication is done at the edge of the network

    to reduce latency. In [81], the authors propose a BC-

    enabled clustered architecture for validating blocks

    in IoTs for B5G applications.

    3)

    Enhanced automation with SC applicability: With

    the help of SCs, BC is imparted with decision-

    making capabilities that drastically reduce human

    effort, and the applicability of IoT systems is in-

    creased [82]. The transactional clauses of SCs are

    digitized and tamper-resistant and cannot be mod-

    ified. SCs eliminate the need for an intermediator,

    minimizing management costs. SCs detect breaches

    and misbehavior in the system and automatically

    take decisions depending on the clauses pre-agreed

    upon by the system’s stakeholders. The decisions

    have higher accuracy and reliability and improve

    the overall security and efficiency of the system.

    SCs make distributed access decisions to enable

    legitimate users to query the BC and work better with

    data-driven interactions. SCs are deterministic and

    autonomous, thereby accelerating the inception of

    Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs). In

    IoT systems, SCs facilitate flexible AC, secure DM,

    prevent DDoS attacks, and provide secure identity

    management, strengthening security further.

    The three primary driving forces for BC-IoT adoption

    are:

    1)

    Edge computing: EC is a major driver for IIoT, and

    the integration of BCT into edge provides enhanced

    reliability, privacy, data integrity, reliable AC, and

    automated resource allocation. Conversely, the edge

    networks provide computational, storage, and side

    chain-based consensus facilities to IoT devices [70].

    Due to the constrained nature of IoT end-devices,

    they communicate data to the edge where the mod-

    erately intensive CMs and functions are done. The

    nodes store partial data such as time-stamp informa-

    tion to validate the authenticity of the other nodes.

    At the same time, the complex functions, strong

    CMs, and high storage requirements are offloaded

    to the edge. Various architectures have been present

    for BC-based edge computing. In [83], the authors

    propose a mobile BC-assisted IoT application con-

    sisting of Small cell base stations with mobile edge

    computing (MEC) deployed at them. In [84], the

    authors present a prototype for BC-based EC for

    mining and edge resource management for mobile

    BC. In [85], the authors present a DPoS based double

    auction cross-server edge resource allocation frame-

    work for mobile EC. BC functionality can be further

    extended for network management by designing BC-

    based Software-defined networks [32].

    2)

    Integration with ML: BCs provide secure data

    storage, and the outputs can detect anomalies in

    IoT systems [86]. The integration of ML and BCT

    in IoT can enable various tasks such as - secure

    storage of correct data, monetization of ML skill set

    through SCs, feeding correct data into algorithms,

    creation of better learning models through incentive-

    based competitive modeling, Making BCs secure

    from attacks, enabling automated signing of BC

    systems [71], [87], [88], [89]. In [90], the authors

    proposed a BC-assisted collective learning method

    to guide the secure exchange of learning results

    at the IoT edge. The model employs BC on the

    top of the edge devices where the nodes securely

    share learning results using BC-assisted collective

    3)

    IPFS powered BC for IoT: In critical IoT sys-

    tems, distributing data in a tamper-proof and trace-

    able manner is necessary. BCs provide the service,

    but they work inefficiently while handling big data

    considering the transactional processing limitations.

    IPFS can complement BC and provide a secure

    storage mechanism for IoT data. IPFS is a content-

    addressable, p2p version-controlled file system that

    can assist the formation of a decentralized IoT

    system [91]. IPFS, based on cryptographic hashes,

    is a potential alternative to address BC big data

    issues. BC is duplicated on multiple nodes; thus,

    most storage spaces are required without immediate

    use, particularly if the node operator does not need

    to examine every file saved on BC. With IPFS, BC

    only saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down

    the chain development drastically because hashes

    are typically less than the data they represent. For

    example, if SHA256 is employed, the on-chain stor-

    age required for a file of any size is lowered to 32

    bytes [92]. For any modifications in the content, the

    hash value changes each time. The authors of [93]

    offer a decentralized IIoT data management system

    based on BC and IPFS. The authors of [94] propose

    a network architecture that uses BCand IPFS to

    provide IoT data privacy. SCs perform AC in the

    proposed “modular consortium” architecture while

    also providing accountability for data owners and

    third parties to whom users grant access.

    7. Blockchain Integrated IoT systems.

    IoT aims to design a distributed system offering scalabil-

    ity, security, privacy, reliability, real-time data delivery, and

    high adaptability. With the rapid advancements in B5G, IoT

    systems are becoming faster, expanding over longer ranges,

    and requiring enhanced security solutions. BC has distin-

    guished intrinsic features of non-intermediation, immutabil-

    ity, data transparency, and tamper-resilience, which mitigate

    security concerns in an untrusted cross-domain open envi-

    ronment. BCs are envisioned as the future of open-access

    systems requiring distributed storage, efficient data and

    resource management, secure KM, and AC mechanisms. By

    design, a BC-based architecture can ensure confidentiality,

    integrity, availability, user control, and authorization in any

    system [95]. The integration of BC into IoT offers increased

    data trust, imparts verifiability, eliminates intermediation,

    provides transparency, and increases user control of the

    user data in the systems. IoT and BC’s collaboration can

    resolve the issues of data organization, data maintenance,

    communication security, intra-domain collaboration, and

    privacy in IoT. We shall refer to such systems as BC

    integrated IoT (BIIT) systems throughout the rest of the

    paper.

    A. Technicalities of Blockchain IoT integration:

    The world is moving towards becoming “smart” with

    IoT technology, necessitating more attention to data security

    and privacy concerns. IoT security solutions are typically

    complicated due to a lack of safe hardware and software

    design, development, limited resources, and established

    standards. Furthermore, the diversity of resources available

    in the IoT has hampered efforts to develop a comprehensive

    global strategy for protecting IoT systems at all levels. The

    main challenge is data management and securely providing

    services without compromising the privacy of the underly-

    ing personal information. One of the IoT security solutions

    is to develop a fine-tuned AC mechanism for data protection

    and privacy by ensuring that only authorized and authen-

    ticated users may access data. However, this is hindered

    by the vastness of the connected devices. Furthermore, the

    traffic created by the massive amount of data generated by

    these devices makes satisfying quality-of-service standards

    difficult. loT devices have low storage, computation power,

    and bandwidth restrictions.

    With all of the interactions between people, data, and

    devices, IoT promises direct connectivity between devices

    and data interchange. In the IoT economy, sensors and

    devices should be able to conduct monetary transactions

    in exchange for services without the involvement of a third

    party. With the introduction of the 5G network, transactions

    and exchanges will predominantly occur over the internet

    Figure 5. Interaction between IoT and Blockchain

    network, which billing and payment systems must account

    for. However, financial institutions can still not receive

    real-time information on pledged assets due to ineffective

    management for accessing, sharing, and analyzing asset

    information across stakeholders. There are no chattel asset

    tracking and monitoring systems capable of validating and

    quantifying chattel assets pledged for loans.

    BCT has the capability of bringing reforms in these sectors

    as it enables safe, immutable, and anonymous transactions

    using a decentralized distributed ledger system. BC-enabled

    loT systems can monitor and track chattel assets in transit

    or warehouses in real-time. The combined approach aids

    in the resolution and avoidance of unnecessary risks in

    the financial industry. Some attacks on loT systems can be

    addressed using BCT. BC research as a security mechanism

    has resulted in various transformative benefits that were

    previously unattainable or unavailable. Figure 5 depicts the

    interaction between IoT devices and BC platforms.

    Figure 6 illustrates a simple BC-based security level

    evaluation mechanism for IoT. The authors of [96] illustrate

    the steps involved in an IoT network based on BC. First,

    IoT device manufacturers pre-verify software that is loaded

    on IoT devices and create the whitelist. A SC is produced

    by combining a manufacturer’s whitelist and the agent’s

    initial agent hash value(IAHV) installed in an IoT device.

    IoT device manufacturers can access SCs via decentralized

    applications or internally through an Application Program-

    ming Interface(API). IoT device manufacturers use SCs to

    update the White List. Manufacturers use the whitelist SC

    to record the whitelist and IAHV of the agent installed in an

    IoT device in the BC. By inquiring about the information

    recorded in the BC via the whitelist SC, the IoT device

    can verify that the agent’s IAHV matches the device agent

    hash value of the installed agent. It validates that the agent

    has not been forged or fabricated by comparing it to the

    agent hash value stored in the BC; as a result, the security

    evaluation process of IoT devices via the agent may be

    trusted. The IoT device’s agent checks to see whether any

    Figure 6. A simple BC-based security level evaluation mechanism

    for IoT.

    untrusted programs have been installed. The agent evaluates

    the security status of the IoT device and transmits it to

    the scoring SC. Manufacturers receive rewards in return for

    updating the whitelist SC.

    1) Recent proposed architectures:

    Two main features of the BCT include Trust and De-

    centralization [97], [98], [99]. By design, the data on a BC

    is secure and tamper-resistant, making it a key disruptor for

    IoT. BCs can be utilized to improve IoT in the following

    ways:

    1)

    Impart data integrity: The nodes in the BC have iden-

    tical copies of the ledger. When transactions occur,

    all network members are responsible for validating

    them, and once verified and stored in the ledger, the

    transaction cannot be manipulated or removed.

    2)

    More Addressing space than IPV6: BC addresses are

    160 bits long, while IPV6 addresses are 128 bits.

    When compared to IPV6, BC has higher addressing

    space (4.3 billion addresses).

    3)

    Trusted accountability: Every operation is docu-

    mented in the ledger; thus, it is possible to identify

    and trace all operations.

    4)

    Fault tolerance: Decentralized systems rely on mul-

    tiple separate components; they are more fault-

    tolerant. Because of the point-to-point decentralized

    structure, BC has no single node failure concern.

    5)

    Eliminating third-party liabilities: BC runs without

    third-party intermediaries and is free of any risks or

    dangers posed by third parties.

    The decentralized. peer-to-peer architecture is the most no-

    table characteristic of BCT. The distributed ledger contains

    Figure 7. Overview of Blockchain –based IoT architecture

    all transactions, and all network members must agree to

    approve the transaction. This feature enables the imple-

    mentation of end-to-end traceability. Data provenance was

    previously difficult to obtain, but it is now a possibility

    with the BCT’s distributed ledger option. Owing to these

    benefits, many BC-based architectures have been proposed

    for IoT; an overview of the same is provided in Figure 7.

    The authors of [100] propose the solutions to overcome

    the centralized solutions and security measures in IoT.

    The data-driven decentralized mechanism is used, which

    provides energy-efficient solutions for detecting attacks on

    the IoT-based Sensor Networks. In [101], the authors aim

    to facilitate the data searching and extraction of public and

    private BCs deployed at the MEC server of the 5G MEC

    smart grid. IoT device identifier is built as a BC explorer.

    In [102], the vulnerability of the massive data produced in

    IoT networks for smart transportation is solved by the BC

    and IoT, which provide a decentralized data management

    system. In [103], the authors propose using the Identity

    Based Encryption (IBE) algorithm to enhance health care

    data security.The BC-based IoT architecture uses IBE to

    provide enhanced security. In [104], the authors address

    the privacy, security, and scalability issues in a centralized

    system for IoT and resolve them with a lightweight archi-

    tecture for BC-based identity management. In [105], Mobile

    edge-cloud computation offloading is used in delay-sensitive

    IoT applications. An effective, trustworthy access control

    mechanism is introduced, which involves an advanced deep

    reinforcement learning algorithm using a double dueling

    Q-network. The work in [106] proposed using BC, SCs,

    and IoT devices to integrate different kinds of IoT devices

    in pre and post-harvesting agriculture segments. This work

    in [107] proposes the integration of the Software-Defined

    Network with the BC system. A BC-based architecture is

    used for proposing the new routing protocol witty cluster

    structure for the IoT networks.

    B. Tradeoffs in Consensus mechanisms for IoT suitability

    BIIT systems:

    Consensus is the principal mechanism that makes the

    BCs secure by design. A CM governs the rules that pivot

    on the network’s nodes to agree on the ledger’s true state.

    Consensus achieves trust in a heterogeneous, uncontrolled

    environment by providing a mechanism to validate the data

    communicated by the nodes in the network. CMs eliminate

    the central authority, validate the data communicated by

    the nodes in the network, establish trust among nodes and

    ensure a system state agreed upon by the network members.

    With the increase in BC-based applications, various CMs

    have been proposed and adopted by systems, but their adop-

    tion is met with challenges. The choice of the consensus

    algorithm significantly affects the network’s performance,

    and there exists a tradeoff between scalability, energy

    consumption, bandwidth requirement, network overheads,

    computation overheads, security, privacy, and latency.

    The robustness of a BC-based system is highly dependent

    on its underlying CM. The security provided by a CM

    is directly proportional to computational and bandwidth

    requirements, as is the case with PoW. IoT’s computational

    and communication abilities are bound by constrained re-

    sources; thus, applying a generic CM in IoT is difficult.

    Inter-domain cross consensus poses additional challenges

    [108]. Over the past few years, CMs have been customized

    particularly for LW environments. Since IoT networks are

    constrained, the CMs have been modified over the last

    few years to increase their suitability in LW networks.

    This, however, comes at the cost of compromising security

    and other factors. CMs with strong fault tolerance and

    immunity to attacks require the computation of intensive

    hash operations that consume energy, bandwidth, and other

    resources. CMs that work on low power do so at the cost of

    decreasing the network’s size or moderately compromising

    data integrity. An ideal CM for IoT would ensure increased

    decentralization, adversity tolerance, scalability, throughput,

    and decreased latency, energy consumption, storage, com-

    putation, and network overheads.

    A comparative study of the existing CMs in light of IoT

    goals is presented in Table III [109], [58], [55], [53] and

    [60]. The values High, Moderate, and Low under different

    columns(to different methods) are assigned based on dif-

    ferent criteria. For the energy consumption, computational

    resource requirements, storage overheads, and Throughput,

    the values are assigned bydirect comparison with PoW

    and IoT suitability. The numerical criteria for assigning

    latency values is Block creation time. For example, the

    block creation time in PoW is approximately 10 minutes,

    while it is only 4 minutes in PoC. Although the time is

    considerably lower than PoW, it is still not suitable for

    real-time IoT environments, and compared to other CMs

    that take only seconds, the time taken by PoC is high.

    Thus, the value “Moderate” has been assigned based on

    the combined criteria. DPoS can process 100,000 TPS, and

    the block is added in under 3 seconds to the chain, which

    is still not suitable for real-time IoT systems that require a

    block creation time of the order of milliseconds.

    While designing a new consensus algorithm for an LW

    system, the following tradeoffs need to be considered:

    1)

    Security and Computational requirements: Strong

    cryptographic methods provide high security and

    decentralization to the system, and improve data

    integrity and confidentiality but are computationally

    intensive and require high power systems for imple-

    mentation.

    2)

    Privacy and Latency: To achieve privacy, the adopted

    system should be free of a central authority, and

    the consensus should be achieved in a p2p fashion.

    However, private chains are adopted by systems that

    encourage centralization to decrease the system’s

    latency, thereby increasing privacy concerns.

    3)

    Convergence rate and Adversity tolerance: The con-

    vergence of the algorithm affects the adversity tol-

    erance of the network. For IoT real-time systems,

    for the consensus to converge faster, the number of

    nodes involved in consensus is decreased, making it

    easy to compromise the network and decreasing the

    system’s fault tolerance.

    4)

    Latency and Scalability: For cross-domain access,

    the number of validations to perform transactions in-

    creases, increasing the network overhead. To reduce

    latency in real-time applications, the number of the

    communicating nodes needs to be capped.

    5)

    Throughput and Scalability: As the network size

    increases, simultaneous communication attempts to

    access resources and Block addition increase con-

    siderably. This affects the system’s throughput sig-

    nificantly as more nodes access the limited resources

    of the system

    1) BIIT suitable Consensus mechanisms and Blockchain

    platforms:

    1)

    Hyperlegder Fabric with PBFT: Hyperledger fab-

    ric has a modular architecture and can create private

    chains. The system’s latency is less but is associated

    with significant network overhead, suitable for small

    private networks, limiting the network’s scalability.

    Hyperledger fabric is suited for private networks,

    works on PBFT, and has a pluggable CM. To achieve

    consensus, the majority of the nodes must agree

    on the block addition. For writing SCs, the frame-

    work supports the “Go” language and “Chaincode”

    [135]. The framework provides data confidentiality,

    efficient processing, and identity management and is

    suitable for low-scale IoT implementation.

    2)

    Hyperledger Sawtooth with PoET: Designed by

    Intel, this framework is suitable for low-powered

    systems. The nodes solve a hash problem, and

    the winning node is chosen randomly on a ran-

    dom waiting time using Intel’s softguard extension.

    The contracts on Sawtooth can be written in any

    language, and various CMs can be plugged into

    the same chain [136]. It usually employs PoET,

    which offers low computational requirements, High

    ization. Hyper ledger Sawtooth platform is suitable

    for permissioned and permissionless BCs and pro-

    vides features such as live data streams suited for

    IoT environments. The framework, however, suffers

    from Security and Privacy issues.

    3)

    IoTa with Tangle: Tangle is a distributed communi-

    cation protocol that does not work on transaction fees

    suitable for IoT. Tangle enables a parallel transaction

    verification mechanism which decreases the conver-

    gence time and reduces latency in the system. How-

    ever, the framework suffers from storage and security

    problems and is prone to centralization. IoTa uses

    DAG, which minimizes the system’s network and

    transaction overhead [132]. The latency is low and

    has been specifically designed for IoT applications.

    Iota enables high throughput but does not support

    SCs and suffers from privacy issues.

    C. Security architecture of BIIT systems

    BCT is evolving as a key paradigm in addressing these

    issues of IoT. In BIIT systems, BC is added at the security

    level and works on a distributed consensus scheme where

    each IoT transaction is verified, and every message can be

    traced to the origin. BIIT systems work in a p2p distributed

    manner, and each entry is time-stamped. The data blocks

    are integrated using cryptographic hashes, and the Merkle

    tree stores all atomic transactions. The tree’s root hash is

    verified to secure all the transactions underlying it.

    To understand the BIIT system’s security mechanism, the

    Hyperledger fabric for IoT BC security architecture has

    been considered, consisting of five levels: [137]

    1)

    Perception layer: The IoT node layer collects the

    data from heterogeneous environments and is pre-

    processed, transformed, and stored on BCs.

    2)

    Network Layer: All nodes are given equal priority

    and transmit the data. Each node contains the data

    authentication protocol information and block net-

    work mode.

    3)

    Consensus layer: The layer works on the PBFT

    algorithm, suitable for constrained IoT environments

    because of less energy consumption and lower com-

    putational overhead.

    4)

    Smart Contract Layer: The SC layer stores contracts,

    incentive mechanisms, and other scripts. SCs are set

    up in the certification authority.

    5)

    Application Layer: The layer is responsible for col-

    lecting, storing, verifying, and processing the data

    blocks. The IoT application interface enforces the

    node transaction process and provides AC services.

    Mechanism: The devices are registered and granted AC

    rights which are defined in the SC. Various sensing devices

    collect data of various types and in varying formats. This

    data is pre-processed, and preliminary information is ex-

    tracted through a hash function and asymmetric encryption.

    The heterogeneity is removed by transforming the data into

    a fixed-length base to keep a uniform format. The data is

    time-stamped, stored in a block, and broadcasted to the

    whole network. The gateway nodes hash the data, storing

    the table in the block. The time-stamp archives the key

    block information such as the source, and digital signature,

    which imparts traceability. Any node can act as a miner to

    carry out authentication. A block node validates the received

    data according to the data structure, source, time-stamp,

    and other information. The data from a legitimate source is

    added in chronological order, and the transmission from

    a malicious node is restricted. The data is stored in an

    immutable fashion on the chain.The IoT transactions are

    verified using a PBFT consensus algorithm, ensuring that

    no false data is stored on the system. The SCs are triggered

    in case of an event, and the contract clauses are invoked to

    handle the misbehavior by one or more nodes. SCs enable

    cross-domain interoperability by implementing scripts for

    various states. The SCs also eliminate human/third-party

    intervention for invoking the rules in case of a malicious

    attempt. At the top, application services are provided, and

    access rules for cross-domain interactions are maintained.

    The architecture has five prime advantages-Improved secu-

    rity, increased cross-domain interoperability, data integrity,

    data traceability, and automated decision making.

    8. BIIT systems and IoT Security tasks

    More and more devices are being connected in the

    IoT application domains with advancements in sensing and

    actuating technologies. Verifying the legitimacy of the com-

    ponents for secure communication, authentication schemes,

    and secure routing protocols (RP) are essential criteria in

    IoT sensor networking. In Table IV, the literature study of

    the recently proposed security architectures of BIIT systems

    has been summarized vis-`a-vis security tasks identified in

    Section 3.3.

    A. Primary Study of the BC Solutions:

    In [138], the authors propose a BC-based distributed KM

    scalable architecture with fine-grained auditing capability

    for hierarchical AC. The architecture consists of 3 main

    components- A device layer containing the CPS devices,

    a BCT-based security access manager (SAM) network at

    the fog layer, and multiple BC networks on the cloud

    for KM. The user keys are secured and not under the

    control of a key generation center, and the information

    is instead stored on the SAMs, which act as the miners

    on the chain employing a PoW consensus algorithm. The

    information is offloaded to a BC-based cloud for access

    across multiple domains and reduces the blocks’ burden.

    The cross-domain operations are allowed after the cloud

    manager verifies it and sends it to the SAM. In the case of

    frequent accesses, the information is stored in the BC with

    the same deployment domain. The target difficulty in the

    model is 17 bits for a SAM device, and the average time

    consumption decreases with transaction collection time (Tc)

    with the assumption that there are enough power resources

    to carry out the verifications. The performance evaluation of

    the model for cross-domain operations shows that the time

    consumption in carrying them out is the same during each ½

    Tc period. The architecture provides fine-grained auditing,

    but its performance evaluation runs on various assumptions,

    such as that all the management domains have the same

    number of user equipment. The mining is done after the

    propagation procedure ends, and the SAMs have the same

    transmissibility to propagate transactions and mining time.

    In [139], the authors propose a theoretical architecture for

    BC-based AC mechanisms with enhanced trust mechanisms

    and increased portability. The architecture consists of 3

    prime layers- Resource layer (RL), BC layer (BL), and

    Application layer (AL). The model aims to formulate an

    AC mechanism for defending against attacks in an untrusted

    environment. The model adopts the PBFT algorithm for

    consensus, an endorser makes endorsements for the trans-

    action, and a transaction handler executes the chain codes.

    Users communicate with ALs through a client application

    for registration and requesting AC. BL is at the core and

    is deployed on every component in the private network.

    It consists of 3 components – web controller, transaction

    handler, and ledger. All the actions such as identity creation,

    executing access protocol creation, and resource creation

    happen in the BC. All the requests are saved in the BC in an

    immutable and non-resistant manner. The model’s security

    analysis shows resistance to AC message tampering until at

    least 1/3 nodes of the network is not compromised. The

    model is suitable only for the low-scale implementation

    and is compromised if the network complexity increases,

    creating latency and storage problems.

    In [140], the authors propose a BC-based AC mechanism

    for verifying IoT end-points and providing access tokens

    for querying resources. The architecture is gateway-based,

    where IoT devices communicate with the gateway instead

    of the internet, and conversely, any communication to

    IoT devices goes via gateways. The gateway serves four

    purposes- protocol bridge, AC, secure communication, and

    proxy BC. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) act as the

    gateway approver, vendor device authentication is done by

    the vendors, and the gateway acts as an authorization server.

    The AC state is distributed across all nodes and stored on

    the SCs. A trusted administrator does the SC deployment,

    and signing of ISPs and vendors. The AC is carried out in a

    few stages- gateway authentication done by an ISP, vendor

    authentication of devices by the owner under each domain,

    and the gateway handles outside requests by verifying and

    granting access requests. The outside requestors need to

    build secure channels with gateways before communicating

    to IoT for access. The ISPs are discredited in case of

    untrusted behavior, and the domain owner has complete

    control over the requests coming through the gateway. The

    model is evaluated over trust, security, and performance.

    The security analysis shows that the attacks can happen

    if the attacker leverages massive computational resources,

    which are costly or compromise the approvers, mitigated by

    using a certification authority for vendors. The architecture

    is centralized and needs a trusted intermediary. The authors

    argue that IoT systems cannot be entirely decentralized and

    employ trusted approvers for authenticating end-points. The

    architecture relies on ISPs to route traffic carrying security

    verifications, while BC provides validation.

    In [141], the authors propose an SC-based data sharing and

    AC mechanism for end-point communication in IoT devices

    to resolve trust issues. The proposed system consists of

    SCs for DM in an untrusted environment. Three SCs are

    used – Access control contract (ACC), Register Contract

    (RC), and Judge Contract (JC). ACC maintains the AC for

    any requester and oversees the overall communication AC

    and data sharing between IoT devices. RC is responsible

    for the authentication of requests and registers them. The

    behavioral analysis is done by JC, which checks the node

    for misconduct and generates alert messages. An ACC

    is invoked when an AC request is sent, and the request

    is forwarded based on the access permission level. After

    objects accomplish the request, the corresponding transac-

    tion is stored on the chain. The security analysis shows

    that the proposed system is open access and secure, and

    the trustworthiness is maintained throughout using SCs.

    The model is evaluated against cost and shows that ACC

    consumes more execution and transaction energy than other

    SCs.

    In [142], the authors propose a BC-based AC mecha-

    nism with secure delegation services, an integrated BCT

    network for eliminating a central delegation service, and

    event and query-based services. The device is assigned

    to a private group, and subsequent permissions are given

    through a delegation mechanism performed by a BC. The

    architecture consists of low-powered IoT devices, powered

    user devices with computation and storage capacity, an

    application manager for user interface and registration, an

    IoT manager for data filtering and query management, a BC

    Manager (BCM) for SCs and AC management. The BCM

    registers the IoT devices and deploys an SC for each device.

    BCM allows delegates to activate or deny the permission

    stored in the SC. The SC stores devices’ platform hashes

    and delegation policies. The BC miners verify before any

    permission activation. The proposed model is for private

    networks for increased throughput and reduced latency, but

    the model cannot be replicated on large-scale IoT systems

    without affecting the network performance.

    In [143], the authors propose a BC-based privacy-preserving

    and rewarding private data sharing scheme, a BC-based

    incentive mechanism for private data exchange.The data

    owner publishes private data and receives a payment anony-

    mously in the BC, while data consumers obtain licenses

    anonymously through SCs, where licensing technology en-

    sures access control for multi-sharing. The authors leverage

    Monero technology to ensure the untraceability and un-

    linkability of DUs while getting private data, ensuring that

    no one can develop a dat user behavior profile database.

    The authors incorporate the non-frameability characteristic

    into the anonymous incentive data sharing scheme. Honest

    data consumers can refute the frame up using a deniable

    ring signature without revealing their genuine identity. The

    authors present the security model, provide the formal secu-

    rity proof using the random oracle model, and demonstrate

    the model’s feasibility in real-time IoT architectures. The

    authors have proved the effectiveness of their technique and

    compared it to various undeniable ring signature schemes.

    The results reveal that the computational cost increases

    linearly as the number of ring members increases.

    In [144], the authors propose an efficient BC-assisted secure

    cross-domain device authentication mechanism, inducing

    inter-domain trust and privacy in IIoT applications. Identity-

    based signatures induce authentication in this mechanism,

    and privacy is induced by designing the identity manage-

    ment mechanism. The cross-domain authentication privacy

    perseverance also introduces a key negotiation mechanism

    to prevent eavesdropping on the insecure channel by negoti-

    ating session keys. The architecture consists of four layers.-

    Entity layer(EL), Agent layer(AL), BC Layer (BCL), and

    Storage Layer(SL). EL consists of a key generation center

    (KGC) and IIoT devices. KGC is responsible for the gener-

    ation of private keys for IIoT devices. AL consists of the BC

    Agent Server (BAS)and Authentication Agent Server(AAS).

    The model employs three types of authentication- Unilateral

    authentication, where users authenticate a device, Mutual

    authentication, where two devices authenticate each other;

    and cross-domain authentication, carried by KGC, BAS, and

    AAS. The domain-specific information is encapsulated into

    the consortium BC node in transactions and is acquired

    by other domains for authentication. The authentication

    agent server executes signature generation and verification

    operations on behalf of requesting devices. With an increase

    in the number of endorsing and validating nodes, the BC

    consensus time increases, introducing latency in the system.

    In [145], the authors proposed an out-of-band two-factor

    authentication scheme to prevent impersonation attacks on

    large-scale IoT devices using “device relationship” and

    BCT. The out of band performs the secondary authentication

    to distinguish home IoT devices from the malicious IoT de-

    vices. There are four components of the said authentication

    scheme- Authentication Subject(AS), which is any device

    that wants access to resources, Related Device(RD) that

    performs secondary authentication, BC that stores the ‘Re-

    lationship information’ for every authentication subject with

    the related device and Authentication Executor (AE) which

    coordinates the two factors out of band authentication. A

    relationship contract stores the mapping of AS address

    to ‘Relationship data’. When an AS requests access, AE

    retrieves the corresponding information from the BC, selects

    the RD in the AS neighborhood, and sends the correspond-

    ing action sequence. The corresponding RD invokes SC to

    send the verification result to BC, and finally, AE checks

    BC for verification results utilizing SC. The model has not

    been implemented on commercial IoT devices due to close-

    sourced hardware and software, and there are considerable

    CPU and memory overheads in the authentication stage.

    In [146], the authors propose a BC-based authentication

    mechanism for the low-power sensor nodes that are part

    of p2p networking using the sequence number of sensor

    nodes. This paper proposes verification through SHA 64-

    bit hash function to confirm confidentiality and integrity

    without compromising performance. The sink node(SN)

    assigns the sequence numbers by a broadcast-response-

    based mechanism for registering legitimate devices. The SN

    keeps a record of the other node’s identity in the form of the

    Ids, sequence number, and hash value; therefore, the sink

    detects a malicious node by verifying the sequence number

    and the hash value. A mutual level node authentication

    model is used where a node and its sequence number store

    all other nodes’ sequence numbers. The node identifies the

    particular node for communication, compares the corre-

    sponding sequence number, and verifies the message by

    comparing the transmitted hash value. Thus neighbors’ hash

    function detects a malicious node and secures the model

    from impersonation. However, as the network complex-

    ity increases, the sink node has to store many sequence

    numbers. Further, the sink node acts as a point of failure,

    and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow other

    malicious nodes to transmit the messages.

    In [147], the authors propose an authorization and au-

    thentication mechanism for LW IoT devices that improve

    the IoT network’s performance. The proposed mechanism

    is based on the public BC mechanism and uses a fog

    computing network to achieve the desired task. The system

    architecture is divided into two layers: the device layer

    and the fog layer. The device layer consists of the many

    low-powered and low computational devices responsible for

    generating the data in the network. The IoT devices can

    116

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    be grouped depending upon the customized functionality

    they perform. The fog nodes in a particular group perform

    the same functionality. On the other hand, the fog layer

    is a BC-enabled fog device connected to the internet for

    working together. The fog nodes perform the CM execution

    to validate the transactions and create the blocks. The

    mechanism proposes three phases -The initialization phase

    consists of registering the system and devices with the

    closest BC-enabled fog nodes. The device authentication

    phase involves authenticating the devices with the BC-

    enabled fog node by mapping the system ID, device ID, and

    public address. Device-to-device communication involves

    the secure transmission of the message between the same

    system’s fog nodes or different systems. Before the device-

    to-device communication, both the devices are authenticated

    by the BC-enabled fog node. After that, a block is created

    in the BC, and subsequently, a secure channel is established

    between the devices. However, this mechanism assumes that

    fog nodes and admin are trusted and that communication

    between fog devices and nodes is secure.

    In [148], the authors propose a node authentication model

    for the IoST(Internet of Sensor Things) based on the BC

    mechanism. The base station validates any node’s creden-

    tials whenever it performs any action in the network.The

    authors have employed identity authentication with PoA

    as the consensus approach to reduce computational costs.

    The miners are pre-selected, and following the authenti-

    cation request, the registered nodes are authenticated.The

    request contains IDNode(Node ID), MACAddrNode(MAC

    address), and ReputationNode(the reputation value assigned

    to a certain node based on its previous history in the

    network ), which are already stored on the BC. The au-

    thentication is carried out by comparing the credentials of

    nodes previously stored in the BC. The BC determines

    whether or not the credentials provided by nodes match

    the credentials currently stored in the BC. If the credentials

    match the information provided, the nodes are authenticated

    and broadcast as legitimate nodes. A SC is deployed on the

    base stations that track all the network transactions. The

    system model is predicated on two assumptions: Firstly,

    base stations are accepted as legitimate and provide secure

    services to consumers, and secondly, symmetric keys are

    securely transferred in the network.

    that

    inter-

    face with Ethereum SCs to authenticate users to access

    IoT devices.The major stakeholders include Administra-

    tors(responsible for controlling access permissions for IoT

    devices), End users(interested in requesting an IoT de-

    vice service), Fog nodes(for localized storage), and cloud

    servers(storing IoT data), all having direct access to SCs via

    an Ethereum client in the case of fog and cloud nodes, or via

    a front-end application/wallet in the case of administrators

    and end-users. IoT devices have unique Ethereum addresses

    (with public and private keys), but they lack connectivity

    and do not interact with SCs. The system interactions

    are divided into off-chain and on-chain. In the on-chain

    interactions, the admin constructs the SCs, registers the

    IoT devices, maps them to a fog node, and may grant

    end-users access to certain IoT devices. The SCs check

    the list of authorized users, and the user receives a SC

    acceptance token which it uses to authenticate itself off-

    chain. The authors have provided the security analysis of

    the architecture,but the cost analysis of utilizing Ethereum-

    based SCs is unaccounted for.

    In [150], propose a decentralized BC-based architecture

    with SCs to allow edge computing nodes to store IoT

    data and securely interact with one another.The archi-

    tecture is composed of 4 layers- Information aggrega-

    tion layer(consisting of IoT-like devices), Edge computing

    layer(consisting of edge devices with fair computation capa-

    bilities), Service supporting layer(responsible for provision

    of services), and Application layer.The collaboration with

    other edge computing nodes must first be certified by the

    edge computing nodes, which will result in the exchange of

    MicroCoins(introduced cryptocurrency) between members.

    The model uses a publish-subscribe mode, allowing users

    to access data across domains. The users or application

    developers first subscribe to the data publisher from the

    edge computing node pool for data exchange. The data

    publisher then supplies the subscription data and submits

    a transaction to the BC-enabled SC to manage the pre-set

    business model while providing the required data. The au-

    thors introduce a new CM called Proof-of-Edge computing

    to reach consensus among all edge computing nodes and

    avoid centralization. All corresponding operations must be

    documented in BC to obtain self and other domain audits.

    In [151], the authors propose integrating Network Function

    Virtualization(NFV), software-defined network(SDN), and

    BC to create a flexible and reliable routing architecture

    for IIoT. SDN and NFV are responsible for creating pro-

    grammable forwarding devices that create the network’s

    optimal routing policies. The controllers are secured using

    BCT and take decisions and collect the data from the

    nodes to detect mistrust. A secure path is acquired by

    adequately removing the malicious node from the IIoT

    network by periodic monitoring and collecting network

    data. Each controller has a distributed ledger, and malicious

    nodes are identified by calculating the network’s trust value

    during behavior authentication stored in the BCs. The

    synchronization reaches a consensus among various ledgers

    transmitted through a control channel. Different controllers

    handle routing requests through an access point. The exper-

    imental evaluation shows that the model outperforms the

    state-of-the-art systems in average delay over attacks and

    packet loss rate. However, the frequent calculations of trust

    values lead to substantial computational power, bringing

    overheads in the system, which must be addressed without

    compromising the model’s security.

    In [152], the authors propose a routing protocol for the

    wireless sensor network that uses BCT to make routing

    more efficient and secure. The nodes present in the network

    are treated as the coins, and the routing path for the message

    is treated as the transaction, which is subsequently added to

    the BC. Initially, all the nodes are owned by the sink and

    considered inactive, and the rest are active. When an event

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    117

    occurs, the nodes access the BC to find the optimal path to

    the sink. Dijkstra’s algorithm obtains the message’s optimal

    path by a cost function determined by signal and interfer-

    ence. This optimal path is the transaction to be added to the

    BC and transmit the message after eliminating malicious

    nodes detected by the BC security mechanism. The routing

    process is made secure by trusted cryptographic algorithms

    such as ECDSA224 and SHA512. While transmitting the

    message to the sink, the node seeks the ‘ownership’ of

    the path’s nodes transferred back after successfully sending

    the message. However, the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages. Complex calculations are involved in

    finding routes that increase the computational overhead and

    network cost.

    In [153], the authors propose a BC-assisted secure routing

    algorithm for a network based on 5G new radio for the

    swarm Unmanned Aircraft System(UAS) to prevent the

    disruptive attacks committed on UAS networking. The BC

    performs two main functions -Selecting the secure next

    hop for transmission of a packet from one to another

    and the authentication and verification of UASs. The BC

    distributed updated block digests to the whole swarm after

    a UAS is authenticated. The BC used is LW, which is

    different from the conventional BC distribution. Instead of

    using conventional mechanisms, the traffic status of UASs

    is leveraged to achieve a consensus known as Proof of

    Traffic(PoT). The neighborhood of UAS is decided based

    on the destination and record of the digest in BC, and each

    UAS in the swarm delivers packets to its neighbors with

    beamforming. The block digest records are checked so that

    the unauthenticated UAS are not chosen as hops. The attack-

    ers need the specific BC digest to launch an attack, which is

    computationally very expensive. PoT employs the passive

    broadcast for block synchronization, unlike conventional

    algorithms, which reduces the system’s overheads suitable

    for LW environments. However, the model assumes that the

    hackers cannot compromise a UAS in joining the swarm

    UAS networking. The untrusted UAS cannot recuperate

    the signal with side lopes leakage of beamforming without

    directional transmission.

    In [154], the authors propose a malware detection technique

    in IoT devices using Deep Learning (DL)and BCT, where

    SCs detect malicious applications. SC guides users’ and

    end-developers’ interactions, stores information about new

    apks, and enables tracking of malicious apps on the net-

    work. The malware features are shared and trained on DL

    models in android IoT devices. After the user uploads an

    app to the network, it is stored in an IPFS where the DL

    models extract features. The hash values obtained from the

    training models are stored in an immutable fashion on a BC

    network to prevent decompilation and repacking attacks by

    reverse engineering methods. When a user downloads a new

    app, the user sends the hash to the network for verification,

    where an SC decides whether the app is malicious or not.

    The model has been evaluated on 18,850 android appli-

    cations and 10,000 malware android packages and shows

    considerable efficiency. However, the analysis of bandwidth

    consumption by the IPFS based storage is not given, which

    is important, especially in the case of metered connections

    In [155], the authors propose a BC-based framework for

    detecting malware in mobile applications before down-

    loading. The model relies on dynamic and static analysis

    for detecting malware. The model uses two external and

    internal BCs. The internal private BC(IPB) contains feature

    extractors(FEs) to extend the dedicated internal private

    BC(DIPB). FE extracts information during the lifetime of an

    app. These features can be static, extracted from the file, or

    dynamic and extracted by monitoring the run time behavior.

    Each FE component is connected to a DIBP that tracks

    each app using the behavioral information. A dedicated

    external private BC(DECB) for each application contains

    scanning information of application versions. A determinant

    agent(DE) is part of the BC and based on the data in the

    BC, it classifies the app as malicious or not. DEs attach their

    decisions to DEPBs with relevant information. Although

    the dedicated BC for each app reduces the computational

    burden of one BC, it also increases the system’s overall

    complexity.

    In [156], the authors propose a distributed anti-malware

    protection mechanism to support a hybrid signature and

    anomaly-based detection model. When a new file is added,

    the users make a signed hash of the file corresponding

    hash is sent to the BC ledger. The verification is done on

    signature-based detection, and the system process and ports

    are checked for malicious activity. However, the signature-

    based verification suffers from detection evasion if the hash

    of the malicious file is changed. To avoid this, if the hash

    comparison does not match, a notification is sent to the

    users, and the system process and network ports are con-

    tinued to be examined. If any suspicious activity is found,

    the file is blocked from self-executing. The BC is updated

    with the hash of the malware file detected. This can prevent

    DDoS attacks where the malicious app may attempt to gain

    access to IoT devices. However, the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but not for resource-constrained IoT

    devices.

    In [157], the authors propose a three layer parallel dis-

    tributed architecture for storing and sharing IoT data-

    BC layer, Node layer, Distributed storage layer aimed to

    improve the scalabilty of BC-based systems. The data

    generated by IoT devices is encrypted, and the hash value

    of the data is generated and stored in the BC as its unique

    identity. BC is the system’s control layer and is responsible

    for validating transactionsand data access control and also

    provides a platform for SCs to support various applications.

    The raw data is encrypted locally and stored in multiple

    storage nodes across the distributed network using the

    Kademlia method so that the data host has no access to

    the original data. The encryption technique used is AES

    (Advanced encryption standard). The data owner adds a

    digital signature to the data block’s digest, allowing the

    data’s ownership to be authenticated. The efficiency analysis

    reveals that in a network of 2n nodes, retrieving any data

    requires a maximum of n steps.

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    In [158], the authors propose a BC-based solution for the

    decentralized storage mechanism and secure data transmis-

    sion, in this case, a sensing image, in IoT networks. This

    paper proposes using an encryption algorithm for secure

    data transfer and an intelligent verification algorithm for

    data storage and signature verification. A blocking algo-

    rithm is employed for sensing an image, and an intelligent

    sensor divides the image using image sensing and block

    data partitioning. A public key generation algorithm is

    leveraged, and the smart image sensor securely transmits

    the key information to BC. The sensor signs the data

    blocks with different keys at different intervals and transmits

    the message to the server, where a signature verification

    algorithm is employed. If the signature is verified, the data

    block is stored. The theoretical analysis shows that the

    model is resistant to counterfeit, theft, replay, and DoS

    attacks. The BC uses only one public key to authenticate

    different blocks, reducing the cost, but the intelligent sensor

    calculates n+1 keys for n blocks and stores n keys.

    In [159], the authors propose a theoretical prototype of

    BC-based IoT architecture using a design science research

    approach. The approach aims to design a prototype for data

    center decision-making, simplicity, complete digitization,

    tamper resistance, heterogeneity, and authentication of BC

    data. The Raspberry Pi is configured as a client node

    for the Ethereum BC, containing the storage and compu-

    tational configuration layer. The model has three prime

    components- IoT data logger(senses the data), SCs (stores

    data, chain address of the devices, and records events),

    and the monitoring dashboard component(displays data to

    end-users, communicates with the SCs, and behaves as a

    mining node). The system considers Ethereum BC, where

    SCs are executed on a virtual machine to reduce costs. The

    accounts on Ethereum are classified as contract (contain

    balance and contract storage executed via a transaction sent

    to its unique address)and externally owned(refer to external

    agents and contain only balance). The prototype is designed

    for high data availability, parsimony, and modularity in

    IoT ecosystems essential for efficient DM, but the design

    encounters high operational costs and scalability issues.

    In [160], the authors propose a trusted DM scheme for

    sensitive data distribution and storage in EC. The ar-

    chitecture is divided into three layers- Edge device(Fog

    nodes), BC Network(to which data is committed), Edge

    nodes(provides services), and Cloud center layer(complex

    problem solving). BlockTDM is reliant on a multi-step mu-

    tual authentication scheme based on certificates. A modified

    PBFT - broadcast multi-signature-based CM is employed

    where a client commits the message to the endorsing

    pairs (EPs) and the management pair(PM). PM verifies the

    signature, the endorsing pairs simulate, and the result is

    broadcasted to an ordering service peer and delivered to

    the bookkeeper. A multichannel matrix-based architecture

    is considered for data protection for blocks on different

    channels and user-defined data encryption for interchannel

    security. The scheme employs Hyperledger Chaincode as

    an SC connected to the EPs and is invoked to process

    transactions and query over the protected BC data. SCs are

    designed for data of various kinds, such as multimedia and

    documents, to support specific block DM. The model is

    highly secure but has O(n2) communication complexity.

    In [161], the authors propose a BC and Deep reinforcement

    learning(DRL) based scheme for efficient DM to achieve

    high-quality data collection with limited mobile terminal

    (MT) energy resources and sensing range and secure data

    sharing in Industrial IoT. The model proposes collecting the

    data through a DRL approach fed to the BC network. The

    connection of each MT is validated, and data is encrypted

    using keys and digital signatures. BC integration ensures

    data security and reliability when MTs share data and

    prevents the systems from attacks. Multiple Ethereum nodes

    are distributed across a private chain that interacts with the

    SC deployed on the chain. A certification authority is set up

    to maintain the data’s reliability and authenticity to avoid

    fraudulent transactions by MTs. The model is tested on the

    severity of DoS and DDoS attacks, and it is that DDoS

    attacks have a 0.1 % worse impact than DoS attacks. The

    increase in MTs does not impact the network, but both

    the attacks affect the database as the transaction frequency

    increases affecting the data storage.

    1) Critical Analysis of the proposed architectures:

    The evaluation of these studied techniques reveals that

    a tradeoff exists between IoT security and other perfor-

    mance criteria. Most of the proposed frameworks have been

    carefully verified against several security metrics, but the

    cost issues for customers or businesses are not addressed.

    The model in [145] cannot be implemented on commercial

    IoT devices due to close-sourced hardware and software,

    and there are considerable CPU and memory overheads in

    the authentication stage. In the architecture presented in

    [146], the sink node has to store many sequence numbers

    as the network complexity increases. In [151], the frequent

    calculations of trust values lead to substantial computational

    power, bringing overheads to the system. In [152], complex

    calculations are involved in finding routes that increase

    the computational overhead and network cost. In [154],

    the analysis of bandwidth consumption by the IPFS-based

    storage is not given, which is important, especially in the

    case of metered connections. In [155], the dedicated BC

    for each app increases the system’s overall complexity. In

    [160], the model has a communication complexity of O(n2).

    Many architectures have ignored or not completely ad-

    dressed the issues of latency, scalability, energy consump-

    tion, computational power, or the security aspect of privacy

    leakage. Most methods restrict to a certain aspect of IoT

    security while ignoring the computational overheads of

    implementation on a large scale. The architecture of [139] is

    suitable for the low-scale implementation, but the network

    performance is compromised if the network complexity

    increases, creating latency and storage problems. The model

    is resistant to AC message tampering until one-third of

    the network is not compromised. The proposed model in

    [142] is for private networks and cannot be replicated

    on large-scale IoT systems without affecting the network

    performance. The architecture proposed in [144] suffers

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    119

    from latency issues when the number of endorsing and

    validating nodes increases. The design in [159] encounters

    high operational costs and scalability issues.

    The authentication, trustworthiness, and authorization in

    many BC-based architectures are achieved through SCs,

    introducing transactional costs. In [141], ACC consumes

    high execution and transaction energy. In [149], the security

    analysis is provided in-depth, but the cost analysis of

    utilizing Ethereum-based SCs is unaccounted for. Many

    architectures provide security but are not suitable in con-

    strained environments. In [156], the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but cannot be replicated for IoT

    devices.The architectures are not truly decentralized and

    run on some form of central scheme and are prone to

    security issues. In [146], the sink node acts as a point of

    failure, and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow

    other malicious nodes to transmit the messages. BC-based

    systems incur high storage costs too. In [161], the increase

    in MTs does not impact the network, but both the attacks

    affect the database as the transaction frequency increases

    affecting the data storage.

    Many architectures rely on assumptions that may not be

    practically true. The architecture presented in [138] runs

    on various assumptions, such as that all the management

    domains have the same number of user equipment, the min-

    ing is done after the propagation procedure ends, the SAMs

    have the same transmissibility to propagate transactions and

    mining time and that there are enough power resources to

    carry out the verifications. The architecture of [148] runs on

    the assumption that base stations are always legitimate and

    that symmetric keys are securely transmitted in the network.

    In [147], the mechanism assumes that fog nodes and admin

    are trusted and that communication between fog devices and

    nodes is secure. In [152], the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages.

    B. Security benefits of BIIT systems :

    Despite the limitations, there are significant benefits of

    BIIT systems. The information created by IoT frameworks

    is broadly significant and confidential, and BCT substan-

    tially increases the security in distributed networks. BIIT

    systems offer the following security merits:

    1)

    Data integrity and confidentiality: The transactions in

    BIIT systems are verified through a CM, and all the

    nodes have an identical copy of the ledger. The data

    and transactions are highly encrypted by leveraging

    cryptographic mechanisms intrinsic to the BC.

    2)

    Data provenance: BIIT systems offer traceability by

    keeping a historical record of the timestamp in the

    BC.

    3)

    Fault tolerance: In BIIT systems, the data is dis-

    tributed across multiple devices, and a single node

    failure does not disrupt the system’s functionality.

    This eliminates a single point of failure and makes

    the BIIT systems more robust than centralized IoT

    systems.

    4)

    Secure communication and resistance to attacks: CM

    prevents the malicious nodes from corrupting the

    system. Launching an attack requires leveraging high

    computational resources.

    5)

    Trust management: BCs bring trust in the commu-

    nicating nodes and, through SCs, provide rules that

    guide a user’s authorization. SCs invoke clauses in

    the event of mistrust and penalizes the user for the

    breach.

    6)

    Access control: BIIT systems provide uniform access

    across multiple IoT systems. In BIIT systems, the

    IoT device is coupled with a unique identifier, and

    efficient KM and AC mechanisms for interoperability

    are available.

    7)

    Removing third-party risks: BCs decentralize the

    structure authority and provide secure DM with a

    decentralized architecture. Thus, the data is not under

    the control of a private organization but distributed

    across a plurality of nodes.

    BIIT systems offer higher security than centralized IoT

    architectures. A comparison is given in Table V.

    9. Challenges, Open Issues, and Research Directions:

    BCT is emerging as a key paradigm for establishing

    trust, imparting security, auditing capability, and verifia-

    bility in systems. BIIT systems are secure but require a

    scalable architecture with sufficient throughput and low

    latency. IoT systems are constrained, and designing less

    intensive security measures for low-powered devices with

    low storage, computational, and network overheads are in

    progress. The constrained nature of IoT and other factors

    hinders the deployment of BIIT systems, briefly discussed

    below:

    1)

    Cost of IoT storage through SCs: In Ethereum SCs,

    the amount of computational work required to com-

    plete an operation in a transaction is measured in

    Gas units. The currency to pay for Gas units is Ether/

    gwei (1 gwei= 10-9 ethers). There is no fixed price

    set for the gas, and the sender enforces a gas limit

    in the transaction and specifies the gas cost. Miners

    mine the blocks which specify high gas prices. The

    price of Ethereum has risen from a single-digit USD

    value in 2015 to touching 2500 USD in 2021 [162].

    Suppose a transaction requires 100 million gas units

    with 1 gas unit set at 25 gwei; the corresponding

    price in dollars to complete the transaction would

    be 108x25x 10-9x2500=6250 USD. With more de-

    vices in the network, data storage complexity also

    increases. BCs store an immutable, permanent record

    of data, and with the increase in the nodes, the

    size of the chain also increases, which causes stor-

    age/memory concerns. Although BC eliminates the

    management costs in a system, it is considerably

    expensive to store data in a BC. Ethereum costs

    76000 USD per GB, which is very expensive for

    120

    IoT applications. The research is moving towards

    cost analysis and solutions for IoT storage through

    BC SCs. In [163], the authors investigate the storage

    costs of numeric data on BC through SCs. The data

    storage is conducted using two strategies. In scenario

    1, the data is stored in an array, and in Scenario

    2, the data is encoded into one variable using two

    methods- Encoding within SC and encoding outside

    SC. The experimental results show that encoding the

    data outside SC into one variable is cost-efficient

    compared to storing data in an array or encoding it

    into a variable within SC.

    2)

    Power consumption: IoT devices applyenergy-saving

    strategies such as “Sleep and Wake up” scheduling

    to increase the network lifetime. However, due to

    BC’s unique way of storing and continuous data

    processing, the energy consumed by such a system is

    considerably higher than conventional systems. The

    authors in [164] estimate the energy consumption of

    various cryptocurrencies. The processing power is

    measured in hash rates. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 and

    has a rated power network of 4291,366 KWwhich an

    IoT node cannot support. Mining is computationally

    expensive, which necessitates specialized machinery

    and massive quantities of electricity.It is challenging

    to run BC as a full node on IoT devices. Recent solu-

    tions suggest using edge computing to enable mobile

    devices to offload the mining work to the cloud.

    Edge computing can be incorporated to help mobile

    devices offload mining work to cloud resources.

    The authors in [165] propose a 4-layer BC-based

    framework for IoT where the devices and servers

    participate in BC via p2p communication. The end

    devices handle simple operations while more pow-

    erful servers support the complex operations in the

    top tiers at the edge/cloud.

    3)

    Network model in BC systems: The expansion of

    the BIIT system creates new requesting blocks. The

    requesting block and the state data must lead to

    a consistent system state, and the newer clients

    synchronize with the existing state. The majority

    of the BC-based traffic models are p2p. The au-

    thors of [55] categorize it into three types- Gos-

    sip Protocol, Kademlia Algorithm, and DAG. The

    gossip-based BCs offer relatively less latency and

    energy consumption but achieve data integrity at

    the cost of large message overheads [166]. The

    Kademlia algorithm works with lesser communica-

    tion overhead, and the resource location in DAG is

    guaranteed. Ethereum also employs p2p networking

    with no trusted intermediary. The nodes themselves

    act as the service and the service providers to en-

    sure data synchronization [167]. Ethereum follows

    a discovery protocol that allows the nodes to find

    each other. BlIT systems must satisfy consistency

    in an asynchronous network with reduced latency

    and increased security. The security of consensus

    depends on the underlying network. Studying the

    network extensively to determine what affects the

    performance of a p2p network is an important issue.

    In [168], the authors study the network structure

    of Ethereum by running a customized version of

    Ethereum’s Go client, GETH, for seven months.

    4)

    BC Security and Privacy vulnerabilities: BC-based

    systems provide high security to systems by making

    data tamper-proof. However, BC itself exhibits secu-

    rity vulnerabilities. The adversity tolerance is further

    reduced with modifications in CMs for LW environ-

    ments. Common security threats to BC include Pro-

    tocol attacks, Ellipse attacks, the chance of double-

    spending, Consensus protocol attacks, SC Vulner-

    abilities, Programming frauds, Private Key Leak-

    age, DDoS attacks, and other security issues[169],

    [170]. Employment of communication security pro-

    tocols such as Datagram transport layer security

    is resource-intensive and not suitable. Further, all

    transactions in the BC are transparent. By analyz-

    ing the patterns of transactions from a user, the

    anonymity of a user can be compromised and lead to

    potential front-running. For private communications,

    protocols such as Telehash or Whisper can be inte-

    grated. Privacy leakage can be countered through pri-

    vacy protection mechanisms such as Zero-knowledge

    proof, Attribute-based Encryption [171]. However,

    these cryptographic algorithms are highly resource-

    intensive and unaffordable in LW environments.

    5)

    SC Vulnerabilities: A fault in the SC could be caused

    by a simple typing error, a misinterpretation of the

    specification, or a more severe programming error.

    BC is irreversible, and a minor glitch has many

    ramifications for SC security and functionality. For

    example, the quantity of gas that the transactions

    contained in the block can utilize is limited to

    prevent the chains from growing beyond a point. If

    data is stored in variable-sized arrays and accessed

    through loops, the gas can get exhausted before

    committing a transaction. Miners are compensated,

    but the transaction is reversed. As a result, testing

    mechanisms for SCs is a critical problem. The test

    mechanism must inspect the SC on enough data

    for all malicious and non-malicious inputs before

    deployment to detect anomalies. Furthermore, be-

    cause IoT systems are distributed across multiple

    locations, retrieving data from various sources can

    cause the SCs to become overburdened. It’s difficult

    to fine-tune SCs for IoT LW applications. SCs are

    associated with a variety of other challenges. The

    legal enforcement of SCs, for example, is currently

    restricted. Dual integration of SCs with real-world le-

    gal contracts is one solution that has been proposed.

    6)

    IoT specific Consensus: The abilities of the existing

    CMs are limited when applied to IoT and have not

    been tested thoroughly. Conventional CMs, such as

    PoW, is resource-intensive and cannot run on IoT

    devices. Even a powerful IoT node such as Rasp-

    berry pi3 can only achieve 104 hashes per second,

    122

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    while a Bitcoin network can conduct around 1019

    hashes per second. Integration of full BC nodes in

    IoT is in the nascent stage. Malicious attacks on

    lightweight CMs with low adversity tolerance can

    prevent valid transactions. A potential solution is

    to limit the consensus to the edge / decentralized

    cloud, while IoT nodes save only the hash values,

    but this increases the storage overheads on the edge.

    Furthermore, the interoperability and authentication

    standards for edge devices are limited.

    7)

    Throughput, Latency, Scalability, and Network com-

    plexity:BC systems do not scale well if the network

    size increases massively. The network efficiency re-

    duces as the network scales up and more authen-

    tication requests are handled, leading to network

    congestion. The growth of the chain further leads

    to bandwidth problems. The mobility of IoT devices

    also affects BC performance. BCs are inherently

    latency tolerant, and the mining time is induced to

    secure the networks further, which is unacceptable

    in real-time IoT systems such as IoV. A poten-

    tial solution is to integrate IPFS, AI, and ML to

    complement the BC. Off-Chain solutions can be

    integrated to increase the transaction throughput.

    IoT big data is posing challenges in real-time data

    delivery. Integration of ML in BIIT systems for IoT

    Big data analytics is hindered by storage, latency,

    scalability, and other challenges. Further investiga-

    tion is required to analyze the overheads introduced

    in BC-IPFS integration. Normalization and compres-

    sion techniques explicitly designed for BIIT systems

    where BC power is leveraged are required.

    8)

    Compatibility and Adoption: BC is an emerging

    technology and lacks standardization laws. Access

    control legislation is an issue in public BCs. IoT data

    is heterogeneous, and the diversity of IoT devices

    implies the need for different network protocols. Pro-

    tocol conversions to enable smooth communication

    are especially costly in BIIT systems. The large-

    scale adoption of BIIT applications needs significant

    infrastructural changes. A generic BC-IoT architec-

    ture is needed to bridge the gap between IoT service

    providers and BC. IoT service providers must modify

    the underlying naming and discovery schemes to

    comply with the BC mechanism. Laws and regula-

    tions concerning information security govern the IoT

    domain, and many countries have strict legislative

    rules regarding cryptocurrencies.

    A. Research Directions

    We present the following research directions based on

    our thorough study of the domain.

    1)

    1. Cost reduction strategies: The rising cost of

    Ethereum is impeding the use of BC in IoT. More

    research into strategies to lower the cost of BC

    adoption in IoT is needed. Given IoT Big data’s con-

    cerns, more efficient data representations that allow

    low-cost SC operations require further investigation

    to make large-scale IoT-BC systems commercially

    viable.

    2)

    IoT-BC Traffic Models: Performing large-scale data

    collection and traffic analysis of growing-BC chains

    is an understudied topic due to large-scale simulation

    and time requirements. The security of the consensus

    protocols is based on the assumption of efficient

    p2p overlay network operations. More research is

    needed to understand the parameters that influence

    the properties of p2p networks.

    3)

    Testing Mechanisms for SCs: The voids in the

    SCs can expose BC security. SCs are vulnerable to

    mining pool attacks because they are open source

    to all parties involved. Once deployed, the SC is

    irreversible and cannot be repaired in the event of

    a virus or a hacking attack. Thus, validating and

    devising unerring testing mechanisms for SCs and

    running them on sufficient data is an important

    research direction.

    4)

    At the Edge Consensus: IoT devices have limited

    computational and networking capabilities; thus, run-

    ning BC as a full node is difficult. It is critical

    to protect IoT suitable CMs from attackers from

    gaining control of the majority of hash power. De-

    signing IoT suitable mechanisms with good adversity

    tolerance and low latency is an open issue and a

    strong research direction.

    5)

    Integration with computing platforms:Due to the

    constrained nature of IoT devices, Fog /Cloud

    servers are added at top tiers, storing the entire BC

    information for transaction validation. It is necessary

    to enable IoT devices to push transactions to the

    BC without centralized block endorsement groups.

    Designing architectures for such integration without

    compromising the security and privacy concerns is a

    strong research direction.

    6)

    Network Configuration: There is no standard archi-

    tecture for BIIT systems. Integration of the cloud

    and the edge at a higher level is critical. Config-

    uring BCs at the node, edge, and cloud levels and

    load balancing and network congestion control for

    addressing increased validation requests are open

    research issues.

    7)

    Convergence of BC and ML: BC-based systems

    can benefit from the addition of MLalgorithms. SCs

    can be used to create a reward-based mechanism

    for training ML models. The potential of ML-BC

    integration has yet to be fully realized, but it is a

    promising future direction.

    8)

    Convergence of BC and IPFS: With IPFS, BC only

    saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down the

    chain development drastically. Through SCs, BC can

    allow access-controlled file sharing and secure stor-

    age of cryptographic hashes of IPFS. It is crucial to

    analyze the latency introduced in the IPFS primarily

    due to the contact with BC and the consequences on

    LW operations.

    9)

    Securing BC and Transactional privacy: Pattern anal-

    ysis of transparent transactions exposes users’ pri-

    vacy. More research is needed to protect BC-based

    AC systems from security threats. Thus, a potential

    research direction is developing LW cryptographic

    algorithms for BCs to protect transactional and user

    privacy in BC-based IoT systems.

    10. Conclusion

    The disruptive attacks on IoT networks are predicted to

    be more severe in the future due to the advanced capability

    of B5G and 6G networks. The unique properties of BCT

    for enabling a p2p network with no centralized stakeholder

    controlling the system enable it to be a perfect security

    solution. BCs, through SCs, provide fine-grained AC by

    providing global functions of authentication, authorization,

    and KM, besides providing a distributed architecture for

    secure storage of hashes, verification rules, sensor data, and

    other information. However, IoT devices are constrained

    and require an LW implementation of CMs to bear the

    computational, storage, power, and network overheads. This

    paper presents a comprehensive comparison of BC solutions

    for IoT systems and concludes that BC can provide efficient

    KM and AC, node authentication, routing security, and se-

    curely store the domain-specific information. A detailed sur-

    vey of recent research on security enhancement, consensus,

    applications, integration with ML, and computing platforms

    is presented. We discuss IPFS, ML, and EC can facilitate

    BC as a crucial enabling technology for IoT. Through IPFS-

    enabled BCs, the growth of the chain is restricted by only

    storing hashes on the BC, and the AC list is maintained

    by SCs, enforced by the updated IPFS software. MEC is

    being considered to be a potential approach for achieving

    consensus for mobile users, facilitating BC applications in

    future mobile IoT systems.

    The convergence of BC and ML for IoT can enable ac-

    curate data analytics. 6G systems are expected to create

    a massive convergence of IoT, AI, EC, Quantum ML,

    and BCT for fast and secure systems that can support

    a plethora of devices. IoT systems are rapidly evolving,

    and as the number of network nodes grows, the tradeoffs

    between energy consumption, security, latency, throughput,

    and scalability become more complex. We conclude that

    BC and IoT technology have evolved separately and for

    futuristic IoT systems to reach their full potential, exten-

    sive research is needed in two domains- a) Blockchain as

    enabling technology in IoT and b)Enabling technologies

    for BC-based IoT. Challenges such as the rising cost of

    Ethereum, power consumption of IoT nodes, SC security,

    and legislation issues are hindering the large-scale adoption

    of BC-based IoT. Extensive research is needed on the

    parameters affecting the network properties, cost reduction

    strategies, encoding, traffic modeling, off-chain solutions,

    network configuration, transactional privacy, SC testing, and

    BC security, especially in LW environments.

  title: Securing the Internet of Things Through Blockchain Approach:Security Architectures,
    Consensus Algorithms, Enabling Technologies, Open Issues, and Research Directions
  verbatim_quote1: Authorization and authentication are critical concerns in Internet
    of Things (IoT) networks. With the increasing number of connected devices, the
    traditional centralized access control mechanisms are becoming increasingly inefficient
    and vulnerable. Blockchain, a decentralized and secure technology, has emerged
    as a promising solution to address these challenges. In this paper, we propose
    a blockchain-based authentication and authorization mechanism for resource-constrained
    IoT devices. The proposed mechanism utilizes a fog computing network to achieve
    efficient and secure access control. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
    mechanism through simulation experiments and show that it outperforms the existing
    centralized mechanisms in terms of latency, scalability, and security.
  verbatim_quote2: A novel Blockchain-based IoT Data Management (BTD) architecture
    is proposed to ensure data integrity, reliability, and traceability in the loT.
    BTD applies a modified PBFT-broadcast multi-signature-based consensus mechanism
    to ensure the trustworthiness of the data. Furthermore, a multichannel matrix-based
    architecture is designed to protect data privacy and confidentiality for blocks
    on different channels, and a user-defined data encryption scheme is adopted to
    provide interchannel security. This research also presents SC design for various
    types of data, such as multimedia and documents, to support specific block data
    management. The experimental analysis demonstrates that BTD effectively enhances
    the accuracy and efficiency of data utilization.
